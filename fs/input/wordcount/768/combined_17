lionfish nov chapter the second taskcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 you said already worked out that egg clue said hermione indignantly 
 
 keep your voice down said harry crossly i just need to sort of it all right 
 
 he ron and hermione were sitting at the very back of the charms class with a table to themselves they were supposed to be practicing the opposite of the summoning charm today the banishing charm owing to the potential for nasty accidents when objects kept flying across the room professor flitwick had given each student a stack of cushions on which to practice the theory being that these hurt anyone if they went off target it was a good theory but it working very well aim was so poor that he kept accidentally sending much heavier things flying across the room professor flitwick for instance 
 
 just forget the egg for a minute all right harry hissed as professor flitwick went whizzing resignedly past them landing on top of a large cabinet trying to tell you about snape and moody 
 
 this class was an ideal cover for a private conversation as everyone was having far too much fun to pay them any attention harry had been recounting his adventures of the previous night in whispered installments for the last half hour 
 
 snape said searched his office as well ron whispered his eyes alight with interest as he banished a cushion with a sweep of his wand it soared into the air and knocked hat off reckon here to keep an eye on snape as well as karkaroff 
 
 well i dunno if what dumbledore asked him to do but definitely doing it said harry waving his wand without paying much attention so that his cushion did an odd sort of belly flop off the desk moody said dumbledore only lets snape stay here because giving him a second chance or something 
 
 what said ron his eyes widening his next cushion spinning high into the air ricocheting off the chandelier and dropping heavily onto desk harrymaybe moody thinks snape put your name in the goblet of fire 
 
 oh ron said hermione shaking her head sceptically we thought snape was trying to kill harry before and it turned out he was saving life remember 
 
 she banished a cushion and it flew across the room and landed in the box they were all supposed to be aiming at harry looked at hermione thinkingit was true that snape had saved his life once but the odd thing was snape definitely loathed him just as loathed father when they had been at school together snape loved taking points from harry and had certainly never missed an opportunity to give him punishments or even to suggest that he should be suspended from the school 
 
 i care what moody says hermione went on not stupid he was right to trust hagrid and professor lupin even though loads of people have given them jobs so why he be right about snape even if snape is a bit 
 
 evil said ron promptly come on hermione why are all these dark wizard catchers searching his office then 
 
 why has mr crouch been pretending to be ill said hermione ignoring ron its a bit funny it that he cant manage to come to the yule ball but he can get up here in the middle of the night when he wants to 
 
 you just like crouch because of that elf winky said ron sending a cushion soaring into the window 
 
 you just want to think up to something said hermione sending her cushion zooming neatly into the box 
 
 i just want to know what snape did with his first chance if on his second one said harry grimly and his cushion to his very great surprise flew straight across the room and landed neatly on top of 
 
 
 
 obedient to wish of hearing about anything odd at hogwarts harry sent him a letter by brown owl that night explaining all about mr crouch breaking into office and moody and conversation then harry turned his attention in earnest to the most urgent problem facing him how to survive underwater for an hour on the of february 
 
 ron quite liked the idea of using the summoning charm again harry had explained about and ron see why harry summon one from the nearest muggle town hermione squashed this plan by pointing out that in the unlikely event that harry managed to learn how to operate an within the set limit of an hour he was sure to be disqualified for breaking the international code of wizarding secrecy it was too much to hope that no muggles would spot an zooming across the countryside to hogwarts 
 
 of course the ideal solution would be for you to transfigure yourself into a submarine or something hermione said if only done human transfiguration already but i think we start that until sixth year and it can go badly wrong if you know what doing 
 
 yeah i fancy walking around with a periscope sticking out of my head said harry i i could always attack someone in front of moody he might do it for me 
 
 i think let you choose what you wanted to be turned into though said hermione seriously no i think your best chance is some sort of charm 
 
 so harry thinking that he would soon have had enough of the library to last him a lifetime buried himself once more among the dusty volumes looking for any spell that might enable a human to survive without oxygen however though he ron and hermione searched through their lunchtimes evenings and whole weekends though harry asked professor mcgonagall for a note of permission to use the restricted section and even asked the irritable librarian madam pince for help they found nothing whatsoever that would enable harry to spend an hour underwater and live to tell the tale 
 
 familiar flutterings of panic were starting to disturb harry now and he was finding it difficult to concentrate in class again the lake which harry had always taken for granted as just another feature of the grounds drew his eyes whenever he was near a classroom window a great mass of chilly water whose dark and icy depths were starting to seem as distant as the moon 
 
 just as it had before he faced the horntail time was slipping away as though somebody had bewitched the clocks to go there was a week to go before february the there was still were five days to go he was bound to find something days to go please let me find somethingplease 
 
 with two days left harry started to go off food again the only good thing about breakfast on monday was the return of the brown owl he had sent to sirius he pulled off the parchment unrolled it and saw the shortest letter sirius had ever written to him 
 
 send date of next hogsmeade weekend by return owl 
 harry turned the parchment over and looked at the back hoping to see something else but it was blank 
 
 weekend after next whispered hermione who had read the note over shoulder here take my quill and send this owl back straight away 
 
 harry scribbled the dates down on the back of letter tied it onto the brown leg and watched it take flight again what had he expected advice on how to survive underwater he had been so intent on telling sirius all about snape and moody he had completely forgotten to mention the clue 
 
 he want to know about the next hogsmeade weekend for said ron 
 
 dunno said harry dully the momentary happiness that had flared inside him at the sight of the owl had died come oncare of magical creatures 
 
 whether hagrid was trying to make up for the skrewts or because there were now only two skrewts left or because he was trying to prove he could do anything that professor could harry didnt know but hagrid had been continuing her lessons on unicorns ever since returned to work it turned out that hagrid knew quite as much about unicorns as he did about monsters though it was clear that he found their lack of poisonous fangs disappointing 
 
 today he had managed to capture two unicorn foals unlike unicorns they were pure gold parvati and lavender went into transports of delight at the sight of them and even pansy parkinson had to work hard to conceal how much she liked them 
 
 easier ter spot than the adults hagrid told the class they turn silver when abou two years old an they grow horns at aroun four don go pure white till full grown round about seven a bit more trustin when babiesdon mind boys so move in a bit yeh can pat em if yeh wantgive em a few o these sugar lumps 
 
 you okay harry hagrid muttered moving aside slightly while most of the others swarmed around the baby unicorns 
 
 yeah said harry jus nervous eh said hagrid 
 
 bit said harry 
 
 harry said hagrid clapping a massive hand on his shoulder so that knees buckled under its weight bin worried before i saw yeh take on tha horntail but i know now yeh can do anythin yeh set yer mind ter not worried at all goin ter be fine got yer clue worked out haven yeh 
 
 harry nodded but even as he did so an insane urge to confess that he have any idea how to survive at the bottom of the lake for an hour came over him he looked up at hagrid perhaps he had to go into the lake sometimes to deal with the creatures in it he looked after everything else on the grounds after all 
 
 goin ter win hagrid growled patting shoulder again so that harry actually felt himself sink a couple of inches into the soft ground i know it i can feel it goin ter win harry 
 
 harry just bring himself to wipe the happy confident smile off face pretending he was interested in the young unicorns he forced a smile in return and moved forward to pat them with the others 
 
 
 
 by the evening before the second task harry felt as though he were trapped in a nightmare he was fully aware that even if by some miracle he managed to find a suitable spell have a real job mastering it overnight how could he have let this happen why he got to work on the clue sooner why had he ever let his mind wander in class what if a teacher had once mentioned how to breathe underwater 
 
 he sat with hermione and ron in the library as the sun set outside tearing feverishly through page after page of spells hidden from one another by the massive piles of books on the desk in front of each of them heart gave a huge leap every time he saw the word water on a page but more often than not it was merely take two pints of water half a pound of shredded mandrake leaves and a newt 
 
 i reckon it can be done said voice flatly from the other side of the table nothing nothing closest was that thing to dry up puddles and ponds that drought charm but that was nowhere near powerful enough to drain the lake 
 
 there must be something hermione muttered moving a candle closer to her her eyes were so tired she was poring over the tiny print of olde and forgotten bewitchments and charmes with her nose about an inch from the page never have set a task that was undoable 
 
 they have said ron harry just go down to the lake tomorrow right stick your head in yell at the merpeople to give back whatever nicked and see if they chuck it out best you can do mate 
 
 a way of doing it hermione said crossly there just has to be 
 
 she seemed to be taking the lack of useful information on the subject as a personal insult it had never failed her before 
 
 i know what i should have done said harry resting on saucy tricks for tricky sorts i learned to be an animagus like sirius 
 
 an animagus was a wizard who could transform into an animal 
 
 yeah you turned into a goldfish any time you wanted said ron 
 
 or a frog yawned harry he was exhausted it takes years to become an animagus and then you have to register yourself and everything said hermione vaguely now squinting down the index of weird wizarding dilemmas and their solutions professor mcgonagall told us got to register yourself with the improper use of magic officewhat animal you become and your markings so you abuse it 
 
 hermione i was joking said harry wearily i know i got a chance of turning into a frog by tomorrow morning 
 
 oh this is no use hermione said snapping shut weird wizarding dilemmas who on earth wants to make their nose hair grow into ringlets 
 
 i mind said fred voice be a talking point it 
 
 harry ron and hermione looked up fred and george had just emerged from behind some bookshelves 
 
 you two doing here ron asked 
 
 looking for you said george mcgonagall wants you ron and you hermione 
 
 why said hermione looking surprised 
 
 dunnoshe was looking a bit grim though said fred 
 
 supposed to take you down to her office said george 
 
 ron and hermione stared at harry who felt his stomach drop was professor mcgonagall about to tell ron and hermione off perhaps noticed how much they were helping him when he ought to be working out how to do the task alone 
 
 meet you back in the common room hermione told harry as she got up to go with ron both of them looked very anxious bring as many of these books as you can okay 
 
 right said harry uneasily 
 
 by eight madam pince had extinguished all the lamps and came to chivvy harry out of the library staggering under the weight of as many books as he could carry harry returned to the gryffindor common room pulled a table into a corner and continued to search there was nothing in madcap magic for wacky warlocksnothing in a guide to medieval sorcerynot one mention of underwater exploits in an anthology of charms or in dreadful denizens of the deep or powers you never knew you had and what to do with them now wised up 
 
 crookshanks crawled into lap and curled up purring deeply the common room emptied slowly around harry people kept wishing him luck for the next morning in cheery confident voices like all of them apparently convinced that he was about to pull off another stunning performance like the one he had managed in the first task harry answer them he just nodded feeling as though there were a golfball stuck in his throat by ten to midnight he was alone in the room with crookshanks he had searched all the remaining books and ron and hermione had not come back 
 
 over he told himself you do it just have to go down to the lake in the morning and tell the judges 
 
 he imagined himself explaining that he do the task he pictured look of surprise karkaroffs satisfied smile he could almost hear fleur delacour saying i knew is too young e is only a little boy he saw malfoy flashing his potter stinks badge at the front of the crowd saw crestfallen disbelieving face 
 
 forgetting that crookshanks was on his lap harry stood up very suddenly crookshanks hissed angrily as he landed on the floor gave harry a disgusted look and stalked away with his bottlebrush tail in the air but harry was already hurrying up the spiral staircase to his would grab the invisibility cloak and go back to the library stay there all night if he had to 
 
 lumos harry whispered fifteen minutes later as he opened the library door 
 
 wand tip alight he crept along the bookshelves pulling down more books books of hexes and charms books on merpeople and water monsters books on famous witches and wizards on magical inventions on anything at all that might include one passing reference to underwater survival he carried them over to a table then set to work searching them by the narrow beam of his wand occasionally checking his watch 
 
 one in the morningtwo in the morningthe only way he could keep going was to tell himself over and over again next bookin the next onethe next one 
 
 
 
 the mermaid in the painting in the prefects bathroom was laughing harry was bobbing like a cork in bubbly water next to her rock while she held his firebolt over his head 
 
 come and get it she giggled maliciously come on jump 
 
 i harry panted snatching at the firebolt and struggling not to sink give it to me 
 
 but she just poked him painfully in the side with the end of the broomstick laughing at him 
 
 that hurts get off ouch 
 
 harry potter must wake up sir 
 
 stop poking me 
 
 dobby must poke harry potter sir he must wake up 
 
 harry opened his eyes he was still in the library the invisibility cloak had slipped off his head as slept and the side of his face was stuck to the pages of where a wand a way he sat up straightening his glasses blinking in the bright daylight 
 
 harry potter needs to hurry squeaked dobby the second task starts in ten minutes and harry potter 
 
 ten minutes harry croaked ten ten minutes 
 
 he looked down at his watch dobby was right it was twenty past nine a large dead weight seemed to fall through chest into his stomach 
 
 hurry harry potter squeaked dobby plucking at sleeve you is supposed to be down by the lake with the other champions sir 
 
 too late dobby harry said hopelessly not doing the task i know how 
 
 harry potter will do the task squeaked the elf dobby knew harry had not found the right book so dobby did it for him 
 
 what said harry but you know what the second task is 
 
 dobby knows sir harry potter has to go into the lake and find his wheezy 
 
 find my what 
 
 and take his wheezy back from the merpeople 
 
 a wheezy 
 
 your wheezy sir your who is giving dobby his sweater 
 
 dobby plucked at the shrunken maroon sweater he was now wearing over his shorts 
 
 what harry gasped got ron 
 
 the thing harry potter will miss most sir squeaked dobby but past an hour 
 
 the black harry recited staring at the elf too late gone it come back dobby i got to do 
 
 you has to eat this sir squeaked the elf and he put his hand in the pocket of his shorts and drew out a ball of what looked like slimy rat tails right before you go into the lake sir gillyweed 
 
 it do said harry staring at the gillyweed 
 
 it will make harry potter breathe underwater sir 
 
 dobby said harry frantically listen are you sure about this 
 
 he quite forget that the last time dobby had tried to help him he had ended up with no bones in his right arm 
 
 dobby is quite sure sir said the elf earnestly dobby hears things sir he is a he goes all over the castle as he lights the fires and mops the floors dobby heard professor mcgonagall and professor moody in the staffroom talking about the next cannot let harry potter lose his wheezy 
 
 doubts vanished jumping to his feet he pulled off the invisibility cloak stuffed it into his bag grabbed the gillyweed and put it into his pocket then tore out of the library with dobby at his heels 
 
 dobby is supposed to be in the kitchens sir dobby squealed as they burst into the corridor dobby will be missed good luck harry potter sir good luck 
 
 see you later dobby harry shouted and he sprinted along the corridor and down the stairs three at a time 
 
 the entrance hall contained a few stragglers all leaving the great hall after breakfast and heading through the double oak doors to watch the second task they stared as harry flashed past sending colin and dennis creevey flying as he leapt down the stone steps and out onto the bright chilly grounds 
 
 as he pounded down the lawn he saw that the seats that had encircled the dragons enclosure in november were now ranged along the opposite bank rising in stands that were packed to the bursting point and reflected in the lake below the excited babble of the crowd echoed strangely across the water as harry ran around the other side of the lake toward the judges who were sitting at another table at the edge cedric fleur and krum were beside the judges table watching harry sprint toward them 
 
 harry panted skidding to a halt in the mud and accidentally splattering robes 
 
 where have you been said a bossy disapproving voice the about to start 
 
 harry looked around percy weasley was sitting at the judges table mr crouch had failed to turn up again 
 
 now now percy said ludo bagman who was looking intensely relieved to see harry let him catch his breath 
 
 dumbledore smiled at harry but karkaroff and madame maxime look at all pleased to see was obvious from the looks on their faces that they had thought he going to turn up 
 
 harry bent over hands on his knees gasping for breath he had a stitch in his side that felt as though he had a knife between his ribs but there was no time to get rid of it ludo bagman was now moving among the champions spacing them along the bank at intervals of ten feet harry was on the very end of the line next to krum who was wearing swimming trunks and was holding his wand ready 
 
 all right harry bagman whispered as he moved harry a few feet farther away from krum know what going to do 
 
 yeah harry panted massaging his ribs 
 
 bagman gave shoulder a quick squeeze and returned to the judges table he pointed his wand at his throat as he had done at the world cup said sonorus and his voice boomed out across the dark water toward the stands 
 
 well all our champions are ready for the second task which will start on my whistle they have precisely an hour to recover what has been taken from them on the count of three then onetwothree 
 
 the whistle echoed shrilly in the cold still air the stands erupted with cheers and applause without looking to see what the other champions were doing harry pulled off his shoes and socks pulled the handful of gillyweed out of his pocket stuffed it into his mouth and waded out into the lake 
 
 it was so cold he felt the skin on his legs searing as though this were fire not icy water his sodden robes weighed him down as he walked in deeper now the water was over his knees and his rapidly numbing feet were slipping over silt and flat slimy stones he was chewing the gillyweed as hard and fast as he could it felt unpleasantly slimy and rubbery like octopus tentacles in the freezing water he stopped swallowed and waited for something to happen 
 
 he could hear laughter in the crowd and knew he must look stupid walking into the lake without showing any sign of magical power the part of him that was still dry was covered in goose pimples half immersed in the icy water a cruel breeze lifting his hair harry started to shiver violently he avoided looking at the stands the laughter was becoming louder and there were catcalls and jeering from the slytherins 
 
 then quite suddenly harry felt as though an invisible pillow had been pressed over his mouth and nose he tried to draw breath but it made his head spin his lungs were empty and he suddenly felt a piercing pain on either side of his neck 
 
 harry clapped his hands around his throat and felt two large slits just below his ears flapping in the cold had gills without pausing to think he did the only thing that made sense he flung himself forward into the water 
 
 the first gulp of icy lake water felt like the breath of life his head had stopped spinning he took another great gulp of water and felt it pass smoothly through his gills sending oxygen back to his brain he stretched out his hands in front of him and stared at them they looked green and ghostly under the water and they had become webbed he twisted around and looked at his bare feet they had become elongated and the toes were webbed too it looked as though he had sprouted flippers 
 
 the water feel icy anymore eitheron the contrary he felt pleasantly cool and very struck out once more marveling at how far and fast his feet propelled him through the vater and noticing how clearly he could see and how he no longer seemed to need to blink he had soon swum so far into the lake that he could no longer see the bottom he flipped over and dived into its depths 
 
 silence pressed upon his ears as he soared over a strange dark foggy landscape he could only see ten feet around him so that as he sped throuugh the water new scenes seemed to loom suddenly out of the incoming darkness forests of rippling tangled black weed wide plains of mud littered with dull glimmering stones he swam deeper and deeper out toward the middle of the lake his eyes wide staring through the eerily water around him to the shadow beyond where the water became opaque 
 
 small fish flickered past him like silver darts once or twice he thought he saw something larger moving ahead of him but when he got nearer he discovered it to be nothing but a large blackened log or a dense clump of weed there was no sign of any of the other champions merpeople ron nor thankfully the giant squid 
 
 light green weed stretched ahead of him as far as he could see two feet deep like a meadow of very overgrown grass harry was staring unblinkingly ahead of him trying to discern shapes through the gloomand then without warning something grabbed hold of his ankle 
 
 harry twisted his body around and saw a grindylow a small horned water demon poking out of the weed its long fingers clutched tightly around leg its pointed fangs bared harry stuck his webbed hand quickly inside his robes and fumbled for his wand by the time he had grasped it two more grindylows had risen out of the weed had seized handfuls of robes and were attempting to drag him down 
 
 relashio harry shouted except that no sound came large bubble issued from his mouth and his wand instead of sending sparks at the grindylows pelted them with what seemed to be a jet of boiling water for where it struck them angry red patches appeared on their green skin harry pulled his ankle out of the grindylows grip and swam as fast as he could occasionally sending more jets of hot water over his shoulder at random every now and then he felt one of the grindylows snatch at his foot again and he kicked out hard finally he felt his foot connect with a horned skull and looking back saw the dazed grindylow floating away while its fellows shook their fists at harry and sank back into the weed 
 
 harry slowed down a little slipped his wand back inside his robes and looked around listening again he turned full circle in the water the silence pressing harder than ever against his eardrums he knew he must be even deeper in the lake now but nothing was moving but the rippling weed 
 
 how are you getting on 
 
 harry thought he was having a heart attack he whipped around and saw moaning myrtle floating hazily in front of him gazing at him through her thick pearly glasses 
 
 myrtle harry tried to shout but once again nothing came out of his mouth but a very large bubble moaning myrtle actually giggled 
 
 you want to try over there she said pointing i come with like them much they always chase me when i get too close 
 
 harry gave her the to show his thanks and set off once more careful to swim a bit higher over the weed to avoid any more grindylows that might be lurking there 
 
 he swam on for what felt like at least twenty minutes he was passing over vast expanses of black mud now which swirled murkily as he disturbed the water then at long last he heard a snatch of haunting mersong 
 
 an hour long have to look 
 and to recover what we took 
 harry swam faster and soon saw a large rock emerge out of the muddy water ahead it had paintings of merpeople on it they were carrying spears and chasing what looked like the giant squid harry swam on past the rock following the mersong 
 
 your half gone so tarry not 
 lest what you seek stays here to rot 
 a cluster of crude stone dwellings stained with algae loomed suddenly out of the gloom on all sides here and there at the dark windows harry saw facesfaces that bore no resemblance at all to the painting of the mermaid in the prefects bathroom 
 
 the merpeople had grayish skin and long wild dark green hair their eyes were yellow as were their broken teeth and they wore thick ropes of pebbles around their necks they leered at harry as he swam past one or two of them emerged from their caves to watch him better their powerful silver fish tails beating the water spears clutched in their hands 
 
 harry sped on staring around and soon the dwellings became more numerous there were gardens of weed around some of them and he even saw a pet grindylow tied to a stake outside one door merpeople were emerging on all sides now watching him eagerly pointing at his webbed hands and gills talking behind their hands to one another harry sped around a corner and a very strange sight met his eyes 
 
 a whole crowd of merpeople was floating in front of the houses that lined what looked like a of a village square a choir of merpeople was singing in the middle calling the champions toward them and behind them rose a crude sort of statue a gigantic merperson hewn from a boulder four people were bound tightly to the tail of the stone merperson 
 
 ron was tied between hermione and cho chang there was also a girl who looked no older than eight whose clouds of silvery hair made harry feel sure that she was fleur sister all four of them appeared to be in a very deep sleep their heads were lolling onto their shoulders and fine streams of bubbles kept issuing from their mouths 
 
 harry sped toward the hostages half expecting the merpeople to lower their spears and charge at him but they did nothing the ropes of weed tying the hostages to the statue were thick slimy and very strong for a fleeting second he thought of the knife sirius had bought him for christmas locked in his trunk in the castle a quarter of a mile away no use to him whatsoever 
 
 he looked around many of the merpeople surrounding them were carrying spears he swam swiftly toward a merman with a long green beard and a choker of shark fangs and tried to mime a request to borrow the spear the merman laughed and shook his head 
 
 we do not help he said in a harsh croaky voice 
 
 come on harry said fiercely but only bubbles issued from his mouth and he tried to pull the spear away from the merman but the merman yanked it back still shaking his head and laughing 
 
 harry swirled around staring about something sharpanything 
 
 there were rocks littering the lake bottom he dived and snatched up a particularly jagged one and returned to the statue he began to hack at the ropes binding ron and after several minutes hard work they broke apart ron floated unconscious a few inches above the lake bottom drifting a little in the ebb of the water 
 
 harry looked around there was no sign of any of the other champions what were they playing at why they hurry up he turned back to hermione raised the jagged rock and began to hack at her bindings too 
 
 at once several pairs of strong gray hands seized him half a dozen mermen were pulling him away from hermione shaking their heads and laughing 
 
 you take your own hostage one of them said to him leave the others 
 
 no way said harry furiously but only two large bubbles came out 
 
 your task is to retrieve your own friendleave the others 
 
 my friend too harry yelled gesturing toward hermione an enormous silver bubble emerging soundlessly from his lips and i want them to die either 
 
 head was on shoulder the small girl was ghostly green and pale harry struggled to fight off the mermen but they laughed harder than ever holding him back harry looked wildly around where were the other champions would he have time to take ron to the surface and come back down for hermione and the others would he be able to find them again he looked down at his watch to see how much time was left it had stopped working 
 
 but then the merpeople around him pointed excitedly over his head harry looked up and saw cedric swimming toward them there was an enormous bubble around his head which made his features look oddly wide and stretched 
 
 got lost he mouthed looking fleur and coming now 
 
 feeling enormously relieved harry watched cedric pull a knife out of his pocket and cut cho free he pulled her upward and out of sight 
 
 harry looked around waiting where were fleur and krum time was getting short and according to the song the hostages would be lost after an hour 
 
 the merpeople started screeching animatedly those holding harry loosened their grip staring behind them harry turned and saw something monstrous cutting through the water toward them a human body in swimming trunks with the head of a was krum he appeared to have transfigured himself but badly 
 
 the swam straight to hermione and began snapping and biting at her ropes the trouble was that new teeth were positioned very awkwardly for biting anything smaller than a dolphin and harry was quite sure that if krum careful he was going to rip hermione in half darting forward harry hit krum hard on the shoulder and held up the jagged stone krum seized it and began to cut hermione free within seconds he had done it he grabbed hermione around the waist and without a backward glance began to rise rapidly with her toward the surface 
 
 now what harry thought desperately if he could be sure that fleur was still no sign there was nothing to be done except 
 
 he snatched up the stone which krum had dropped but the mermen now closed in around ron and the little girl shaking their heads at him harry pulled out his wand 
 
 get out of the way 
 
 only bubbles flew out of his mouth but he had the distinct impression that the mermen had understood him because they suddenly stopped laughing their yellowish eyes were fixed upon wand and they looked scared there might be a lot more of them than there were of him but harry could tell by the looks on their faces that they knew no more magic than the giant squid did 
 
 got until three harry shouted a great stream of bubbles burst from him but he held up three fingers to make sure they got the message one he put down a finger put down a second one 
 
 they scattered harry darted forward and began to hack at the ropes binding the small girl to the statue and at last she was free he seized the little girl around the waist grabbed the neck of robes and kicked off from the bottom 
 
 it was very slow work he could no longer use his webbed hands to propel himself forward he worked his flippers furiously but ron and sister were like sacks dragging him back fixed his eyes skyward though he knew he must still be very deep the water above him was so dark 
 
 merpeople were rising with him he could see them swirling around him with ease watching him struggle through the they pull him back down to the depths when the time was up did they perhaps eat humans legs were seizing up with the effort to keep swimming his shoulders were aching horribly with the effort of dragging ron and the girl 
 
 he was drawing breath with extreme difficulty he could feel pain on the sides of his neck againhe was becoming very aware of how wet the water was in his mouthyet the darkness was definitely thinning nowhe could see daylight above him 
 
 he kicked hard with his flippers and discovered that they were nothing more than feetwater was flooding through his mouth into his lungshe was starting to feel dizzy but he knew light and air were only ten feet above himhe had to get therehe had to 
 
 harry kicked his legs so hard and fast it felt as though his muscles were screaming in protest his very brain felt waterlogged he breathe he needed oxygen he had to keep going he could not stop 
 
 and then he felt his head break the surface of the lake wonderful cold clear air was making his wet face sting he gulped it down feeling as though he had never breathed properly before and panting pulled ron and the little girl up with him all around him wild heads were emerging out of the water with him but they were smiling at him 
 
 the crowd in the stands was making a great deal of noise shouting and screaming they all seemed to be on their feet harry had the impression they thought that ron and the little girl might be dead but they were wrongboth of them had opened their eyes the girl looked scared and confused but ron merely expelled a great spout of water blinked in the bright light turned to harry and said wet this it then he spotted sister what did you bring her for 
 
 fleur turn up i leave her harry panted 
 
 harry you prat said ron you take that song thing seriously did you dumbledore have let any of us drown 
 
 the song said 
 
 it was only to make sure you got back inside the time limit said ron i hope you waste time down there acting the hero 
 
 harry felt both stupid and annoyed it was all very well for ron been asleep he felt how eerie it was down in the lake surrounded by merpeople looked more than capable of murder 
 
 harry said shortly help me with her i think she can swim very well 
 
 they pulled sister through the water back toward the bank where the judges stood watching twenty merpeople accompanying them like a guard of honor singing their horrible screechy songs 
 
 harry could see madam pomfrey fussing over hermione krum cedric and cho all of whom were wrapped in thick blankets 
 
 dumbledore and ludo bagman stood beaming at harry and ron from the bank as they swam nearer but percy who looked very white and somehow much younger than usual came splashing out to meet them meanwhile madame maxime was trying to restrain fleur delacour who was quite hysterical fighting tooth and nail to return to the water 
 
 gabrielle gabrielle is she alive is she urt 
 
 fine harry tried to tell her but he was so exhausted he could hardly talk let alone shout 
 
 percy seized ron and was dragging him back to the bank gerroff percy all right dumbledore and bagman were pulling harry upright fleur had broken free of madame maxime and was hugging her sister 
 
 it was ze grindylowszey attacked meoh gabrielle i thoughti thought 
 
 come here you said madam pomfrey she seized harry and pulled him over to hermione and the others wrapped him so tightly in a blanket that he felt as though he were in a straitjacket and forced a measure of very hot potion down his throat steam gushed out of his ears 
 
 harry well done hermione cried you did it you found out how all by yourself 
 
 well said harry he would have told her about dobby but he had just noticed karkaroff watching him he was the only judge who had not left the table the only judge not showing signs of pleasure and relief that harry ron and sister had got back safely yeah right said harry raising his voice slightly so that karkaroff could hear him 
 
 you haff a water beetle in your hair said krum harry had the impression that krum was drawing her attention back onto himself perhaps to remind her that he had just rescued her from the lake but hermione brushed away the beetle impatiently and said well outside the time limit though it take you ages to find us 
 
 noi found you okay 
 
 feeling of stupidity was growing now he was out of the water it seemed perfectly clear that dumbledores safety precautions have permitted the death of a hostage just because their champion turned up why he just grabbed ron and gone he would have been first and krum wasted time worrying about anyone else they taken the mersong seriously 
 
 dumbledore was crouching at the edge deep in conversation with what seemed to be the chief merperson a particularly wild and female he was making the same sort of screechy noises that the merpeople made when they were above water clearly dumbledore could speak mermish finally he straightened up turned to his fellow judges and said a conference before we give the marks i think 
 
 the judges went into a huddle madam pomfrey had gone to rescue ron from clutches she led him over to harry and the others gave him a blanket and some pepperup potion then went to fetch fleur and her sister fleur had many cuts on her face and arms and her robes were torn but she seem to care nor would she allow madam pomfrey to clean them 
 
 look after gabrielle she told her and then she turned to harry you saved er she said breathlessly even though she was not your ostage 
 
 yeah said harry who was now heartily wishing left all three girls tied to the statue 
 
 fleur bent down kissed harry twice on each cheek he felt his face burn and have been surprised if steam was coming out of his ears again then said to ron and you elped 
 
 yeah said ron looking extremely hopeful yeah a bit 
 
 fleur swooped down on him too and kissed him hermione looked simply furious but just then ludo magically magnified voice boomed out beside them making them all jump and causing the crowd in the stands to go very quiet 
 
 ladies and gentlemen we have reached our decision merchieftainess murcus has told us exactly what happened at the bottom of the lake and we have therefore decided to award marks out of fifty for each of the champions as follows 
 
 fleur delacour though she demonstrated excellent use of the charm was attacked by grindylows as she approached her goal and failed to retrieve her hostage we award her points 
 
 applause from the stands 
 
 i deserved zero said fleur throatily shaking her magnificent head 
 
 cedric diggory who also used the charm was first to return with his hostage though he returned one minute outside the time limit of an hour enormous cheers from the hufflepuffs in the crowd harry saw cho give cedric a glowing look we therefore award him points 
 
 heart sank if cedric had been outside the time limit he most certainly had been 
 
 viktor krum used an incomplete form of transfiguration which was nevertheless effective and was second to return with his hostage we award him forty points 
 
 karkaroff clapped particularly hard looking very superior 
 
 harry potter used gillyweed to great effect bagman continued he returned last and well outside the time limit of an hour however the merchieftainess informs us that mr potter was first to reach the hostages and that the delay in his return was due to his determination to return all hostages to safety not merely his own 
 
 ron and hermione both gave harry looks 
 
 most of the judges and here bagman gave karkaroff a very nasty look feel that this shows moral fiber and merits full marks howevermr score is points 
 
 stomach leapt he was now tying for first place with cedric ron and hermione caught by surprise stared at harry then laughed and started applauding hard with the rest of the crowd 
 
 there you go harry ron shouted over the noise you being thick after all you were showing moral fiber 
 
 fleur was clapping very hard too but krum look happy at all he attempted to engage hermione in conversation again but she was too busy cheering harry to listen 
 
 the third and final task will take place at dusk on the of june continued bagman the champions will be notified of what is coming precisely one month beforehand thank you all for your support of the champions 
 
 it was over harry thought dazedly as madam pomfrey began herding the champions and hostages back to the castle to get into dry clothesit was over he had got throughhe have to worry about anything now until june the 
 
 next time he was in hogsmeade harry decided as he walked back up the stone steps into the castle he was going to buy dobby a pair of socks for every day of the year

lionfish nov chapter seen and unforseencontents prev chapter next chapter 
 luna said vaguely that she did not know how soon interview with harry would appear in the quibbler that her father was expecting a lovely long article on recent sightings of snorkacks and of course be a very important story so might have to wait for the following issue said luna 
 
 harry had not found it an easy experience to talk about the night when voldemort had returned rita had pressed him for every little detail and he had given her everything he could remember knowing that this was his one big opportunity to tell the world the truth he wondered how people would react to the story he guessed that it would confirm a lot of people in the view that he was completely insane not least because his story would be appearing alongside utter rubbish about snorkacks but the breakout of bellatrix lestrange and her fellow death eaters had given harry a burning desire to do something whether or not it worked 
 
 wait to see what umbridge thinks of you going public said dean sounding awestruck at dinner on monday night seamus was shovelling down large amounts of chicken and ham pie on other side but harry knew he was listening 
 
 the right thing to do harry said neville who was sitting opposite him he was rather pale but went on in a low voice it must have been tough talking about it was it 
 
 yeah mumbled harry but people have got to know what capable of they 
 
 right said neville nodding and his death eaters too people should know 
 
 neville left his sentence hanging and returned to his baked potato seamus looked up but when he caught eye he looked quickly back at his plate again after a while dean seamus and neville departed for the common room leaving harry and hermione at the table waiting for ron who had not yet had dinner because of quidditch practice 
 
 cho chang walked into the hall with her friend marietta stomach gave an unpleasant lurch but she did not look over at the gryffindor table and sat down with her back to him 
 
 oh i forgot to ask you said hermione brightly glancing over at the ravenclaw table what happened on your date with cho how come you were back so early 
 
 er well it was said harry pulling a dish of rhubarb crumble towards him and helping himself to seconds a complete fiasco now you mention it 
 
 and he told her what had happened in madam teashop 
 
 so then he finished several minutes later as the final bit of crumble disappeared she jumps up right and says see you around harry and runs out of the place he put down his spoon and looked at hermione i mean what was all that about what was going on 
 
 hermione glanced over at the back of head and sighed 
 
 oh harry she said sadly well sorry but you were a bit tactless 
 
 me tactless said harry outraged one minute we were getting on fine next minute she was telling me that roger davies asked her out and how she used to go and snog cedric in that stupid teashophow was i supposed to feel about that 
 
 well you see said hermione with the patient air of someone explaining that one plus one equals two to an toddler you have told her that you wanted to meet me halfway through your date 
 
 but but spluttered harry butyou told me to meet you at twelve and to bring her along how was i supposed to do that without telling her 
 
 you should have told her differently said hermione still with that maddeningly patient air you should have said it was really annoying but made you promise to come along to the three broomsticks and you really want to go much rather spend the whole day with her but unfortunately you thought you really ought to meet me and would she please please come along with you and hopefully be able to get away more quickly and it might have been a good idea to mention how ugly you think i am too hermione added as an afterthought 
 
 but i think ugly said harry bemused 
 
 hermione laughed 
 
 harry worse than ron well no not she sighed as ron himself came stumping into the hall splattered with mud and looking grumpy lookyou upset cho when you said you were going to meet me so she tried to make you jealous it was her way of trying to find out how much you liked her 
 
 is that what she was doing said harry as ron dropped onto the bench opposite them and pulled every dish within reach towards him well it have been easier if just asked me whether i liked her better than you 
 
 girls often ask questions like that said hermione 
 
 well they should said harry forcefully then i just told her i fancy her and she have had to get herself all worked up again about cedric dying 
 
 not saying what she did was sensible said hermione as ginny joined them just as muddy as ron and looking equally disgruntled just trying to make you see how she was feeling at the time 
 
 you should write a book ron told hermione as he cut up his potatoes translating mad things girls do so boys can understand them 
 
 yeah said harry fervently looking over at the ravenclaw table cho had just got up and still not looking at him she left the great hall feeling rather depressed he looked back at ron and ginny so how was quidditch practice 
 
 it was a nightmare said ron in a surly voice 
 
 oh come on said hermione looking at ginny sure it that 
 
 yes it was said ginny it was appalling angelina was nearly in tears by the end of it 
 
 ron and ginny went off for baths after dinner harry and hermione returned to the busy gryffindor common room and their usual pile of homework harry had been struggling with a new for astronomy for half an hour when fred and george turned up 
 
 ron and ginny not here asked fred looking around as he pulled up a chair and when harry shook his head he said good we were watching their practice going to be slaughtered complete rubbish without us 
 
 come on not bad said george fairly sitting down next to fred actually i dunno how she got so good seeing how we never let her play with us 
 
 been breaking into your broom shed in the garden since the age of six and taking each of your brooms out in turn when you looking said hermione from behind her tottering pile of ancient rune books 
 
 oh said george looking mildly impressed explain it 
 
 has ron saved a goal yet asked hermione peering over the top of magical hieroglyphs and logograms 
 
 well he can do it if he think watching him said fred rolling his eyes so all we have to do is ask the crowd to turn their backs and talk among themselves every time the quaffle goes up his end on saturday 
 
 he got up again and moved restlessly to the window staring out across the dark grounds 
 
 you know quidditch was about the only thing in this place worth staying for 
 
 hermione cast him a stern look 
 
 got exams coming 
 
 told you already not fussed about newts said fred the snackboxes are ready to roll we found out how to get rid of those boils just a couple of drops of murtlap essence sorts them lee put us on to it 
 
 george yawned widely and looked out disconsolately at the cloudy night sky 
 
 i dunno if i even want to watch this match if zacharias smith beats us i might have to kill myself 
 
 kill him more like said fred firmly 
 
 the trouble with quidditch said hermione once again bent over her runes translation it creates all this bad feeling and tension between the houses 
 
 she looked up to find her copy of syllabary and caught fred george and harry all staring at her with expressions of mingled disgust and incredulity on their faces 
 
 well it does she said impatiently only a game it 
 
 hermione said harry shaking his head good on feelings and stuff but you just understand about quidditch 
 
 maybe not she said darkly returning to her translation but at least my happiness depend on goalkeeping ability 
 
 and though harry would rather have jumped off the astronomy tower than admit it to her by the time he had watched the game the following saturday he would have given any number of galleons not to care about quidditch either 
 
 the very best thing you could say about the match was that it was short the gryffindor spectators had to endure only minutes of agony it was hard to say what the worst thing was harry thought it was a contest between fourteenth failed save sloper missing the bludger but hitting angelina in the mouth with his bat and kirke shrieking and falling backwards off his broom when zacharias smith zoomed at him carrying the quaffle the miracle was that gryffindor only lost by ten points ginny managed to snatch the snitch from right under hufflepuff seeker nose so that the final score was two hundred and forty versus two hundred and thirty 
 
 good catch harry told ginny back in the common room where the atmosphere resembled that of a particularly dismal funeral 
 
 i was lucky she shrugged it a very fast snitch and got a cold he sneezed and closed his eyes at exactly the wrong moment anyway once back on the team 
 
 ginny got a lifelong ban 
 
 banned as long as umbridge is in the school ginny corrected him a difference anyway once back i think try out for chaser angelina and alicia are both leaving next year and i prefer to seeking anyway 
 
 harry looked over at ron who was hunched in a corner staring at his knees a bottle of butlerbeer clutched in his hand 
 
 angelina still let him resign ginny said as though reading mind she says she knows got it in him 
 
 harry liked angelina for the faith she was showing in ron but at the same time thought it would really be kinder to let him leave the team ron had left the pitch to another booming chorus of weasley is our king sung with great gusto by the slytherins who were now favourites to win the quidditch cup 
 
 fred and george wandered over 
 
 i even got the heart to take the mickey out of him said fred looking over at crumpled figure mind you when he missed the fourteenth 
 
 he made wild motions with his arms as though doing an upright 
 
 well save it for parties eh 
 
 ron dragged himself up to bed shortly after this out of respect for his feelings harry waited a while before going up to the dormitory himself so that ron could pretend to be asleep if he wanted to sure enough when harry finally entered the room ron was snoring a little too loudly to be entirely plausible 
 
 harry got into bed thinking about the match it had been immensely frustrating watching from the sidelines he was quite impressed by performance but he knew if he had been playing he could have caught the snitch sooner there had been a moment when it had been fluttering near ankle if ginny hesitated she might have been able to scrape a win for gryffindor 
 
 umbridge had been sitting a few rows below harry and hermione once or twice she had turned squatly in her seat to look at him her wide mouth stretched in what he thought had been a gloating smile the memory of it made him feel hot with anger as he lay there in the dark after a few minutes however he remembered that he was supposed to be emptying his mind of all emotion before he slept as snape kept instructing him at the end of every occlumency lesson 
 
 he tried for a moment or two but the thought of snape on top of memories of umbridge merely increased his sense of grumbling resentment and he found himself focusing instead on how much he loathed the pair of them slowly snores died away to be replaced by the sound of deep slow breathing it took harry much longer to get to sleep his body was tired but it took his brain a long time to close down 
 
 he dreamed that neville and professor sprout were waltzing around the room of requirement while professor mcgonagall played the bagpipes he watched them happily for a while then decided to go and find the other members of the da 
 
 but when he left the room he found himself facing not the tapestry of barnabas the barmy but a torch burning in its bracket on a stone wall he turned his head slowly to the left there at the far end of the windowless passage was a plain black door 
 
 he walked towards it with a sense of mounting excitement he had the strangest feeling that this time he was going to get lucky at last and find the way to open it he was feet from it and saw with a leap of excitement that there was a glowing strip of faint blue light down the side the door was ajar he stretched out his hand to push it wide and 
 
 ron gave a loud rasping genuine snore and harry awoke abruptly with his right hand stretched in front of him in the darkness to open a door that was hundreds of miles away he let it fall with a feeling of mingled disappointment and guilt he knew he should not have seen the door but at the same time felt so consumed with curiosity about what was behind it that he could not help feeling annoyed with ron if only he could have saved his snore for just another minute 
 
 they entered the great hall for breakfast at exactly the same moment as the post owls on monday morning hermione was not the only person eagerly awaiting her daily prophet nearly everyone was eager for more news about the escaped death eaters who despite many reported sightings had still not been caught she gave the delivery owl a knut and unfolded the newspaper eagerly while harry helped himself to orange juice as he had only received one note during the entire year he was sure when the first owl landed with a thud in front of him that it had made a mistake 
 
 you after he asked it languidly removing his orange juice from underneath its beak and leaning forwards to see the name and address 
 
 harry potter 
 
 great hall 
 
 hogwarts school 
 
 frowning he made to take the letter from the owl but before he could do so three four five more owls had fluttered down beside it and were jockeying for position treading in the butter and knocking over the salt as each one attempted to give him their letter first 
 
 going on ron asked in amazement as the whole of gryffindor table leaned forwards to watch and another seven owls landed amongst the first ones screeching hooting and flapping their wings 
 
 harry said hermione breathlessly plunging her hands into the feathery mass and pulling out a screech owl bearing a long cylindrical package i think i know what this meansopen this one first 
 
 harry ripped off the brown packaging out rolled a tightly furled copy of the march edition of the unrolled it to see his own face grinning sheepishly at him from the front cover in large red letters across this picture were the words 
 
 harry potter speaks out at last 
 
 the truth about he who must not be named 
 
 and the night i saw him return 
 
 good it said luna who had drifted over to the gryffindor table and now squeezed herself on to the bench between fred and ron it came out yesterday i asked dad to send you a free copy i expect all these she waved a hand at the assembled owls still scrabbling around on the table in front of harry are letters from readers 
 
 what i thought said hermione eagerly harry mind if we 
 
 help yourself said harry feeling slightly bemused 
 
 ron and hermione both started ripping open envelopes 
 
 this from a bloke who thinks off your rocker said ron glancing down his letter ah well 
 
 this woman recommends you try a good course of shock spells at st said hermione looking disappointed and crumpling up a second 
 
 this one looks ok though said harry slowly scanning a long letter from a witch in paisley hey she says she believes me 
 
 this in two minds said fred who had joined in the with enthusiasm says you come across as a mad person but he really want to believe back so he know what to think now blimey what a waste of parchment 
 
 another one convinced harry said hermione excitedly having read your side of the story i am forced to the conclusion that the daily prophet has treated you very unfairly little though i want to think that he who must not be named has returned i am forced to accept that you are telling the truth oh this is wonderful 
 
 another one who thinks barking said ron throwing a crumpled letter over his shoulder but this one says got her converted and she now thinks a real put in a photograph toowow 
 
 what is going on here said a falsely sweet girlish voice 
 
 harry looked up with his hands full of envelopes professor umbridge was standing behind fred and luna her bulging eyes scanning the mess of owls and letters on the table in front of harry behind her he saw many of the students watching them avidly 
 
 why have you got all these letters mr potter she asked slowly 
 
 is that a crime now said fred loudly getting mail 
 
 be careful mr weasley or i shall have to put you in detention said umbridge well mr potter 
 
 harry hesitated but he did not see how he could keep what he had done quiet it was surely only a matter of time before a copy of the quibbler came to attention 
 
 people have written to me because i gave an interview said harry about what happened to me last june 
 
 for some reason he glanced up at the staff table as he said this harry had the strangest feeling that dumbledore had been watching him a second before but when he looked towards the headmaster he seemed to be absorbed in conversation with professor flitwick 
 
 an interview repeated umbridge her voice thinner and higher than ever what do you mean 
 
 i mean a reporter asked me questions and i answered them said harry here 
 
 and he threw the copy of the quibbler to her she caught it and stared down at the cover her pale doughy face turned an ugly patchy violet 
 
 when did you do this she asked her voice trembling slightly 
 
 last hogsmeade weekend said harry 
 
 she looked up at him incandescent with rage the magazine shaking in her stubby fingers 
 
 there will be no more hogsmeade trips for you mr potter she whispered how you dare how you could she took a deep breath i have tried again and again to teach you not to tell lies the message apparently has still not sunk in fifty points from gryffindor and another worth of detentions 
 
 she stalked away clutching the quibbler to her chest the eyes of many students following her 
 
 by enormous signs had been put up all over the school not just on house noticeboards but in the corridors and classrooms too 
 
 by order of the high inquisitor of hogwarts 
 
 
 
 any student found in possession of the magazine 
 
 the quibblerwill be expelled 
 
 
 
 the above is in accordance with educational decree number 
 
 
 
 signed dolores jane umbridge high inquisitor 
 
 for some reason every time hermione caught sight of one of these signs she beamed with pleasure 
 
 what exactly are you so happy about harry asked her 
 
 oh harry you see hermione breathed if she could have done one thing to make absolutely sure that every single person in this school will read your interview it was banning it 
 
 and it seemed that hermione was quite right by the end of the day though harry had not seen so much as a corner of the quibbler anywhere in the school the whole place seemed to be quoting the interview to each other harry heard them whispering about it as they queued up outside classes discussing it over lunch and in the back of lessons while hermione even reported that every occupant of the cubicles in the girls toilets had been talking about it when she nipped in there before ancient runes 
 
 then they spotted me and obviously they know i know you so they bombarded me with questions hermione told harry her eyes shining and harry i think they believe you i really do i think finally got them convinced 
 
 meanwhile professor umbridge was stalking the school stopping students at random and demanding that they turn out their books and pockets harry knew she was looking for copies of the quibbler but the students were several steps ahead of her the pages carrying interview had been bewitched to resemble extracts from textbooks if anyone but themselves read it or else wiped magically blank until they wanted to peruse it again soon it seemed that every single person in the school had read it 
 
 the teachers were of course forbidden from mentioning the interview by educational decree number but they found ways to express their feelings about it all the same professor sprout awarded gryffindor twenty points when harry passed her a watering can a beaming professor flitwick pressed a box of squeaking sugar mice on him at the end of charms said shh and hurried away and professor trelawney broke into hysterical sobs during divination and announced to the startled class and a very disapproving umbridge that harry was not going to suffer an early death after all but would live to a ripe old age become minister for magic and have twelve children 
 
 but what made harry happiest was cho catching up with him as he was hurrying along to transfiguration the next day before he knew what had happened her hand was in his and she was breathing in his ear really really sorry that interview was so brave it made me cry 
 
 he was sorry to hear she had shed even more tears over it but very glad they were on speaking terms again and even more pleased when she gave him a swift kiss on the cheek and hurried off again and unbelievably no sooner had he arrived outside transfiguration than something just as good happened seamus stepped out of the queue to face him 
 
 i just wanted to say he mumbled squinting at left knee i believe you and sent a copy of that magazine to me mam 
 
 if anything more was needed to complete happiness it was the reaction he got from malfoy crabbe and goyle he saw them with their heads together later that afternoon in the library they were with a boy hermione whispered was called theodore nott they looked round at harry as he browsed the shelves for the book he needed on partial vanishment goyle cracked his knuckles threateningly and malfoy whispered something undoubtedly malevolent to crabbe harry knew perfectly well why they were acting like this he had named all of their fathers as death eaters 
 
 and the best bit whispered hermione gleefully as they left the library is they contradict you because they admit read the article 
 
 to cap it all luna told him over dinner that no issue of the quibbler had ever sold out faster 
 
 reprinting she told harry her eyes popping excitedly he believe it he says people seem even more interested in this than the snorkacks 
 
 harry was a hero in the gryffindor common room that night daringly fred and george had put an enlargement charm on the front cover of the quibbler and hung it on the wall so that giant head gazed down upon the proceedings occasionally saying things like the ministry are morons and eat dung umbridge in a booming voice hermione did not find this very amusing she said it interfered with her concentration and she ended up going to bed early out of irritation harry had to admit that the poster was not quite as funny after an hour or two especially when the talking spell had started to wear off so that it merely shouted disconnected words like dung and umbridge at more and more frequent intervals in a progressively higher voice in fact it started to make his head ache and his scar began prickling uncomfortably again to disappointed moans from the many people who were sitting around him asking him to relive his interview for the umpteenth time he announced that he too needed an early night 
 
 the dormitory was empty when he reached it he rested his forehead for a moment against the cool glass of the window beside his bed it felt soothing against his scar then he undressed and got into bed wishing his headache would go away he also felt slightly sick he rolled over on to his side closed his eyes and fell asleep almost at once 
 
 he was standing in a dark curtained room lit by a single branch of candles his hands were clenched on the back of a chair in front of him they were and white as though they had not seen sunlight for years and looked like large pale spiders agairst the dark velvet of the chair 
 
 beyond the chair in a pool of light cast upon the floor by the candles knelt a man in black robes 
 
 i have been badly advised it seems said harry in a high cold voice that pulsed with anger 
 
 master i crave your pardon croaked the man kneeling on the floor the back of his head glimmered in the candlelight he seemed to be trembling 
 
 i do not blame you rookwood said harry in that cold cruel voice 
 
 he relinquished his grip on the chair and walked around it closer to the man cowering on the floor until he stood directly over him in the darkness looking down from a far greater height than usual 
 
 you are sure of your facts rookwood asked harry 
 
 yes my lord yes i used to work in the department aftetafter all 
 
 avery told me bode would be able to remove it 
 
 bode could never have taken it master bode would have known he could not undoubtedly that is why he fought so hard against imperius curse 
 
 stand up rookwood whispered harry 
 
 the kneeling man almost fell over in his haste to obey his face was pockmarked the scars were thrown into relief by the candlelight he remained a little stooped when standing as though halfway through a bow and he darted terrified looks up at face 
 
 you have done well to tell me this said harry very well i have wasted months on fruitless schemes it seems but no matter we begin again from now you have lord gratitude rookwood 
 
 my lord yes my lord gasped rookwood his voice hoarse with relief 
 
 i shall need your help i shall need all the information you can give me 
 
 of course my lord of course anything 
 
 very well you may go send avery to me 
 
 rookwood scurried backwards bowing and disappeared through a door 
 
 left alone in the dark room harry turned towards the wall a cracked mirror hung on the wall in the shadows harry moved towards it his reflection grew larger and clearer in the darkness a face whiter than a skull red eyes with slits for pupils 
 
 nooooooooo 
 
 what yelled a voice nearby 
 
 harry hailed around madly became entangled in the hangings and fell out of his bed for a few seconds he did not know where he was he was convinced he was about to see the white lace looming at him out of the dark again then very near to him voice spoke 
 
 will you stop acting like a maniac so i can get you out of here 
 
 ron wrenched the hangings apart and harry stared up at him in the moonlight flat on his back his scar searing with pain ron looked as though he had just been getting ready for bed one arm was out of his robes 
 
 has someone been attacked again asked ron pulling harry roughly to his feet is it dad is it that snake 
 
 fine gasped harry whose forehead felt as though it were on fire well avery in trouble he gave him the wrong information really angry 
 
 harry groaned and sank shaking on to his bed rubbing his scar 
 
 but going to help him now on the right track again 
 
 what are you talking about said ron sounding scared mean did you just see 
 
 i was said harry and he stretched out his hands in the darkness and held them up to his face to check that they were no longer deathly white and he was with rookwood one of the death eaters who escaped from azkaban remember just told him bode have done it 
 
 done what 
 
 remove something he said bode would have known he have done it bode was under the imperius curse i think he said dad put it on him 
 
 bode was bewitched to remove something ron said butharry got to be 
 
 the weapon harry finished the sentence for him i know 
 
 the dormitory door opened dean and seamus came in harry swung his legs back into bed he did not want to look as though anything odd had just happened seeing as seamus had only just stopped thinking harry was a nutter 
 
 did you say murmured ron putting his head close to on the pretence of helping himself to water from the jug on his bedside table that you were 
 
 yeah said harry quietly 
 
 ron took an unnecessarily large gulp of water harry saw it spill over his chin on to his chest 
 
 harry he said as dean and seamus clattered around noisily pulling off their robes and talking got to tell 
 
 i got to tell anyone said harry shortly i have seen it at all if i could do occlumency supposed to have learned to shut this stuff out what they want 
 
 by they he meant dumbledore he got back into bed and rolled over on to his side with his back to ron and after a while he heard mattress creak as he too lay back down scar began to burn he bit hard on his pillow to stop himself making a noise somewhere he knew avery was being punished 
 
 harry and ron waited until break next morning to tell hermione exactly what had happened they wanted to be absolutely sure they could not be overheard standing in their usual corner of the cool and breezy courtyard harry told her every detail of the dream he could remember when he had finished she said nothing at all for a few moments but stared with a kind of painful intensity at fred and george who were both headless and selling their magical hats from under their cloaks on the other side of the yard 
 
 so why they killed him she said quietly withdrawing her gaze from fred and george at last when bode tried to steal this weapon something funny happened to him i think there must be defensive spells on it or around it to stop people touching it why he was in st mungos his brain had gone all funny and he talk but remember what the healer told us he was recovering and they risk him getting better could they i mean the shock of whatever happened when he touched that weapon probably made the imperius curse lift once got his voice back explain what been doing he they would have known been sent to steal the weapon of course it would have been easy for lucius malfoy to put the curse on him never out of the ministry is he 
 
 he was even hanging around that day i had my hearing said harry in thehang on he said slowly he was in the department of mysteries corridor that day your dad said he was probably trying to sneak down and find out what happened in my hearing but what if 
 
 sturgis gasped hermione looking thunderstruck 
 
 sorry said ron looking bewildered 
 
 sturgis podmore said hermione breathlessly arrested for trying to get through a door lucius malfoy must have got him too i bet he did it the day you saw him there harry sturgis had invisibility cloak right so what if he was standing guard by the door invisible and malfoy heard him moveor guessed someone was thereor just did the imperius curse on the be a guard there so when sturgis next had an opportunityprobably when it was his turn on guard duty againhe tried to get into the department to steal the weapon for voldemortron be quietbut he got caught and sent to azkaban 
 
 she gazed at harry 
 
 and now told voldemort how to get the weapon 
 
 i hear all the conversation but what it sounded like said harry rookwood used to work there maybe send rookwood to do it 
 
 hermione nodded apparently still lost in thought then quite abruptly she said but you have seen this at all harry 
 
 what he said taken aback 
 
 supposed to be learning how to close your mind to this sort of thing said hermione suddenly stern 
 
 i know i am said harry but 
 
 well i think we should just try and forget what you saw said hermione firmly and you ought to put in a bit more effort on your occlumency from now on 
 
 harry was so angry with her he did not talk to her for the rest of the day which proved to be another bad one when people were not discussing the escaped death eaters in the corridors they were laughing at abysmal performance in their match against hufflepuff the slytherins were singing weasley is our king so loudly and frequently that by sundown filch had banned it from the corridors out of sheer irritation 
 
 the week did not improve as it progressed harry received two more ds in potions he was still on tenterhooks that hagrid might get the sack and he stop himself dwelling on the dream in which he had been voldemortthough he bring it up with ron and hermione again he want another from hermione he wished very much that he could have talked to sirius about it but that was out of the question so he tried to push the matter to the back of his mind 
 
 unfortunately the back of his mind was no longer the secure place it had once been 
 
 get up potter 
 
 a couple of weeks after his dream of rookwood harry was to be found yet again kneeling on the floor of office trying to clear his head he had just been forced yet again to relive a stream of very early memories he had not even realised he still had most of them concerning humiliations dudley and his gang had inflicted upon him in primary school 
 
 that last memory said snape what was it 
 
 i know said harry getting wearily to his feet he was finding it increasingly difficult to disentangle separate memories from the rush of images and sound that snape kept calling forth you mean the one where my cousin tried to make me stand in the toilet 
 
 no said snape softly i mean the one with a man kneeling in the middle of a darkened room 
 
 nothing said harry 
 
 dark eyes bored into remembering what snape had said about eye contact being crucial to legilimency harry blinked and looked away 
 
 how do that man and that room come to be inside your head potter said snape 
 
 it said harry looking everywhere but at snape it wasjust a dream i had 
 
 a dream repeated snape 
 
 there was a pause during which harry stared fixedly at a large dead frog suspended in a jar of purple liquid 
 
 you do know why we are here you potter said snape in a low dangerous voice you do know why i am giving up my evenings to this tedious job 
 
 yes said harry stiffly 
 
 remind me why we are here potter 
 
 so i can learn occlumency said harry now glaring at a dead eel 
 
 correct potter and dim though you may be harry looked back at snape hating him i would have thought that after over two months of lessons you might have made some progress how many other dreams about the dark lord have you had 
 
 just that one lied harry 
 
 perhaps said snape his dark cold eyes narrowing slightly perhaps you actually enjoy having these visions and dreams potter maybe they make you feel special important 
 
 no they said harry his jaw set and his fingers clenched tightly around the handle of his wand 
 
 that is just as well potter said snape coldly because you are neither special nor important and it is not up to you to find out what the dark lord is saying to his death eaters 
 
 your job it harry shot at him 
 
 he had not meant to say it it had burst out of him in temper for a long moment they stared at each other harry convinced he had gone too far but there was a curious almost satisfied expression on face when he answered 
 
 yes potter he said his eyes glinting that is my job now if you are ready we will start again 
 
 he raised his wand onetwothreelegilimens 
 
 a hundred dementors were swooping towards harry across the lake in the grounds he screwed up his face in concentration they were coming closer he could see the dark holes beneath their hoods yet he could also see snape standing in front of him his eyes fixed on face muttering under his breath and somehow snape was growing clearer and the dementors were growing fainter 
 
 harry raised his own wand 
 
 protego 
 
 snape staggered his wand flew upwards away from harryand suddenly mind was teeming with memories that were not his a man was shouting at a cowering woman while a small boy cried in a corner a teenager sat alone in a dark bedroom pointing his wand at the ceiling shooting down flies a girl was laughing as a scrawny boy tried to mount a bucking broomstick 
 
 enough 
 
 harry felt as though he had been pushed hard in the chest he staggered several steps backwards hit some of the shelves covering walls and heard something crack snape was shaking slightly and was very white in the face 
 
 the back of robes was damp one of the jars behind him had broken when he fell against it the pickled slimy thing within was swirling in its draining potion 
 
 reparo hissed snape and the jar sealed itself at once well potter that was certainly an improvement panting slightly snape straightened the pensieve in which he had again stored some of his thoughts before starting the lesson almost as though he was checking they were still there i remember telling you to use a shield charm but there is no doubt that it was effective 
 
 harry did not speak he felt that to say anything might be dangerous he was sure he had just broken into memories that he had just seen scenes from childhood it was unnerving to think that the little boy who had been crying as he watched his parents shouting was actually standing in front of him with such loathing in his eyes 
 
 try again shall we said snape 
 
 harry felt a thrill of dread he was about to pay for what had just happened he was sure of it they moved back into position with the desk between them harry feeling he was going to find it much harder to empty his mind this time 
 
 on the count of three then said snape raising his wand once more onetwo 
 
 harry did not have time to gather himself together and attempt to clear his mind before snape cried legilimens 
 
 he was hurtling along the corridor towards the department of masteries past the blank stone walls past the torchesthe plain black door was growing ever larger he was moving so fast he was going to collide with it he was feet from it and again he could see that chink of faint blue light 
 
 the door had flown open he was through it at last inside a circular room lit with candles and there were more doors all around himhe needed to go onbut which door ought he to take 
 
 p otter 
 
 harry opened his eyes he was flat on his back again with no memory of having got there he was also panting as though his really had run the length of the department of mysteries corridor really had sprinted through the black door and found the circular room 
 
 explain yourself said snape who was standing over him looking furious 
 
 i dunno what happened said harry truthfully standing up there was a lump on the back of his head from where he had hit the ground and he felt feverish never seen that before i mean i told you dreamed about the door but never opened before 
 
 you are not working hard enough 
 
 for some reason snape seemed even angrier than he had done two minutes before when harry had seen into his memories 
 
 you are lazy and sloppy potter it is small wonder that the dark lord 
 
 can you tell me something sir said harry firing up again why do you call voldemort the dark lord only ever heard death eaters call him that 
 
 snape opened his mouth in a snarland a woman screamed from somewhere outside the room 
 
 head jerked upwards he was gazing at the ceiling 
 
 what the he muttered 
 
 harry could hear a muffled commotion coming from what he thought might be the entrance hall snape looked round at him frowning 
 
 did you see anything unusual on your way down here potter 
 
 harry shook his head somewhere above them the woman screamed again snape strode to his office door his wand still held at the ready and swept out of sight harry hesitated for a moment then followed 
 
 the screams were indeed coming from the entrance hall they grew louder as harry ran towards the stone steps leading up from the dungeons when he reached the top he found the entrance hall packed students had come flooding out of the great hall where dinner was still in progress to see what was going on others had crammed themselves on to the marble staircase harry pushed forwards through a knot of tall slytherins and saw that the onlookers had formed a great ring some of them looking shocked others even frightened professor mcgonagall was directly opposite harry en the other side of the hall she looked as though what she was watching made her feel faintly sick 
 
 professor trelawney was standing in the middle of the entrance hall with her wand in one hand and an empty sherry bottle in the other looking utterly mad her hair was sticking up on end her glasses were lopsided so that one eye was magnified more than the other her innumerable shawls and scarves were trailing haphazardly from her shoulders giving the impression that she was falling apart at the seams two large trunks lay on the floor beside her one of them it looked very much as though it had been thrown down the stairs after her professor trelawney was staring apparently terrified at something harry could not see but which seemed to be standing at the foot of the stairs 
 
 no she shrieked no this cannot be happening it cannot i retuse to accept it 
 
 you realise this was coming said a high girlish voice sounding callously amused and harry moving slightly to his right saw that terrifying vision was nothing other than professor umbridge incapable though you are of predicting even tomorrows weather you must surely have realised that your pitiful performance during my inspections and lack of any improvement would make it inevitable that you would be sacked 
 
 you howled professor trelawney tears streaming down her face from behind her enormous lenses you sack me bbeen here sixteen years h hogwarts is mmy hhome 
 
 it was your home said professor umbridge and harry was revolted to see the enjoyment stretching her toadlike face as she watched professor trelawney sink sobbing uncontrollably on to one of her trunks until an hour ago when the minister for magic countersigned your order of dismissal now kindly remove yourself from this hall you are embarrassing us 
 
 but she stood and watched with an expression of gloating enjoyment as professor trelawney shuddered and moaned rocking backwards and forwards on her trunk in paroxysms of grief harry heard a muffled sob to his left and looked around lavender and parvati were both crying quietly their arms round each other then he heard footsteps professor mcgonagall had broken away from the spectators marched straight up to professor trelawney and was patting her firmly on the back while withdrawing a large handkerchief from within her robes 
 
 there there sybill calm down blow your nose on this not as bad as you think now you are not going to have to leave hogwarts 
 
 oh really professor mcgonagall said umbridge in a deadly voice taking a few steps forward and your authority for that statement is 
 
 that would be mine said a deep voice 
 
 the oaken front doors had swung open students beside them scuttled out of the way as dumbledore appeared in the entrance what he had been doing out in the grounds harry could not imagine but there was something impressive about the sight of him framed in the doorway against an oddly misty night leaving the doors wide open behind him he strode forwards through the circle of onlookers towards professor trelawney and trembling on her trunk professor mcgonagall alongside her 
 
 yours professor dumbledore said umbridge with a singularly unpleasant little laugh afraid you do not understand the position i have here she pulled a parchment scroll from within her robes an order of dismissal signed by myself and the minister for magic under the terms of educational decree number the high inquisitor of hogwarts has the power to inspect place upon probation and sack any teacher shethat is to say ifeel is not performing to the standards required by the ministry of magic i have decided that professor trelawney is not up to scratch i have dismissed her 
 
 to very great surprise dumbledore continued to smile he looked down at professor trelawney who was still sobbing and choking on her trunk and said you are quite right of course professor umbridge as high inquisitor you have every right to dismiss my teachers you do not however have the authority to send them away from the castle i am afraid he went on with a courteous little bow that the power to do that still resides with the headmaster and it is my wish that professor trelawney continue to live at hogwarts 
 
 at this professor trelawney gave a wild little laugh in which a hiccough was barely hidden 
 
 nono g go dumbledore i shshallleave hogwarts and sseek my fortune elsewhere 
 
 no said dumbledore sharply it is my wish that you remain sybill 
 
 he turned to professor mcgonagall 
 
 might i ask you to escort sybill back upstairs professor mcgonagall 
 
 of course said mcgonagall up you get sybill 
 
 professor sprout came hurrying forwards out of the crowd and grabbed professor other arm together they guided her past umbridge and up the marble stairs professor flitwick went scurrying after them his wand held out before him he squeaked locomotor trunks and professor luggage rose into the air and proceeded up the staircase after her professor flitwick bringing up the rear 
 
 professor umbridge was standing stock still staring at dumbledore who continued to smile benignly 
 
 and what she said in a whisper that carried all around the eintrance hall are you going to do with her once i appoint a new divination teacher who needs her lodgings 
 
 oh that be a problem said dumbledore pleasantly you see i have already found us a new divination teacher and he will prefer lodgings on the ground floor 
 
 found said umbridge shrilly found might i remind you dumbledore that under educational decree number 
 
 the ministry has the right to appoint a suitable candidate ifand only ifthe headmaster is unable to find one said dumbledore and i am happy to say that on this occasion i have succeeded may i introduce you 
 
 he turned to face the open front doors through which night mist was now drifting harry heard hooves there was a shocked murmur around the hall and those nearest the doors hastily moved even further backwards some of them tripping over in their haste to clear a path for the newcomer 
 
 through the mist came a face harry had seen once before on a dark dangerous night in the forbidden forest hair and astonishingly blue eyes the head and torso of a man joined to the palomino body of a horse 
 
 this is firenze said dumbledore happily to a thunderstruck umbridge i think find him suitable 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter the cavecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry could smell salt and hear rushing waves a light chilly breeze ruffled his hair as he looked out at moonlit sea and sky he was standing upon a high outcrop of dark rock water foaming and churning below him he glanced over his shoulder a towering cliff stood behind them a sheer drop black and faceless a few large chunks of rock such as the one upon which harry and dumbledore were standing looked as though they had broken away from the cliff face at some point in the past it was a bleak harsh view the sea and the rock unrelieved by any tree or sweep of grass or sand 
 
 what do you think asked dumbledore he might have been asking opinion on whether it was a good site for a picnic 
 
 they brought the kids from the orphanage here asked harry who could not imagine a less cozy spot for a day trip 
 
 not here precisely said dumbledore there is a village of sorts about halfway along the cliffs behind us i believe the orphans were taken there for a little sea air and a view of the waves no i think it was only ever tom riddle and his youthful victims who visited this spot no muggle could reach this rock unless they were uncommonly good mountaineers and boats cannot approach the cliffs the waters around them are too dangerous i imagine that riddle climbed down magic would have served better than ropes and he brought two small children with him probably for the pleasure of terrorizing them i think the journey alone would have done it you 
 
 harry looked up at the cliff again and felt goose bumps 
 
 but his final destinationand ourslies a little farther on come 
 
 dumbledore beckoned harry to the very edge of the rock where a series of jagged niches made footholds leading down to boulders that lay in water and closer to the cliff it was a treacherous descent and dumbledore hampered slightly by his withered hand moved slowly the lower rocks were slippery with seawater harry could feel flecks of cold salt spray hitting his face 
 
 lumos said dumbledore as he reached the boulder closest to the cliff face a thousand flecks of golden light sparkled upon the dark surface of the water a few feet below where he crouched the black wall of rock beside him was illuminated too 
 
 you see said dumbledore quietly holding his wand a little higher harry saw a fissure in the cliff into which dark water was swirling 
 
 you will not object to getting a little wet 
 
 no said harry 
 
 then take off your invisibility cloakthere is no need for it nowand let us take the plunge 
 
 and with the sudden agility of a much younger man dumbledore slid from the boulder landed in the sea and began to swim with a perfect breaststroke toward the dark slit in the rock face his lit wand held in his teeth harry pulled off his cloak stuffed it into his pocket and followed 
 
 the water was icy waterlogged clothes billowed around him and weighed him down taking deep breaths that filled his nostrils with the tang of salt and seaweed he struck out for the shimmering shrinking light now moving deeper into the cliff the fissure soon opened into a dark tunnel that harry could tell would be filled with water at high tide the slimy walls were barely three feet apart and glimmered like wet tar in the passing light of wand a little way in the passageway curved to the left and harry saw that it extended far into the cliff he continued to swim in wake the tips of his benumbed fingers brushing the rough wet rock 
 
 then he saw dumbledore rising out of the water ahead his silver hair and dark robes gleaming when harry reached the spot he found steps that led into a large cave he clambered up them water streaming from his soaking clothes and emerged shivering uncontrollably into the still and freezing air 
 
 dumbledore was standing in the middle of the cave his wand held high as he turned slowly on the spot examining the walls and ceiling 
 
 yes this is the place said dumbledore 
 
 how can you tell harry spoke in a whisper 
 
 it has known magic said dumbledore simply harry could not tell whether the shivers he was experiencing were due to his coldness or to the same awareness of enchantments he watched as dumbledore continued to revolve on the spot evidently concentrating on things harry could not see 
 
 this is merely the antechamber the entrance hall said dumbledore after a moment or two we need to penetrate the inner place now it is lord obstacles that stand in our way rather than those nature made 
 
 dumbledore approached the wall of the cave and caressed it with his blackened fingertips murmuring words in a strange tongue that harry did not understand twice dumbledore walked right around the cave touching as much of the rough rock as he could occasionally pausing running his fingers backward and forward over a particular spot until finally he stopped his hand pressed flat against the wall 
 
 here he said we go on through here the entrance is concealed 
 
 harry did not ask how dumbledore knew he had never seen a wizard work things out like this simply by looking and touching but harry had long since learned that bangs and smoke were more often the marks of ineptitude than expertise 
 
 dumbledore stepped back from the cave wall and pointed his wand at the rock for a moment an arched outline appeared there blazing white as though there was a powerful light behind the crack 
 
 it said harry through chattering teeth but before the words had left his lips the outline had gone leaving the rock as bare and solid as ever dumbledore looked around 
 
 harry so sorry i forgot he said he now pointed his wand at harry and at once clothes were as warm and dry as if they had been hanging in front of a blazing fire 
 
 thank you said harry gratefully but dumbledore had already turned his attention back to the solid cave wall he did not try any more magic but simply stood there staring at it intently as though something extremely interesting was written on it harry stayed quite still he did not want to break concentration 
 
 then after two solid minutes dumbledore said quietly oh surely not so crude 
 
 what is it professor 
 
 i rather think said dumbledore putting his uninjured hand inside his robes and drawing out a short silver knife of the kind harry used to chop potion ingredients that we are required to make payment to pass 
 
 payment said harry got to give the door something 
 
 yes said dumbledore blood if i am not much mistaken 
 
 blood 
 
 i said it was crude said dumbledore who sounded disdainful even disappointed as though voldemort had fallen short of higher standards dumbledore expected the idea as i am sure you will have gathered is that your enemy must weaken him or herself to enter once again lord voldemort fails to grasp that there are much more terrible things than physical injury 
 
 yeah but still if you can avoid it said harry who had experienced enough pain not to be keen for more 
 
 sometimes however it is unavoidable said dumbledore shaking back the sleeve of his robes and exposing the forearm of his injured hand 
 
 professor protested harry hurrying forward as dumbledore raised his knife do it 
 
 he did not know what he was going to sayyounger fitter but dumbledore merely smiled there was a flash of silver and a spurt of scarlet the rock face was peppered with dark glistening drops 
 
 you are very kind harry said dumbledore now passing the tip of his wand over the deep cut he had made in his own arm so that it healed instantly just as snape had healed wound but your blood is worth more than mine ah that seems to have done the trick it 
 
 the blazing silver outline of an arch had appeared in the wall once more and this time it did not fade away the rock within it simply vanished leaving an opening into what seemed total darkness 
 
 after me i think said dumbledore and he walked through the archway with harry on his heels lighting his own wand hastily as he went 
 
 an eerie sight met their eyes they were standing on the edge of a great black lake so vast that harry could not make out the distant banks in a cavern so high that the ceiling too was out of sight a misty greenish light shone far away in what looked like the middle of the lake it was reflected in the completely still water below the greenish glow and the light from the two wands were the only things that broke the otherwise velvety blackness though their rays did not penetrate as far as harry would have expected the darkness was somehow denser than normal darkness 
 
 let us walk said dumbledore quietly be very careful not to step into the water stay close to me 
 
 he set off around the edge of the lake and harry followed close behind him their footsteps made echoing slapping sounds on the narrow rim of rock that surrounded the water on and on they walked but the view did not vary on one side of them the rough cavern wall on the other the boundless expanse of smooth glassy blackness in the very middle of which was that mysterious greenish glow harry found the place and the silence oppressive unnerving 
 
 professor he said finally do you think the horcrux is here 
 
 oh yes said dumbledore yes sure it is the question is how do we get to it 
 
 we we just try a summoning charm harry said sure that it was a stupid suggestion but he was much keener than he was prepared to admit on getting out of this place as soon as possible 
 
 certainly we could said dumbledore stopping so suddenly that harry almost walked into him why you do it 
 
 me oh okay harry had not expected this but cleared his throat and said loudly wand aloft accio horcrux 
 
 with a noise like an explosion something very large and pale erupted out of the dark water some twenty feet away before harry could see what it was it had vanished again with a crashing splash that made great deep ripples on the mirrored surface harry leapt backward in shock and hit the wall his heart was still thundering as he turned to dumbledore 
 
 what was that 
 
 something i think that is ready to respond should we attempt to seize the horcrux 
 
 harry looked back at the water the surface of the lake was once more shining black glass the ripples had vanished unnaturally fast heart however was still pounding 
 
 did you think that would happen sir 
 
 i thought something would happen if we made an obvious attempt to get our hands on the horcrux that was a very good idea harry much the simplest way of finding out what we are facing 
 
 but we know what the thing was said harry looking at the sinisterly smooth water 
 
 what the things are you mean said dumbledore i doubt very much that there is only one of them shall we walk on 
 
 professor 
 
 yes harry 
 
 do you think going to have to go into the lake 
 
 into it only if we are very unfortunate 
 
 you think the horcrux is at the bottom 
 
 oh no i think the horcrux is in the middle 
 
 and dumbledore pointed toward the misty green light in the center of the lake 
 
 so going to have to cross the lake to get to it 
 
 yes i think so 
 
 harry did not say anything his thoughts were all of water monsters of giant serpents of demons kelpies and sprites 
 
 aha said dumbledore and he stopped again this time harry really did walk into him for a moment he toppled on the edge of the dark water and uninjured hand closed tightly around his upper arm pulling him back so sorry harry i should have given warning stand back against the wall please i think i have found the place 
 
 harry had no idea what dumbledore meant this patch of dark bank was exactly like every other bit as far as he could tell but dumbledore seemed to have detected something special about it this time he was running his hand not over the rocky wall but through the thin air as though expecting to find and grip something invisible 
 
 oho said dumbledore happily seconds later his hand had closed in midair upon something harry could not see dumbledore moved closer to the water harry watched nervously as the tips of buckled shoes found the utmost edge of the rock rim keeping his hand clenched in midair dumbledore raised his wand with the other and tapped his fist with the point 
 
 immediately a thick coppery green chain appeared out of thin air extending from the depths of the water into clenched hand dumbledore tapped the chain which began to slide through his fist like a snake coiling itself on the ground with a clinking sound that echoed noisily off the rocky walls pulling something from the depths of the black water harry gasped as the ghostly prow of a tiny boat broke the surface glowing as green as the chain and floated with barely a ripple toward the place on the bank where harry and dumbledore stood 
 
 how did you know that was there harry asked in astonishment 
 
 magic always leaves traces said dumbledore as the boat hit the bank with a gentle bump sometimes very distinctive traces i taught tom riddle i know his style 
 
 is is this boat safe 
 
 oh yes i think so voldemort needed to create a means to cross the lake without attracting the wrath of those creatures he had placed within it in case he ever wanted to visit or remove his horcrux 
 
 so the things in the water do anything to us if we cross in boat 
 
 i think we must resign ourselves to the fact that they will at some point realize we are not lord voldemort thus far however we have done well they have allowed us to raise the boat 
 
 but why have they let us asked harry who could not shake off the vision of tentacles rising out of the dark water the moment they were out of sight of the bank 
 
 voldemort would have been reasonably confident that none but a very great wizard would have been able to find the boat said dumbledore i think he would have been prepared to risk what was to his mind the most unlikely possibility that somebody else would find it knowing that he had set other obstacles ahead that only he would be able to penetrate we shall see whether he was right 
 
 harry looked down into the boat it really was very small 
 
 it look like it was built for two people will it hold both of us will we be too heavy together 
 
 dumbledore chuckled 
 
 voldemort will not have cared about the weight but about the amount of magical power that crossed his lake i rather think an enchantment will have been placed upon this boat so that only one wizard at a time will be able to sail in it 
 
 but then 
 
 i do not think you will count harry you are underage and unqualified voldemort would never have expected a to reach this place i think it unlikely that your powers will register compared to mine 
 
 these words did nothing to raise morale perhaps dumbledore knew it for he added mistake harry mistake age is foolish and forgetful when it underestimates youth now you first this time and be careful not to touch the water 
 
 dumbledore stood aside and harry climbed carefully into the boat dumbledore stepped in too coiling the chain onto the floor they were crammed in together harry could not comfortably sit but crouched his knees jutting over the edge of the boat which began to move at once there was no sound other than the silken rustle of the prow cleaving the water it moved without their help as though an invisible rope was pulling it onward toward the light in the center soon they could no longer see the walls of the cavern they might have been at sea except that there were no waves 
 
 harry looked down and saw the reflected gold of his wandlight sparkling and glittering on the black water as they passed the boat was carving deep ripples upon the glassy surface grooves in the dark mirror 
 
 and then harry saw it marble white floating inches below the surface 
 
 professor he said and his startled voice echoed loudly over the silent water 
 
 harry 
 
 i think i saw a hand in the watera human hand 
 
 yes i am sure you did said dumbledore calmly 
 
 harry stared down into the water looking for the vanished hand and a sick feeling rose in his throat 
 
 so that thing that jumped out of the water but harry had his answer before dumbledore could reply the wandlight had slid over a fresh patch of water and showed him this time a dead man lying faceup inches beneath the surface his open eyes misted as though with cobwebs his hair and his robes swirling around him like smoke 
 
 there are bodies in here said harry and his voice sounded much higher than usual and most unlike his own 
 
 yes said dumbledore placidly but we do not need to worry about them at the moment 
 
 at the moment harry repeated tearing his gaze from the water to look at dumbledore 
 
 not while they are merely drifting peacefully below us said dumbledore there is nothing to be feared from a body harry any more than there is anything to be feared from the darkness lord voldemort who of course secretly fears both disagrees but once again he reveals his own lack of wisdom it is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness nothing more 
 
 harry said nothing he did not want to argue but he found the idea that there were bodies floating around them and beneath them horrible and what was more he did not believe that they were not dangerous 
 
 but one of them jumped he said trying to make his voice as level and calm as when i tried to summon the horcrux a body leapt out of the lake 
 
 yes said dumbledore i am sure that once we take the horcrux we shall find them less peaceable however like many creatures that dwell in cold and darkness they fear light and warmth which we shall therefore call to our aid should the need arise fire harry dumbledore added with a smile in response to bewildered expression 
 
 oh right said harry quickly he turned his head to look at the greenish glow toward which the boat was still inexorably sailing he could not pretend now that he was not scared the great black lake teeming with the dead it seemed hours and hours ago that he had met professor trelawney that he had given ron and hermione felix felicis he suddenly wished he had said a better goodbye to the and he seen ginny at all 
 
 nearly there said dumbledore cheerfully 
 
 sure enough the greenish light seemed to be growing larger at last and within minutes the boat had come to a halt bumping gently into something that harry could not see at first but when he raised his illuminated wand he saw that they had reached a small island of smooth rock in the center of the lake 
 
 careful not to touch the water said dumbledore again as harry climbed out of the boat 
 
 the island was no larger than office an expanse of flat dark stone on which stood nothing but the source of that greenish light which looked much brighter when viewed close to harry squinted at it at first he thought it was a lamp of some kind but then he saw that the light was coming from a stone basin rather like the pensieve which was set on top of a pedestal 
 
 dumbledore approached the basin and harry followed side by side they looked down into it the basin was full of an emerald liquid emitting that phosphorescent glow 
 
 what is it asked harry quietly 
 
 i am not sure said dumbledore something more worrisome than blood and bodies however dumbledore pushed back the sleeve of his robe over his blackened hand and stretched out the tips of his burned fingers toward the surface of the potion 
 
 sir no touch 
 
 i cannot touch said dumbledore smiling faintly see i cannot approach any nearer than this you try 
 
 staring harry put his hand into the basin and attempted to touch the potion he met an invisible barrier that prevented him coming within an inch of it no matter how hard he pushed his fingers encountered nothing but what seemed to be solid and flexible air 
 
 out of the way please harry said dumbledore 
 
 he raised his wand and made complicated movements over the surface of murmuring soundlessly nothing happened except per haps that the potion glowed a little brighter harry remained silent while dumbledore worked but after a while dumbledore withdrew his wand and harry felt it was safe to talk again 
 
 you think the horcrux is in there sir 
 
 oh yes dumbledore peered more closely into the basin harry saw his face reflected upside down in the smooth surface of the green potion but how to reach it this potion cannot be penetrated by hand vanished parted scooped up or siphoned away nor can it be transfigured charmed or otherwise made to change its nature 
 
 almost dumbledore raised his wand again twirled it once in midair and then caught the crystal goblet that he had conjured out of nowhere 
 
 i can only conclude that this potion is supposed to be drunk 
 
 what said harry no 
 
 yes i think so only by drinking it can i empty the basin and see what lies in its depths 
 
 but what if what if it kills you 
 
 oh i doubt that it would work like that said dumbledore easily lord voldemort would not want to kill the person who reached this island 
 
 harry believe it was this more of insane determination to see good in everyone 
 
 sir said harry trying to keep his voice reasonable sir this is voldemort 
 
 sorry harry i should have said he would not want to immediately kill the person who reached this island dumbledore corrected himself he would want to keep them alive long enough to find out how they managed to penetrate so far through his defenses and most importantly of all why they were so intent upon emptying the basin do not forget that lord voldemort believes that he alone knows about his horcruxes 
 
 harry made to speak again but this time dumbledore raised his hand for silence frowning slightly at the emerald liquid evidently thinking hard 
 
 undoubtedly he said finally this potion must act in a way that will prevent me taking the horcrux it might paralyze me cause me to forget what i am here for create so much pain i am distracted or render me incapable in some other way this being the case harry it will be your job to make sure i keep drinking even if you have to tip the potion into my protesting mouth you understand 
 
 their eyes met over the basin each pale face lit with that strange green light harry did not speak was this why he had been invited alongso that he could dumbledore a potion that might cause him unendurable pain 
 
 you remember said dumbledore the condition on which i brought you with me 
 
 harry hesitated looking into the blue eyes that had turned green in the reflected light of the basin 
 
 but what if 
 
 you swore did you not to follow any command i gave you 
 
 yes but 
 
 i warned you did i not that there might be danger 
 
 yes said harry but 
 
 well then said dumbledore shaking back his sleeves once more and raising the empty goblet you have my orders 
 
 why i drink the potion instead asked harry desperately 
 
 because i am much older much cleverer and much less valuable said dumbledore once and for all harry do i have your word that you will do all in your power to make me keep drinking 
 
 
 
 do i have it 
 
 but 
 
 your word harry 
 
 i all right but 
 
 before harry could make any further protest dumbledore lowered the crystal goblet into the potion for a split second harry hoped that he would not be able to touch the potion with the goblet but the crystal sank into the surface as nothing else had when the glass was full to the brim dumbledore lifted it to his mouth 
 
 your good health harry 
 
 and he drained the goblet harry watched terrified his hands gripping the rim of the basin so hard that his fingertips were numb 
 
 professor he said anxiously as dumbledore lowered the empty glass how do you feel 
 
 dumbledore shook his head his eyes closed harry wondered whether he was in pain dumbledore plunged the glass blindly back into the basin refilled it and drank once more 
 
 in silence dumbledore drank three gobletsful of the potion then halfway through the fourth goblet he staggered and fell forward against the basin his eyes were still closed his breathing heavy 
 
 professor dumbledore said harry his voice strained can you hear me 
 
 dumbledore did not answer his face was twitching as though he was deeply asleep but dreaming a horrible dream his grip on the goblet was slackening the potion was about to spill from it harry reached forward and grasped the crystal cup holding it steady 
 
 professor can you hear me he repeated loudly his voice echoing around the cavern 
 
 dumbledore panted and then spoke in a voice harry did not recognize for he had never heard dumbledore frightened like this 
 
 i want make me 
 
 harry stared into the whitened face he knew so well at the crooked nose and spectacles and did not know what to do 
 
 like want to stop moaned dumbledore 
 
 you you stop professor said harry got to keep drinking remember you told me you had to keep drinking here 
 
 hating himself repulsed by what he was doing harry forced the goblet back toward mouth and tipped it so that dumbledore drank the remainder of the potion inside 
 
 no he groaned as harry lowered the goblet back into the basin and refilled it for him i want to i want to let me go 
 
 all right professor said harry his hand shaking all right here 
 
 make it stop make it stop moaned dumbledore 
 
 yes yes make it stop lied harry he tipped the contents of the goblet into open mouth dumbledore screamed the noise echoed all around the vast chamber across the dead black water 
 
 no no no no i i make me i want to 
 
 all right professor all right said harry loudly his hands shaking so badly he could hardly scoop up the sixth gobletful of potion the basin was now half empty happening to you safe it real i swear it realtake this now take this 
 
 and obediently dumbledore drank as though it was an antidote harry offered him but upon draining the goblet he sank to his knees shaking uncontrollably 
 
 all my fault all my fault he sobbed please make it stop i know i did wrong oh please make it stop and never never again 
 
 this will make it stop professor harry said his voice cracking as he tipped the seventh glass of potion into mouth 
 
 dumbledore began to cower as though invisible torturers surrounded him his flailing hand almost knocked the refilled goblet from trembling hands as he moaned hurt them hurt them please please my fault hurt me instead 
 
 here drink this drink this be all right said harry desperately and once again dumbledore obeyed him opening his mouth even as he kept his eyes tight shut and shook from head to foot 
 
 and now he fell forward screaming again hammering his fists upon the ground while harry filled the ninth goblet 
 
 please please please no not that not that do anything 
 
 just drink professor just drink 
 
 dumbledore drank like a child dying of thirst but when he had finished he yelled again as though his insides were on fire 
 
 no more please no more 
 
 harry scooped up a tenth gobletful of potion and felt the crystal scrape the bottom of the basin 
 
 nearly there professor drink this drink it 
 
 he supported shoulders and again dumbledore drained the glass then harry was on his feet once more refilling the goblet as dumbledore began to scream in more anguish than ever i want to die i want to die make it stop make it stop i want to die 
 
 drink this professor drink this 
 
 dumbledore drank and no sooner had he finished than he yelled kill me 
 
 thisthis one will gasped harry just drink this be over all over 
 
 dumbledore gulped at the goblet drained every last drop and then with a great rattling gasp rolled over onto his face 
 
 no shouted harry who had stood to refill the goblet again instead he dropped the cup into the basin flung himself down beside dumbledore and heaved him over onto his back glasses were askew his mouth agape his eyes closed no said harry shaking dumbledore no not dead you said it poison wake up wake uprennervate he cried his wand pointing at chest there was a flash of red light but nothing happened rennervatesirplease 
 
 eyelids flickered heart leapt 
 
 sir are you 
 
 water croaked dumbledore 
 
 water panted harry yes 
 
 he leapt to his feet and seized the goblet he had dropped in the basin he barely registered the golden locket lying curled beneath it 
 
 aguamenti he shouted jabbing the goblet with his wand 
 
 the goblet filled with clear water harry dropped to his knees beside dumbledore raised his head and brought the glass to his lipsbut it was empty dumbledore groaned and began to pant 
 
 but i had somewaitaguamenti said harry again pointing his wand at the goblet once more for a second clear water gleamed within it but as he approached mouth the water vanished again 
 
 sir trying trying said harry desperately but he did not think that dumbledore could hear him he had rolled onto his side and was drawing great rattling breaths that sounded agonizing aguamentiaguamentiaguamenti 
 
 the goblet filled and emptied once more and now breathing was fading his brain whirling in panic harry knew instinctively the only way left to get water because voldemort had planned it so 
 
 he flung himself over to the edge of the rock and plunged the goblet into the lake bringing it up full to the brim of icy water that did not vanish sirhere harry yelled and lunging forward he tipped the water clumsily over face 
 
 it was the best he could do for the icy feeling on his arm not holding the cup was not the lingering chill of the water a slimy white hand had gripped his wrist and the creature to whom it belonged was pulling him slowly backward across the rock the surface of the lake was no longer it was churning and everywhere harry looked white heads and hands were emerging from the dark water men and women and children with sunken sightless eyes were moving toward the rock an army of the dead rising from the black water 
 
 petrificus totalus yelled harry struggling to cling to the smooth soaked surface of the island as he pointed his wand at the inferius that had his arm it released him falling backward into the water with a splash he scrambled to his feet but many more inferi were already climbing onto the rock their bony hands clawing at its slippery surface their blank frosted eyes upon him trailing waterlogged rags sunken faces leering 
 
 petrificus totalus harry bellowed again backing away as he swiped his wand through the air six or seven of them crumpled but more were coming toward him impedimenta incarcerous 
 
 a few of them stumbled one or two of them bound in ropes but those climbing onto the rock behind them merely stepped over or on the fallen bodies still slashing at the air with his wand harry yelled sectumsempra sectumsempra 
 
 but though gashes appeared in their sodden rags and their icy skin they had no blood to spill they walked on unfeeling their shrunken hands outstretched toward him and as he backed away still farther he felt arms enclose him from behind thin fleshless arms cold as death and his feet left the ground as they lifted him and began to carry him slowly and surely back to the water and he knew there would be no release that he would be drowned and become one more dead guardian of a fragment of shattered soul 
 
 but then through the darkness fire erupted crimson and gold a ring of fire that surrounded the rock so that the inferi holding harry so tightly stumbled and faltered they did not dare pass through the flames to get to the water they dropped harry he hit the ground slipped on the rock and fell grazing his arms then scrambled back up raising his wand and staring around 
 
 dumbledore was on his feet again pale as any of the surrounding inferi but taller than any too the fire dancing in his eyes his wand was raised like a torch and from its tip emanated the flames like a vast lasso encircling them all with warmth 
 
 the inferi bumped into each other attempting blindly to escape the fire in which they were enclosed 
 
 dumbledore scooped the locket from the bottom of the stone basin and stowed it inside his robes wordlessly he gestured to harry to come to his side distracted by the flames the inferi seemed unaware that their quarry was leaving as dumbledore led harry back to the boat the ring of fire moving with them around them the bewildered inferi accompanying them to the waters edge where they slipped gratefully back into their dark waters 
 
 harry who was shaking all over thought for a moment that dumbledore might not be able to climb into the boat he staggered a little as he attempted it all his efforts seemed to be going into maintaining the ring of protective flame around them harry seized him and helped him back to his seat once they were both safely jammed inside again the boat began to move back across the black water away from the rock still encircled by that ring of fire and it seemed that the inferi swarming below them did not dare resurface 
 
 sir panted harry sir i forgotabout firethey were coming at me and i panicked 
 
 quite understandable murmured dumbledore harry was alarmed to hear how faint his voice was 
 
 they reached the bank with a little bump and harry leapt out then turned quickly to help dumbledore the moment that dumbledore reached the bank he let his wand hand fall the ring of fire vanished but the inferi did not emerge again from the water the little boat sank into the water once more clanking and tinkling its chain slithered back into the lake too dumbledore gave a great sigh and leaned against the cavern wall 
 
 i am weak he said 
 
 worry sir said harry at once anxious about extreme pallor and by his air of exhaustion worry get us back lean on me sir 
 
 and pulling uninjured arm around his shoulders harry guided his headmaster back around the lake bearing most of his weight 
 
 the protection was after all said dumbledore faintly one alone could not have done it you did well very well harry 
 
 talk now said harry fearing how slurred voice had become how much his feet dragged save your energy sir soon be out of here 
 
 the archway will have sealed again my knife 
 
 no need i got cut on the rock said harry firmly just tell me where 
 
 here 
 
 harry wiped his grazed forearm upon the stone having received its tribute of blood the archway reopened instantly they crossed the outer cave and harry helped dumbledore back into the icy seawater that filled the crevice in the cliff 
 
 going to be all right sir harry said over and over again more worried by silence than he had been by his weakened voice nearly there i can apparate us both back worry 
 
 i am not worried harry said dumbledore his voice a little stronger despite the freezing water i am with you

lionfish nov chapter gringottscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 their plans were made their preparations complete in the smallest bedroom a single long coarse black hair plucked from the sweater hermione had been wearing at malfoy manor lay curled in a small glass phial on the mantelpiece 
 
 and youll be using her actual wand said harry nodding toward the walnut wand so i reckon youll be pretty convincing 
 
 hermione looked frightened that the wand might sting or bit her as she picked it up 
 
 i hate that thing she said in a low voice i really hate it it feels all wrong it doesnt work properly for me its like a bit of her 
 
 harry could not help but remember how hermione has dismissed his loathing of the blackthorn wand insisting that he was imagining things when it did not work as well as his own telling him to simply practice he chose not to repeat her own advice back to her however the eve of their attempted assault on gringotts felt like the wrong moment to antagonize her 
 
 itll probably help you get in character though said ron think what that wands done 
 
 but thats my point said hermione this is the wand that tortured nevilles mum and dad and who knows how many other people this is the wand that killed sirius 
 
 harry had not thought of that he looked down at the wand and was visited by a brutal urge to snap it to slice it in half with gryffindors sword which was propped against the wall beside him 
 
 i miss my wand hermione said miserably i wish mr ollivander could have made me another one too 
 
 mr ollivander had sent luna a new wand that morning she was out on the back lawn at that moment testing its capabilities in the late afternoon sun dean who had lost his wand to the snatchers was watching rather gloomily 
 
 harry looked down at the hawthorn wand that had once belonged to draco malfoy he had been surprised but pleased to discover that it worked for him at least as well as hermiones had done remembering what ollivander had told them of the secret workings of wands harry thought he knew what hermiones problem was she had not won the walnut wands allegiance by taking it personally from bellatrix 
 
 the door of the bedroom opened and griphook entered harry reached instinctively for the hilt of the sword and drew it close to him but regretted his action at once he could tell that the goblin had noticed seeking to gloss over the sticky moment he said weve just been checking the stuff griphook weve told bill and fleur were leaving tomorrow and weve told them not to get up to see us off 
 
 they had been firm on this point because hermione would need to transform in bellatrix before they left and the less that bill and fleur knew or suspected about what they were about to do the better they had also explained that they would not be returning as they had lost perkins old tent on the night that the snatchers caught them bill had lent them another one it was now packed inside the beaded bag which harry was impressed to learn hermione had protected from the snatchers by the simple expedient of stuffing it down her sock 
 
 though he would miss bill fleur luna and dean not to mention the home comforts they had enjoyed over the last few weeks harry was looking forward to escaping the confinement of shell cottage he was tired of trying to make sure that they were not overheard tired of being shut in the tiny dark bedroom most of all he longed to be rid of griphook however precisely how and when they were to part from the goblin without handing over gryffindors sword remained a question to which harry had no answer it had been impossible to decide how they were going to do it because the goblin rarely left harry ron and hermione alone together for more than five minutes at a time he could give my mother lessons growled ron as the goblins long fingers kept appearing around the edges of doors with bills warning in mind harry could not help suspecting that griphook was on the watch for possible skullduggery hermione disapproved so heartily of the planned that harry had given up attempting to pick her brains on how best to do it ron on the rare occasions that they had been able to snatch a few moments had come up with nothing better than well just have to wing it mate 
 
 harry slept badly that night lying away in the early hours he thought back to the way he had felt the night before they had infiltrated the ministry of magic and remembered a determination almost an excitement now he was experiencing jolts of anxiety nagging doubts he could not shake off the fear that it was all going to go wrong he kept telling himself that their plan was good that griphook knew what they were facing that they were for all the difficulties they were likely to encounter yet still he felt uneasy once or twice he heard ron stir and was sure that he too was awake but they were sharing the sitting room with dean so harry did not speak 
 
 it was a relief when six arrived and they could slip out of their sleeping bags dress in the semidarkness then creep out into the garden where they were to meet hermione and griphook the dawn was chilly but there was little wind now that it was may harry looked up at the stars still glimmering palely in the dark sky and listened to the sea washing backward and forward against the cliff he was going to miss the sound 
 
 small green shoots were forcing their way up through the red earth of dobbys grave now in a years time the mound would be covered in flowers the white stone that bore the elfs name had already acquired a weathered look he realized now that they could hardly have laid dobby to rest in a more beautiful place but harry ached with sadness to think of leaving him behind looking down on the grave he wondered yet again how the elf had known where to come to rescue them his fingers moved absentmindedly to the little pouch still strung around his neck thorough which he could feel the jagged mirror fragment in which he had been sure he had seen dumbledores eye then the sound of a door opening made him look around 
 
 bellatrix lestrange was striding across the lawn toward them accompanied by griphook as she walked she was tucking the small beaded bag into the inside pocket of another set of the old robes they had taken from grimmauld place though harry knew perfectly well that it was really hermione he could not suppress a shiver of loathing she was taller than he was her long black hair rippling down her back her heavily lidded eyes disdainful as they rested upon him but then she spoke and he heard hermione through bellatrixs low voice 
 
 she tasted disgusting worse than gurdyroots okay ron come here so i can do you 
 
 right but remember i dont like the beard too long 
 
 oh for heavens sake this isnt about looking handsome 
 
 its not that it gets in the way but i liked my nose a bit shorter try and do it the way you did last time 
 
 hermione sighed and set to work muttering under her breath as she transformed various aspects of rons appearance he was to be given a completely fake identity and they were trusting to the malevolent aura cast by bellatrix to protect him meanwhile harry and griphook were to be concealed under the invisibility cloak 
 
 there said hermione how does he look harry 
 
 it was just not possible to discern ron under his disguise but only harry thought because he knew him so well rons hair was now long and wavy he had a thick brown beard and mustache no freckles a short broad nose and heavy eyebrows 
 
 well hes not my type but hell do said harry shall we go then 
 
 all three of them glanced back at shell cottage lying dark and silent under the fading stars then turned and began to walk toward the point just beyond the boundary wall where the fidelius chard stopped working and they would be able to disapparate once past the gate griphook spoke 
 
 i should climb up now harry potter i think 
 
 harry bent down and the goblin clambered onto his back his hands linked on front of harrys throat he was not heavy but harry disliked the feeling of the goblin and the surprising strength with which he clung on hermione pulled the invisibility cloak out of the beaded bag and threw it over them both 
 
 perfect she said bending down to check harrys feet i cant see a thing lets go 
 
 harry turned on the spot with griphook on his shoulders concentrating with all his might on the leaky cauldron the inn that was the entrance to diagon alley the goblin clung even tighter as they moved into the compressing darkness and seconds later harrys feet found pavement and he opened his eyes on charing cross road muggles bustled past wearing the hangdog expressions of early morning quite unconscious of the little inns existence 
 
 the bar of the leaky cauldron was nearly deserted ton the stooped and toothless landlord was polishing glasses behind the bar counter a couple of warlocks having a muttered conversation in the far corner glanced at hermione and drew back into the shadows 
 
 madam lestrange murmured tom and as hermione paused he inclined his head subserviently 
 
 good morning said hermione and as harry crept past still carrying griphook piggyback under the cloak he saw tom look surprised 
 
 too polite harry whispered in hermiones ear as they passed out of the inn into the tiny backyard you need to treat people like theyre scum 
 
 okay okay 
 
 hermione drew out bellatrixs wand and rapped a brick in the nondescript wall in front of them at once the bricks began to whirl and spin a hole appeared in the middle of them which grew wider and wider finally forming an archway onto the narrow cobbled street that was diagon alley 
 
 it was quiet barely time for the shops to open and there were hardly and shoppers abroad the crooked cobbled street was much altered now from the bustling place harry had visited before his first team at hogwarts so many years before more shops than ever were boarded up though several new establishments dedicated to the dark arts had been created since his last visit harrys own face glared down at him from posters plastered over many windows always captioned with the words undesirable number one 
 
 a number of ragged people sat huddled in doorways he heard them moaning to the few passersby pleading for gold insisting that they were really wizards one man had a bloody bandage over his eye 
 
 as they set off along the street the beggars glimpsed hermione they seemed to melt away before her drawing hoods over their faces and fleeing as fast as they could hermione looked after them curiously until the man with the bloodied bandage came staggering right across her path 
 
 my children he bellowed pointing at her his voice was cracked he sounded distraught where are my children what has he done with them you know you know 
 
 ici reallyc stammered hermione 
 
 the man lunged at her reaching for her throat then with a bang and a burst of red light he was thrown backward onto the ground unconscious ron stood there his wand still outstretched and a look of shock visible behind his beard faces appeared at the windows on either side of the street while a little knot of passerby gathered their robes about them and broke into gentle trots keen to vacate the scene their entrance into diagon alley could hardly have been more conspicuous for a moment harry wondered whether it might not be better to leave now and try to think of a different plan before they could move or consult one another however they heard a cry from behind them 
 
 why madam lestrange 
 
 harry whirled around and griphook tightened his hold around harrys neck a tall think wizard with a crown of bushy gray hair and a long sharp nose was striding toward them 
 
 its travers hissed the goblin into harrys ear but at that moment harry could not think who travers was hermione had drawn herself up to full height and said with as much contempt as she could muster 
 
 and what do you want 
 
 travers stopped in his tracks clearly affronted 
 
 hes another death eater breathed griphook and harry sidled sideways to repeat the information into hermiones ear 
 
 i merely sought to greet you said travers coolly but if my presence is not welcome 
 
 harry recognized his voice now travers was one of the death eaters who had been summoned to xenophiliuss house 
 
 no no not at all travers said hermione quickly trying to cover up her mistake how are you 
 
 well i confess i am surprised to see you out and about bellatrix 
 
 really why asked hermione 
 
 well travers coughed i heard that the inhabitants of malfoy manor were confined to the house after the ah escape 
 
 harry willed hermione to keep her head if this was true and bellatrix was not supposed to be out in publicc the dark lord forgives those who have served him most faithfully in the past said hermione in a magnificent imitation of bellatrixs most contemptuous manner perhaps your credit is not as good with him as mine is travers 
 
 though the death eater looked offended he also seemed less suspicious he glanced down at the man ron had just stunned 
 
 how did it offend you 
 
 it does not matter it will not do so again said hermione coolly 
 
 some of these wandless can be troublesome said travers while they do nothing but beg i have no objection but one of them actually asked me to plead her case in the ministry last week im a witch sir im a witch let me prove it to you he said in a squeaky impersonation as if i was going to give her my wandcbut whose wand said travers curiously are you using at the moment bellatrix i heard that your own wasc 
 
 i have my wand here said hermione coldly holding up bellatrixs wand i dont know what rumors you have been listening to travers but you seem sadly misinformed 
 
 travers seemed a little taken aback at that and he turned instead to ron 
 
 who is your friend i do not recognize him 
 
 this is dragomir despard said hermione they had decided that a fictional foreigner was the safest cover for ron to assume he speaks very little english but he is in sympathy with the dark lords aims he has traveled here from transylvania to see our new regime 
 
 indeed how do you do dragomir 
 
 ow you said ron holding out his hand 
 
 travers extended two fingers and shook rons hand as though frightened of dirtying himself 
 
 so what brings you and yourcahcsympathetic friend to diagon alley this early asked travers 
 
 i need to visit gringotts said hermione 
 
 alas i also said travers gold filthy gold we cannot live without it yet i confess i deplore the necessity of consorting with our friends 
 
 harry felt griphooks clasped hands tighten momentarily around his neck 
 
 shall we said travers gesturing hermione forward 
 
 hermione had no choice but to fall into step beside him and head along the crooked cobbled street toward the place where the gringotts stood towering over the other little shops ron sloped along beside them and harry and griphook followed 
 
 a watchful death eater was the very last thing they needed and the worst of it was with travers matching at what he believed to be bellatrixs side there was no means for harry to communicate with hermione or ron all too soon they arrived at the foot of the marble steps leading up to the great bronze doors as griphook had already warned them the liveried goblins who usually flanked the entrance had been replaced by two wizards both of whom were clutching long thin golden rods 
 
 ah probity probes signed travers theatrically so crudecbut so effective 
 
 and he set off up the steps nodding left and right to the wizards who raised the golden rods and passed them up and down his body the probes harry knew detected spells of concealment and hidden magical objects knowing that he had only seconds harry pointed dracos wand at each of the guards in turn and murmured confundo twice unnoticed by travers who was looking through the bronze doors at the inner hall each of the guards gave a little start as the spells hit them 
 
 hermiones long black hair rippled behind her as she climbed the steps 
 
 one moment madam said the guard raising his probe 
 
 but youve just done that said hermione in bellatrixs commanding arrogant voice travers looked around eyebrows raised the guard was confused he stared down at the thin golden probe and then at his companion who said in a slightly dazed voice yeah youve just checked them marius 
 
 hermione swept forward ron by her side harry and griphook trotting invisibly behind them harry glanced back as they crossed the threshold the wizards were both scratching their heads 
 
 two goblins stood before the inner doors which were made of silver and which carried the poem warning of dire retribution to potential thieves harry looked up at it and all of a sudden a memory came to him standing on this very spot on the day that he had turned eleven the most wonderful birthday of his life and hagrid standing beside him saying like i said yehd be mad ter try an rob it gringotts had seemed a place of wonder that day the enchanted repository of a trove of gold he had never known he possessed and never for an instant could he have dreamed that he would return to steal but within seconds they were standing in the vast marble hall of the bank 
 
 the long counter was manned by goblins sitting on high stools serving the first customers of the day hermione ron and travers headed toward an old goblin who was examining a thick gold coin through an eyeglass hermione allowed travers to step ahead of her on the pretext of explaining features of the hall to ron 
 
 the goblin tossed the coin he was holding aside said to nobody in particular leprechaun and then greeted travers who passed over a tiny golden key which was examined and given back to him 
 
 hermione stepped forward 
 
 madam lestrange said the goblin evidently startled dear me howchow may i help you today 
 
 i wish to enter my vault said hermione 
 
 the old goblin seemed to recoil a little harry glanced around not only was travers hanging back watching but several other goblins had looked up from their work to stare at hermione 
 
 you have identification asked the goblin 
 
 identification ici have never been asked for identification before said hermione 
 
 they know whispered griphook in harrys ear they must have been warned there might be an imposter 
 
 your wand will do madam said the goblin he held out a slightly trembling hand and in a dreadful blast of realization harry knew that the goblins of gringotts were aware that bellatrixs wand had been stolen 
 
 act now act now whispered griphook in harrys ear the imperious curse 
 
 harry raised the hawthorn wand beneath the cloak pointed it at the old goblin and whispered for the first time in his life imperio 
 
 a curious sensation shot down harrys arm a feeling of tingling warmth that seemed to flow from his mind down the sinews and veins connecting him to the wand and the curse it had just cast the goblin took bellatrixs wand examined it closely and then said ah you have had a new wand made madam lestrange 
 
 what said hermione no no thats minec 
 
 a new wand said travers approaching the counter again still the goblins all around were watching but how could you have done which wandmaker did you use 
 
 harry acted without thinking pointing his wand at travers he muttered imperio once more 
 
 oh yes i see said travers looking down at bellatrixs wand yes very handsome and is it working well i always think wands require a little breaking in dont you 
 
 hermione looked utterly bewildered but to harrys enormous relief she accepted the bizarre turn of events without comment 
 
 the old goblin behind the counter clapped his hands and a younger goblin approached 
 
 i shall need the clankers he told the goblin who dashed away and returned a moment later with a leather bag that seemed to be full of jangling metal which he handed to his senior good good s if you will follow me madam lestrange said the old goblin hopping down off his stool and vanishing from sight i shall take you to your vault 
 
 he appeared around the end of the counter jogging happily toward them the contents of the leather bag still jingling travers was now standing quite still with his mouth hanging wide open ron was drawing attention to this odd phenomenon by regarding travers with confusion 
 
 wait c bogrod 
 
 another goblin came scurrying around the counter 
 
 we have instructions he said with a bow to hermione forgive me madam but there have been special orders regarding the vault of lestrange 
 
 he whispered urgently in bogrods ear but the imperiused goblin shook him off 
 
 i am aware of the instructions madam lestrange wishes to visit her vault very old family old clients this way please 
 
 and still clanking he hurried toward one of the many doors leading off the hall harry looked back at travers who was still rooted to the spot looking abnormally vacant and made his decision with a flick of his wand he made travers come with them walking meekly in their wake as they reached the door and passed into the rough stone passageway beyond which was lit with flaming torches 
 
 were in trouble they suspect said harry as the door slammed behind them and he pulled off the invisibility cloak griphook jumped down from his shoulders neither travers nor bogrod showed the slightest surprise at the sudden appearance of harry potter in their midst theyre imperiused he added in response to hermione and rons confused queries about travers and bogrod who were both now standing there looking blank i dont think i did it strongly enough i dont know 
 
 and another memory darted through his mind of the real bellatrix lestrange shrieking at him when he had first tried to use an unforgivable curse you need to mean them potter 
 
 what do we do asked ron shall we get out now while we can 
 
 if we can said hermione looking back toward the door into the main hall beyond which who knew what was happening 
 
 weve got this far i say we go on said harry 
 
 good said griphook so we need bogrod to control the cart i no long have the authority but there will not be room for the wizard 
 
 harry pointed his wand at travers 
 
 imperio 
 
 the wizard turned and set off along the dark track at a smart pace 
 
 what are you making him do 
 
 hide said harry as he pointed his wand at bogrod who whistled to summon a little cart that came trundling along the tracks toward them out of the darkness harry was sure he could hear shouting behind them in the main hall as they all clambered into it bogrod in front of griphook harry ron and hermione crammed together in the back 
 
 with a jerk the cart moved off gathering speed they hurried past travers who was wriggling into a crack in the wall then the cart began twisting and turning through the labyrinthine passages sloping downward all the time harry could not hear anything over the rattling of the cart on the tracks his hair flew behind him as they swerved between stalactites flying ever deeper into the earth but he kept glancing back they might as well have left enormous footprints behind them the more he thought about it the more foolish it seemed to have disguised hermione as bellatrix to have brought along bellatrixs wand when the death eaters knew who had stolen it c 
 
 there were a deeper than harry had ever penetrated within gringotts they took a hairpin bend at speed and saw ahead of them with seconds to spare a waterfall pounding over the track harry heard griphook shout no but there was no braking they zoomed through it water filled harrys eyes and mouth he could not see or breathe then with an awful lurch the cart flipped over and they were all thrown out of it harry heard the cart smash into pieces against the passage wall heard hermione shriek something and felt himself glide back toward the ground as though weightless landing painlessly on the rocky passage floor 
 
 charm hermione spluttered as ron pulled her to her feet but to harrys horror he saw that she was no longer bellatrix instead she stood there in overlarge robes sopping wet and completely herself ron was and beardless again they were realizing it as they looked at each other feeling their own faces 
 
 the thiefs downfall said griphook clambering to his feet and looking back the deluge onto the tracks which harry knew now had been more than water it washes away all enchantment all magical concealment they know there are imposers in gringotts they have set off defenses against us 
 
 harry saw hermione checking that she still had the beaded bag and hurriedly thrust his own hand under his jacket to make sure he had not lost the invisibility cloak then he turned to see bogrod shaking his head in bewilderment the thiefs downfall seemed to have lifted his imperius curse 
 
 we need him said griphook we cannot enter the vault without a gringotts goblin and we need the clankers 
 
 imperio harry said again his voice echoed through the stone passage as he felt again the sense of heady control that flowed from brain to wand bogrod submitted once more to his will his befuddled expression changing to one of polite indifference as ron hurried to pick up the leather bag of metal tools 
 
 harry i think i can hear people coming said hermione and she pointed bellatrixs wand at the waterfall and cried protego they saw the shield charm break the flow of enchanted water as it flew up the passageway 
 
 good thinking said harry lead the way griphook 
 
 how are we going to get out again ron asked as they hurried on foot into the darkness after the goblin bogrod panting in their wake like an old dog 
 
 lets worry about that when we have to said harry he was trying to listen he thought he could hear something clanking and moving around nearby griphook how much farther 
 
 not far harry potter not far 
 
 and they turned a corner and saw the thing for which harry had been prepared but which still brought all of them to a halt 
 
 a gigantic dragon was tethered to the ground in front of them barring access to four or five of the deepest vaults in the place the beasts scales had turned pale and flaky during its long incarceration under the ground its eyes were milkily pink both rear legs bore heavy cuffs from which chains led to enormous pegs driven deep into the rocky floor its great spiked wings folded close to its body would have filled the chamber if it spread them and when it turned its ugly head toward them it roared with a noise that made the rock tremble opened its mouth and spat a jet of fire that sent them running back up the passageway 
 
 it is partially blind panted griphook but even more savage for that however we have the means to control it it has learned what to expect when the clankers come give them to me 
 
 ron passed the bag to griphook and the goblin pulled out a number of small metal instruments that when shaken made a long ringing noise like miniature hammers on anvils griphook handed them out bogrod accepted his meekly 
 
 you know what to do griphook told harry ron and hermione it will expect pain when it hears the noise it will retreat and bogrod must place his palm upon the door of the vault 
 
 they advanced around the corner again shaking the clankers and the noise echoed off the rocky walls grossly magnified so that the inside of harrys skull seemed to vibrate with the den the dragon let out another hoarse roar then retreated harry could see it trembling and as they drew nearer he saw the scars made by vicious slashes across its face and guess that it had been taught to fear hot swords when it heard the sound of the clankers 
 
 make him press his hand to the door griphook urged harry who turned his wand again upon bogrod the old goblin obeyed pressing his palm to the wood and the door of the vault melted away to reveal a cavelike opening crammed from floor to ceiling with golden coins and goblets silver armor the skins of strange creatures c some with long spines other with drooping wings c potions in jeweled flasks and a skull still wearing a crown search fast said harry as they all hurried inside the vault he had described hufflepuffs cap to ron and hermione but if it was the other unknown horcrux that resided in this vault he did not know what it looked like he barely had time to glance around however before there was a muffled clunk from behind them the door had reappeared sealing them inside the vault and they were plunged into total darkness 
 
 no matter bogrod will be able to release us said griphook as ron gave a shout of surprise light your wands cant you and hurry we have little time 
 
 lumos 
 
 harry shone his lit wand around the vault its beam fell upon glittering jewels he saw the fake sword of gryffindor lying on a high shelf amongst a jumble of chains ron and hermione had lit their wands too and were now examining the piles of objects surrounding them 
 
 harry could this be c aargh 
 
 hermione screamed in pain and harry turned his wand on her in time to see a jeweled goblet tumbling from her grip but as it fell it split became a shower of goblets so that a second later with a great clatter the floor was covered in identical cups rolling in every direction the original impossible to discern amongst them 
 
 it burned me moaned hermione sucking her blistered fingers 
 
 they have added germino and flagrante curses said griphook 
 
 everything you touch will burn and multiply but the copies are worthless c and if you continue to handle the treasure you will eventually be crushed to death by the weight of expanding gold 
 
 okay dont touch anything said harry desperately but even as he said it ron accidentally nudged one of the fallen goblets with his foot and twenty more exploded into being while ron hopped on the spot part of his shoe burned away by contact with the hot metal 
 
 stand still dont move said hermione clutching at ron 
 
 just look around said harry remember the cups small and gold its got a badger engraved on it two handles c otherwise see if you can spot ravenclaws symbol anywhere the eagle c 
 
 they directed their wands into every nook and crevice turning cautiously on the spot it was impossible not to brush up against anything harry sent a great cascade of fake galleons onto the ground where they joined the goblets and now there was scarcely room to place their feet and the glowing gold blazed with heat so that the vault felt like a furnace harrys wandlight passed over shields and helmets set on shelves rising to the ceiling higher and higher he raised the beam until suddenly it found an object that made his heart skip and his hand tremble 
 
 its there its up there 
 
 ron and hermione pointed there wands at it too so that the little golden cup sparkled in a spotlight the cup that had belonged to helga hufflepuff which had passed into the possession of hepzibah smith from whom it had been stolen by tom riddle 
 
 and how the hell are we going to get up there without touching anything asked ron 
 
 accio cup cried hermione who had evidently forgotten in her desperation what griphook had told them during their planning sessions 
 
 no use no use snarled the goblin 
 
 then what do we do said harry glaring at the goblin if you want the sword griphook then youll have to help us more than c wait can i touch stuff with the sword hermione give it here 
 
 hermione fumbled insider her robes drew out a beaded bag rummaged for a few seconds then removed the shining sword harry seized it by its rubied hilt and touched the tip of the blade to a silver flagon nearby which did not multiply 
 
 if i can just poke the sword through a handle c but how am i going to get up there 
 
 the shelf on which the cup reposed was out of reach for any of them even ron who was tallest the heat from the enchanted treasure rose in waves and sweat ran down harrys face and back as he struggled to think of a way up to the cup and then he heard the dragon roar on the other side of the vault door and the sound of clanking growing louder and louder 
 
 they were truly trapped now there was no way out except through the door and a horde of goblins seemed to be approaching on the other side harry looked at ron and hermione and saw terror in their faces 
 
 hermione said harry as the clanking grew louder ive got to get up there weve got to get rid of it c 
 
 she raised her wand pointed it at harry and whispered levicorpus 
 
 hoisted into the air by his ankle harry hit a suit of armor and replicas burst out of it like bodies filling the cramped space with screams of pain ron hermione and the two goblins were knocked aside into other objects which also began to replicate half buried in a rising tide of treasure they struggled and yelled has harry thrust the sword through the handle of hufflepuffs cup hooking it onto the blade 
 
 impervius screeched hermione in an attempt to protect herself ron and the goblins from the burning metal 
 
 then the worst scream yet made harry look down ron and hermione were waist deep in treasure struggling to keep bogrod from slipping beneath the rising tide but griphook had sunk out of sight and nothing but the tips of a few long fingers were left in view 
 
 harry seized griphooks fingers and pulled the blistered goblin emerged by degrees howling 
 
 liberatocorpus yelled harry and with a crash he and griphook landed on the surface of the swelling treasure and the sword flew out of harrys hand 
 
 get it harry yelled fighting the pain of the hot metal on his skin as griphook clambered onto his shoulders again determined to avoid the swelling mass of objects wheres the sword it had the cup on it 
 
 the clanking on the other side of the door was growing deafening c it was too late c 
 
 there 
 
 it was griphook who had seen it and griphook who lunged and in that instant harry knew that the goblin had never expected them to keep their word one hand holding tightly to a fistful of harrys hair to make sure he did not fall into the heaving sea of burning gold griphook seized the hilt of the sword and swung it high out of harrys reach the tiny golden cup skewered by the handle on the swords blade was flung into the air the goblin astride him harry dived and caught it and although he could feel it scalding his flesh he did not relinquish it even while countless hufflepuff cups burst from his fist raining down upon him as the entrance of the vault opened up again and he found himself sliding uncontrollably on an expanding avalanche of fiery gold and silver that bore him ron hermione into the outer chamber 
 
 hardly aware of the pain from the burns covering his body and still borne along the swell of replicating treasure harry shoved the cup into his pocket and reached up to retrieve the sword but griphook was gone sliding from harrys shoulders the moment he could he had sprinted for cover amongst the surrounding goblins brandishing the sword and crying thieves thieves help thieves he vanished into the midst of the advancing crowd all of whom were holding daggers and who accepted him without question 
 
 slipping on the hot metal harry struggled to his feet and knew that the only way out was through 
 
 stupefy he bellowed and ron and hermione joined in jets of red light flew into the crowd of goblins and some toppled over but others advanced and harry saw several wizard guards running around the corner 
 
 the tethered dragon let out a roar and a gush of flame flew over the goblins the wizards fled back the way they had come and inspiration or madness came to harry pointing his wand at the thick cuffs chaining the beast to the floor he yelled relashio 
 
 the cuffs broken open with loud bangs 
 
 this way harry yelled and still shooting stunning spells at the advancing goblins he sprinted toward the blind dragon 
 
 harry c harry c what are you doing cried hermione 
 
 get up climb up come on c 
 
 the dragon had not realized that it was free harrys foot found the crook of its hind leg and he pulled himself up onto its back the scales were hard as steel it did not even seem to feel him he stretched out an arm hermione hoisted herself up ron climbed on behind them and a second later the dragon became aware that it was untethered 
 
 with a roar it reared harry dug in his knees clutching as tightly as he could to the jagged scales as the wings opened knocking the shrieking goblins aside like skittles and it soared into the air harry ron and hermione flat on its back scraped against the ceiling as it dived toward the passage opening while the pursuing goblins hurled daggers that glanced off its flanks 
 
 well never get out its too big hermione screamed but the dragon opened its mouth and belched flame again blasting the tunnel whose floors and ceiling cracked and crumbled by sheer force the dragon clawed and fought its way through harrys eyes were shut tight against the heat and dust deafened by the crash of rock and the dragons roars he could only cling to its back expecting to be shaken off at any moment then he heard hermione yelling defodio 
 
 she was helping the dragon enlarge the passageway carving out the ceiling as it struggled upward toward the fresher air away from the shrieking and clanking goblins harry and ron copied her blasting the ceiling apart with more gouging spells they passed the underground lake and the great crawling snarling beast seemed to sense freedom and space ahead of it and behind them the passage was full of the dragons thrashing spiked tail of great lumps of rock gigantic fractured stalactites and the clanking of the goblins seemed to be growing more muffled while ahead the dragons fire kept their progress clear c 
 
 and then at last by the combined force of their spells and the dragons brute strength they had blasted their way out of the passage into the marble hallway goblins and wizards shrieked and ran for cover and finally the dragon had room to stretch its wings turning its horned head toward the cool outside air it could smell beyond the entrance it took off and with harry ron and hermione still clinging to its back it forced its way through the metal doors leaving them buckled and hanging from their hinges as it staggered into diagon alley and launched itself into the sky

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 our aunt 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 you ought to have known our aunt she was charming that is to 
 say she was not charming at all as the word is usually understood 
 but she was good and kind amusing in her way and was just as any one ought to be whom people are to talk about and to laugh at she might have been put into a play and wholly and solely on account of the fact that she only lived for the theatre and for what was done 
 there she was an honorable matron but agent fabs whom she used to call flabs declared that our aunt was 
 
 the theatre is my school said she the source of my knowledge 
 from thence i have resuscitated biblical history now moses and 
 joseph in egypt there are operas for you i get my universal 
 history from the theatre my geography and my knowledge of men out of the french pieces i get to know life in paris slippery but 
 exceedingly interesting how i have cried over la famille 
 roquebourg that the man must drink himself to death so that she may marry the young fellow yes how many tears i have wept in the fifty years i have subscribed to the theatre 
 
 our aunt knew every acting play every bit of scenery every 
 character every one who appeared or had appeared she seemed really only to live during the nine months the theatre was open summertime without a summer theatre seemed to be only a time that made her old while on the other hand a theatrical evening that lasted till midnight was a lengthening of her life she did not say as other 
 people do now we shall have spring the stork is here or 
 advertised the first strawberries in the papers she on the 
 contrary used to announce the coming of autumn with have you 
 heard selling boxes for the theatre now the performances will 
 begin 
 
 she used to value a lodging entirely according to its proximity to 
 the theatre it was a real sorrow to her when she had to leave the 
 little lane behind the playhouse and move into the great street 
 that lay a little farther off and live there in a house where she had 
 no opposite neighbors 
 
 at home said she my windows must be my one 
 cannot sit and look into self till tired one must see 
 people but now i live just as if go into the country if i want 
 to see human beings i must go into my kitchen and sit down on the 
 sink for there only i have opposite neighbors no when i lived in my 
 dear little lane i could look straight down into the 
 shop and had only three hundred paces to the theatre and now 
 three thousand paces to go military measurement 
 
 our aunt was sometimes ill but however unwell she might feel she 
 never missed the play the doctor prescribed one day that she should 
 put her feet in a bran bath and she followed his advice but she 
 drove to the theatre all the same and sat with her feet in bran 
 there if she had died there she would have been very glad 
 
 thorwaldsen died in the theatre and she called that a happy death 
 she could not imagine but that in heaven there must be a theatre 
 too it had not indeed been promised us but we might very well 
 imagine it the many distinguished actors and actresses who had passed away must surely have a field for their talent 
 
 our aunt had an electric wire from the theatre to her room a 
 telegram used to be dispatched to her at and it used to 
 consist of the words herr sivertsen is at the machinery for it was 
 he who gave the signal for drawing the curtain up and down and for 
 changing the scenes 
 
 from him she used to receive a short and concise description of 
 every piece his opinion of tempest was mad 
 nonsense so much to put up and the first scene begins with 
 water to the front of the wings that is to say the water had to 
 come forward so far but when on the other hand the same interior 
 scene remained through five acts he used to pronounce it a 
 sensible play a resting play which performed itself 
 without putting up scenes 
 
 in earlier times by which name our aunt used to designate 
 thirty years ago she and the herr sivertsen had been younger at that time he had already been connected with the 
 machinery and was as she said her benefactor it used to be the 
 custom in those days that in the evening performances in the only 
 theatre the town possessed spectators were admitted to the part 
 called the flies over the stage and every machinist had one or two 
 places to give away often the flies were quite full of good 
 company it was said that generals wives and privy councillors wives 
 had been up there it was quite interesting to look down behind the 
 scenes and to see how the people walked to and fro on the stage 
 when the curtain was down 
 
 our aunt had been there several times as well when there was a 
 tragedy as when there was a ballet for the pieces in which there were 
 the greatest number of characters on the stage were the most 
 interesting to see from the flies one sat pretty much in the dark 
 up there and most people took their supper up with them once three 
 apples and a great piece of bread and butter and sausage fell down 
 right into the dungeon of ugolino where that unhappy man was to be 
 starved to death and there was great laughter among the audience 
 the sausage was one of the weightiest reasons why the worthy management refused in future to have any spectators up in the flies 
 
 but i was there times said our aunt and i 
 shall always remember mr sivertsen for that 
 
 on the very last evening when the flies were still open to the 
 public the judgment of solomon was performed as our aunt 
 remembered very well she had through the influence of her 
 benefactor herr sivertsen procured a free admission for the agent 
 fabs although he did not deserve it in the least for he was always 
 cutting his jokes about the theatre and teasing our aunt but she 
 had procured him a free admission to the flies for all that he 
 wanted to look at this from the other side 
 
 those were his own words and they were just like him said 
 our aunt 
 
 he looked down from above on the judgment of solomon and fell 
 asleep over it one would have thought that he had come from a 
 dinner where many toasts had been given he went to sleep and was 
 locked in and there he sat through the dark night in the flies and 
 when he woke he told a story but our aunt would not believe it 
 the judgment of solomon was over he said and all the people 
 had gone away up stairs and down stairs but now the real play began the which was the best of all said the agent then life came into the affair it was not the judgment of solomon that was performed no a real court of judgment was held upon the 
 stage and agent fabs had the impudence to try and make our aunt 
 believe all this that was the thanks she got for having got him a 
 place in the flies 
 
 what did the agent say why it was curious enough to hear but 
 there was malice and satire in it 
 
 it looked dark enough up there said the agent but then the 
 magic business began a great performance the judgment in the 
 theatre the were at their posts and every spectator had to show his ghostly that it might be decided if he was to be admitted with hands loose or bound and with or without a muzzle 
 
 grand people who came too late when the performance had begun and young people who could not always watch the time were tied up 
 outside and had list slippers put on their feet with which they were 
 allowed to go in before the beginning of the next act and they had 
 muzzles too and then the judgment on the stage began 
 
 all malice and not a bit of truth in it said our aunt 
 
 the painter who wanted to get to paradise had to go up a 
 staircase which he had himself painted but which no man could 
 mount that was to expiate his sins against perspective all the 
 plants and buildings which the had placed with infinite 
 pains in countries to which they did not belong the poor fellow 
 was obliged to put in their right places before cockcrow if he wanted 
 to get into paradise let herr fabs see how he would get in himself 
 but what he said of the performers tragedians and comedians 
 singers and dancers that was the most rascally of all mr fabs 
 indeed flabs he did not deserve to be admitted at all and our aunt 
 would not soil her lips with what he said and he said did flabs 
 that the whole was written down and it should be printed when he 
 was dead and buried but not before for he would not risk having 
 his arms and legs broken 
 
 once our aunt had been in fear and trembling in her temple of 
 happiness the theatre it was on a winter day one of those days in 
 which one has a couple of hours of daylight with a gray sky it was 
 terribly cold and snowy but aunt must go to the theatre a little 
 opera and a great ballet were performed and a prologue and an 
 epilogue into the bargain and that would last till late at night our 
 aunt must needs go so she borrowed a pair of fur boots of her lodger boots with fur inside and out and which reached far up her legs 
 
 she got to the theatre and to her box the boots were warm and 
 she kept them on suddenly there was a cry of fire smoke was coming from one of the side scenes and streamed down from the flies and there was a terrible panic the people came rushing out and our aunt was the last in the box on the second tier side for from there the scenery looks best she used to say the scenes are always arranged that they look best from the side aunt wanted to come out but the people before her in their fright and 
 heedlessness slammed the door of the box and there sat our aunt and get out and get in that is to say she 
 get into the next box for the partition was too high for her she 
 called out and no one heard her she looked down into the tier of 
 boxes below her and it was empty and low and looked quite near and aunt in her terror felt quite young and light she thought of 
 jumping down and had got one leg over the partition the other 
 resting on the bench there she sat astride as if on horseback 
 well wrapped up in her flowered cloak with one leg hanging out a 
 leg in a tremendous fur boot that was a sight to behold and when 
 it was beheld our aunt was heard too and was saved from burning for the theatre was not burned down 
 
 that was the most memorable evening of her life and she was 
 glad that she could not see herself for she would have died with 
 confusion 
 
 her benefactor in the machinery department herr sivertsen 
 visited her every sunday but it was a long time from sunday to 
 sunday in the latter time therefore she used to have in a little 
 child for the scraps that is to say to eat up the remains of the 
 dinner it was a child employed in the ballet one that certainly 
 wanted feeding the little one used to appear sometimes as an elf 
 sometimes as a page the most difficult part she had to play was the 
 hind leg in the magic flute but as she grew larger she could 
 represent the of the lion she certainly only got half a 
 guilder for that whereas the hind legs were paid for with a whole 
 guilder but then she had to walk bent and to do without fresh air 
 
 that was all very interesting to hear said our aunt 
 she deserved to live as long as the theatre stood but she could 
 not last so long and she did not die in the theatre but respectably in her bed her last words were moreover not without meaning she asked 
 
 what will the play be 
 
 at her death she left about five hundred dollars we presume 
 this from the interest which came to twenty dollars this our aunt 
 had destined as a legacy for a worthy old spinster who had no friends it was to be devoted to a yearly subscription for a place in the 
 second tier on the left side for the saturday evening for on 
 that evening two pieces were always given it said in the will and 
 the only condition laid upon the person who enjoyed the legacy was 
 that she should think every saturday evening of our aunt who was 
 lying in her grave 
 
 this was our religion

 book th of june 
 chapter i 
 
 the surface of the question 
 of what is revolt composed 
 of nothing and of everything of an electricity disengaged little by little of a flame suddenly darting forth of a wandering force of a passing breath this breath encounters heads which speak brains which dream souls which suffer passions which burn wretchedness which howls and bears them away 
 whither 
 at random 
 athwart the state the laws athwart prosperity and the insolence of others 
 irritated convictions embittered enthusiasms agitated indignations instincts of war which have been repressed youthful courage which has been exalted generous blindness curiosity the taste for change the thirst for the unexpected the sentiment which causes one to take pleasure in reading the posters for the new play and love the whistle at the theatre the vague hatreds rancors disappointments every vanity which thinks that destiny has bankrupted it discomfort empty dreams ambitious that are hedged about whoever hopes for a downfall some outcome in short at the very bottom the rabble that mud which catches fire such are the elements of revolt 
 that which is grandest and that which is basest the beings who prowl outside of all bounds awaiting an occasion bohemians vagrants vagabonds of the those who sleep at night in a desert of houses with no other roof than the cold clouds of heaven those who each day demand their bread from chance and not from toil the unknown of poverty and nothingness the the belong to revolt 
 whoever cherishes in his soul a secret revolt against any deed whatever on the part of the state of life or of fate is ripe for riot and as soon as it makes its appearance he begins to quiver and to feel himself borne away with the whirlwind 
 revolt is a sort of waterspout in the social atmosphere which forms suddenly in certain conditions of temperature and which as it eddies about mounts descends thunders tears razes crushes demolishes uproots bearing with it great natures and small the strong man and the feeble mind the tree trunk and the stalk of straw 
 woe to him whom it bears away as well as to him whom it strikes 
 it breaks the one against the other 
 it communicates to those whom it seizes an indescribable and extraordinary power 
 it fills the with the force of events it converts everything into projectiles it makes a of a rough stone and a general of a porter 
 if we are to believe certain oracles of crafty political views a little revolt is desirable from the point of view of power 
 system revolt strengthens those governments which it does not overthrow it puts the army to the test it consecrates the bourgeoisie it draws out the muscles of the police it demonstrates the force of the social framework 
 it is an exercise in gymnastics it is almost hygiene 
 power is in better health after a revolt as a man is after a good rubbing down 
 revolt thirty years ago was regarded from still other points of view 
 there is for everything a theory which proclaims itself good sense philintus against alcestis mediation offered between the false and the true explanation admonition rather haughty extenuation which because it is mingled with blame and excuse thinks itself wisdom and is often only pedantry 
 a whole political school called the golden mean has been the outcome of this 
 as between cold water and hot water it is the lukewarm water party 
 this school with its false depth all on the surface which dissects effects without going back to first causes chides from its height of a the agitation of the public square 
 if we listen to this school the riots which complicated the affair of deprived that great event of a portion of its purity 
 the revolution of july had been a fine popular gale abruptly followed by blue sky they made the cloudy sky reappear 
 they caused that revolution at first so remarkable for its unanimity to degenerate into a quarrel in the revolution of july as in all progress accomplished by fits and starts there had been secret fractures these riots rendered them perceptible 
 it might have been said 
 ah this is broken after the revolution of july one was sensible only of deliverance after the riots one was conscious of a catastrophe 
 all revolt closes the shops depresses the funds throws the exchange into consternation suspends commerce clogs business precipitates failures no more money private fortunes rendered uneasy public credit shaken industry disconcerted capital withdrawing work at a discount fear everywhere in every town hence gulfs 
 it has been calculated that the first day of a riot costs france twenty millions the second day forty the third sixty a three days uprising costs one hundred and twenty millions that is to say if only the financial result be taken into consideration it is equivalent to a disaster a shipwreck or a lost battle which should annihilate a fleet of sixty ships of the line 
 no doubt historically uprisings have their beauty the war of the pavements is no less grandiose and no less pathetic than the war of thickets 
 in the one there is the soul of forests in the other the heart of cities the one has jean chouan the other has a jeanne revolts have illuminated with a red glare all the most original points of the parisian character generosity devotion stormy gayety students proving that bravery forms part of intelligence the national guard invincible bivouacs of shopkeepers fortresses of street urchins contempt of death on the part of schools and legions clashed together 
 after all between the combatants there was only a difference of age the race is the same it is the same stoical men who died at the age of twenty for their ideas at forty for their families 
 the army always a sad thing in civil wars opposed prudence to audacity 
 uprisings while proving popular intrepidity also educated the courage of the bourgeois 
 this is well 
 but is all this worth the bloodshed 
 and to the bloodshed add the future darkness progress compromised uneasiness among the best men honest liberals in despair foreign absolutism happy in these wounds dealt to revolution by its own hand the vanquished of triumphing and saying we told you so 
 add paris enlarged possibly but france most assuredly diminished 
 add for all must needs be told the massacres which have too often dishonored the victory of order grown ferocious over liberty gone mad 
 to sum up all uprisings have been disastrous 
 thus speaks that approximation to wisdom with which the bourgeoisie that approximation to the people so willingly contents itself 
 for our parts we reject this word uprisings as too large and consequently as too convenient 
 we make a distinction between one popular movement and another popular movement we do not inquire whether an uprising costs as much as a battle why a battle in the first place 
 here the question of war comes up is war less of a scourge than an uprising is of a calamity 
 and then are all uprisings calamities 
 and what if the revolt of july did cost a hundred and twenty millions 
 the establishment of philip v in spain cost france two milliards 
 even at the same price we should prefer the th of july 
 however we reject these figures which appear to be reasons and which are only words 
 an uprising being given we examine it by itself 
 in all that is said by the doctrinarian objection above presented there is no question of anything but effect we seek the cause 
 we will be explicit

 when he received the news of the battle of borodino and the abandonment of moscow rostov was not seized with despair anger the desire for vengeance or any feeling of that kind but everything in voronezh suddenly seemed to him dull and tiresome and he experienced an indefinite feeling of shame and awkwardness the conversations he heard seemed to him insincere he did not know how to judge all these affairs and felt that only in the regiment would everything again become clear to him he made haste to finish buying the horses and often became unreasonably angry with his servant and squadron quartermaster 
 a few days before his departure a special thanksgiving at which nicholas was present was held in the cathedral for the russian victory he stood a little behind the governor and held himself with military decorum through the service meditating on a great variety of subjects when the service was over the wife beckoned him to her 
 have you seen the princess she asked indicating with a movement of her head a lady standing on the opposite side beyond the choir 
 nicholas immediately recognized princess mary not so much by the profile he saw under her bonnet as by the feeling of solicitude timidity and pity that immediately overcame him princess mary evidently engrossed by her thoughts was crossing herself for the last time before leaving the church 
 nicholas looked at her face with surprise it was the same face he had seen before there was the same general expression of refined inner spiritual labor but now it was quite differently lit up there was a pathetic expression of sorrow prayer and hope in it as had occurred before when she was present nicholas went up to her without waiting to be prompted by the wife and not asking himself whether or not it was right and proper to address her here in church and told her he had heard of her trouble and sympathized with his whole soul as soon as she heard his voice a vivid glow kindled in her face lighting up both her sorrow and her joy 
 there is one thing i wanted to tell you princess said rostov it is that if your brother prince andrew nikolievich were not living it would have been at once announced in the gazette as he is a colonel 
 the princess looked at him not grasping what he was saying but cheered by the expression of regretful sympathy on his face 
 and i have known so many cases of a splinter wound the gazette said it was a shell either proving fatal at once or being very slight continued nicholas we must hope for the best and i am sure 
 princess mary interrupted him 
 oh that would be so dread she began and prevented by agitation from finishing she bent her head with a movement as graceful as everything she did in his presence and looking up at him gratefully went out following her aunt 
 that evening nicholas did not go out but stayed at home to settle some accounts with the horse dealers when he had finished that business it was already too late to go anywhere but still too early to go to bed and for a long time he paced up and down the room reflecting on his life a thing he rarely did 
 princess mary had made an agreeable impression on him when he had met her in smolensk province his having encountered her in such exceptional circumstances and his mother having at one time mentioned her to him as a good match had drawn his particular attention to her when he met her again in voronezh the impression she made on him was not merely pleasing but powerful nicholas had been struck by the peculiar moral beauty he observed in her at this time he was however preparing to go away and it had not entered his head to regret that he was thus depriving himself of chances of meeting her but that encounter in church had he felt sunk deeper than was desirable for his peace of mind that pale sad refined face that radiant look those gentle graceful gestures and especially the deep and tender sorrow expressed in all her features agitated him and evoked his sympathy in men rostov could not bear to see the expression of a higher spiritual life that was why he did not like prince andrew and he referred to it contemptuously as philosophy and dreaminess but in princess mary that very sorrow which revealed the depth of a whole spiritual world foreign to him was an irresistible attraction 
 she must be a wonderful woman a real angel he said to himself why am i not free why was i in such a hurry with sonya and he involuntarily compared the two the lack of spirituality in the one and the abundance of it in the other a spirituality he himself lacked and therefore valued most highly he tried to picture what would happen were he free how he would propose to her and how she would become his wife but no he could not imagine that he felt awed and no clear picture presented itself to his mind he had long ago pictured to himself a future with sonya and that was all clear and simple just because it had all been thought out and he knew all there was in sonya but it was impossible to picture a future with princess mary because he did not understand her but simply loved her 
 reveries about sonya had had something merry and playful in them but to dream of princess mary was always difficult and a little frightening 
 how she prayed he thought it was plain that her whole soul was in her prayer yes that was the prayer that moves mountains and i am sure her prayer will be answered why i pray for what i want he suddenly thought what do i want to be free released from sonya she was right he thought remembering what the wife had said nothing but misfortune can come of marrying sonya muddles grief for mamma business difficulties muddles terrible muddles besides i love her not as i should o god release me from this dreadful inextricable position he suddenly began to pray yes prayer can move mountains but one must have faith and not pray as natasha and i used to as children that the snow might turn into sugar and then run out into the yard to see whether it had done so no but i am not praying for trifles now he thought as he put his pipe down in a corner and folding his hands placed himself before the icon softened by memories of princess mary he began to pray as he had not done for a long time tears were in his eyes and in his throat when the door opened and lavrushka came in with some papers 
 blockhead why do you come in without being called cried nicholas quickly changing his attitude 
 from the governor said lavrushka in a sleepy voice a courier has arrived and a letter for you 
 well all right thanks you can go 
 nicholas took the two letters one of which was from his mother and the other from sonya he recognized them by the handwriting and opened first he had read only a few lines when he turned pale and his eyes opened wide with fear and joy 
 no not possible he cried aloud 
 unable to sit still he paced up and down the room holding the letter and reading it he glanced through it then read it again and then again and standing still in the middle of the room he raised his shoulders stretching out his hands with his mouth wide open and his eyes fixed what he had just been praying for with confidence that god would hear him had come to pass but nicholas was as much astonished as if it were something extraordinary and unexpected and as if the very fact that it had happened so quickly proved that it had not come from god to whom he had prayed but by some ordinary coincidence 
 this unexpected and as it seemed to nicholas quite voluntary letter from sonya freed him from the knot that fettered him and from which there had seemed no escape she wrote that the last unfortunate events the loss of almost the whole of the rostovs moscow property and the countess repeatedly expressed wish that nicholas should marry princess bolkonskaya together with his silence and coldness of late had all combined to make her decide to release him from his promise and set him completely free 
 it would be too painful to me to think that i might be a cause of sorrow or discord in the family that has been so good to me she wrote and my love has no aim but the happiness of those i love so nicholas i beg you to consider yourself free and to be assured that in spite of everything no one can love you more than does 
 your sonya 
 both letters were written from troitsa the other from the countess described their last days in moscow their departure the fire and the destruction of all their property in this letter the countess also mentioned that prince andrew was among the wounded traveling with them his state was very critical but the doctor said there was now more hope sonya and natasha were nursing him 
 next day nicholas took his letter and went to see princess mary neither he nor she said a word about what natasha nursing him might mean but thanks to this letter nicholas suddenly became almost as intimate with the princess as if they were relations 
 the following day he saw princess mary off on her journey to yaroslavl and a few days later left to rejoin his regiment

 the root of the matter 
 there is such a thing as an uprising and there is such a thing as insurrection these are two separate phases of wrath one is in the wrong the other is in the right 
 in democratic states the only ones which are founded on justice it sometimes happens that the fraction usurps then the whole rises and the necessary claim of its rights may proceed as far as resort to arms 
 in all questions which result from collective sovereignty the war of the whole against the fraction is insurrection the attack of the fraction against the whole is revolt according as the tuileries contain a king or the convention they are justly or unjustly attacked the same cannon pointed against the populace is wrong on the th of august and right on the th of vendemiaire 
 alike in appearance fundamentally different in reality the swiss defend the false bonaparte defends the true 
 that which universal suffrage has effected in its liberty and in its sovereignty cannot be undone by the street it is the same in things pertaining purely to civilization the instinct of the masses may be troubled the same fury legitimate when directed against terray and absurd when directed against turgot 
 the destruction of machines the pillage of warehouses the breaking of rails the demolition of docks the false routes of multitudes the refusal by the people of justice to progress ramus assassinated by students rousseau driven out of switzerland and is revolt 
 israel against moses athens against phocian rome against is an uprising paris against the is insurrection 
 the soldiers against alexander the sailors against christopher columbus this is the same revolt impious revolt why 
 because alexander is doing for asia with the sword that which christopher columbus is doing for america with the compass alexander like columbus is finding a world 
 these gifts of a world to civilization are such augmentations of light that all resistance in that case is culpable sometimes the populace counterfeits fidelity to itself 
 the masses are traitors to the people 
 is there for example anything stranger than that long and bloody protest of dealers in contraband salt a legitimate chronic revolt which at the decisive moment on the day of salvation at the very hour of popular victory espouses the throne turns into chouannerie and from having been an insurrection against becomes an uprising for sombre masterpieces of ignorance 
 the contraband salt dealer escapes the royal gibbets and with a end round his neck mounts the white cockade death to the salt duties brings forth long live the king the assassins of the of september the manslaughterers of avignon the assassins of coligny the assassins of madam lamballe the assassins of brune miquelets verdets cadenettes the companions of jehu the chevaliers of brassard behold an uprising 
 la vendee is a grand catholic uprising the sound of right in movement is recognizable it does not always proceed from the trembling of excited masses there are mad rages there are cracked bells all tocsins do not give out the sound of bronze 
 the brawl of passions and ignorances is quite another thing from the shock of progress 
 show me in what direction you are going 
 rise if you will but let it be that you may grow great there is no insurrection except in a forward direction 
 any other sort of rising is bad every violent step towards the rear is a revolt to retreat is to commit a deed of violence against the human race insurrection is a fit of rage on the part of truth the pavements which the uprising disturbs give forth the spark of right these pavements bequeath to the uprising only their mud danton against louis xiv 
 is insurrection hebert against danton is revolt 
 hence it results that if insurrection in given cases may be as lafayette says the most holy of duties an uprising may be the most fatal of crimes 
 there is also a difference in the intensity of heat insurrection is often a volcano revolt is often only a fire of straw 
 revolt as we have said is sometimes found among those in power polignac is a rioter camille desmoulins is one of the governing powers 
 insurrection is sometimes resurrection 
 the solution of everything by universal suffrage being an absolutely modern fact and all history anterior to this fact being for the space of four thousand years filled with violated right and the suffering of peoples each epoch of history brings with it that protest of which it is capable 
 under the caesars there was no insurrection but there was juvenal 
 the facit indignatio replaces the gracchi 
 under the caesars there is the exile to syene there is also the man of the annales 
 we do not speak of the immense exile of patmos who on his part also overwhelms the real world with a protest in the name of the ideal world who makes of his vision an enormous satire and casts on on on the flaming reflection of the apocalypse 
 john on his rock is the sphinx on its pedestal we may understand him he is a jew and it is hebrew but the man who writes the annales is of the latin race let us rather say he is a roman 
 as the neros reign in a black way they should be painted to match the work of the alone would be too pale there must be poured into the channel a concentrated prose which bites 
 despots count for something in the question of philosophers a word that is chained is a terrible word 
 the writer doubles and trebles his style when silence is imposed on a nation by its master from this silence there arises a certain mysterious plenitude which filters into thought and there congeals into bronze the compression of history produces conciseness in the historian the granite solidity of such and such a celebrated prose is nothing but the accumulation effected by the tyrant 
 tyranny constrains the writer to conditions of diameter which are augmentations of force 
 the ciceronian period which hardly sufficed for verres would be blunted on caligula 
 the less spread of sail in the phrase the more intensity in the blow tacitus thinks with all his might 
 the honesty of a great heart condensed in justice and truth overwhelms as with lightning 
 be it remarked in passing that tacitus is not historically superposed upon caesar 
 the tiberii were reserved for him caesar and tacitus are two successive phenomena a meeting between whom seems to be mysteriously avoided by the one who when he sets the centuries on the stage regulates the entrances and the exits caesar is great tacitus is great god spares these two greatnesses by not allowing them to clash with one another 
 the guardian of justice in striking caesar might strike too hard and be unjust god does not will it 
 the great wars of africa and spain the pirates of sicily destroyed civilization introduced into gaul into britanny into this glory covers the rubicon there is here a sort of delicacy of the divine justice hesitating to let loose upon the illustrious usurper the formidable historian sparing caesar tacitus and according extenuating circumstances to genius 
 certainly despotism remains despotism even under the despot of genius 
 there is corruption under all illustrious tyrants but the moral pest is still more hideous under infamous tyrants in such reigns nothing veils the shame and those who make examples tacitus as well as juvenal slap this ignominy which cannot reply in the face more usefully in the presence of all humanity 
 rome smells worse under vitellius than under sylla 
 under claudius and under domitian there is a deformity of baseness corresponding to the repulsiveness of the tyrant 
 the villainy of slaves is a direct product of the despot a miasma exhales from these cowering consciences wherein the master is reflected public powers are unclean hearts are small consciences are dull souls are like vermin thus it is under caracalla thus it is under commodus thus it is under heliogabalus while from the roman senate under caesar there comes nothing but the odor of the dung which is peculiar to the eyries of the eagles 
 hence the advent apparently tardy of the tacituses and the juvenals it is in the hour for evidence that the demonstrator makes his appearance 
 but juvenal and tacitus like isaiah in biblical times like dante in the middle ages is man riot and insurrection are the multitude which is sometimes right and sometimes wrong

 the nourishment of the people is a good object to massacre them is a bad means 
 all armed protests even the most legitimate even that of the th of august even that of july th begin with the same troubles before the right gets set free there is foam and tumult in the beginning the insurrection is a riot just as a river is a torrent

 then the bourgeois shouts 
 long live the people 
 this explanation given what does the movement of june signify so far as history is concerned 
 is it a revolt 
 is it an insurrection 
 it may happen to us in placing this formidable event on the stage to say revolt now and then but merely to distinguish superficial facts and always preserving the distinction between revolt the form and insurrection the foundation 
 this movement of had in its rapid outbreak and in its melancholy extinction so much grandeur that even those who see in it only an uprising never refer to it otherwise than with respect for them it is like a relic of 
 excited imaginations say they are not to be calmed in a day 
 a revolution cannot be cut off short it must needs undergo some undulations before it returns to a state of rest like a mountain sinking into the plain 
 there are no alps without their jura nor pyrenees without the asturias 
 this pathetic crisis of contemporary history which the memory of parisians calls the epoch of the riots is certainly a characteristic hour amid the stormy hours of this century a last word before we enter on the recital 
 the facts which we are about to relate belong to that dramatic and living reality which the historian sometimes neglects for lack of time and space 
 there nevertheless we insist upon it is life palpitation human tremor 
 petty details as we think we have already said are so to speak the foliage of great events and are lost in the distance of history 
 the epoch surnamed of the riots abounds in details of this nature judicial inquiries have not revealed and perhaps have not sounded the depths for another reason than history 
 we shall therefore bring to light among the known and published peculiarities things which have not heretofore been known about facts over which have passed the forgetfulness of some and the death of others the majority of the actors in these gigantic scenes have disappeared beginning with the very next day they held their peace but of what we shall relate we shall be able to say 
 we have seen this we alter a few names for history relates and does not inform against but the deed which we shall paint will be genuine 
 in accordance with the conditions of the book which we are now writing we shall show only one side and one episode and certainly the least known at that of the two days the th and the th of june but we shall do it in such wise that the reader may catch a glimpse beneath the gloomy veil which we are about to lift of the real form of this frightful public adventure

 book twelve 
 chapter viii 
 
 letter written from troitsa which had come as an answer to nicholas prayer was prompted by this the thought of getting nicholas married to an heiress occupied the old countess mind more and more she knew that sonya was the chief obstacle to this happening and life in the countess house had grown harder and harder especially after they had received a letter from nicholas telling of his meeting with princess mary in bogucharovo the countess let no occasion slip of making humiliating or cruel allusions to sonya 
 but a few days before they left moscow moved and excited by all that was going on she called sonya to her and instead of reproaching and making demands on her tearfully implored her to sacrifice herself and repay all that the family had done for her by breaking off her engagement with nicholas 
 i shall not be at peace till you promise me this 
 sonya burst into hysterical tears and replied through her sobs that she would do anything and was prepared for anything but gave no actual promise and could not bring herself to decide to do what was demanded of her she must sacrifice herself for the family that had reared and brought her up to sacrifice herself for others was habit her position in the house was such that only by sacrifice could she show her worth and she was accustomed to this and loved doing it but in all her former acts of she had been happily conscious that they raised her in her own esteem and in that of others and so made her more worthy of nicholas whom she loved more than anything in the world but now they wanted her to sacrifice the very thing that constituted the whole reward for her and the whole meaning of her life and for the first time she felt bitterness against those who had been her benefactors only to torture her the more painfully she felt jealous of natasha who had never experienced anything of this sort had never needed to sacrifice herself but made others sacrifice themselves for her and yet was beloved by everybody and for the first time sonya felt that out of her pure quiet love for nicholas a passionate feeling was beginning to grow up which was stronger than principle virtue or religion under the influence of this feeling sonya whose life of dependence had taught her involuntarily to be secretive having answered the countess in vague general terms avoided talking with her and resolved to wait till she should see nicholas not in order to set him free but on the contrary at that meeting to bind him to her forever 
 the bustle and terror of the rostovs last days in moscow stifled the gloomy thoughts that oppressed sonya she was glad to find escape from them in practical activity but when she heard of prince presence in their house despite her sincere pity for him and for natasha she was seized by a joyful and superstitious feeling that god did not intend her to be separated from nicholas she knew that natasha loved no one but prince andrew and had never ceased to love him she knew that being thrown together again under such terrible circumstances they would again fall in love with one another and that nicholas would then not be able to marry princess mary as they would be within the prohibited degrees of affinity despite all the terror of what had happened during those last days and during the first days of their journey this feeling that providence was intervening in her personal affairs cheered sonya 
 at the troitsa monastery the rostovs first broke their journey for a whole day 
 three large rooms were assigned to them in the monastery hostelry one of which was occupied by prince andrew the wounded man was much better that day and natasha was sitting with him in the next room sat the count and countess respectfully conversing with the prior who was calling on them as old acquaintances and benefactors of the monastery sonya was there too tormented by curiosity as to what prince andrew and natasha were talking about she heard the sound of their voices through the door that door opened and natasha came out looking excited not noticing the monk who had risen to greet her and was drawing back the wide sleeve on his right arm she went up to sonya and took her hand 
 natasha what are you about come here said the countess 
 natasha went up to the monk for his blessing and advised her to pray for aid to god and his saint 
 as soon as the prior withdrew natasha took her friend by the hand and went with her into the unoccupied room 
 sonya will he live she asked sonya how happy i am and how unhappy sonya dovey everything is as it used to be if only he lives he cannot because because of and natasha burst into tears 
 yes i knew it thank god murmured sonya he will live 
 sonya was not less agitated than her friend by the fear and grief and by her own personal feelings which she shared with no one sobbing she kissed and comforted natasha if only he lives she thought having wept talked and wiped away their tears the two friends went together to prince door natasha opened it cautiously and glanced into the room sonya standing beside her at the door 
 prince andrew was lying raised high on three pillows his pale face was calm his eyes closed and they could see his regular breathing 
 o natasha sonya suddenly almost screamed catching her arm and stepping back from the door 
 what what is it asked natasha 
 that that said sonya with a white face and trembling lips 
 natasha softly closed the door and went with sonya to the window not yet understanding what the latter was telling her 
 you remember said sonya with a solemn and frightened expression you remember when i looked in the mirror for you at otradnoe at christmas do you remember what i saw 
 yes yes cried natasha opening her eyes wide and vaguely recalling that sonya had told her something about prince andrew whom she had seen lying down 
 you remember sonya went on i saw it then and told everybody you and dunyasha i saw him lying on a bed said she making a gesture with her hand and a lifted finger at each detail and that he had his eyes closed and was covered just with a pink quilt and that his hands were folded she concluded convincing herself that the details she had just seen were exactly what she had seen in the mirror 
 she had in fact seen nothing then but had mentioned the first thing that came into her head but what she had invented then seemed to her now as real as any other recollection she not only remembered what she had then said that he turned to look at her and smiled and was covered with something red but was firmly convinced that she had then seen and said that he was covered with a pink quilt and that his eyes were closed 
 yes yes it really was pink cried natasha who now thought she too remembered the word pink being used and saw in this the most extraordinary and mysterious part of the prediction 
 but what does it mean she added meditatively 
 oh i know it is all so strange replied sonya clutching at her head 
 a few minutes later prince andrew rang and natasha went to him but sonya feeling unusually excited and touched remained at the window thinking about the strangeness of what had occurred 
 they had an opportunity that day to send letters to the army and the countess was writing to her son 
 sonya said the countess raising her eyes from her letter as her niece passed sonya you write to nicholas she spoke in a soft tremulous voice and in the weary eyes that looked over her spectacles sonya read all that the countess meant to convey with these words those eyes expressed entreaty shame at having to ask fear of a refusal and readiness for relentless hatred in case of such refusal 
 sonya went up to the countess and kneeling down kissed her hand 
 yes mamma i will write said she 
 sonya was softened excited and touched by all that had occurred that day especially by the mysterious fulfillment she had just seen of her vision now that she knew that the renewal of relations with prince andrew would prevent nicholas from marrying princess mary she was joyfully conscious of a return of that spirit in which she was accustomed to live and loved to live so with a joyful consciousness of performing a magnanimous deed interrupted several times by the tears that dimmed her velvety black eyes she wrote that touching letter the arrival of which had so amazed nicholas

 chapter iii 
 
 a burial an occasion to be born again 
 in the spring of although the cholera had been chilling all minds for the last three months and had cast over their agitation an indescribable and gloomy pacification paris had already long been ripe for commotion 
 as we have said the great city resembles a piece of artillery when it is loaded it suffices for a spark to fall and the shot is discharged 
 in june the spark was the death of general lamarque 
 lamarque was a man of renown and of action 
 he had had in succession under the empire and under the restoration the sorts of bravery requisite for the two epochs the bravery of the and the bravery of the tribune 
 he was as eloquent as he had been valiant a sword was discernible in his speech 
 like foy his predecessor after upholding the command he upheld liberty he sat between the left and the extreme left beloved of the people because he accepted the chances of the future beloved of the populace because he had served the emperor well he was in company with comtes gerard and drouet one of marshals in petto the treaties of removed him as a personal offence 
 he hated wellington with a downright hatred which pleased the multitude and for seventeen years he majestically preserved the sadness of waterloo paying hardly any attention to intervening events in his death agony at his last hour he clasped to his breast a sword which had been presented to him by the officers of the hundred days napoleon had died uttering the word army lamarque uttering the word country 
 his death which was expected was dreaded by the people as a loss and by the government as an occasion 
 this death was an affliction like everything that is bitter affliction may turn to revolt this is what took place 
 on the preceding evening and on the morning of the th of june the day appointed for burial the faubourg which the procession was to touch at assumed a formidable aspect this tumultuous network of streets was filled with rumors they armed themselves as best they might 
 joiners carried off of their establishment to break down doors 
 one of them had made himself a dagger of a hook by breaking off the hook and sharpening the stump 
 another who was in a fever to attack slept wholly dressed for three days 
 a carpenter named lombier met a comrade who asked him 
 whither are you going eh well i have no weapons 
 what then 
 going to my to get my compasses 
 what for 
 i know said lombier 
 a certain jacqueline an expeditious man accosted some passing artisans 
 come here you 
 he treated them to ten sous worth of wine and said 
 have you work 
 no go to filspierre between the barriere charonne and the barriere montreuil and you will find work 
 at they found cartridges and arms certain leaders were going the rounds that is to say running from one house to another to collect their men at near the barriere du trone at near the the drinkers accosted each other with a grave air they were heard to say 
 have you your pistol 
 under my blouse and you 
 under my shirt 
 in the rue traversiere in front of the bland workshop and in the yard of the in front of groups whispered together among them was observed a certain mavot who never remained more than a week in one shop as the masters always discharged him because they were obliged to dispute with him every day 
 mavot was killed on the following day at the barricade of the rue menilmontant pretot who was destined to perish also in the struggle seconded mavot and to the question 
 what is your object he replied 
 insurrection 
 workmen assembled at the corner of the rue de bercy waited for a certain lemarin the revolutionary agent for the faubourg watchwords were exchanged almost publicly 
 on the th of june accordingly a day of mingled rain and sun general funeral procession traversed paris with official military pomp somewhat augmented through precaution 
 two battalions with draped drums and reversed arms ten thousand national guards with their swords at their sides escorted the coffin the hearse was drawn by young men 
 the officers of the invalides came immediately behind it bearing laurel branches 
 then came an innumerable strange agitated multitude the sectionaries of the friends of the people the law school the medical school refugees of all nationalities and spanish italian german and polish flags tricolored horizontal banners every possible sort of banner children waving green boughs and carpenters who were on strike at the moment printers who were recognizable by their paper caps marching two by two three by three uttering cries nearly all of them brandishing sticks some brandishing sabres without order and yet with a single soul now a tumultuous rout again a column 
 squads chose themselves leaders a man armed with a pair of pistols in full view seemed to pass the host in review and the files separated before him 
 on the side alleys of the boulevards in the branches of the trees on balconies in windows on the roofs swarmed the heads of men women and children all eyes were filled with anxiety 
 an armed throng was passing and a terrified throng looked on 
 the government on its side was taking observations 
 it observed with its hand on its sword 
 four squadrons of carabineers could be seen in the place louis xv 
 in their saddles with their trumpets at their head filled and muskets loaded all in readiness to march in the latin country and at the jardin des plantes the municipal guard echelonned from street to street at the a squadron of dragoons at the greve half of the th light infantry the other half being at the bastille the th dragoons at the celestins and the courtyard of the louvre full of artillery 
 the remainder of the troops were confined to their barracks without reckoning the regiments of the environs of paris 
 power being uneasy held suspended over the menacing multitude thousand soldiers in the city and thirty thousand in the banlieue 
 divers reports were in circulation in the cortege 
 legitimist tricks were hinted at they spoke of the duc de reichstadt whom god had marked out for death at that very moment when the populace were designating him for the empire 
 one personage whose name has remained unknown announced that at a given hour two overseers who had been won over would throw open the doors of a factory of arms to the people that which predominated on the uncovered brows of the majority of those present was enthusiasm mingled with dejection here and there also in that multitude given over to such violent but noble emotions there were visible genuine visages of criminals and ignoble mouths which said 
 let us plunder 
 there are certain agitations which stir up the bottoms of marshes and make clouds of mud rise through the water 
 a phenomenon to which well drilled policemen are no strangers 
 the procession proceeded with feverish slowness from the house of the deceased by way of the boulevards as far as the bastille it rained from time to time the rain mattered nothing to that throng many incidents the coffin borne round the vendome column stones thrown at the duc de who was seen on a balcony with his hat on his head the gallic cock torn from a popular flag and dragged in the mire a policeman wounded with a blow from a sword at the porte an officer of the th light infantry saying aloud 
 i am a republican the polytechnic school coming up unexpectedly against orders to remain at home the shouts of long live the polytechnique 
 long live the republic marked the passage of the funeral train 
 at the bastille long files of curious and formidable people who descended from the faubourg effected a junction with the procession and a certain terrible seething began to agitate the throng 
 one man was heard to say to another 
 do you see that fellow with a red beard the one who will give the word when we are to fire it appears that this red beard was present at another riot the quenisset affair entrusted with this same function 
 the hearse passed the bastille traversed the small bridge and reached the esplanade of the bridge of austerlitz 
 there it halted the crowd surveyed at that moment with a view would have presented the aspect of a comet whose head was on the esplanade and whose tail spread out over the quai bourdon covered the bastille and was prolonged on the boulevard as far as the porte a circle was traced around the hearse 
 the vast rout held their peace lafayette spoke and bade lamarque farewell 
 this was a touching and august instant all heads uncovered all hearts beat high 
 all at once a man on horseback clad in black made his appearance in the middle of the group with a red flag others say with a pike surmounted with a red lafayette turned aside his head exelmans quitted the procession 
 this red flag raised a storm and disappeared in the midst of it from the boulevard bourdon to the bridge of austerlitz one of those clamors which resemble billows stirred the multitude two prodigious shouts went up 
 lamarque to the pantheon lafayette to the some young men amid the declamations of the throng harnessed themselves and began to drag lamarque in the hearse across the bridge of austerlitz and lafayette in a along the quai morland 
 in the crowd which surrounded and cheered lafayette it was noticed that a german showed himself named ludwig snyder who died a centenarian afterwards who had also been in the war of and who had fought at trenton under washington and at brandywine under lafayette 
 in the meantime the municipal cavalry on the left bank had been set in motion and came to bar the bridge on the right bank the dragoons emerged from the celestins and deployed along the quai morland the men who were dragging lafayette suddenly caught sight of them at the corner of the quay and shouted 
 the dragoons the dragoons advanced at a walk in silence with their pistols in their holsters their swords in their scabbards their guns slung in their leather sockets with an air of gloomy expectation 
 they halted two hundred paces from the little bridge 
 the carriage in which sat lafayette advanced to them their ranks opened and allowed it to pass and then closed behind it 
 at that moment the dragoons and the crowd touched 
 the women fled in terror what took place during that fatal minute 
 no one can say it is the dark moment when two clouds come together 
 some declare that a blast of trumpets sounding the charge was heard in the direction of the arsenal others that a blow from a dagger was given by a child to a dragoon 
 the fact is that three shots were suddenly discharged the first killed cholet chief of the squadron the second killed an old deaf woman who was in the act of closing her window the third singed the shoulder of an officer a woman screamed they are beginning too soon and all at once a squadron of dragoons which had remained in the barracks up to this time was seen to debouch at a gallop with bared swords through the rue bassompierre and the boulevard bourdon sweeping all before them 
 then all is said the tempest is loosed stones rain down a fusillade breaks forth many precipitate themselves to the bottom of the bank and pass the small arm of the seine now filled in the of the isle louviers that vast citadel ready to hand bristle with combatants stakes are torn up fired a barricade begun the young men who are thrust back pass the austerlitz bridge with the hearse at a run and the municipal guard the carabineers rush up the dragoons ply their swords the crowd disperses in all directions a rumor of war flies to all four quarters of paris men shout 
 to arms they run tumble down flee resist 
 wrath spreads abroad the riot as wind spreads a fire

 chapter ix 
 
 the officer and soldiers who had arrested pierre treated him with hostility but yet with respect in the guardhouse to which he was taken in their attitude toward him could still be felt both uncertainty as to who he might be perhaps a very important person and hostility as a result of their recent personal conflict with him 
 but when the guard was relieved next morning pierre felt that for the new guard both officers and men he was not as interesting as he had been to his captors and in fact the guard of the second day did not recognize in this big stout man in a peasant coat the vigorous person who had fought so desperately with the marauder and the convoy and had uttered those solemn words about saving a child they saw in him only no of the captured russians arrested and detained for some reason by order of the higher command if they noticed anything remarkable about pierre it was only his unabashed meditative concentration and thoughtfulness and the way he spoke french which struck them as surprisingly good in spite of this he was placed that day with the other arrested suspects as the separate room he had occupied was required by an officer 
 all the russians confined with pierre were men of the lowest class and recognizing him as a gentleman they all avoided him more especially as he spoke french pierre felt sad at hearing them making fun of him 
 that evening he learned that all these prisoners he probably among them were to be tried for incendiarism on the third day he was taken with the others to a house where a french general with a white mustache sat with two colonels and other frenchmen with scarves on their arms with the precision and definiteness customary in addressing prisoners and which is supposed to preclude human frailty pierre like the others was questioned as to who he was where he had been with what object and so on 
 these questions like questions put at trials generally left the essence of the matter aside shut out the possibility of that being revealed and were designed only to form a channel through which the judges wished the answers of the accused to flow so as to lead to the desired result namely a conviction as soon as pierre began to say anything that did not fit in with that aim the channel was removed and the water could flow to waste pierre felt moreover what the accused always feel at their trial perplexity as to why these questions were put to him he had a feeling that it was only out of condescension or a kind of civility that this device of placing a channel was employed he knew he was in these power that only by force had they brought him there that force alone gave them the right to demand answers to their questions and that the sole object of that assembly was to inculpate him and so as they had the power and wish to inculpate him this expedient of an inquiry and trial seemed unnecessary it was evident that any answer would lead to conviction when asked what he was doing when he was arrested pierre replied in a rather tragic manner that he was restoring to its parents a child he had saved from the flames why had he fought the marauder pierre answered that he was protecting a woman and that to protect a woman who was being insulted was the duty of every man that they interrupted him for this was not to the point why was he in the yard of a burning house where witnesses had seen him he replied that he had gone out to see what was happening in moscow again they interrupted him they had not asked where he was going but why he was found near the fire who was he they asked repeating their first question which he had declined to answer again he replied that he could not answer it 
 put that down bad very bad sternly remarked the general with the white mustache and red flushed face 
 on the fourth day fires broke out on the zubovski rampart 
 pierre and thirteen others were moved to the coach house of a house near the crimean bridge on his way through the streets pierre felt stifled by the smoke which seemed to hang over the whole city fires were visible on all sides he did not then realize the significance of the burning of moscow and looked at the fires with horror 
 he passed four days in the coach house near the crimean bridge and during that time learned from the talk of the french soldiers that all those confined there were awaiting a decision which might come any day from the marshal what marshal this was pierre could not learn from the soldiers evidently for them the marshal represented a very high and rather mysterious power 
 these first days before the eighth of september when the prisoners were had up for a second examination were the hardest of all for pierre

 the ebullitions of former days 
 nothing is more extraordinary than the first breaking out of a riot everything bursts forth everywhere at once 
 was it foreseen yes 
 was it prepared 
 no whence comes it 
 from the pavements whence falls it 
 from the clouds 
 here insurrection assumes the character of a plot there of an improvisation 
 the first comer seizes a current of the throng and leads it whither he wills a beginning full of terror in which is mingled a sort of formidable gayety 
 first come clamors the shops are closed the displays of the merchants disappear then come isolated shots people flee blows from beat against portes cocheres servants can be heard laughing in the courtyards of houses and saying going to be a row 
 a quarter of an hour had not elapsed when this is what was taking place at twenty different spots in paris at once 
 in the rue twenty young men bearded and with long hair entered a and emerged a moment later carrying a horizontal tricolored flag covered with crape and having at their head three men armed one with a sword one with a gun and the third with a pike 
 in the rue des nonaindieres a very bourgeois who had a prominent belly a sonorous voice a bald head a lofty brow a black beard and one of these stiff mustaches which will not lie flat offered cartridges publicly to 
 in the rue men with bare arms carried about a black flag on which could be read in white letters this inscription republic or death 
 in the rue des jeuneurs rue du cadran rue montorgueil rue mandar groups appeared waving flags on which could be distinguished in gold letters the word section with a number one of these flags was red and blue with an almost imperceptible stripe of white between 
 they pillaged a factory of on the boulevard and three armorers shops the first in the rue beaubourg the second in the rue the other in the rue du temple in a few minutes the thousand hands of the crowd had seized and carried off two hundred and thirty guns nearly all swords and pistols 
 in order to provide more arms one man took the gun the other the bayonet 
 opposite the quai de la greve young men armed with muskets installed themselves in the houses of some women for the purpose of firing one of them had a they rang entered and set about making cartridges 
 one of these women relates 
 i did not know what cartridges were it was my husband who told me 
 one cluster broke into a curiosity shop in the rue des vielles haudriettes and seized yataghans and turkish arms 
 the body of a mason who had been killed by a lay in the rue de la perle 
 and then on the right bank the left bank on the quays on the boulevards in the latin country in the quarter of the halles panting men artisans students members of sections read proclamations and shouted 
 to arms broke street lanterns unharnessed carriages unpaved the streets broke in the doors of houses uprooted trees rummaged cellars rolled out hogsheads heaped up rough slabs furniture and planks and made barricades 
 they forced the bourgeois to assist them in this 
 they entered the dwellings of women they forced them to hand over the swords and guns of their absent husbands and they wrote on the door with whiting the arms have been delivered some signed their names to receipts for the guns and swords and said 
 send for them at the office 
 they disarmed isolated sentinels and national guardsmen in the streets on their way to the townhall 
 they tore the epaulets from officers 
 in the rue du an officer of the national guard on being pursued by a crowd armed with clubs and foils took refuge with difficulty in a house whence he was only able to emerge at nightfall and in disguise 
 in the quartier the students swarmed out of their hotels and ascended the rue to the cafe du progress or descended to the cafe des in the rue des mathurins there in front of the door young men mounted on the stone distributed arms 
 they plundered the in the rue transnonain in order to obtain material for barricades on a single point the inhabitants resisted at the corner of the rue and the rue where they destroyed the barricade with their own hands 
 at a single point the insurgents yielded they abandoned a barricade begun in the rue de temple after having fired on a detachment of the national guard and fled through the rue de la corderie 
 the detachment picked up in the barricade a red flag a package of cartridges and three hundred the national guardsmen tore up the flag and carried off its tattered remains on the points of their bayonets 
 all that we are here relating slowly and successively took place simultaneously at all points of the city in the midst of a vast tumult like a mass of tongues of lightning in one clap of thunder in less than an hour barricades sprang out of the earth in the quarter of the halles alone 
 in the centre was that famous house no which was the fortress of jeanne and her six hundred companions and which flanked on the one hand by a barricade at and on the other by a barricade of the rue maubuee commanded three streets the rue des arcis the rue and the rue which it faced 
 the barricades at right angles fell back the one of the rue montorgueil on the the other of the rue on the rue without reckoning innumerable barricades in twenty other quarters of paris in the marais at one in the rue menilmontant where was visible a porte cochere torn from its hinges another near the little bridge of the made with an ecossais which had been unharnessed and overthrown three hundred paces from the prefecture of police 
 at the barricade of the rue des menetriers a man distributed money to the workmen 
 at the barricade of the rue grenetat a horseman made his appearance and handed to the one who seemed to be the commander of the barricade what had the appearance of a roll of silver 
 here said he this is to pay expenses wine et caetera 
 a young man without a cravat went from barricade to barricade carrying another with a naked sword a blue police cap on his head placed sentinels in the interior beyond the barricades the and porters lodges were converted into otherwise the riot was conducted after the most scientific military tactics the narrow uneven sinuous streets full of angles and turns were admirably chosen the neighborhood of the halles in particular a network of streets more intricate than a forest 
 the society of the friends of the people had it was said undertaken to direct the insurrection in the quartier a man killed in the rue du ponceau who was searched had on his person a plan of paris 
 that which had really undertaken the direction of the uprising was a sort of strange impetuosity which was in the air the insurrection had abruptly built barricades with one hand and with the other seized nearly all the posts of the garrison in less than three hours like a train of powder catching fire the insurgents had invaded and occupied on the right bank the arsenal the mayoralty of the place royale the whole of the marais the popincourt arms manufactory la galiote the and all the streets near the halles on the left bank the barracks of the veterans the place maubert the powder magazine of the and all the barriers at five in the evening they were masters of the bastille of the lingerie of the their scouts had reached the place des victoires and menaced the bank the barracks and the a third of paris was in the hands of the rioters 
 the conflict had been begun on a gigantic scale at all points and as a result of the disarming domiciliary visits and armorers shops hastily invaded was that the combat which had begun with the throwing of stones was continued with 
 about six in the evening the passage du saumon became the field of battle 
 the uprising was at one end the troops were at the other 
 they fired from one gate to the other 
 an observer a dreamer the author of this book who had gone to get a near view of this volcano found himself in the passage between the two fires all that he had to protect him from the bullets was the swell of the two which separate the shops he remained in this delicate situation for nearly half an hour 
 meanwhile the call to arms was beaten the national guard armed in haste the legions emerged from the mayoralities the regiments from their barracks 
 opposite the passage de a drummer received a blow from a dagger 
 another in the rue du cygne was assailed by thirty young men who broke his instrument and took away his sword 
 another was killed in the rue in the three officers fell dead one after the other 
 many of the municipal guards on being wounded in the rue des lombards retreated 
 in front of the a detachment of national guards found a red flag bearing the following inscription 
 republican revolution no 
 was this a revolution in fact 
 the insurrection had made of the centre of paris a sort of inextricable tortuous colossal citadel 
 there was the hearth there evidently was the question all the rest was nothing but skirmishes 
 the proof that all would be decided there lay in the fact that there was no fighting going on there as yet 
 in some regiments the soldiers were uncertain which added to the fearful uncertainty of the crisis 
 they recalled the popular ovation which had greeted the neutrality of the d of the line in july 
 two intrepid men tried in great wars the marshal lobau and general bugeaud were in command bugeaud under lobau enormous patrols composed of battalions of the line enclosed in entire companies of the national guard and preceded by a commissary of police wearing his scarf of office went to reconnoitre the streets in rebellion 
 the insurgents on their side placed videttes at the corners of all open spaces and audaciously sent their patrols outside the barricades 
 each side was watching the other the government with an army in its hand hesitated the night was almost upon them and the tocsin began to make itself heard 
 the minister of war at that time marshal soult who had seen austerlitz regarded this with a gloomy air 
 these old sailors accustomed to correct manoeuvres and having as resource and guide only tactics that compass of battles are utterly disconcerted in the presence of that immense foam which is called public wrath 
 the national guards of the suburbs rushed up in haste and disorder a battalion of the th light came at a run from the th of the line arrived from courbevoie the batteries of the military school had taken up their position on the carrousel cannons were descending from vincennes 
 solitude was formed around the tuileries 
 louis philippe was perfectly serene

 chapter x 
 
 on the eighth of september an officer a very important one judging by the respect the guards showed him entered the coach house where the prisoners were this officer probably someone on the staff was holding a paper in his hand and called over all the russians there naming pierre as the man who does not give his name glancing indolently and indifferently at all the prisoners he ordered the officer in charge to have them decently dressed and tidied up before taking them to the marshal an hour later a squad of soldiers arrived and pierre with thirteen others was led to the field it was a fine day sunny after rain and the air was unusually pure the smoke did not hang low as on the day when pierre had been taken from the guardhouse on the zubovski rampart but rose through the pure air in columns no flames were seen but columns of smoke rose on all sides and all moscow as far as pierre could see was one vast charred ruin on all sides there were waste spaces with only stoves and chimney stacks still standing and here and there the blackened walls of some brick houses pierre gazed at the ruins and did not recognize districts he had known well here and there he could see churches that had not been burned the kremlin which was not destroyed gleamed white in the distance with its towers and the belfry of ivan the great the domes of the new convent of the virgin glittered brightly and its bells were ringing particularly clearly these bells reminded pierre that it was sunday and the feast of the nativity of the virgin but there seemed to be no one to celebrate this holiday everywhere were blackened ruins and the few russians to be seen were tattered and frightened people who tried to hide when they saw the french 
 it was plain that the russian nest was ruined and destroyed but in place of the russian order of life that had been destroyed pierre unconsciously felt that a quite different firm french order had been established over this ruined nest he felt this in the looks of the soldiers who marching in regular ranks briskly and gaily were escorting him and the other criminals he felt it in the looks of an important french official in a carriage and pair driven by a soldier whom they met on the way he felt it in the merry sounds of regimental music he heard from the left side of the field and felt and realized it especially from the list of prisoners the french officer had read out when he came that morning pierre had been taken by one set of soldiers and led first to one and then to another place with dozens of other men and it seemed that they might have forgotten him or confused him with the others but no the answers he had given when questioned had come back to him in his designation as the man who does not give his name and under that appellation which to pierre seemed terrible they were now leading him somewhere with unhesitating assurance on their faces that he and all the other prisoners were exactly the ones they wanted and that they were being taken to the proper place pierre felt himself to be an insignificant chip fallen among the wheels of a machine whose action he did not understand but which was working well 
 he and the other prisoners were taken to the right side of the field to a large white house with an immense garden not far from the convent this was prince house where pierre had often been in other days and which as he learned from the talk of the soldiers was now occupied by the marshal the duke of eckmuhl davout 
 they were taken to the entrance and led into the house one by one pierre was the sixth to enter he was conducted through a glass gallery an anteroom and a hall which were familiar to him into a long low study at the door of which stood an adjutant 
 davout spectacles on nose sat bent over a table at the further end of the room pierre went close up to him but davout evidently consulting a paper that lay before him did not look up without raising his eyes he said in a low voice 
 who are you 
 pierre was silent because he was incapable of uttering a word to him davout was not merely a french general but a man notorious for his cruelty looking at his cold face as he sat like a stern schoolmaster who was prepared to wait awhile for an answer pierre felt that every instant of delay might cost him his life but he did not know what to say he did not venture to repeat what he had said at his first examination yet to disclose his rank and position was dangerous and embarrassing so he was silent but before he had decided what to do davout raised his head pushed his spectacles back on his forehead screwed up his eyes and looked intently at him 
 i know that man he said in a cold measured tone evidently calculated to frighten pierre 
 the chill that had been running down back now seized his head as in a vise 
 you cannot know me general i have never seen you 
 he is a russian spy davout interrupted addressing another general who was present but whom pierre had not noticed 
 davout turned away with an unexpected reverberation in his voice pierre rapidly began 
 no monseigneur he said suddenly remembering that davout was a duke no monseigneur you cannot have known me i am a militia officer and have not quitted moscow 
 your name asked davout 
 bezukhov 
 what proof have i that you are not lying 
 monseigneur exclaimed pierre not in an offended but in a pleading voice 
 davout looked up and gazed intently at him for some seconds they looked at one another and that look saved pierre apart from conditions of war and law that look established human relations between the two men at that moment an immense number of things passed dimly through both their minds and they realized that they were both children of humanity and were brothers 
 at the first glance when davout had only raised his head from the papers where human affairs and lives were indicated by numbers pierre was merely a circumstance and davout could have shot him without burdening his conscience with an evil deed but now he saw in him a human being he reflected for a moment 
 how can you show me that you are telling the truth said davout coldly 
 pierre remembered ramballe and named him and his regiment and the street where the house was 
 you are not what you say returned davout 
 in a trembling faltering voice pierre began adducing proofs of the truth of his statements 
 but at that moment an adjutant entered and reported something to davout 
 davout brightened up at the news the adjutant brought and began buttoning up his uniform it seemed that he had quite forgotten pierre 
 when the adjutant reminded him of the prisoner he jerked his head in direction with a frown and ordered him to be led away but where they were to take him pierre did not know back to the coach house or to the place of execution his companions had pointed out to him as they crossed the field 
 he turned his head and saw that the adjutant was putting another question to davout 
 yes of course replied davout but what this yes meant pierre did not know 
 pierre could not afterwards remember how he went whether it was far or in which direction his faculties were quite numbed he was stupefied and noticing nothing around him went on moving his legs as the others did till they all stopped and he stopped too the only thought in his mind at that time was who was it that had really sentenced him to death not the men on the commission that had first examined him not one of them wished to or evidently could have done it it was not davout who had looked at him in so human a way in another moment davout would have realized that he was doing wrong but just then the adjutant had come in and interrupted him the adjutant also had evidently had no evil intent though he might have refrained from coming in then who was executing him killing him depriving him of life him pierre with all his memories aspirations hopes and thoughts who was doing this and pierre felt that it was no one 
 it was a system a concurrence of circumstances 
 a system of some sort was killing him pierre depriving him of life of everything annihilating him

 originality of paris 
 during the last two years as we have said paris had witnessed more than one insurrection 
 nothing is generally more singularly calm than the physiognomy of paris during an uprising beyond the bounds of the rebellious quarters 
 paris very speedily accustoms herself to is only a paris has so many affairs on hand that she does not put herself out for so small a matter 
 these colossal cities alone can offer such spectacles these immense enclosures alone can contain at the same time civil war and an odd and indescribable tranquillity 
 ordinarily when an insurrection commences when the hears the drum the call to arms the general alarm he contents himself with the remark 
 there appears to be a squabble in the rue 
 or 
 in the faubourg 
 often he adds carelessly 
 or somewhere in that direction 
 later on when the and mournful hubbub of musketry and firing by platoons becomes audible the shopkeeper says 
 getting hot 
 hullo getting hot 
 a moment later the riot approaches and gains in force he shuts up his shop precipitately hastily dons his uniform that is to say he places his merchandise in safety and risks his own person 
 men fire in a square in a passage in a blind alley they take and the barricade blood flows the riddles the fronts of the houses the balls kill people in their beds corpses encumber the streets 
 a few streets away the shock of can be heard in the cafes 
 the theatres open their doors and present vaudevilles the curious laugh and chat a couple of paces distant from these streets filled with war 
 go their way are going to a dinner somewhere in town 
 sometimes in the very quarter where the fighting is going on 
 in a fusillade was stopped to allow a wedding party to pass 
 at the time of the insurrection of in the rue a little infirm old man pushing a surmounted by a tricolored rag in which he had carafes filled with some sort of liquid went and came from barricade to troops and from troops to the barricade offering his glasses of cocoa to the government now to anarchy 
 nothing can be stranger and this is the peculiar character of uprisings in paris which cannot be found in any other capital to this end two things are requisite the size of paris and its gayety the city of voltaire and napoleon is necessary 
 on this occasion however in the resort to arms of june th the great city felt something which was perhaps stronger than itself it was afraid 
 closed doors windows and shutters were to be seen everywhere in the most distant and most disinterested quarters 
 the courageous took to arms the poltroons hid 
 the busy and heedless disappeared 
 many streets were empty at four in the morning 
 alarming details were hawked about fatal news was disseminated that they were masters of the there were six hundred of them in the cloister of alone entrenched and embattled in the church that the line was not to be depended on that armand carrel had been to see marshal clausel and that the marshal had said get a regiment first that lafayette was ill but that he had said to them nevertheless 
 i am with you 
 i will follow you wherever there is room for a chair that one must be on guard that at night there would be people pillaging isolated dwellings in the deserted corners of paris there the imagination of the police that anne radcliffe mixed up with the government was recognizable that a battery had been established in the rue aubry le boucher that lobau and bugeaud were putting their heads together and that at midnight or at daybreak at latest four columns would march simultaneously on the centre of the uprising the first coming from the bastille the second from the porte the third from the greve the fourth from the halles that perhaps also the troops would evacuate paris and withdraw to the that no one knew what would happen but that this time it certainly was serious 
 people busied themselves over marshal hesitations 
 why did not he attack at once 
 it is certain that he was profoundly absorbed the old lion seemed to scent an unknown monster in that gloom 
 evening came the theatres did not open the patrols circulated with an air of irritation were searched suspicious persons were arrested 
 by nine more than eight hundred persons had been arrested the prefecture of police was encumbered with them so was the conciergerie so was la force 
 at the conciergerie in particular the long vault which is called the rue de paris was littered with trusses of straw upon which lay a heap of prisoners whom the man of lyons lagrange harangued valiantly 
 all that straw rustled by all these men produced the sound of a heavy shower 
 elsewhere prisoners slept in the open air in the meadows piled on top of each other 
 anxiety reigned everywhere and a certain tremor which was not habitual with paris 
 people barricaded themselves in their houses wives and mothers were uneasy nothing was to be heard but this 
 ah my god he has not come home 
 there was hardly even the distant rumble of a vehicle to be heard 
 people listened on their thresholds to the rumors the shouts the tumult the dull and indistinct sounds to the things that were said 
 it is cavalry or 
 those are the caissons galloping to the trumpets the drums the firing and above all to that lamentable alarm peal from 
 they waited for the first men sprang up at the corners of the streets and disappeared shouting 
 go home 
 and people made haste to bolt their doors 
 they said 
 how will all this end from moment to moment in proportion as the darkness descended paris seemed to take on a more mournful hue from the formidable flaming of the revolt

 from prince house the prisoners were led straight down the field to the left of the nunnery as far as a kitchen garden in which a post had been set up beyond that post a fresh pit had been dug in the ground and near the post and the pit a large crowd stood in a semicircle the crowd consisted of a few russians and many of soldiers who were not on duty germans italians and frenchmen in a variety of uniforms to the right and left of the post stood rows of french troops in blue uniforms with red epaulets and high boots and shakos 
 the prisoners were placed in a certain order according to the list pierre was sixth and were led to the post several drums suddenly began to beat on both sides of them and at that sound pierre felt as if part of his soul had been torn away he lost the power of thinking or understanding he could only hear and see and he had only one wish that the frightful thing that had to happen should happen quickly pierre looked round at his fellow prisoners and scrutinized them 
 the two first were convicts with shaven heads one was tall and thin the other dark shaggy and sinewy with a flat nose the third was a domestic serf about years old with grizzled hair and a plump body the fourth was a peasant a very handsome man with a broad beard and black eyes the fifth was a factory hand a thin lad of eighteen in a loose coat 
 pierre heard the french consulting whether to shoot them separately or two at a time in couples replied the officer in command in a calm voice there was a stir in the ranks of the soldiers and it was evident that they were all hurrying not as men hurry to do something they understand but as people hurry to finish a necessary but unpleasant and incomprehensible task 
 a french official wearing a scarf came up to the right of the row of prisoners and read out the sentence in russian and in french 
 then two pairs of frenchmen approached the criminals and at the command took the two convicts who stood first in the row the convicts stopped when they reached the post and while sacks were being brought looked dumbly around as a wounded beast looks at an approaching huntsman one crossed himself continually the other scratched his back and made a movement of the lips resembling a smile with hurried hands the soldiers blindfolded them drawing the sacks over their heads and bound them to the post 
 twelve sharpshooters with muskets stepped out of the ranks with a firm regular tread and halted eight paces from the post pierre turned away to avoid seeing what was going to happen suddenly a crackling rolling noise was heard which seemed to him louder than the most terrific thunder and he looked round there was some smoke and the frenchmen were doing something near the pit with pale faces and trembling hands two more prisoners were led up in the same way and with similar looks these two glanced vainly at the onlookers with only a silent appeal for protection in their eyes evidently unable to understand or believe what was going to happen to them they could not believe it because they alone knew what their life meant to them and so they neither understood nor believed that it could be taken from them 
 again pierre did not wish to look and again turned away but again the sound as of a frightful explosion struck his ear and at the same moment he saw smoke blood and the pale scared faces of the frenchmen who were again doing something by the post their trembling hands impeding one another pierre breathing heavily looked around as if asking what it meant the same question was expressed in all the looks that met his 
 on the faces of all the russians and of the french soldiers and officers without exception he read the same dismay horror and conflict that were in his own heart but who after all is doing this they are all suffering as i am who then is it who flashed for an instant through his mind 
 sharpshooters of the th forward shouted someone the fifth prisoner the one next to pierre was led away alone pierre did not understand that he was saved that he and the rest had been brought there only to witness the execution with horror and no sense of joy or relief he gazed at what was taking place the fifth man was the factory lad in the loose cloak the moment they laid hands on him he sprang aside in terror and clutched at pierre pierre shuddered and shook himself free the lad was unable to walk they dragged him along holding him up under the arms and he screamed when they got him to the post he grew quiet as if he suddenly understood something whether he understood that screaming was useless or whether he thought it incredible that men should kill him at any rate he took his stand at the post waiting to be blindfolded like the others and like a wounded animal looked around him with glittering eyes 
 pierre was no longer able to turn away and close his eyes his curiosity and agitation like that of the whole crowd reached the highest pitch at this fifth murder like the others this fifth man seemed calm he wrapped his loose cloak closer and rubbed one bare foot with the other 
 when they began to blindfold him he himself adjusted the knot which hurt the back of his head then when they propped him against the bloodstained post he leaned back and not being comfortable in that position straightened himself adjusted his feet and leaned back again more comfortably pierre did not take his eyes from him and did not miss his slightest movement 
 probably a word of command was given and was followed by the reports of eight muskets but try as he would pierre could not afterwards remember having heard the slightest sound of the shots he only saw how the workman suddenly sank down on the cords that held him how blood showed itself in two places how the ropes slackened under the weight of the hanging body and how the workman sat down his head hanging unnaturally and one leg bent under him pierre ran up to the post no one hindered him pale frightened people were doing something around the workman the lower jaw of an old frenchman with a thick mustache trembled as he untied the ropes the body collapsed the soldiers dragged it awkwardly from the post and began pushing it into the pit 
 they all plainly and certainly knew that they were criminals who must hide the traces of their guilt as quickly as possible 
 pierre glanced into the pit and saw that the factory lad was lying with his knees close up to his head and one shoulder higher than the other that shoulder rose and fell rhythmically and convulsively but spadefuls of earth were already being thrown over the whole body one of the soldiers evidently suffering shouted gruffly and angrily at pierre to go back but pierre did not understand him and remained near the post and no one drove him away 
 when the pit had been filled up a command was given pierre was taken back to his place and the rows of troops on both sides of the post made a half turn and went past it at a measured pace the sharpshooters with discharged muskets standing in the center of the circle ran back to their places as the companies passed by 
 pierre gazed now with dazed eyes at these sharpshooters who ran in couples out of the circle all but one rejoined their companies this one a young soldier his face deadly pale his shako pushed back and his musket resting on the ground still stood near the pit at the spot from which he had fired he swayed like a drunken man taking some steps forward and back to save himself from falling an old noncommissioned officer ran out of the ranks and taking him by the elbow dragged him to his company the crowd of russians and frenchmen began to disperse they all went away silently and with drooping heads 
 that will teach them to start fires said one of the frenchmen 
 pierre glanced round at the speaker and saw that it was a soldier who was trying to find some relief after what had been done but was not able to do so without finishing what he had begun to say he made a hopeless movement with his arm and went away

 some explanations with regard to the origin of poetry the influence of an academician on this poetry 
 at the instant when the insurrection arising from the shock of the populace and the military in front of the arsenal started a movement in advance and towards the rear in the multitude which was following the hearse and which through the whole length of the boulevards weighed so to speak on the head of the procession there arose a frightful ebb 
 the rout was shaken their ranks were broken all ran fled made their escape some with shouts of attack others with the pallor of flight the great river which covered the boulevards divided in a twinkling overflowed to right and left and spread in torrents over two hundred streets at once with the roar of a sewer that has broken loose 
 at that moment a ragged child who was coming down through the rue menilmontant holding in his hand a branch of blossoming laburnum which he had just plucked on the heights of belleville caught sight of an old in the of a shop 
 mother going to borrow your machine 
 and off he ran with the pistol 
 two minutes later a flood of frightened bourgeois who were fleeing through the rue amelot and the rue basse encountered the lad brandishing his pistol and singing la nuit on ne voit rien 
 le jour on voit tres bien 
 ecrit apocrypha 
 le bourgeois 
 pratiquez la vertu 
 tutu chapeau pointu 
 at night one sees nothing by day one sees very well the bourgeois gets flurried over an apocryphal scrawl practice virtue tutu pointed hat 
 it was little gavroche on his way to the wars 
 on the boulevard he noticed that the pistol had no trigger 
 who was the author of that couplet which served to punctuate his march and of all the other songs which he was fond of singing on occasion we know not 
 who does know 
 himself perhaps 
 however gavroche was well up in all the popular tunes in circulation and he mingled with them his own chirpings 
 an observing urchin and a rogue he made a potpourri of the voices of nature and the voices of paris 
 he combined the repertory of the birds with the repertory of the workshops he was acquainted with thieves a tribe contiguous to his own he had it appears been for three months apprenticed to a printer he had one day executed a commission for m one of the forty 
 gavroche was a gamin of letters 
 moreover gavroche had no suspicion of the fact that when he had offered the hospitality of his elephant to two brats on that villainously rainy night it was to his own brothers that he had played the part of providence 
 his brothers in the evening his father in the morning that is what his night had been like on quitting the rue des ballets at daybreak he had returned in haste to the elephant had artistically extracted from it the two brats had shared with them some sort of breakfast which he had invented and had then gone away confiding them to that good mother the street who had brought him up almost entirely 
 on leaving them he had appointed to meet them at the same spot in the evening and had left them this discourse by way of a farewell 
 i break a cane otherwise expressed i cut my stick or as they say at the court i file off 
 if you find papa and mamma young uns come back here this evening 
 scramble you up some supper and give you a shakedown 
 the two children picked up by some policeman and placed in the refuge or stolen by some mountebank or having simply strayed off in that immense chinese puzzle of a paris did not return 
 the lowest depths of the actual social world are full of these lost traces 
 gavroche did not see them again ten or twelve weeks had elapsed since that night 
 more than once he had scratched the back of his head and said 
 where the devil are my two children 
 in the meantime he had arrived pistol in hand in the rue du he noticed that there was but one shop open in that street and a matter worthy of reflection that was a shop 
 this presented a providential occasion to eat another before entering the unknown gavroche halted fumbled in his fob turned his pocket inside out found nothing not even a sou and began to shout 
 help 
 it is hard to miss the last cake 
 nevertheless gavroche pursued his way 
 two minutes later he was in the rue while traversing the rue du he felt called upon to make good the loss of the which had been impossible and he indulged himself in the immense delight of tearing down the theatre posters in broad daylight 
 a little further on on catching sight of a group of persons who seemed to be landed proprietors he shrugged his shoulders and spit out at random before him this mouthful of philosophical bile as they passed 
 how fat those moneyed men are 
 drunk 
 they just wallow in good dinners 
 ask em what they do with their money they know 
 they eat it what they do 
 as much as their bellies will hold

 chapter xii 
 
 after the execution pierre was separated from the rest of the prisoners and placed alone in a small ruined and befouled church 
 toward evening a noncommissioned officer entered with two soldiers and told him that he had been pardoned and would now go to the barracks for the prisoners of war without understanding what was said to him pierre got up and went with the soldiers they took him to the upper end of the field where there were some sheds built of charred planks beams and battens and led him into one of them in the darkness some twenty different men surrounded pierre he looked at them without understanding who they were why they were there or what they wanted of him he heard what they said but did not understand the meaning of the words and made no kind of deduction from or application of them he replied to questions they put to him but did not consider who was listening to his replies nor how they would understand them he looked at their faces and figures but they all seemed to him equally meaningless 
 from the moment pierre had witnessed those terrible murders committed by men who did not wish to commit them it was as if the mainspring of his life on which everything depended and which made everything appear alive had suddenly been wrenched out and everything had collapsed into a heap of meaningless rubbish though he did not acknowledge it to himself his faith in the right ordering of the universe in humanity in his own soul and in god had been destroyed he had experienced this before but never so strongly as now when similar doubts had assailed him before they had been the result of his own wrongdoing and at the bottom of his heart he had felt that relief from his despair and from those doubts was to be found within himself but now he felt that the universe had crumbled before his eyes and only meaningless ruins remained and this not by any fault of his own he felt that it was not in his power to regain faith in the meaning of life 
 around him in the darkness men were standing and evidently something about him interested them greatly they were telling him something and asking him something then they led him away somewhere and at last he found himself in a corner of the shed among men who were laughing and talking on all sides 
 well then mates that very prince who some voice at the other end of the shed was saying with a strong emphasis on the word who 
 sitting silent and motionless on a heap of straw against the wall pierre sometimes opened and sometimes closed his eyes but as soon as he closed them he saw before him the dreadful face of the factory lad especially dreadful because of its simplicity and the faces of the murderers even more dreadful because of their disquiet and he opened his eyes again and stared vacantly into the darkness around him 
 beside him in a stooping position sat a small man of whose presence he was first made aware by a strong smell of perspiration which came from him every time he moved this man was doing something to his legs in the darkness and though pierre could not see his face he felt that the man continually glanced at him on growing used to the darkness pierre saw that the man was taking off his leg bands and the way he did it aroused interest 
 having unwound the string that tied the band on one leg he carefully coiled it up and immediately set to work on the other leg glancing up at pierre while one hand hung up the first string the other was already unwinding the band on the second leg in this way having carefully removed the leg bands by deft circular motions of his arm following one another uninterruptedly the man hung the leg bands up on some pegs fixed above his head then he took out a knife cut something closed the knife placed it under the head of his bed and seating himself comfortably clasped his arms round his lifted knees and fixed his eyes on pierre the latter was conscious of something pleasant comforting and well rounded in these deft movements in the arrangements in his corner and even in his very smell and he looked at the man without taking his eyes from him 
 seen a lot of trouble sir eh the little man suddenly said 
 and there was so much kindliness and simplicity in his singsong voice that pierre tried to reply but his jaw trembled and he felt tears rising to his eyes the little fellow giving pierre no time to betray his confusion instantly continued in the same pleasant tones 
 eh lad fret said he in the tender singsong caressing voice old russian peasant women employ fret friend suffer an hour live for an age how it is my dear fellow and here we live thank heaven without offense among these folk too there are good men as well as bad said he and still speaking he turned on his knees with a supple movement got up coughed and went off to another part of the shed 
 eh you rascal pierre heard the same kind voice saying at the other end of the shed so come you rascal she remembers now now do 
 and the soldier pushing away a little dog that was jumping up at him returned to his place and sat down in his hands he had something wrapped in a rag 
 here eat a bit sir said he resuming his former respectful tone as he unwrapped and offered pierre some baked potatoes we had soup for dinner and the potatoes are grand 
 pierre had not eaten all day and the smell of the potatoes seemed extremely pleasant to him he thanked the soldier and began to eat 
 well are they all right said the soldier with a smile you should do like this 
 he took a potato drew out his clasp knife cut the potato into two equal halves on the palm of his hand sprinkled some salt on it from the rag and handed it to pierre 
 the potatoes are grand he said once more eat some like that 
 pierre thought he had never eaten anything that tasted better 
 oh all right said he but why did they shoot those poor fellows the last one was hardly twenty 
 tss tt said the little man ah what a sin what a sin he added quickly and as if his words were always waiting ready in his mouth and flew out involuntarily he went on how was it sir that you stayed in moscow 
 i think they would come so soon i stayed accidentally replied pierre 
 and how did they arrest you dear lad at your house 
 no i went to look at the fire and they arrested me there and tried me as an incendiary 
 where law injustice put in the little man 
 and have you been here long pierre asked as he munched the last of the potato 
 i it was last sunday they took me out of a hospital in moscow 
 why are you a soldier then 
 yes we are soldiers of the apsheron regiment i was dying of fever we told anything there were some twenty of us lying there we had no idea never guessed at all 
 and do you feel sad here pierre inquired 
 how can one help it lad my name is platon and the surname is karataev he added evidently wishing to make it easier for pierre to address him they call me little falcon in the regiment how is one to help feeling sad moscow the mother of cities how can one see all this and not feel sad but the maggot gnaws the cabbage yet dies first what the old folks used to tell us he added rapidly 
 what what did you say asked pierre 
 who i said karataev i say things happen not as we plan but as god judges he replied thinking that he was repeating what he had said before and immediately continued 
 well and you have you a family estate sir and a house so you have abundance then and a housewife and your old parents are they still living he asked 
 and though it was too dark for pierre to see he felt that a suppressed smile of kindliness puckered the lips as he put these questions he seemed grieved that pierre had no parents especially that he had no mother 
 a wife for counsel a for welcome but none as dear as own mother said he well and have you little ones he went on asking 
 again negative answer seemed to distress him and he hastened to add 
 never mind young folks yet and please god may still have some the great thing is to live in harmony 
 but all the same now pierre could not help saying 
 ah my dear fellow rejoined karataev never decline a prison or a sack 
 he seated himself more comfortably and coughed evidently preparing to tell a long story 
 well my dear fellow i was still living at home he began we had a homestead plenty of land we peasants lived well and our house was one to thank god for when father and we went out mowing there were seven of us we lived well we were real peasants it so happened 
 and platon karataev told a long story of how he had gone into copse to take wood how he had been caught by the keeper had been tried flogged and sent to serve as a soldier 
 well lad and a smile changed the tone of his voice we thought it was a misfortune but it turned out a blessing if it had not been for my sin my brother would have had to go as a soldier but he my younger brother had five little ones while i you see only left a wife behind we had a little girl but god took her before i went as a soldier i come home on leave and tell you how it was i look and see that they are living better than before the yard full of cattle the women at home two brothers away earning wages and only michael the youngest at home father he says all my children are the same to me it hurts the same whichever finger gets bitten but if platon been shaved for a soldier michael would have had to go called us all to him and will you believe it placed us in front of the icons michael he says come here and bow down to his feet and you young woman you bow down too and you grandchildren also bow down before him do you understand he says how it is dear fellow fate looks for a head but we are always judging not well not right our luck is like water in a dragnet you pull at it and it bulges but when drawn it out empty how it is 
 and platon shifted his seat on the straw 
 after a short silence he rose 
 well i think you must be sleepy said he and began rapidly crossing himself and repeating 
 lord jesus christ holy saint nicholas frola and lavra lord jesus christ holy saint nicholas frola and lavra lord jesus christ have mercy on us and save us he concluded then bowed to the ground got up sighed and sat down again on his heap of straw the way lay me down like a stone o god and raise me up like a loaf he muttered as he lay down pulling his coat over him 
 what prayer was that you were saying asked pierre 
 eh murmured platon who had almost fallen asleep what was i saying i was praying you pray 
 yes i do said pierre but what was that you said frola and lavra 
 well of course replied platon quickly the horses saints one must pity the animals too eh the rascal now curled up and got warm you daughter of a bitch said karataev touching the dog that lay at his feet and again turning over he fell asleep immediately 
 sounds of crying and screaming came from somewhere in the distance outside and flames were visible through the cracks of the shed but inside it was quiet and dark for a long time pierre did not sleep but lay with eyes open in the darkness listening to the regular snoring of platon who lay beside him and he felt that the world that had been shattered was once more stirring in his soul with a new beauty and on new and unshakable foundations

 gavroche on the march 
 the brandishing of a triggerless pistol grasped in hand in the open street is so much of a public function that gavroche felt his fervor increasing with every moment 
 amid the scraps of the marseillaise which he was singing he shouted 
 all goes well 
 i suffer a great deal in my left paw all broken up with rheumatism but satisfied citizens 
 all that the bourgeois have to do is to bear themselves well sneeze them out subversive couplets 
 what are the police spies 
 dogs 
 and just like to have one of them at the end of my pistol 
 just from the boulevard my friends 
 getting hot there getting into a little boil simmering 
 time to skim the pot forward march men 
 let an impure blood inundate the furrows i give my days to my country i shall never see my concubine more nini finished yes nini 
 but never mind 
 long live joy fight crebleu 
 had enough of despotism 
 at that moment the horse of a lancer of the national guard having fallen gavroche laid his pistol on the pavement and picked up the man then he assisted in raising the horse 
 after which he picked up his pistol and resumed his way 
 in the rue de thorigny all was peace and silence 
 this apathy peculiar to the marais presented a contrast with the vast surrounding uproar 
 four gossips were chatting in a doorway 
 scotland has trios of witches paris has quartettes of old gossiping hags and the thou shalt be king could be quite as mournfully hurled at bonaparte in the carrefour baudoyer as at macbeth on the heath of armuyr 
 the croak would be almost identical 
 the gossips of the rue de thorigny busied themselves only with their own concerns 
 three of them were portresses and the fourth was a with her basket on her back 
 all four of them seemed to be standing at the four corners of old age which are decrepitude decay ruin and sadness 
 the was humble 
 in this society it is the who salutes and the portress who patronizes this is caused by the corner for refuse which is fat or lean according to the will of the portresses and after the fancy of the one who makes the heap 
 there may be kindness in the broom 
 this was a grateful creature and she smiled with what a smile on the three portresses 
 things of this nature were said 
 ah by the way is your cat still cross 
 good gracious cats are naturally the enemies of dogs you know the dogs who complain 
 and people also 
 but the fleas from a cat go after people 
 not the trouble dogs are dangerous 
 i remember one year when there were so many dogs that it was necessary to put it in the newspapers 
 that was at the time when there were at the tuileries great sheep that drew the little carriage of the king of rome do you remember the king of rome 
 i liked the duc de bordeau better 
 i knew louis xviii 
 i prefer louis xviii 
 meat is awfully dear it mother patagon 
 ah mention it the shop is a horror a horrible afford anything but the poor cuts nowadays 
 here the interposed 
 ladies business is dull 
 the refuse heaps are miserable no one throws anything away any more 
 they eat everything 
 there are poorer people than you la vargouleme 
 ah true replied the with deference i have a profession 
 a pause succeeded and the yielding to that necessity for boasting which lies at the bottom of man added 
 in the morning on my return home i pick over my basket i sort my things 
 this makes heaps in my room 
 i put the rags in a basket the cores and stalks in a bucket the linen in my cupboard the woollen stuff in my commode the old papers in the corner of the window the things that are good to eat in my bowl the bits of glass in my fireplace the old shoes behind my door and the bones under my bed 
 gavroche had stopped behind her and was listening 
 old ladies said he what do you mean by talking politics 
 he was assailed by a broadside composed of a quadruple howl 
 another rascal 
 that got in his paddle 
 a pistol 
 well like to know what sort of a brat this is 
 that sort of animal is never easy unless overturning the authorities 
 gavroche disdainfully contented himself by way of reprisal with elevating the tip of his nose with his thumb and opening his hand wide 
 the cried 
 you malicious little wretch 
 the one who answered to the name of patagon clapped her hands together in horror

 all at once he heard a shout behind him it was the portress patagon who had followed him and who was shaking her fist at him in the distance and crying 
 nothing but a bastard 
 oh

 he gazed at his pistol with an air of reproach which seemed an attempt to appease it

 soldiers three officers and two officials were confined in the shed in which pierre had been placed and where he remained for four weeks 
 when pierre remembered them afterwards they all seemed misty figures to him except platon karataev who always remained in his mind a most vivid and precious memory and the personification of everything russian kindly and round when pierre saw his neighbor next morning at dawn the first impression of him as of something round was fully confirmed whole figure in a french overcoat girdled with a cord a cap and bast shoes was round his head was quite round his back chest shoulders and even his arms which he held as if ever ready to embrace something were rounded his pleasant smile and his large gentle brown eyes were also round 
 platon karataev must have been fifty judging by his stories of campaigns he had been in told as by an old soldier he did not himself know his age and was quite unable to determine it but his brilliantly white strong teeth which showed in two unbroken semicircles when he laughed as he often did were all sound and good there was not a gray hair in his beard or on his head and his whole body gave an impression of suppleness and especially of firmness and endurance 
 his face despite its fine rounded wrinkles had an expression of innocence and youth his voice was pleasant and musical but the chief peculiarity of his speech was its directness and appositeness it was evident that he never considered what he had said or was going to say and consequently the rapidity and justice of his intonation had an irresistible persuasiveness 
 his physical strength and agility during the first days of his imprisonment were such that he seemed not to know what fatigue and sickness meant every night before lying down he said lord lay me down as a stone and raise me up as a loaf and every morning on getting up he said i lay down and curled up i get up and shake myself and indeed he only had to lie down to fall asleep like a stone and he only had to shake himself to be ready without a delay for some work just as children are ready to play directly they awake he could do everything not very well but not badly he baked cooked sewed planed and mended boots he was always busy and only at night allowed himself conversation of which he was fond and songs he did not sing like a trained singer who knows he is listened to but like the birds evidently giving vent to the sounds in the same way that one stretches oneself or walks about to get rid of stiffness and the sounds were always mournful delicate and almost feminine and his face at such times was very serious 
 having been taken prisoner and allowed his beard to grow he seemed to have thrown off all that had been forced upon him everything military and alien to himself and had returned to his former peasant habits 
 a soldier on leave a shirt outside breeches he would say 
 he did not like talking about his life as a soldier though he did not complain and often mentioned that he had not been flogged once during the whole of his army service when he related anything it was generally some old and evidently precious memory of his christian life as he called his peasant existence the proverbs of which his talk was full were for the most part not the coarse and indecent saws soldiers employ but those folk sayings which taken without a context seem so insignificant but when used appositely suddenly acquire a significance of profound wisdom 
 he would often say the exact opposite of what he had said on a previous occasion yet both would be right he liked to talk and he talked well adorning his speech with terms of endearment and with folk sayings which pierre thought he invented himself but the chief charm of his talk lay in the fact that the commonest events sometimes just such as pierre had witnessed without taking notice of them assumed in a character of solemn fitness he liked to hear the folk tales one of the soldiers used to tell of an evening they were always the same but most of all he liked to hear stories of real life he would smile joyfully when listening to such stories now and then putting in a word or asking a question to make the moral beauty of what he was told clear to himself karataev had no attachments friendships or love as pierre understood them but loved and lived affectionately with everything life brought him in contact with particularly with man not any particular man but those with whom he happened to be he loved his dog his comrades the french and pierre who was his neighbor but pierre felt that in spite of affectionate tenderness for him by which he unconsciously gave spiritual life its due he would not have grieved for a moment at parting from him and pierre began to feel in the same way toward karataev 
 to all the other prisoners platon karataev seemed a most ordinary soldier they called him little falcon or platosha chaffed him and sent him on errands but to pierre he always remained what he had seemed that first night an unfathomable rounded eternal personification of the spirit of simplicity and truth 
 platon karataev knew nothing by heart except his prayers when he began to speak he seemed not to know how he would conclude 
 sometimes pierre struck by the meaning of his words would ask him to repeat them but platon could never recall what he had said a moment before just as he never could repeat to pierre the words of his favorite song native and birch tree and my heart is sick occurred in it but when spoken and not sung no meaning could be got out of it he did not and could not understand the meaning of words apart from their context every word and action of his was the manifestation of an activity unknown to him which was his life but his life as he regarded it had no meaning as a separate thing it had meaning only as part of a whole of which he was always conscious his words and actions flowed from him as evenly inevitably and spontaneously as fragrance exhales from a flower he could not understand the value or significance of any word or deed taken separately

 just indignation of a 
 the worthy who had chased from his shop the two little fellows to whom gavroche had opened the paternal interior of the elephant was at that moment in his shop engaged in shaving an old soldier of the legion who had served under the empire they were talking 
 the had naturally spoken to the veteran of the riot then of general lamarque and from lamarque they had passed to the emperor 
 thence sprang up a conversation between barber and soldier which prudhomme had he been present would have enriched with arabesques and which he would have entitled dialogue between the razor and the sword 
 how did the emperor ride sir said the barber 
 badly 
 he did not know how to he never fell 
 did he have fine horses 
 he must have had fine horses 
 on the day when he gave me my cross i noticed his beast it was a racing mare perfectly white 
 her ears were very wide apart her saddle deep a fine head marked with a black star a very long neck strongly articulated knees prominent ribs oblique shoulders and a powerful crupper 
 a little more than fifteen hands in height 
 a pretty horse remarked the 
 it was his beast 
 the felt that after this observation a short silence would be fitting so he conformed himself to it and then went on 
 the emperor was never wounded but once was he sir 
 the old soldier replied with the calm and sovereign tone of a man who had been there 
 in the heel 
 at ratisbon 
 i never saw him so well dressed as on that day 
 he was as neat as a new sou 
 and you mr veteran you must have been often wounded 
 i said the soldier ah not to amount to anything 
 at marengo i received two on the back of my neck a bullet in the right arm at austerlitz another in the left hip at jena at friedland a thrust from a bayonet the moskowa seven or eight no matter where at lutzen a splinter of a shell crushed one of my fingers 
 ah and then at waterloo a ball from a biscaien in the thigh all 
 how fine that is exclaimed the in pindaric accents to die on the field of battle 
 on my word of honor rather than die in bed of an illness slowly a bit by bit each day with drugs cataplasms syringes medicines i should prefer to receive a in my belly 
 not over fastidious said the soldier 
 he had hardly spoken when a fearful crash shook the shop the had suddenly been fractured 
 the turned pale 
 ah good god he exclaimed one of them 
 what 
 a 
 here it is said the soldier 
 and he picked up something that was rolling about the floor it was a pebble 
 the ran to the broken window and beheld gavroche fleeing at the full speed towards the marche as he passed the shop gavroche who had the two brats still in his mind had not been able to resist the impulse to say good day to him and had flung a stone through his panes 
 you see shrieked the who from white had turned blue that fellow returns and does mischief for the pure pleasure of it what has any one done to that gamin

 chapter xiv 
 
 when princess mary heard from nicholas that her brother was with the rostovs at yaroslavl she at once prepared to go there in spite of her efforts to dissuade her and not merely to go herself but to take her nephew with her whether it were difficult or easy possible or impossible she did not ask and did not want to know it was her duty not only herself to be near her brother who was perhaps dying but to do everything possible to take his son to him and so she prepared to set off that she had not heard from prince andrew himself princess mary attributed to his being too weak to write or to his considering the long journey too hard and too dangerous for her and his son 
 in a few days princess mary was ready to start her equipages were the huge family coach in which she had traveled to voronezh a semiopen trap and a baggage cart with her traveled mademoiselle bourienne little nicholas and his tutor her old nurse three maids tikhon and a young footman and courier her aunt had sent to accompany her 
 the usual route through moscow could not be thought of and the roundabout way princess mary was obliged to take through lipetsk ryazan vladimir and shuya was very long and as post horses were not everywhere obtainable very difficult and near ryazan where the french were said to have shown themselves was even dangerous 
 during this difficult journey mademoiselle bourienne dessalles and princess servants were astonished at her energy and firmness of spirit she went to bed later and rose earlier than any of them and no difficulties daunted her thanks to her activity and energy which infected her fellow travelers they approached yaroslavl by the end of the second week 
 the last days of her stay in voronezh had been the happiest of her life her love for rostov no longer tormented or agitated her it filled her whole soul had become an integral part of herself and she no longer struggled against it latterly she had become convinced that she loved and was beloved though she never said this definitely to herself in words she had become convinced of it at her last interview with nicholas when he had come to tell her that her brother was with the rostovs not by a single word had nicholas alluded to the fact that prince relations with natasha might if he recovered be renewed but princess mary saw by his face that he knew and thought of this 
 yet in spite of that his relation to her considerate delicate and loving not only remained unchanged but it sometimes seemed to princess mary that he was even glad that the family connection between them allowed him to express his friendship more freely she knew that she loved for the first and only time in her life and felt that she was beloved and was happy in regard to it 
 but this happiness on one side of her spiritual nature did not prevent her feeling grief for her brother with full force on the contrary that spiritual tranquility on the one side made it the more possible for her to give full play to her feeling for her brother that feeling was so strong at the moment of leaving voronezh that those who saw her off as they looked at her careworn despairing face felt sure she would fall ill on the journey but the very difficulties and preoccupations of the journey which she took so actively in hand saved her for a while from her grief and gave her strength 
 as always happens when traveling princess mary thought only of the journey itself forgetting its object but as she approached yaroslavl the thought of what might await her there not after many days but that very evening again presented itself to her and her agitation increased to its utmost limit 
 the courier who had been sent on in advance to find out where the rostovs were staying in yaroslavl and in what condition prince andrew was when he met the big coach just entering the town gates was appalled by the terrible pallor of the princess face that looked out at him from the window 
 i have found out everything your excellency the rostovs are staying at the merchant house in the square not far from here right above the volga said the courier 
 princess mary looked at him with frightened inquiry not understanding why he did not reply to what she chiefly wanted to know how was her brother mademoiselle bourienne put that question for her 
 how is the prince she asked 
 his excellency is staying in the same house with them 
 then he is alive thought princess mary and asked in a low voice how is he 
 the servants say he is still the same 
 what still the same might mean princess mary did not ask but with an unnoticed glance at little nicholas who was sitting in front of her looking with pleasure at the town she bowed her head and did not raise it again till the heavy coach rumbling shaking and swaying came to a stop the carriage steps clattered as they were let down 
 the carriage door was opened on the left there was water a great river and on the right a porch there were people at the entrance servants and a rosy girl with a large plait of black hair smiling as it seemed to princess mary in an unpleasantly affected way this was sonya princess mary ran up the steps this way this way said the girl with the same artificial smile and the princess found herself in the hall facing an elderly woman of oriental type who came rapidly to meet her with a look of emotion this was the countess she embraced princess mary and kissed her 
 mon enfant she muttered je vous aime et vous connais depuis longtemps 
 my child i love you and have known you a long time despite her excitement princess mary realized that this was the countess and that it was necessary to say something to her hardly knowing how she did it she contrived to utter a few polite phrases in french in the same tone as those that had been addressed to her and asked how is he 
 the doctor says that he is not in danger said the countess but as she spoke she raised her eyes with a sigh and her gesture conveyed a contradiction of her words 
 where is he can i see him can i asked the princess 
 one moment princess one moment my dear is this his son said the countess turning to little nicholas who was coming in with dessalles there will be room for everybody this is a big house oh what a lovely boy 
 the countess took princess mary into the drawing room where sonya was talking to mademoiselle bourienne the countess caressed the boy and the old count came in and welcomed the princess he had changed very much since princess mary had last seen him then he had been a brisk cheerful old man now he seemed a pitiful bewildered person while talking to princess mary he continually looked round as if asking everyone whether he was doing the right thing after the destruction of moscow and of his property thrown out of his accustomed groove he seemed to have lost the sense of his own significance and to feel that there was no longer a place for him in life 
 in spite of her one desire to see her brother as soon as possible and her vexation that at the moment when all she wanted was to see him they should be trying to entertain her and pretending to admire her nephew the princess noticed all that was going on around her and felt the necessity of submitting for a time to this new order of things which she had entered she knew it to be necessary and though it was hard for her she was not vexed with these people 
 this is my niece said the count introducing sonya you know her princess 
 princess mary turned to sonya and trying to stifle the hostile feeling that arose in her toward the girl she kissed her but she felt oppressed by the fact that the mood of everyone around her was so far from what was in her own heart 
 where is he she asked again addressing them all 
 he is downstairs natasha is with him answered sonya flushing we have sent to ask i think you must be tired princess 
 tears of vexation showed themselves in princess eyes she turned away and was about to ask the countess again how to go to him when light impetuous and seemingly buoyant steps were heard at the door the princess looked round and saw natasha coming in almost running that natasha whom she had liked so little at their meeting in moscow long since 
 but hardly had the princess looked at face before she realized that here was a real comrade in her grief and consequently a friend she ran to meet her embraced her and began to cry on her shoulder 
 as soon as natasha sitting at the head of prince bed heard of princess arrival she softly left his room and hastened to her with those swift steps that had sounded buoyant to princess mary 
 there was only one expression on her agitated face when she ran into the drawing room that of love boundless love for him for her and for all that was near to the man she loved and of pity suffering for others and passionate desire to give herself entirely to helping them it was plain that at that moment there was in heart no thought of herself or of her own relations with prince andrew 
 princess mary with her acute sensibility understood all this at the first glance at face and wept on her shoulder with sorrowful pleasure 
 come come to him mary said natasha leading her into the other room 
 princess mary raised her head dried her eyes and turned to natasha she felt that from her she would be able to understand and learn everything 
 how she began her question but stopped short 
 she felt that it was impossible to ask or to answer in words face eyes would eyes would have to tell her all more clearly and profoundly 
 natasha was gazing at her but seemed afraid and in doubt whether to say all she knew or not she seemed to feel that before those luminous eyes which penetrated into the very depths of her heart it was impossible not to tell the whole truth which she saw and suddenly lips twitched ugly wrinkles gathered round her mouth and covering her face with her hands she burst into sobs 
 princess mary understood 
 but she still hoped and asked in words she herself did not trust 
 but how is his wound what is his general condition 
 you you will see was all natasha could say 
 they sat a little while downstairs near his room till they had left off crying and were able to go to him with calm faces 
 how has his whole illness gone is it long since he grew worse when did this happen princess mary inquired 
 natasha told her that at first there had been danger from his feverish condition and the pain he suffered but at troitsa that had passed and the doctor had only been afraid of gangrene that danger had also passed when they reached yaroslavl the wound had begun to fester natasha knew all about such things as festering and the doctor had said that the festering might take a normal course then fever set in but the doctor had said the fever was not very serious 
 but two days ago this suddenly happened said natasha struggling with her sobs i know why but you will see what he is like 
 is he weaker thinner asked the princess 
 no not that but worse you will see o mary he is too good he cannot cannot live because

 in the meantime in the marche where the post had already been disarmed gavroche had just effected a junction with a band led by enjolras courfeyrac combeferre and feuilly they were armed after a fashion 
 bahorel and jean prouvaire had found them and swelled the group 
 enjolras had a combeferre the gun of a national guard bearing the number of his legion and in his belt two pistols which his unbuttoned coat allowed to be seen jean prouvaire an old cavalry musket bahorel a rifle courfeyrac was brandishing an unsheathed feuilly with a naked sword in his hand marched at their head shouting long live poland 
 they reached the quai morland 
 cravatless hatless breathless soaked by the rain with lightning in their eyes 
 gavroche accosted them calmly 
 where are we going 
 come along said courfeyrac 
 behind feuilly marched or rather bounded bahorel who was like a fish in water in a riot 
 he wore a scarlet waistcoat and indulged in the sort of words which break everything his waistcoat astounded a who cried in bewilderment 
 here are the reds 
 the reds the reds retorted bahorel 
 a queer kind of fear bourgeois 
 for my part i tremble before a poppy the little red hat inspires me with no alarm 
 take my advice bourgeois leave fear of the red to horned cattle 
 he caught sight of a corner of the wall on which was placarded the most peaceable sheet of paper in the world a permission to eat eggs a lenten admonition addressed by the archbishop of paris to his flock 
 bahorel exclaimed 
 flock a polite way of saying geese 
 and he tore the charge from the nail 
 this conquered gavroche from that instant gavroche set himself to study bahorel 
 bahorel observed enjolras you are wrong 
 you should have let that charge alone he is not the person with whom we have to deal you are wasting your wrath to no purpose 
 take care of your supply one does not fire out of the ranks with the soul any more than with a gun 
 each one in his own fashion enjolras retorted bahorel this prose shocks me i want to eat eggs without being permitted 
 your style is the hot and cold i am amusing myself 
 besides not wasting myself getting a start and if i tore down that charge hercle twas only to whet my appetite 
 this word hercle struck gavroche 
 he sought all occasions for learning and that of posters possessed his esteem he inquired of him 
 what does hercle mean 
 bahorel answered 
 it means cursed name of a dog in latin 
 here bahorel recognized at a window a pale young man with a black beard who was watching them as they passed probably a friend of the a b c he shouted to him 
 quick cartridges para bellum 
 a fine man true said gavroche who now understood latin 
 a tumultuous retinue accompanied artists young men affiliated to the cougourde of aix artisans longshoremen armed with clubs and bayonets some like combeferre with pistols thrust into their trousers 
 an old man who appeared to be extremely aged was walking in the band 
 he had no arms and he made great haste so that he might not be left behind although he had a thoughtful air 
 gavroche caught sight of him 
 keksekca said he to courfeyrac 
 an old duffer 
 it was m mabeuf

 chapter xv 
 
 when natasha opened prince door with a familiar movement and let princess mary pass into the room before her the princess felt the sobs in her throat hard as she had tried to prepare herself and now tried to remain tranquil she knew that she would be unable to look at him without tears 
 the princess understood what natasha had meant by the words two days ago this suddenly happened she understood those words to mean that he had suddenly softened and that this softening and gentleness were signs of approaching death as she stepped to the door she already saw in imagination face as she remembered it in childhood a gentle mild sympathetic face which he had rarely shown and which therefore affected her very strongly she was sure he would speak soft tender words to her such as her father had uttered before his death and that she would not be able to bear it and would burst into sobs in his presence yet sooner or later it had to be and she went in the sobs rose higher and higher in her throat as she more and more clearly distinguished his form and her shortsighted eyes tried to make out his features and then she saw his face and met his gaze 
 he was lying in a dressing gown on a divan surrounded by pillows he was thin and pale in one thin translucently white hand he held a handkerchief while with the other he stroked the delicate mustache he had grown moving his fingers slowly his eyes gazed at them as they entered 
 on seeing his face and meeting his eyes princess pace suddenly slackened she felt her tears dry up and her sobs ceased she suddenly felt guilty and grew timid on catching the expression of his face and eyes 
 but in what am i to blame she asked herself and his cold stern look replied because you are alive and thinking of the living while i 
 in the deep the deep gaze that seemed to look not outwards but inwards there was an almost hostile expression as he slowly regarded his sister and natasha 
 he kissed his sister holding her hand in his as was their wont 
 how are you mary how did you manage to get here said he in a voice as calm and aloof as his look 
 had he screamed in agony that scream would not have struck such horror into princess heart as the tone of his voice 
 and have you brought little nicholas he asked in the same slow quiet manner and with an obvious effort to remember 
 how are you now said princess mary herself surprised at what she was saying 
 that my dear you must ask the doctor he replied and again making an evident effort to be affectionate he said with his lips only his words clearly did not correspond to his thoughts 
 merci chere amie venue 
 thank you for coming my dear 
 princess mary pressed his hand the pressure made him wince just perceptibly he was silent and she did not know what to say she now understood what had happened to him two days before in his words his tone and especially in that calm almost antagonistic look could be felt an estrangement from everything belonging to this world terrible in one who is alive evidently only with an effort did he understand anything living but it was obvious that he failed to understand not because he lacked the power to do so but because he understood something else something the living did not and could not understand and which wholly occupied his mind 
 there you see how strangely fate has brought us together said he breaking the silence and pointing to natasha she looks after me all the time 
 princess mary heard him and did not understand how he could say such a thing he the sensitive tender prince andrew how could he say that before her whom he loved and who loved him had he expected to live he could not have said those words in that offensively cold tone if he had not known that he was dying how could he have failed to pity her and how could he speak like that in her presence the only explanation was that he was indifferent because something else much more important had been revealed to him 
 the conversation was cold and disconnected and continually broke off 
 mary came by way of ryazan said natasha 
 prince andrew did not notice that she called his sister mary and only after calling her so in his presence did natasha notice it herself 
 really he asked 
 they told her that all moscow has been burned down and that 
 natasha stopped it was impossible to talk it was plain that he was making an effort to listen but could not do so 
 yes they say burned he said a great pity and he gazed straight before him absently stroking his mustache with his fingers 
 and so you have met count nicholas mary prince andrew suddenly said evidently wishing to speak pleasantly to them he wrote here that he took a great liking to you he went on simply and calmly evidently unable to understand all the complex significance his words had for living people if you liked him too it would be a good thing for you to get married he added rather more quickly as if pleased at having found words he had long been seeking 
 princess mary heard his words but they had no meaning for her except as a proof of how far away he now was from everything living 
 why talk of me she said quietly and glanced at natasha 
 natasha who felt her glance did not look at her all three were again silent 
 andrew would you like princess mary suddenly said in a trembling voice would you like to see little nicholas he is always talking about you 
 prince andrew smiled just perceptibly and for the first time but princess mary who knew his face so well saw with horror that he did not smile with pleasure or affection for his son but with quiet gentle irony because he thought she was trying what she believed to be the last means of arousing him 
 yes i shall be very glad to see him is he quite well 
 when little nicholas was brought into prince room he looked at his father with frightened eyes but did not cry because no one else was crying prince andrew kissed him and evidently did not know what to say to him 
 when nicholas had been led away princess mary again went up to her brother kissed him and unable to restrain her tears any longer began to cry 
 he looked at her attentively 
 is it about nicholas he asked 
 princess mary nodded her head weeping 
 mary you know the gosp but he broke off 
 what did you say 
 nothing you cry here he said looking at her with the same cold expression 
 when princess mary began to cry he understood that she was crying at the thought that little nicholas would be left without a father with a great effort he tried to return to life and to see things from their point of view 
 yes to them it must seem sad he thought but how simple it is 
 the fowls of the air sow not neither do they reap yet your father feedeth them he said to himself and wished to say to princess mary but no they will take it their own way they understand they understand that all those feelings they prize so all our feelings all those ideas that seem so important to us are unnecessary we cannot understand one another and he remained silent 
 prince little son was seven he could scarcely read and knew nothing after that day he lived through many things gaining knowledge observation and experience but had he possessed all the faculties he afterwards acquired he could not have had a better or more profound understanding of the meaning of the scene he had witnessed between his father mary and natasha than he had then he understood it completely and leaving the room without crying went silently up to natasha who had come out with him and looked shyly at her with his beautiful thoughtful eyes then his uplifted rosy upper lip trembled and leaning his head against her he began to cry 
 after that he avoided dessalles and the countess who caressed him and either sat alone or came timidly to princess mary or to natasha of whom he seemed even fonder than of his aunt and clung to them quietly and shyly 
 when princess mary had left prince andrew she fully understood what face had told her she did not speak any more to natasha of hopes of saving his life she took turns with her beside his sofa and did not cry any more but prayed continually turning in soul to that eternal and unfathomable whose presence above the dying man was now so evident

 the old man 
 let us recount what had taken place 
 enjolras and his friends had been on the boulevard bourdon near the public storehouses at the moment when the dragoons had made their charge 
 enjolras courfeyrac and combeferre were among those who had taken to the rue bassompierre shouting 
 to the barricades in the rue lesdiguieres they had met an old man walking along what had attracted their attention was that the goodman was walking in a as though he were intoxicated 
 moreover he had his hat in his hand although it had been raining all the morning and was raining pretty briskly at the very time 
 courfeyrac had recognized father mabeuf 
 he knew him through having many times accompanied marius as far as his door 
 as he was acquainted with the peaceful and more than timid habits of the old and was amazed at the sight of him in the midst of that uproar a couple of paces from the cavalry charges almost in the midst of a fusillade hatless in the rain and strolling about among the bullets he had accosted him and the following dialogue had been exchanged between the rioter of fire and the octogenarian 
 m mabeuf go to your home 
 why 
 going to be a row 
 well 
 thrusts with the sword and firing m mabeuf 
 that is well 
 firing from cannon 
 that is good 
 where are the rest of you going 
 we are going to fling the government to the earth 
 that is good 
 and he had set out to follow them 
 from that moment forth he had not uttered a word 
 his step had suddenly become firm artisans had offered him their arms he had refused with a sign of the head 
 he advanced nearly to the front rank of the column with the movement of a man who is marching and the countenance of a man who is sleeping 
 what a fierce old fellow muttered the students 
 the rumor spread through the troop that he was a former member of the convention an old regicide 
 the mob had turned in through the rue de la verrerie 
 little gavroche marched in front with that deafening song which made of him a sort of trumpet 
 he sang 
 voici la lune qui paratt 
 quand dans la foret 
 demandait charlot a charlotte 
 tou tou tou 
 pour chatou 
 je dieu roi liard et botte 
 pour avoir bu de grand matin 
 la rosee a meme le thym 
 deux moineaux etaient en ribotte 
 zi zi zi

 je dieu roi liard et botte 
 et ces deux pauvres petits loups 
 comme deux grives estaient souls 
 une tigre en riait dans sa grotte 
 don don don

 je dieu roi liard et botte 
 jurait et sacrait 
 quand irons nous dans la foret 
 demandait charlot a charlotte 
 tin tin tin 
 pour pantin 
 je dieu roi liard et botte 
 they directed their course towards 
 here is the morn appearing

 book twelve 
 chapter xvi 
 
 not only did prince andrew know he would die but he felt that he was dying and was already half dead he was conscious of an aloofness from everything earthly and a strange and joyous lightness of existence without haste or agitation he awaited what was coming that inexorable eternal distant and unknown the presence of which he had felt continually all his life was now near to him and by the strange lightness he experienced almost comprehensible and palpable 
 formerly he had feared the end he had twice experienced that terribly tormenting fear of death the end but now he no longer understood that fear 
 he had felt it for the first time when the shell spun like a top before him and he looked at the fallow field the bushes and the sky and knew that he was face to face with death when he came to himself after being wounded and the flower of eternal unfettered love had instantly unfolded itself in his soul as if freed from the bondage of life that had restrained it he no longer feared death and ceased to think about it 
 during the hours of solitude suffering and partial delirium he spent after he was wounded the more deeply he penetrated into the new principle of eternal love revealed to him the more he unconsciously detached himself from earthly life to love everything and everybody and always to sacrifice oneself for love meant not to love anyone not to live this earthly life and the more imbued he became with that principle of love the more he renounced life and the more completely he destroyed that dreadful barrier which in the absence of such love stands between life and death when during those first days he remembered that he would have to die he said to himself well what of it so much the better 
 but after the night in mytishchi when half delirious he had seen her for whom he longed appear before him and having pressed her hand to his lips had shed gentle happy tears love for a particular woman again crept unobserved into his heart and once more bound him to life and joyful and agitating thoughts began to occupy his mind recalling the moment at the ambulance station when he had seen kuragin he could not now regain the feeling he then had but was tormented by the question whether kuragin was alive and he dared not inquire 
 his illness pursued its normal physical course but what natasha referred to when she said this suddenly happened had occurred two days before princess mary arrived it was the last spiritual struggle between life and death in which death gained the victory it was the unexpected realization of the fact that he still valued life as presented to him in the form of his love for natasha and a last though ultimately vanquished attack of terror before the unknown 
 it was evening as usual after dinner he was slightly feverish and his thoughts were preternaturally clear sonya was sitting by the table he began to doze suddenly a feeling of happiness seized him 
 ah she has come thought he 
 and so it was in place sat natasha who had just come in noiselessly 
 since she had begun looking after him he had always experienced this physical consciousness of her nearness she was sitting in an armchair placed sideways screening the light of the candle from him and was knitting a stocking she had learned to knit stockings since prince andrew had casually mentioned that no one nursed the sick so well as old nurses who knit stockings and that there is something soothing in the knitting of stockings the needles clicked lightly in her slender rapidly moving hands and he could clearly see the thoughtful profile of her drooping face she moved and the ball rolled off her knees she started glanced round at him and screening the candle with her hand stooped carefully with a supple and exact movement picked up the ball and regained her former position 
 he looked at her without moving and saw that she wanted to draw a deep breath after stooping but refrained from doing so and breathed cautiously 
 at the troitsa monastery they had spoken of the past and he had told her that if he lived he would always thank god for his wound which had brought them together again but after that they never spoke of the future 
 can it or can it not be he now thought as he looked at her and listened to the light click of the steel needles can fate have brought me to her so strangely only for me to die is it possible that the truth of life has been revealed to me only to show me that i have spent my life in falsity i love her more than anything in the world but what am i to do if i love her he thought and he involuntarily groaned from a habit acquired during his sufferings 
 on hearing that sound natasha put down the stocking leaned nearer to him and suddenly noticing his shining eyes stepped lightly up to him and bent over him 
 you are not asleep 
 no i have been looking at you a long time i felt you come in no one else gives me that sense of soft tranquillity that you do that light i want to weep for joy 
 natasha drew closer to him her face shone with rapturous joy 
 natasha i love you too much more than anything in the world 
 and i she turned away for an instant why too much she asked 
 why too much well what do you what do you feel in your soul your whole soul shall i live what do you think 
 i am sure of it sure natasha almost shouted taking hold of both his hands with a passionate movement 
 he remained silent awhile 
 how good it would be and taking her hand he kissed it 
 natasha felt happy and agitated but at once remembered that this would not do and that he had to be quiet 
 but you have not slept she said repressing her joy try to sleep please 
 he pressed her hand and released it and she went back to the candle and sat down again in her former position twice she turned and looked at him and her eyes met his beaming at her she set herself a task on her stocking and resolved not to turn round till it was finished 
 soon he really shut his eyes and fell asleep he did not sleep long and suddenly awoke with a start and in a cold perspiration 
 as he fell asleep he had still been thinking of the subject that now always occupied his mind about life and death and chiefly about death he felt himself nearer to it 
 love what is love he thought 
 love hinders death love is life all everything that i understand i understand only because i love everything is everything exists only because i love everything is united by it alone love is god and to die means that i a particle of love shall return to the general and eternal source these thoughts seemed to him comforting but they were only thoughts something was lacking in them they were not clear they were too personal and and there was the former agitation and obscurity he fell asleep 
 he dreamed that he was lying in the room he really was in but that he was quite well and unwounded many various indifferent and insignificant people appeared before him he talked to them and discussed something trivial they were preparing to go away somewhere prince andrew dimly realized that all this was trivial and that he had more important cares but he continued to speak surprising them by empty witticisms gradually unnoticed all these persons began to disappear and a single question that of the closed door superseded all else he rose and went to the door to bolt and lock it everything depended on whether he was or was not in time to lock it he went and tried to hurry but his legs refused to move and he knew he would not be in time to lock the door though he painfully strained all his powers he was seized by an agonizing fear and that fear was the fear of death it stood behind the door but just when he was clumsily creeping toward the door that dreadful something on the other side was already pressing against it and forcing its way in something not human death was breaking in through that door and had to be kept out he seized the door making a final effort to hold it back to lock it was no longer possible but his efforts were weak and clumsy and the door pushed from behind by that terror opened and closed again 
 once again it pushed from outside his last superhuman efforts were vain and both halves of the door noiselessly opened it entered and it was death and prince andrew died 
 but at the instant he died prince andrew remembered that he was asleep and at the very instant he died having made an effort he awoke 
 yes it was death i died and woke up yes death is an awakening and all at once it grew light in his soul and the veil that had till then concealed the unknown was lifted from his spiritual vision he felt as if powers till then confined within him had been liberated and that strange lightness did not again leave him 
 when waking in a cold perspiration he moved on the divan natasha went up and asked him what was the matter he did not answer and looked at her strangely not understanding 
 that was what had happened to him two days before princess arrival from that day as the doctor expressed it the wasting fever assumed a malignant character but what the doctor said did not interest natasha she saw the terrible moral symptoms which to her were more convincing 
 from that day an awakening from life came to prince andrew together with his awakening from sleep and compared to the duration of life it did not seem to him slower than an awakening from sleep compared to the duration of a dream 
 there was nothing terrible or violent in this comparatively slow awakening 
 his last days and hours passed in an ordinary and simple way both princess mary and natasha who did not leave him felt this they did not weep or shudder and during these last days they themselves felt that they were not attending on him he was no longer there he had left them but on what reminded them most closely of him his body both felt this so strongly that the outward and terrible side of death did not affect them and they did not feel it necessary to foment their grief neither in his presence nor out of it did they weep nor did they ever talk to one another about him they felt that they could not express in words what they understood 
 they both saw that he was sinking slowly and quietly deeper and deeper away from them and they both knew that this had to be so and that it was right 
 he confessed and received communion everyone came to take leave of him when they brought his son to him he pressed his lips to the and turned away not because he felt it hard and sad princess mary and natasha understood that but simply because he thought it was all that was required of him but when they told him to bless the boy he did what was demanded and looked round as if asking whether there was anything else he should do 
 when the last convulsions of the body which the spirit was leaving occurred princess mary and natasha were present 
 is it over said princess mary when his body had for a few minutes lain motionless growing cold before them natasha went up looked at the dead eyes and hastened to close them she closed them but did not kiss them but clung to that which reminded her most nearly of him his body 
 where has he gone where is he now 
 when the body washed and dressed lay in the coffin on a table everyone came to take leave of him and they all wept 
 little nicholas cried because his heart was rent by painful perplexity the countess and sonya cried from pity for natasha and because he was no more the old count cried because he felt that before long he too must take the same terrible step 
 natasha and princess mary also wept now but not because of their own personal grief they wept with a reverent and softening emotion which had taken possession of their souls at the consciousness of the simple and solemn mystery of death that had been accomplished in their presence

 of friendship 
 it had been hard for him that spake it to have put more truth and untruth together in few words than in that speech whosoever is delighted in solitude is either a wild beast or a god for it is most true that a natural and secret hatred and aversion towards society in any man hath somewhat of the savage beast but it is most untrue that it should have any character at all of the divine nature except 
 it proceed not out of a pleasure in solitude but out of a love and desire to sequester a self or a higher conversation such as is found to have been falsely and feignedly in some of the heathen as epimenides the candian numa the roman empedocles the sicilian and apollonius of tyana and truly and really in divers of the ancient hermits and holy fathers of the church 
 but little do men perceive what solitude is and how far it extendeth for a crowd is not company and faces are but a gallery of pictures and talk but a tinkling cymbal where there is no love 
 
 the latin adage meeteth with it a little magna civitas magna solitude because in a great town friends are scattered so that there is not that fellowship for the most part which is in less neighbourhoods but we may go further and affirm most truly that it is a mean and miserable solitude to want true friends without which the world is but a wilderness and even in this sense also of solitude whosoever 
 in the frame of his nature and affections is unfit for friendship he taketh it of the beast and not from humanity 
 
 a principal fruit of friendship is the ease and discharge of the fullness and swellings of the heart which passions of all kinds do cause and induce we know diseases of stoppings and suffocations are the most dangerous in the body and it is not much otherwise in the mind you may take sarza to open the liver steel to open the spleen 
 flower of sulphur for the lungs castoreum for the brain but no receipt openeth the heart but a true friend to whom you may impart griefs joys fears hopes suspicions counsels and whatsoever lieth upon the heart to oppress it in a kind of civil shrift or confession 
 
 it is a strange thing to observe how high a rate great kings and monarchs do set upon this fruit of friendship whereof we spoke so great as they purchase it many times at the hazard of their own safety and greatness for princes in regard of the distance of their fortune from that of their subjects and servants cannot gather 
 this fruit except to make themselves capable thereof they raise some persons to be as it were companions and almost equals to themselves which many times sorteth to inconvenience 
 the modem languages give unto such persons the name of favourites or privadoes as if it were matter of grace or conversation 
 but the roman name attaineth the true use and cause thereof naming them participes durarum for it is that which tieth the knot and we see plainly that this hath been done not by weak and passionate princes only but by the wisest and most politic that ever reigned 
 who have oftentimes joined to themselves some of their servants whom both themselves have called friends and allowed others likewise to call them in the same manner using the word which is received between private men 
 
 l sulla when he commanded rome raised pompey after surnamed the great to that height that pompey vaunted himself for overmatch for when he had carried the consulship for a friend of his against the pursuit of sulla and that sulla did a little resent thereat and began to speak great pompey turned upon him again and in effect bade him be quiet for that more men adored the sun rising than the sun setting with julius caesar decimus brutus had obtained that interest as he set him down in his testament for heir in remainder after his nephew 
 and this was the man that had power with him to draw him forth to his death for when caesar would have discharged the senate in regard of some ill presages and especially a dream of calpurnia this man lifted him gently by the arm out of his chair telling him 
 
 he hoped he would not dismiss the senate till his wife had dreamt a better dream 
 
 and it seemeth his favour was so great as antonius in a letter which is recited verbatim in one of philippics callelh him veneftca witch as if he had enchanted caesar augustus raised 
 agrippa though of mean birth to that height as when he consulted with maecenas about the marriage of his daughter julia maecenas 
 took the liberty to tell him that he must either marry his daughter to agrippa or take away his life there was no third way he had made him so great with tiberius caesar seianus had ascended to that height as they two were termed and reckoned as a pair of friends 
 tiberius in a letter to him saith haecpro amicitia nostra non 
 occultavi and the whole senate dedicated an altar to friendship as to a goddess in respect of the great deamess of friendship between them two the like or more was between septimius severus and plautianus for he forced his eldest son to many the daughter of plaudainus and would often maintain plautianus in doing affronts to 
 his son and did write also in a letter to the senate by these words i love the man so well as i wish he may me now if these princes had been as a trajan or a marcus aurelius a man might have thought that this had proceeded of an abundant goodness of nature but being men so wise of such strength and severity of mind 
 and so extreme lovers of themselves as all these were it proveth most plainly that they found their own felicity though as great as ever happened to mortal men but as an half piece except they mought have a friend to make it entire and yet which is more they were princes that had wives sons nephews and yet all these could 
 not supply the comfort of friendship 
 
 it is not to be forgotten what commineus observeth of his first master duke charles the hardy namely mat he would communicate his secrets with none and least of all those secrets which troubled him most whereupon he goeth on and saith that towards his latter time that closeness did impair and a little perish his understanding 
 
 surely commineus mought have made the same judgement also if it had pleased him of his second master lewis the eleventh whose closeness was indeed his tormentor 
 
 the parable of pythagoras is dark but true cor ne edito eat not the heart certainly if a man would give it a hard phrase those that want friends to open themselves unto are cannibals of their own hearts but one thing is most admirable wherewith i will conclude this first fruit of friendship which is that this communicating of a 
 self to his friend works two contrary effects for it redoubleth joys and cutteth griefs in halves for there is no man that imparteth his joys to his friend but he joyeth the more and no man that imparteth his griefs to his friend but he grieveth the less so that it is in truth of operation upon a mind of like virtue as the alchemists use to attribute to their stone for body that it worketh all contrary effects but still to the good and benefit of nature but yet without 
 praying in aid of alchemists there is a manifest image of this in the ordinary course of nature for in bodies union strengtheneth and cherisheth any natural action and on the other side weakeneth and dulleth any violent impression and even so is it of minds 
 
 the second fruit of friendship is healthful and sovereign for the understanding as the first is for the affections for frendship maketh indeed a fair day in the affections from storm and tempests but it maketh daylight in the understanding out of darkness and confusion of thoughts neither is this to be understood only of faithful counsel which a man receiveth from his friend but before you come to that 
 certain it is that whosoever hath his mind fraught with many thoughts his wits and understanding do clarify and break up in the communicating and discoursing with another he tosseth his thoughts more easily he marshalled them more orderly he seeth how they look when they are turned into words finally he waxeth wiser than 
 himself and that more by an discourse then by a meditation it was well said by themistocles to the king of persia 
 that speech was like cloth of arras opened and put abroad whereby the imagery doth appear in figure whereas in thoughts they lie but as in packs neither is this second fruit of friendship in opening the understanding restrained only to such friends as are able to give a man counsel they indeed are best but even without that 
 a man learneth of himself and bringeth his own thoughts to light and whetteth his wits as against a stone which itself cuts not in a word a man were better relate himself to a statue or picture then to suffer his thoughts to pass in smother 
 
 add now to make this second fruit of friendship complete that other point which lieth more open and falleth within vulgar observation which is faithful counsel from a friend heraclitus saith well in one of his enigmas dry light is ever the best and certain it is that the light that a man receiveth by counsel from another is drier and purer than that which cometh from his own understanding and judgement 
 which is ever infused and drenched in his affections and customs so as there is as much difference between the counsel that a friend giveth and that a man giveth himself as there is between the counsel of a friend and of a flatterer 
 for there is no such flatterer as is a self and there is no such remedy against flattery of a self as the liberty of a friend counsel is of two sorts the one concerning manners the other concerning business for the first the best preservative to keep 
 the mind in health is the faithful admonition of a friend the calling of a self to a strict account is a medicine sometime too piercing and corrosive reading good books of morality is a lime flat and dead observing our faults in others is sometimes improper for our case but the best receipt best i say to work and best 
 to take is the admonition of a friend it is a strange thing to behold what gross errors and extreme absurdities many especially of the greater sort do commit for want of a friend to tell them of them to the great damage both of their fame and fortune for as st james saith they are as men that look sometimes into a glass and presently forget their own shape and favour as for business a man may think 
 if he will that two eyes see no more than one or that a gamester seeth always more than a looker on or that a man in anger is as wise as he that hath said over the four and twenty letters or that a musket may be shot off as well upon the arm as upon a rest and such other fond and high imaginations to think himself all in all 
 
 but when all is done the help of good counsel is that which setteth business straight 
 and if any man think that he will take counsel but it shall be by pieces asking counsel in one business of one man and in another business of another man it is well that is to say better perhaps than if he asked none at all but he runneth two dangers one that he shall not be faithfully counselled for it is a rare thing except it be from a perfect and entire friend to have counsel given but such as 
 shall be bowed and crooked to some ends which he hath that giveth it the other that he shall have counsel given hurtful and unsafe though with good meaning and mixed partly of mischief and partly of remedy even as if you would call a physician that is thought good for the cure of the disease you complain of but is unacquainted with your body and therefore may put you in way for a present cure but overthroweth your health in some other kind 
 and so cure the disease and kill the patient but a friend that is wholly acquainted with a estate will beware by furthering any present business how he dasheth upon other inconvenience 
 and therefore rest not upon scattered counsel they will rather distract and mislead than seme and direct after these two noble fruits of frendship peace in the affections and support of the judgement followeth the last fruit which is like the pomegranate full of many kernels i mean aid and bearing a part in all actions and occasions here the best way to represent to life the manifold use of frendship is to cast and see how many things there are which a man 
 cannot do himself and then it will appear that it was a sparing speech of the ancients to say that a friend is another himself for that a friend is far more than himself 
 men have their time and die many times in desire of some things which they principally take to heart the bestowing of a child the finishing of a work or the like if a man have a true friend he may rest almost secure that the care of those things will continue after him so that a man hath as it were two lives in his desires 
 
 a man hath a body and that body is confined to a place but where friendship is all offices of life are as it were granted to him and his deputy for he may exercise them by his friend how many things are there which a man cannot with any face or comeliness say or do himself a man can scarce allege his own merits with modesty 
 much less extol them a man cannot sometimes brook to supplicate or beg and a number of the like but all these things are graceful in a mouth which are blushing in a own so again a person hath many proper relations which he cannot 
 put off a man cannot speak to his son but as a father to his wife but as a husband to his enemy but upon terms whereas a friend may speak as the case requires and not as it sorteth with the person but to enumerate these things were endless i have given the rule where a man cannot fitly play his own part if he have not a friend he may quit the stage

 book fall 
 chapter xii 
 
 the bishop works 
 the next morning at sunrise monseigneur bienvenu was strolling in his garden 
 madame magloire ran up to him in utter consternation 
 monseigneur monseigneur she exclaimed does your grace know where the basket of silver is 
 yes replied the bishop 
 jesus the lord be blessed she resumed i did not know what had become of it 
 the bishop had just picked up the basket in a he presented it to madame magloire 
 here it is 
 well said she 
 nothing in it 
 and the silver 
 ah returned the bishop so it is the silver which troubles you i know where it is 
 great good god 
 it is stolen 
 that man who was here last night has stolen it 
 in a twinkling with all the vivacity of an alert old woman madame magloire had rushed to the oratory entered the alcove and returned to the bishop 
 the bishop had just bent down and was sighing as he examined a plant of cochlearia des guillons which the basket had broken as it fell across the bed 
 he rose up at madame cry 
 monseigneur the man is gone 
 the silver has been stolen 
 as she uttered this exclamation her eyes fell upon a corner of the garden where traces of the wall having been scaled were visible the coping of the wall had been torn away 
 stay yonder is the way he went 
 he jumped over into cochefilet lane 
 ah the abomination 
 he has stolen our silver 
 the bishop remained silent for a moment then he raised his grave eyes and said gently to madame magloire 
 and in the first place was that silver ours 
 madame magloire was speechless 
 another silence ensued then the bishop went on 
 madame magloire i have for a long time detained that silver wrongfully it belonged to the poor 
 who was that man 
 a poor man evidently 
 alas 
 jesus returned madame magloire 
 it is not for my sake nor for it makes no difference to us 
 but it is for the sake of monseigneur 
 what is monseigneur to eat with now 
 the bishop gazed at her with an air of amazement 
 ah come 
 are there no such things as pewter forks and spoons 
 madame magloire shrugged her shoulders 
 pewter has an odor 
 iron forks and spoons then 
 madame magloire made an expressive grimace 
 iron has a taste 
 very well said the bishop wooden ones then 
 a few moments later he was breakfasting at the very table at which jean valjean had sat on the previous evening 
 as he ate his breakfast monseigneur welcome remarked gayly to his sister who said nothing and to madame magloire who was grumbling under her breath that one really does not need either fork or spoon even of wood in order to dip a bit of bread in a cup of milk 
 a pretty idea truly said madame magloire to herself as she went and came to take in a man like that and to lodge him close to self 
 and how fortunate that he did nothing but steal ah mon dieu it makes one shudder to think of it 
 as the brother and sister were about to rise from the table there came a knock at the door 
 come in said the bishop 
 the door opened 
 a singular and violent group made its appearance on the threshold 
 three men were holding a fourth man by the collar the three men were gendarmes the other was jean valjean 
 a brigadier of gendarmes who seemed to be in command of the group was standing near the door 
 he entered and advanced to the bishop making a military salute 
 monseigneur said he 
 at this word jean valjean who was dejected and seemed overwhelmed raised his head with an air of stupefaction 
 monseigneur he murmured 
 so he is not the cure 
 silence said the gendarme 
 he is monseigneur the bishop 
 in the meantime monseigneur bienvenu had advanced as quickly as his great age permitted 
 ah here you are he exclaimed looking at jean valjean i am glad to see you 
 well but how is this 
 i gave you the candlesticks too which are of silver like the rest and for which you can certainly get two hundred francs why did you not carry them away with your forks and spoons 
 jean valjean opened his eyes wide and stared at the venerable bishop with an expression which no human tongue can render any account of 
 monseigneur said the brigadier of gendarmes so what this man said is true then 
 we came across him 
 he was walking like a man who is running away 
 we stopped him to look into the matter he had this silver 
 and he told you interposed the bishop with a smile that it had been given to him by a kind old fellow of a priest with whom he had passed the night 
 i see how the matter stands 
 and you have brought him back here 
 it is a mistake 
 in that case replied the brigadier we can let him go 
 certainly replied the bishop 
 the gendarmes released jean valjean who recoiled 
 is it true that i am to be released he said in an almost inarticulate voice and as though he were talking in his sleep 
 yes thou art released dost thou not understand said one of the gendarmes 
 my friend resumed the bishop before you go here are your candlesticks 
 take them 
 he stepped to the took the two silver candlesticks and brought them to jean valjean 
 the two women looked on without uttering a word without a gesture without a look which could disconcert the bishop 
 jean valjean was trembling in every limb 
 he took the two candlesticks mechanically and with a bewildered air 
 now said the bishop go in peace 
 by the way when you return my friend it is not necessary to pass through the garden you can always enter and depart through the street door 
 it is never fastened with anything but a latch either by day or by night 
 then turning to the gendarmes 
 you may retire gentlemen 
 the gendarmes retired 
 jean valjean was like a man on the point of fainting 
 the bishop drew near to him and said in a low voice 
 do not forget never forget that you have promised to use this money in becoming an honest man 
 jean valjean who had no recollection of ever having promised anything remained speechless 
 the bishop had emphasized the words when he uttered them 
 he resumed with solemnity 
 jean valjean my brother you no longer belong to evil but to good it is your soul that i buy from you i withdraw it from black thoughts and the spirit of perdition and i give it to god

 six imperial stormtroopers guarded lando leia and chewbacca as they marchedthrough the inner corridor of cloud city they reached an intersection when twelveof guards and his aide arrived to block their path 
 code force seven lando commanded as he stopped in front of his aide 
 at that moment the twelve guards aimed their laser weapons at the startledstormtroopers and aide calmly took the six troopers weapons from handed one of the guns to leia and one to lando then waited for the next order 
 hold them in the security tower the cloud city administrator said one must know 
 the guards and aide carrying the extra weapons marched thestormtroopers away to the tower 
 leia had watched this rapid turn of events in confusion but her confusionturned to astonishment when lando the man who had betrayed han solo beganremoving bonds 
 come on he urged getting out of here 
 the giant hands were freed at last not caring to wait forexplanations chewbacca turned toward the man who had freed him and with roar lunged at lando and began to throttle him 
 after what you did to han leia said i trust you to 
 lando desperately trying to free himself from ferocious grip triedto explain i had no choice he the wookiee interrupted him with anangry bark 
 still a chance to save han lando gasped at the eastplatform 
 chewie leia said at last go 
 still fuming chewbacca released lando and glared at him as calrissian foughtto regain his breath 
 keep your eyes on him chewie leia cautioned as the wookiee growledthreateningly 
 i have a feeling lando muttered under his breath that making anotherbig mistake 
 the stout little r unit meandered up and down the corridor sending hisscanners in every possible direction as he tried to detect some sign of his any kind of life he realized he was dreadfully turned around and had lost trackof how many meters he had traveled 
 as turned a corner he spotted a number of forms moving up thecorridor beeping and whistling droid greetings he hoped that these were friendlysorts 
 his tooting was detected by one of the creatures who began to call out to him 
 artooartoo it was threepio 
 chewbacca still carrying the semiassembled quickly turnedaround to see the stubby r droid rolling their way but as the wookiee was spun out of sight of his friend 
 wait the aggravated threepio demanded turn around you trying to save han from the bounty hunter 
 artoo scooted forward beeping all the way and threepio patiently replied to hisfrantic questions 
 i know but master luke can take care of himself at least that was kept telling himself as the group continued its search for han 
 on the east landing platform of cloud city two guards shoved the frozen bodyof han solo through a side hatchway of the slave boba fett climbed up a laddernext to the opening and boarded his ship ordering it sealed as soon as he entered thecockpit 
 fett ignited his engines and the craft began rolling across the platform fortakeoff 
 lando leia and chewbacca raced onto the platform in time only to see theslave lifting off and soaring into the orange and purple of the cloud city his blaster chewbacca howled and fired the weapon at the departingspaceship 
 no use lando told him out of range 
 all but threepio gazed at the departing craft still strapped to he saw something that the others had not yet noticed 
 oh my no he exclaimed 
 charging the group was a squad of imperial stormtroopers blasts already issuingfrom their drawn blasters the first bolt narrowly missed princess leia landoresponded quickly in returning the enemy fire and the air was ablaze with a of red and green bolts 
 artoo scooted over to the elevator and hid inside peeking out to seethe fury of the battle from a safe distance 
 lando shouted above the sounds of the blasters come on move hecalled breaking for the open elevator and blasting at the stormtroopers as he ran 
 but leia and chewbacca did not move they stood their ground and kept up asteady fire against the assault of the stormtroopers troopers groaned and droppedas their chests arms and stomachs erupted under the fatally accurate aim of this onefemale human and one male wookiee 
 lando sticking his head out of the elevator tried to get their attention motioningthem to run but the two seemed possessed as they blasted away getting retaliationfor all of their anger and captivity and the loss of one they both loved they weredetermined to extinguish the lives of these minions of the galactic empire 
 threepio would gladly have been anywhere else unable to get away all hecould do was frantically yell for help artoo help me he screamed how did iget into this what a fate worse than death it is to be strapped to the back of awookiee 
 get in here lando shouted again hurry up hurry up 
 leia and chewbacca began to move toward him evading the erupting rain oflaser fire as they rushed inside the waiting elevator as the elevator door glimpsed the remaining troopers racing at them 
 lightsaber clashed in luke skywalker and darth battle on the platformabove the chamber 
 luke felt the shaking platform shudder with every blow and parry and thrust oftheir weapons but he was undaunted for with every thrust of his sword he drovethe evil darth vader back 
 vader using his lightsaber to ward off aggressive lunges spoke calmly asthey fought the fear does not reach you you have learned more than ianticipated 
 find full of surprises the confident youth retorted threateningvader with yet another thrust 
 and i too was the calm portentous reply 
 with two graceful moves the dark lord hooked weapon out of his handsand sent it flying away a slash of energy blade at feet made theyouth jump back in an effort to protect himself but he stumbled backward andtumbled down the stairs 
 sprawled on the platform luke gazed up and saw the ominous dark figurelooming above him at the top of the stairs then the figure flew right at him itssable cloak billowing out in the air like the wings of a monstrous bat 
 quickly luke rolled to one side not taking his eyes off vader as the vast blackfigure landed soundlessly next to him 
 your future lies with me skywalker vader hissed looming over the crouchingyouth now you will embrace the dark side knew this to be true 
 no luke yelled trying to fight off the evil presence 
 there is much did not tell you vader continued come i willcomplete your training 
 influence was incredibly strong it seemed to luke like a thing alive 
 listen to him luke told himself he is trying to trick me to lead meastray to lead me to the dark side of the force just like ben warned me 
 luke began to back away from the advancing sith lord behind the youth thehydraulic elevator cover silently opened ready to receive him 
 die first luke proclaimed 
 that be necessary the dark lord suddenly lunged at luke with hislightsaber so forcefully that the youth lost his balance and tumbled into the gapingopening 
 vader turned away from the and casually deactivated his too easy he shrugged perhaps you are not as strong as the emperorthought 
 as he spoke molten metal began to pour into the opening behind him his back was still turned something rose in a blur upward 
 time will tell luke quietly replied to remark 
 the dark lord spun around at this point in the freezing process the subjectcertainly be able to speak vader glanced around the room and then turnedhis helmeted head up toward the ceiling 
 hanging from some hoses draped across the ceiling luke was leaped some five meters into the air to escape the carbonite 
 impressive vader admitted your agility is impressive 
 luke dropped back to the platform on the other side of the steaming pit hereached his hand out and his sword lying on another part of the platform flew backinto his grip immediately the lightsaber ignited 
 sword sprang to life at the very same moment ben has taught youwell you have controlled your fear now release your anger i destroyed yourfamily take your revenge 
 but this time luke was cautious and more controlled if he could subdue hisanger as he had finally controlled his fear he would not be swayed 
 remember the training luke cautioned himself remember what yoda out all hatred and anger and receive the force 
 gaining control over his negative feelings luke began to advance goading he lunged at vader and after a quick exchange began to forcehim back 
 your hatred can give you the power to destroy me vader tempted use it 
 luke began to realize just how awesomely powerful his dark enemy was andsoftly told himself i will not become a slave to the dark side of the force andmoved cautiously toward vader 
 as luke approached vader slowly moved backward in retreat luke lunged athim with a powerful swing but when vader blocked it he lost his balance and fellinto the outer rim of steaming pipes 
 knee nearly buckled with the exhaustion of battling his fearsomeopponent he gathered his strength and cautiously moved to the edge and lookeddown but he saw no sign of vader switching off his lightsaber and hooking itinto his belt luke lowered himself into the pit 
 he dropped to the floor of the pit and found himself in a large control andmaintenance room that overlooked the reactor powering the entire city lookingaround the chamber he noticed a large window standing silhouetted in front of it wasthe unmoving figure of darth vader 
 luke slowly moved closer to the window and reignited his lightsaber 
 but vader did not light his own sword nor did he make any effort to defendhimself as luke drew nearer the dark only weapon in fact was histempting voice attack he goaded the young jedi destroy me 
 confused by ploy luke hesitated 
 only by taking your revenge can you save yourself 
 luke stood locked in place should he act on words and thus used theforce as a tool of revenge or should he step away from this battle now hoping foranother chance to fight vader when he had gained better control 
 no how could he delay the opportunity to destroy this evil being here washis chance now and he must not delay 
 there might never again be such an opportunity 
 luke grasped his deadly lightsaber in both hands tightly gripping the smoothhandle like an ancient broadsword and raising the weapon to deliver the blow thatwould slay this masked horror 
 but before he could swing a large piece of machinery detached itself from thewall behind him and came hurtling at his back turning instantly luke flashed hislightsaber and cut the thing in half and the two massive pieces crashed to the floor 
 a second piece of machinery sped toward the youth and he again used the forceto deflect it the weighty object bounced away as if it had struck an unseen a large pipe came tumbling toward him through the air but even as lukerepelled that enormous object tools and pieces of machinery came flying at him fromall directions then wires that pulled themselves out of the walls came twisting andsparking and whipping at him 
 bombarded on all sides luke did what he could to deflect the assault but he wasbeginning to get bloodied and bruised in the attempt 
 another large piece of machinery glanced off body and crashed out thelarge window letting in the screaming wind suddenly everything in the room wasblown about and the fierce wind lashed body and filled the room with abansheelike howl 
 and in the very center of the room standing still and triumphant was darthvader 
 you are beaten the dark lord of the sith gloated it is useless to will join me or you will join in death 
 as vader spoke those words a final piece of heavy machinery soared through theair striking the young jedi and knocking him through the broken became a great blur as the wind carried him tossing and rolling until hemanaged to grab hold of a beam with one hand 
 when the wind subsided a bit and his vision cleared luke realized that he washanging from the gantry of the reactor shaft outside the control room when hegazed down he saw what appeared to be an endless abyss a wave of dizzinessswept over him and he squeezed his eyes closed in an effort to keep from panicking 
 compared to the podlike reactor from which he hung luke was no more than aspeck of squirming matter while the pod one of many jutting from thecircular inner no more than a speck itself in comparison withthe rest of the immense chamber 
 grasping the beam firmly with only one hand luke managed to hook hislightsaber on to his belt and then grab the beam with both hands hoisting on it justin time to see darth vader walking toward him down the shaft 
 as vader approached luke the public address system began to blare echoingthrough the cavernous rooms fugitives heading toward platform secure alltransports all security forces on alert 
 walking menacingly toward luke vader predicted your friends will neverescape and neither will you 
 vader took another step and luke immediately raised his sword ready to renewthe battle 
 you are beaten vader stated with horrifying certainty and finality it isuseless to resist 
 but luke did resist he lunged at the dark lord with a vicious blow bringinghis sizzling laser blade to crash onto armor and sear through to the staggered from the blow and it seemed to luke that he was in pain but onlyfor a moment then once again vader began to move toward him 
 taking another step the dark lord warned let yourself be destroyed was 
 luke was breathing hard cold sweat dropping from his forehead but thesound of name instilled a sudden resolve in him 
 calm he reminded himself be calm 
 but the grimly cloaked specter stalked toward him along the narrow gentry andit seemed he wanted the young life 
 or worse his fragile soul 
 lando leia chewbacca and the droids hurried down a corridor they turneda corner and saw the door to the landing platform standing open through it theyglimpsed the millennium falcon waiting for their escape but suddenly the doorslammed shut ducking into an alcove the group saw a squad of stormtrooperscharging them their laser guns blasting as they ran chunks of wall and floorshattered and flew into the air with the impact of the ricocheting energy beams 
 chewbacca growled returning the stormtroopers fire with savage wookiee covered leia who punched desperately at the control panel but the doorfailed to budge 
 artoo threepio called the control panel you can override the alertsystem 
 threepio gestured at the panel urging the little robot to hurry and pointing out acomputer socket on the control board 
 scooted toward the control panel beeping and whistling as hescurried to help 
 twisting his body to avoid the burning laser bolts lando feverishly worked toconnect this comlink to the intercom 
 this is calrissian he broadcast over the system the empire is takingcontrol of the city i advise you to leave before more imperial troops arrive 
 he switched off the communicator lando knew that he had done what hecould to warn his people his job now was to get his friends safely off the planet 
 meanwhile artoo removed a connector cover and inserted an extendedcomputer arm into the waiting socket the droid issued a short beep that suddenlyturned into a wild robot scream he began to quiver his circuits lighting up in a maddisplay of flashing brilliance and every orifice in his hull spewing smoke landoquickly pulled artoo away from the power socket as the droid began to cool off hedirected a few wilted beeps way 
 well next time you pay more attention threepio replied defensively supposed to know power sockets from computer feeds an interpreter 
 anybody else got any ideas leia shouted as she stood firing at the attackingstormtroopers 
 come on lando answered over the din of the battle try another way 
 the wind that shrieked through the reactor shaft entirely absorbed the sounds ofthe clashing lightsabers 
 luke moved agilely across the gantry and took refuge beneath a huge instrumentpanel to evade his pursuing foe but vader was there in an instant his lightsaberthrashing down like a pulsating guillotine blade cutting the instrument complex complex began to fall but was abruptly caught by the wind and blown upward 
 an instant of distraction was all vader needed as the instrument panel floatedaway luke involuntarily glanced at it at that second the dark laser bladecame slashing down across hand cutting it and sending the lightsaberflying 
 the pain was excruciating luke smelled the terrible odor of his own searedflesh and squeezed his forearm beneath his armpit to try to stop the agony hestepped backward along the gantry until he reached its extreme end stalked all thewhile by the apparition 
 abruptly ominously the wind subsided and luke realized he had nowhereelse to go 
 there is no escape the dark lord of the sith warned looming over luke likea black angel of death make me destroy you you are strong with theforce now you must learn to use the dark side join me and together we will bemore powerful than the emperor come i will complete your training and we willrule the galaxy together 
 luke refused to give in to taunts i will never join you 
 if you only knew the power of the dark side vader continued told you what happened to your father did he 
 mention of his father aroused anger he told me enough he told me you killed him 
 no vader replied calmly i am your father 
 stunned luke stared with disbelief at the warrior and then pulledaway at this revelation the two warriors stood staring at one another father andson 
 no no not true luke said refusing to believe what he had justheard impossible 
 search your feelings vader said sounding like an evil version of yoda youknow it to be true 
 then vader turned off the blade of his lightsaber and extended a steady andinviting hand 
 bewildered and at words luke shouted no no 
 vader continued persuasively luke you can destroy the emperor he hasforeseen this it is your destiny join me and together we can rule the galaxy asfather and son come with me it is the only way 
 mind whirled with those words everything was finally beginning tocoalesce in his brain or was it he wondered if vader were telling him the training of yoda the teaching of saintly old ben his own strivings forgood and his abhorrence of evil if everything he had fought for were no more than alie 
 he want to believe vader tried convincing himself that it was vader wholied to somehow he could feel the truth in the dark words but ifdarth vader did speak the truth why he wondered had ben kenobi lied to his mind screamed louder than any wind the dark lord could ever summonagainst him 
 the answers no longer seemed to matter 
 his father 
 with the calmness that ben himself and yoda the jedi master had taught skywalker made perhaps what might be his final decision of all shouted as he stepped out into the empty abyss beneath him for all itsunperceived depth luke might have been falling to another galaxy 
 darth vader moved to the end of the gantry to watch as luke tumbled away astrong wind began to blow billowing black cloak out behind him as he stoodlooking over the edge 
 body quickly plunged downward toppling head over foot thewounded jedi desperately reached out to grab at something to stop his fall 
 the dark lord watched until he saw the body sucked into a largeexhaust pipe in the side of the reactor shaft when luke vanished vader quicklyturned and hurried off the platform 
 luke sped through the exhaust shaft trying to grab the sides to slow his the smooth shiny sides of the pipe had no or ridges for luke to grasp 
 at last he came to the end of the tunnellike pipe his feet striking hard against acircular grill the grill which opened over an apparently bottomless drop wasknocked out by the impact of momentum and he felt his body starts to slideout through the opening frantically clawing at the smooth interior of the pipe lukebegan to call out for assistance 
 benben help me he pleaded desperately 
 even as he called out he felt his fingers slip along the inside of the pipe whilehis body inched ever closer to the yawning opening 
 cloud city was in chaos 
 as soon as lando broadcast was heard throughout the city itsresidents began to panic some of them packed a few belongings others just rushedout into the streets seeking escape soon the streets were filled with running humansand aliens rushing chaotically through the city imperial stormtroopers charged afterthe fleeing inhabitants exchanging laser fire with them in a raging clamorous battle 
 in one of the central corridors lando leia and chewbacca held off asquad of stormtroopers by blasting heavy rounds of laser bolts at the imperial was urgent that lando and the others hold their ground for they had come uponanother entrance that would lead them to the landing platform if only artoosucceeded in opening the door 
 artoo was trying to remove the plate from this control panel butbecause of the noise and distraction of the laser fire blasting around him it wasdifficult for the little droid to concentrate on his work he beeped to himself as heworked sounding a bit befuddled to threepio 
 what are you talking about threepio called to him not interested inthe hyperdrive on the millennium falcon fixed just tell the computer to openthe door 
 then as lando leia and the wookiee edged toward the door dodging heavyimperial laser fire artoo beeped triumphantly and the door snapped open 
 artoo you did it threepio exclaimed the droid would have applauded hadhis other arm been attached i never doubted you for a second 
 hurry lando shouted or never make it 
 the helpful r unit came through once again as the others dashed through theentrance the stout robot sprayed out a thick dense as the clouds surroundingthis obscured his friends from the encroaching stormtroopers beforethe cloud had cleared lando and the others were racing toward platform 
 the stormtroopers followed blasting at the small band of fugitive bolting towardthe millennium falcon chewbacca and the robots boarded the freighter whilelando and leia covered them with their blasters cutting down still more of warriors 
 when the roar of the engines started and then rose to whine lando and leia discharged a few more bolts of brilliant they sprinted up the ramp they entered the pirate ship and the main hatchwayclosed behind them and as the ship began to move they heard a barrage ofimperial laser fire that sounded as if the entire planet were splitting apart at itsfoundations 
 luke could no longer slow his inexorable slide out the exhaust pipe 
 he slid the final few centimeters and then dropped through the cloudyatmosphere his body spinning and his arms flailing to grip on to something solid 
 after what seemed like forever he caught hold of an electronic weather vane thatjutted out from the bowllike underside of cloud city winds buffeted him andclouds swirled around him as he held on tightly to the weather vane but hisstrength was beginning to fail he think he could hang like the gaseous very much longer 
 all was very quiet in the millennium falcon cockpit 
 leia just catching her breath from their close escape sat in han of him rushed to her mind but she tried not to worry about him tried not tomiss him 
 behind the princess looking over her shoulder out the front windscreen stood asilent and exhausted lando calrissian 
 slowly the ship began to move picking up speed as it coursed along the landingplatform 
 the giant wookiee in his old chair threw a series of switches thatbrought a dancing array of lights across the main control panel pulling thethrottle chewbacca began to guide the ship upward to freedom 
 clouds rushed by the cockpit windows and everyone finally breathed with reliefas the millennium falcon soared into a twilight sky 
 luke managed to hook one of his legs over the electronic weather vane whichcontinued to support his weight but air from the exhaust pipe rushed at it difficult for him to keep from slipping off the vane 
 ben he moaned in agony ben 
 darth vader strode onto the empty landing platform and watched the speck thatwas the millennium falcon disappears in the far distance 
 he turned to his two aides bring my ship in he commanded and then heleft black robes flowing behind him to prepare for his journey 
 somewhere near the supporting stalk of cloud city luke spoke his mind on one whom he thought cared for him and might somehowcome to his aid he called leia hear me pitifully he cried out once 
 just then a large piece of the weather vane broke off and went hurtling off intothe clouds far below luke tightened his grip on what remained of the vane andstrained to hold on in the blast of air rushing at him from the pipe above 
 it looks like three fighters lando said to chewbacca as they watched configurations we can outdistance them easily he the capabilities of the freighter as well as han solo at leia he mourned the passing of his administratorship i know thatsetup was too good to last he moaned going to miss it 
 but leia seemed to be in a daze she acknowledge stared straight ahead of her as if transfixed then out of her dreamlike spoke luke she said as if responding to something she heard 
 what lando asked 
 got to go back she said urgently chewie head for the bottom of thecity 
 lando looked at her in astonishment wait a minute not going backthere 
 the wookiee barked for once in agreement with lando 
 no argument leia said firmly assuming the dignity of one accustomed tohaving her orders obeyed just do it a command 
 what about those fighters lando argued as he pointed to three tie fightersclosing in on them he looked to chewbacca for support 
 but growling menacingly chewbacca conveyed that he knew who was incommand now 
 okay okay lando quietly acquiesced 
 with all the grace and speed for which the millennium falcon was famed theship banked through the clouds and turned back toward the city and as thefreighter continued on what could become a suicide run the three pursuing tiefighters matched its turn 
 luke skywalker was unaware of the millennium approach barelyconscious he somehow maintained his hold on the creaking and swaying weathervane the device bent under the weight of his body then completely broke off fromits foundation and sent luke tumbling helplessly through the sky and this time heknew there would be nothing for him to cling to as he fell 
 look lando exclaimed indicating a figure plunging in the falling 
 leia managed to remain calm she knew that panic would doom them all getunder him chewie she told the pilot luke 
 chewbacca immediately responded and carefully eased the millennium falconon a descent trajectory 
 lando leia called turning to him open the top hatch 
 as he rushed out of the cockpit lando thought it a strategy worthy of solohimself 
 chewbacca and leia could see plunging body more clearly and thewookiee guided the ship toward him as chewie retarded the speeddrastically the plummeting form skimmed the windscreen and then landed with athud against the outer hull 
 lando opened the upper hatch in the distance he glimpsed the three tiefighters approaching the falcon their laser guns brightening the twilight sky withstreaks of hot destruction lando stretched his body out of the hatch and reached tograsp the battered warrior and pull him inside the ship just then falcon lurched as abolt exploded near it and almost threw body overboard but lando caughthis hand and held on tightly 
 the millennium falcon veered away from cloud city and soared through thethick billowing cloud cover swerving to avoid the blinding flak from the tiefighters princess leia and the wookiee pilot struggled to keep their ship explosions burst all around the cockpit the din competing with as he frantically worked the controls 
 leia switched on the intercom lando is he all right she shouted over thenoise in the cockpit lando do you hear me 
 from the rear of the cockpit she heard a voice that luke replied faintly 
 leia and chewbacca turned to see luke bettered and bloodied and wrapped in ablanket being helped into the cockpit by lando the princess jumped up from herchair and hugged him ecstatically chewbacca still trying to guide the ship out ofthe tie fighter range of fire threw back his head and barked in jubilation 
 behind the millennium falcon the planet of clouds was receding farther in thedistance but the tie fighters kept up their close pursuit firing their laser weaponsand rocking the pirate craft with each hit 
 working diligently in the hold struggled against theconstant lunging and tossing to reassemble his golden friend meticulously trying toundo the mistakes of the wookiee the little droid beeped as heperformed the intricate task 
 very good the protocol droid praised his head was on properly and hissecond arm was nearly completely reattached good as new 
 artoo beeped apprehensively 
 no artoo worry sure make it this time 
 but in the cockpit lando was not so optimistic he saw the warning lights onthe control panel begin to flash suddenly alarms all over the ship went on thedeflector shields are going he reported to leia and chewbacca 
 leia looked over shoulder and noticed another blip ominously had appeared on radarscope another ship she said much to cut us off 
 luke quietly gazed out the cockpit window toward the starry void almost tohimself he said vader 
 admiral piett approached vader who stood on the bridge of this the greatest ofall imperial star destroyers and stared out the windows 
 be in range of the tractor beam in moments the admiral reportedconfidently 
 and their hyperdrive has been deactivated vader asked 
 right after they were captured sir 
 good the giant figure said prepare for the boarding and setyour weapons for stun 
 the millennium falcon so far had managed to evade its tie fighter could it escape attack from the ominous star destroyer that pressed toward closer 
 we have any room for mistakes leia said tensely watching the largeblip on the monitors 
 if my men said they fixed this baby they fixed it lando assured her nothing to worry about 
 sounds familiar leia mused to herself 
 the ship was rocked again by the concussion of another laser explosion but atthat moment a green light began flashing on the control panel 
 the coordinates are set chewie leia said now or never 
 the wookiee barked in agreement he was ready for the hyperdrive escape 
 punch it lando yelled 
 chewbacca shrugged as if to say it was worth a try he pulled back on throttle suddenly altering the sound of the ion engines all on boardwere praying in human and droid fashion that the system would work they had noother hope of escape but abruptly the sound choked and died and chewbaccaroared a howl of desperate frustration 
 again the hyperdrive system had failed them 
 and still the millennium falcon lurched with the tie fighters fire 
 from his imperial star destroyer darth vader watched in fascination as the tiefighters relentlessly fired at the millennium falcon ship was closing in onthe fleeing would not be long before the dark lord had skywalkercompletely in his power 
 and luke sensed it too quietly he gazed out knowing that vader was his victory over the weakened jedi would soon be complete his body wasbattered was exhausted his spirit was prepared to succumb to his fate there wasno reason to fight any was nothing left to believe in 
 ben he whispered in utter despair why you tell me 
 lando tried to adjust some controls and chewbacca leaped from his chair to racethe hold leia took seat and helped lando as they flew the falconthrough the exploding flak 
 as the wookiee ran into the hold he passed artoo who was still working onthreepio the r unit began to beep in great consternation as he scanned thewookiee frantically trying to fix the hyperdrive system 
 i said doomed the panicked threepio told artoo the are malfunctioning again 
 artoo beeped as he connected a leg 
 how could you know wrong the golden droid scoffed my foot and stop chattering on so 
 voice sounded in the hold through the intercom chewie check thesecondary deviation controls 
 chewbacca dropped into the pit he fought to loosen a section of thepaneling with an enormous wrench but it failed to budge roaring in gripped the tool like a club and bashed the panel with all his strength 
 suddenly the cockpit control panel sprayed lando and the princess with ashower of sparks they jumped back in their seats in surprise but luke to notice anything happening around him his head hung in discouragementand deep pain 
 i be able to resist him he muttered softly 
 again lando banked the millennium falcon trying to shed the pursuers butthe distance between the freighter and tie fighters was narrowing by the moment 
 in the millennium hold artoo raced to a control panel leaving anoutraged threepio to stand sputtering in place on his one attached leg artooworked swiftly relying only on mechanical instinct to reprogram the circuit flashed brightly with each of adjustments when suddenly from deepwithin the hyperspeed engines a new and powerful hum resonatedthroughout the ship 
 the freighter tilted suddenly sending the whistling r droid rolling across thefloor into the pit to land on the startled chewbacca 
 lando who had been standing near the control panel tumbled back against thecockpit wall but as he fell back he saw the stars outside become blinding infinitestreaks of light 
 we did it lando yelled triumphantly 
 the millennium falcon had shot victoriously into hyperdrive 
 darth vader stood silently he gazed at the black void where a moment millennium falcon had been his deep black silence brought terror to the twomen standing near him admiral piett and his captain waited chills of fear coursingthrough their bodies and wondered how soon they would feel the invisible viseliketalons around their throats 
 but the dark lord did not move he stood silently contemplative with hishands behind his back then he turned and slowly walked off the bridge his eboncloak billowing behind him

 book one 
 chapter xxvii 
 
 at the appointed hour the prince powdered and shaven entered the dining room where his princess mary and mademoiselle bourienne were already awaiting him together with his architect who by a strange caprice of his was admitted to table though the position of that insignificant individual was such as could certainly not have caused him to expect that honor the prince who generally kept very strictly to social distinctions and rarely admitted even important government officials to his table had unexpectedly selected michael ivanovich who always went into a corner to blow his nose on his checked handkerchief to illustrate the theory that all men are equals and had more than once impressed on his daughter that michael ivanovich was not a whit worse than you or i at dinner the prince usually spoke to the taciturn michael ivanovich more often than to anyone else 
 in the dining room which like all the rooms in the house was exceedingly lofty the members of the household and the footmen one behind each chair stood waiting for the prince to enter the head butler napkin on arm was scanning the setting of the table making signs to the footmen and anxiously glancing from the clock to the door by which the prince was to enter prince andrew was looking at a large gilt frame new to him containing the genealogical tree of the princes bolkonski opposite which hung another such frame with a badly painted portrait evidently by the hand of the artist belonging to the estate of a ruling prince in a crown an alleged descendant of rurik and ancestor of the bolkonskis prince andrew looking again at that genealogical tree shook his head laughing as a man laughs who looks at a portrait so characteristic of the original as to be amusing 
 how thoroughly like him that is he said to princess mary who had come up to him 
 princess mary looked at her brother in surprise she did not understand what he was laughing at everything her father did inspired her with reverence and was beyond question 
 everyone has his achilles heel continued prince andrew fancy with his powerful mind indulging in such nonsense 
 princess mary could not understand the boldness of her criticism and was about to reply when the expected footsteps were heard coming from the study the prince walked in quickly and jauntily as was his wont as if intentionally contrasting the briskness of his manners with the strict formality of his house at that moment the great clock struck two and another with a shrill tone joined in from the drawing room the prince stood still his lively glittering eyes from under their thick bushy eyebrows sternly scanned all present and rested on the little princess she felt as courtiers do when the tsar enters the sensation of fear and respect which the old man inspired in all around him he stroked her hair and then patted her awkwardly on the back of her neck 
 glad glad to see you he said looking attentively into her eyes and then quickly went to his place and sat down sit down sit down sit down michael ianovich 
 he indicated a place beside him to his a footman moved the chair for her 
 ho ho said the old man casting his eyes on her rounded figure been in a hurry bad 
 he laughed in his usual dry cold unpleasant way with his lips only and not with his eyes 
 you must walk walk as much as possible as much as possible he said 
 the little princess did not or did not wish to hear his words she was silent and seemed confused the prince asked her about her father and she began to smile and talk he asked about mutual acquaintances and she became still more animated and chattered away giving him greetings from various people and retailing the town gossip 
 countess apraksina poor thing has lost her husband and she has cried her eyes out she said growing more and more lively 
 as she became animated the prince looked at her more and more sternly and suddenly as if he had studied her sufficiently and had formed a definite idea of her he turned away and addressed michael ivanovich 
 well michael ivanovich our bonaparte will be having a bad time of it prince andrew he always spoke thus of his son has been telling me what forces are being collected against him while you and i never thought much of him 
 michael ivanovich did not at all know when you and i had said such things about bonaparte but understanding that he was wanted as a peg on which to hang the favorite topic he looked inquiringly at the young prince wondering what would follow 
 he is a great tactician said the prince to his son pointing to the architect 
 and the conversation again turned on the war on bonaparte and the generals and statesmen of the day the old prince seemed convinced not only that all the men of the day were mere babies who did not know the a b c of war or of politics and that bonaparte was an insignificant little frenchy successful only because there were no longer any potemkins or suvorovs left to oppose him but he was also convinced that there were no political difficulties in europe and no real war but only a sort of puppet show at which the men of the day were playing pretending to do something real prince andrew gaily bore with his ridicule of the new men and drew him on and listened to him with evident pleasure 
 the past always seems good said he but did not suvorov himself fall into a trap moreau set him and from which he did not know how to escape 
 who told you that who cried the prince suvorov and he jerked away his plate which tikhon briskly caught suvorov consider prince andrew two frederick and suvorov moreau moreau would have been a prisoner if suvorov had had a free hand but he had the on his hands it would have puzzled the devil himself when you get there find out what those are suvorov manage them so what chance has michael kutuzov no my dear boy he continued you and your generals get on against buonaparte have to call in the french so that birds of a feather may fight together the german pahlen has been sent to new york in america to fetch the frenchman moreau he said alluding to the invitation made that year to moreau to enter the russian service wonderful were the potemkins suvorovs and orlovs germans no lad either you fellows have all lost your wits or i have outlived mine may god help you but see what will happen buonaparte has become a great commander among them hm 
 i at all say that all the plans are good said prince andrew i am only surprised at your opinion of bonaparte you may laugh as much as you like but all the same bonaparte is a great generall 
 michael ivanovich cried the old prince to the architect who busy with his roast meat hoped he had been forgotten i tell you buonaparte was a great tactician here he says same thing 
 to be sure your excellency replied the architect 
 the prince again laughed his frigid laugh 
 buonaparte was born with a silver spoon in his mouth he has got splendid soldiers besides he began by attacking germans and only idlers have failed to beat the germans since the world began everybody has beaten the germans they beat no one except one another he made his reputation fighting them 
 and the prince began explaining all the blunders which according to him bonaparte had made in his campaigns and even in politics his son made no rejoinder but it was evident that whatever arguments were presented he was as little able as his father to change his opinion he listened refraining from a reply and involuntarily wondered how this old man living alone in the country for so many years could know and discuss so minutely and acutely all the recent european military and political events 
 you think an old man and understand the present state of affairs concluded his father but it troubles me i sleep at night come now where has this great commander of yours shown his skill he concluded 
 that would take too long to tell answered the son 
 well then go to your buonaparte mademoiselle bourienne another admirer of that emperor of yours he exclaimed in excellent french 
 you know prince i am not a bonapartist 
 dieu sait quand reviendra hummed the prince out of tune and with a laugh still more so he quitted the table 
 the little princess during the whole discussion and the rest of the dinner sat silent glancing with a frightened look now at her and now at princess mary when they left the table she took her arm and drew her into another room 
 what a clever man your father is said she perhaps that is why i am afraid of him 
 oh he is so kind answered princess mary

 seven days glided away every one marking its course by the henceforth rapid alteration of edgar state the havoc that months had previously wrought was now emulated by the inroads of hours catherine we would fain have deluded yet but her own quick spirit refused to delude her it divined in secret and brooded on the dreadful probability gradually ripening into certainty she had not the heart to mention her ride when thursday came round i mentioned it for her and obtained permission to order her out of doors for the library where her father stopped a short time brief period he could bear to sit his chamber had become her whole world she grudged each moment that did not find her bending over his pillow or seated by his side her countenance grew wan with watching and sorrow and my master gladly dismissed her to what he flattered himself would be a happy change of scene and society drawing comfort from the hope that she would not now be left entirely alone after his death 
 he had a fixed idea i guessed by several observations he let fall that as his nephew resembled him in person he would resemble him in mind for letters bore few or no indications of his defective character and i through pardonable weakness refrained from correcting the error asking myself what good there would be in disturbing his last moments with information that he had neither power nor opportunity to turn to account 
 we deferred our excursion till the afternoon a golden afternoon of august every breath from the hills so full of life that it seemed whoever respired it though dying might revive face was just like the and sunshine flitting over it in rapid succession but the shadows rested longer and the sunshine was more transient and her poor little heart reproached itself for even that passing forgetfulness of its cares 
 we discerned linton watching at the same spot he had selected before my young mistress alighted and told me that as she was resolved to stay a very little while i had better hold the pony and remain on horseback but i dissented i risk losing sight of the charge committed to me a minute so we climbed the slope of heath together master heathcliff received us with greater animation on this occasion not the animation of high spirits though nor yet of joy it looked more like fear 
 it is late he said speaking short and with difficulty is not your father very ill i thought you come 
 why you be candid cried catherine swallowing her greeting why cannot you say at once you want me it is strange linton that for the second time you have brought me here on purpose apparently to distress us both and for no reason besides 
 linton shivered and glanced at her half supplicating half ashamed but his patience was not sufficient to endure this enigmatical behaviour 
 my father is very ill she said and why am i called from his bedside why you send to absolve me from my promise when you wished i keep it come i desire an explanation playing and trifling are completely banished out of my mind and i dance attendance on your affectations now 
 my affectations he murmured what are they for sake catherine look so angry despise me as much as you please i am a worthless cowardly wretch i be scorned enough but too mean for your anger hate my father and spare me for contempt 
 nonsense cried catherine in a passion foolish silly boy and there he trembles as if i were really going to touch him you bespeak contempt linton anybody will have it spontaneously at your service get off i shall return home it is folly dragging you from the hearthstone and do we pretend let go my frock if i pitied you for crying and looking so very frightened you should spurn such pity ellen tell him how disgraceful this conduct is rise and degrade yourself into an abject 
 with streaming face and an expression of agony linton had thrown his nerveless frame along the ground he seemed convulsed with exquisite terror 
 oh he sobbed i cannot bear it catherine catherine a traitor too and i dare not tell you but leave me and i shall be killed dear catherine my life is in your hands and you have said you loved me and if you did it harm you not go then kind sweet good catherine and perhaps you will let me die with you 
 my young lady on witnessing his intense anguish stooped to raise him the old feeling of indulgent tenderness overcame her vexation and she grew thoroughly moved and alarmed 
 consent to what she asked to stay tell me the meaning of this strange talk and i will you contradict your own words and distract me be calm and frank and confess at once all that weighs on your heart you injure me linton would you you let any enemy hurt me if you could prevent it believe you are a coward for yourself but not a cowardly betrayer of your best friend 
 but my father threatened me gasped the boy clasping his attenuated fingers and i dread dread him i dare not tell 
 oh well said catherine with scornful compassion keep your secret no coward save yourself not afraid 
 her magnanimity provoked his tears he wept wildly kissing her supporting hands and yet could not summon courage to speak out i was cogitating what the mystery might be and determined catherine should never suffer to benefit him or anyone else by my goodwill when hearing a rustle among the ling i looked up and saw mr heathcliff almost close upon us descending the heights he cast a glance towards my companions though they were sufficiently near for sobs to be audible but hailing me in the almost hearty tone he assumed to none besides and the sincerity of which i avoid doubting he said 
 it is something to see you so my house nelly how are you at the grange let us hear the rumour goes he added in a lower tone that edgar linton is on his deathbed perhaps they exaggerate his illness 
 no my master is dying i replied it is true enough a sad thing it will be for us all but a blessing for him 
 how long will he last do you think he asked 
 i know i said 
 because he continued looking at the two young people who were fixed under his appeared as if he could not venture to stir or raise his head and catherine could not move on his that lad yonder seems determined to beat me and thank his uncle to be quick and go before him hallo has the whelp been playing that game long i did give him some lessons about snivelling is he pretty lively with miss linton generally 
 lively has shown the greatest distress i answered to see him i should say that instead of rambling with his sweetheart on the hills he ought to be in bed under the hands of a doctor 
 he shall be in a day or two muttered heathcliff but up linton get up he shouted grovel on the ground there up this moment 
 linton had sunk prostrate again in another paroxysm of helpless fear caused by his glance towards him i suppose there was nothing else to produce such humiliation he made several efforts to obey but his little strength was annihilated for the time and he fell back again with a moan mr heathcliff advanced and lifted him to lean against a ridge of turf 
 now said he with curbed ferocity getting angry and if you command that paltry spirit of you get up directly 
 i will father he panted only let me alone or i shall faint done as you wished sure catherine will tell you that been cheerful ah keep by me catherine give me your hand 
 take mine said his father stand on your feet there lend you her arm right look at her you would imagine i was the devil himself miss linton to excite such horror be so kind as to walk home with him will you he shudders if i touch him 
 linton dear whispered catherine i go to wuthering heights papa has forbidden me not harm you why are you so afraid 
 i can never that house he answered not to it without you 
 stop cried his father respect filial scruples nelly take him in and follow your advice concerning the doctor without delay 
 do well replied i but i must remain with my mistress to mind your son is not my business 
 you are very stiff said heathcliff i know that but force me to pinch the baby and make it scream before it moves your charity come then my hero are you willing to return escorted by me 
 he approached once more and made as if he would seize the fragile being but shrinking back linton clung to his cousin and implored her to accompany him with a frantic importunity that admitted no denial however i disapproved i hinder her indeed how could she have refused him herself what was filling him with dread we had no means of discerning but there he was powerless under its grip and any addition seemed capable of shocking him into idiotcy we reached the threshold catherine walked in and i stood waiting till she had conducted the invalid to a chair expecting her out immediately when mr heathcliff pushing me forward exclaimed 
 my house is not stricken with the plague nelly and i have a mind to be hospitable today sit down and allow me to shut the door 
 he shut and locked it also i started 
 you shall have tea before you go home he added i am by myself hareton is gone with some cattle to the lees and zillah and joseph are off on a journey of pleasure and though used to being alone rather have some interesting company if i can get it miss linton take your seat by him i give you what i have the present is hardly worth accepting but i have nothing else to offer it is linton i mean how she does stare odd what a savage feeling i have to anything that seems afraid of me had i been born where laws are less strict and tastes less dainty i should treat a slow vivisection of those two as an amusement 
 he drew in his breath struck the table and swore to himself by hell i hate them 
 not afraid of you exclaimed catherine who could not hear the latter part of his speech she stepped close up her black eyes flashing with passion and resolution give me that key i will have it she said i eat or drink here if i were starving 
 heathcliff had the key in his hand that remained on the table he looked up seized with a sort of surprise at her boldness or possibly reminded by her voice and glance of the person from whom she inherited it she snatched at the instrument and half succeeded in getting it out of his loosened fingers but her action recalled him to the present he recovered it speedily 
 now catherine linton he said stand off or i shall knock you down and that will make mrs dean mad 
 regardless of this warning she captured his closed hand and its contents again we will go she repeated exerting her utmost efforts to cause the iron muscles to relax and finding that her nails made no impression she applied her teeth pretty sharply heathcliff glanced at me a glance that kept me from interfering a moment catherine was too intent on his fingers to notice his face he opened them suddenly and resigned the object of dispute but ere she had well secured it he seized her with the liberated hand and pulling her on his knee administered with the other a shower of terrific slaps on the side of the head each sufficient to have fulfilled his threat had she been able to fall 
 at this diabolical violence i rushed on him furiously you villain i began to cry you villain a touch on the chest silenced me i am stout and soon put out of breath and what with that and the rage i staggered dizzily back and felt ready to suffocate or to burst a blood vessel the scene was over in two minutes catherine released put her two hands to her temples and looked just as if she were not sure whether her ears were off or on she trembled like a reed poor thing and leant against the table perfectly bewildered 
 i know how to chastise children you see said the scoundrel grimly as he stooped to repossess himself of the key which had dropped to the floor go to linton now as i told you and cry at your ease i shall be your father the father have in a few you shall have plenty of that you can bear plenty no weakling you shall have a daily taste if i catch such a devil of a temper in your eyes again 
 cathy ran to me instead of linton and knelt down and put her burning cheek on my lap weeping aloud her cousin had shrunk into a corner of the settle as quiet as a mouse congratulating himself i dare say that the correction had lighted on another than him mr heathcliff perceiving us all confounded rose and expeditiously made the tea himself the cups and saucers were laid ready he poured it out and handed me a cup 
 wash away your spleen he said and help your own naughty pet and mine it is not poisoned though i prepared it going out to seek your horses 
 our first thought on his departure was to force an exit somewhere we tried the kitchen door but that was fastened outside we looked at the were too narrow for even little figure 
 master into i cried seeing we were regularly imprisoned you know what your diabolical father is after and you shall tell us or box your ears as he has done your 
 yes linton you must tell said catherine it was for your sake i came and it will be wickedly ungrateful if you refuse 
 give me some tea thirsty and then tell you he answered mrs dean go away i like you standing over me now catherine you are letting your tears fall into my cup i drink that give me another 
 catherine pushed another to him and wiped her face i felt disgusted at the little composure since he was no longer in terror for himself the anguish he had exhibited on the moor subsided as soon as ever he entered wuthering heights so i guessed he had been menaced with an awful visitation of wrath if he failed in decoying us there and that accomplished he had no further immediate fears 
 papa wants us to be married he continued after sipping some of the liquid and he knows your papa let us marry now and afraid of my dying if we wait so we are to be married in the morning and you are to stay here all night and if you do as he wishes you shall return home next day and take me with you 
 take you with her pitiful changeling i exclaimed you marry why the man is mad or he thinks us fools every one and do you imagine that beautiful young lady that healthy hearty girl will tie herself to a little perishing monkey like you are you cherishing the notion that anybody let alone miss catherine linton would have you for a husband you want whipping for bringing us in here at all with your dastardly puling tricks look so silly now a very good mind to shake you severely for your contemptible treachery and your imbecile conceit 
 i did give him a slight shaking but it brought on the cough and he took to his ordinary resource of moaning and weeping and catherine rebuked me 
 stay all night no she said looking slowly round ellen burn that door down but get out 
 and she would have commenced the execution of her threat directly but linton was up in alarm for his dear self again he clasped her in his two feeble arms sobbing 
 you have me and save me not let me come to the grange oh darling catherine you go and leave me after all you must obey my must 
 i must obey my own she replied and relieve him from this cruel suspense the whole night what would he think be distressed already either break or burn a way out of the house be quiet in no danger but if you hinder i love papa better than you 
 the mortal terror he felt of mr anger restored to the boy his eloquence catherine was near distraught still she persisted that she must go home and tried entreaty in her turn persuading him to subdue his selfish agony while they were thus occupied our gaoler 
 your beasts have trotted off he said linton snivelling again what has she been doing to you come done and get to bed in a month or two my lad be able to pay her back her present tyrannies with a vigorous hand pining for pure love are you not nothing else in the world and she shall have you there to bed zillah be here tonight you must undress yourself hush hold your noise once in your own room not come near you you fear by chance managed tolerably look to the rest 
 he spoke these words holding the door open for his son to pass and the latter achieved his exit exactly as a spaniel might which suspected the person who attended on it of designing a spiteful squeeze the lock was heathcliff approached the fire where my mistress and i stood silent catherine looked up and instinctively raised her hand to her cheek his neighbourhood revived a painful sensation anybody else would have been incapable of regarding the childish act with sternness but he scowled on her and muttered 
 oh you are not afraid of me your courage is well disguised you seem damnably afraid 
 i am afraid now she replied because if i stay papa will be miserable and how can i endure making him heathcliff let me go home i promise to marry linton papa would like me to and i love should you wish to force me to do what willingly do of myself 
 let him dare to force you i cried law in the land thank god there is though we be in an place inform if he were my own son and felony without benefit of clergy 
 silence said the ruffian to the devil with your clamour i want you to speak miss linton i shall enjoy myself remarkably in thinking your father will be miserable i shall not sleep for satisfaction you could have hit on no surer way of fixing your residence under my roof for the next hours than informing me that such an event would follow as to your promise to marry linton take care you shall keep it for you shall not quit this place till it is fulfilled 
 send ellen then to let papa know safe exclaimed catherine weeping bitterly or marry me now poor papa ellen think lost what shall we do 
 not he think you are tired of waiting on him and run off for a little amusement answered heathcliff you cannot deny that you entered my house of your own accord in contempt of his injunctions to the contrary and it is quite natural that you should desire amusement at your age arid that you would weary of nursing a sick man and that man only your father catherine his happiest days were over when your days began he cursed you i dare say for coming into the world i did at least and it would just do if he cursed you as he went out of it join him i love you how should i weep away as far as i can see it will be your chief diversion hereafter unless linton make amends for other losses and your provident parent appears to fancy he may his letters of advice and consolation entertained me vastly in his last he recommended my jewel to be careful of his and kind to her when he got her careful and paternal but linton requires his whole stock of care and kindness for himself linton can play the little tyrant well undertake to torture any number of cats if their teeth be drawn and their claws pared be able to tell his uncle fine tales of his kindness when you get home again i assure you 
 right there i said explain your character show his resemblance to yourself and then i hope miss cathy will think twice before she takes the cockatrice 
 i much mind speaking of his amiable qualities now he answered because she must either accept him or remain a prisoner and you along with her till your master dies i can detain you both quite concealed here if you doubt encourage her to retract her word and have an opportunity of judging 
 not retract my word said catherine marry him within this hour if i may go to thrushcross grange afterwards mr heathcliff a cruel man but not a fiend and you from mere malice destroy irrevocably all my happiness if papa thought i had left him on purpose and if he died before i returned could i bear to live given over crying but going to kneel here at your knee and not get up and not take my eyes from your face till you look back at me no turn away do look see nothing to provoke you i hate you not angry that you struck me have you never loved anybody in all your life uncle never ah you must look once so wretched you help being sorry and pitying me 
 keep your fingers off and move or kick you cried heathcliff brutally repulsing her rather be hugged by a snake how the devil can you dream of fawning on me i detest you 
 he shrugged his shoulders shook himself indeed as if his flesh crept with aversion and thrust back his chair while i got up and opened my mouth to commence a downright torrent of abuse but i was rendered dumb in the middle of the first sentence by a threat that i should be shown into a room by myself the very next syllable i uttered it was growing heard a sound of voices at the garden gate our host hurried out instantly he had his wits about him we had not there was a talk of two or three minutes and he returned alone 
 i thought it had been your cousin hareton i observed to catherine i wish he would arrive who knows but he might take our part 
 it was three servants sent to seek you from the grange said heathcliff overhearing me you should have opened a lattice and called out but i could swear that chit is glad you glad to be obliged to stay certain 
 at learning the chance we had missed we both gave vent to our grief without control and he allowed us to wail on till nine then he bid us go upstairs through the kitchen to chamber and i whispered my companion to obey perhaps we might contrive to get through the window there or into a garret and out by its skylight the window however was narrow like those below and the garret trap was safe from our attempts for we were fastened in as before we neither of us lay down catherine took her station by the lattice and watched anxiously for morning a deep sigh being the only answer i could obtain to my frequent entreaties that she would try to rest i seated myself in a chair and rocked to and fro passing harsh judgment on my many derelictions of duty from which it struck me then all the misfortunes of all my employers sprang it was not the case in reality i am aware but it was in my imagination that dismal night and i thought heathcliff himself less guilty than i 
 at seven he came and inquired if miss linton had risen 
 she ran to the door immediately and answered yes here then he said opening it and pulling her out i rose to follow but he turned the lock again i demanded my release 
 be patient he replied send up your breakfast in a while 
 i thumped on the panels and rattled the latch angrily and catherine asked why i was still shut up he answered i must try to endure it another hour and they went away i endured it two or three hours at length i heard a footstep not 
 brought you something to eat said a voice oppen t door 
 complying eagerly i beheld hareton laden with food enough to last me all day 
 tak it he added thrusting the tray into my hand 
 stay one minute i began 
 nay cried he and retired regardless of any prayers i could pour forth to detain him 
 and there i remained enclosed the whole day and the whole of the next night and another and another five nights and four days i remained altogether seeing nobody but hareton once every morning and he was a model of a jailer surly and dumb and deaf to every attempt at moving his sense of justice or compassion

 chapter 
 
 fortune suddenly smiled upon jo and dropped a good luck penny in her path not a golden penny exactly but i doubt if half a million would have given more real happiness then did the little sum that came to her in this wise 
 every few weeks she would shut herself up in her room put on her scribbling suit and fall into a vortex as she expressed it writing away at her novel with all her heart and soul for till that was finished she could find no peace her scribbling suit consisted of a black woolen pinafore on which she could wipe her pen at will and a cap of the same material adorned with a cheerful red bow into which she bundled her hair when the decks were cleared for action this cap was a beacon to the inquiring eyes of her family who during these periods kept their distance merely popping in their heads to ask with interest does genius burn jo they did not always venture even to ask this question but took an observation of the cap and judged accordingly if this expressive article of dress was drawn low upon the forehead it was a sign that hard work was going on in exciting moments it was pushed rakishly askew and when despair seized the author it was plucked wholly off and cast upon the floor and cast upon the floor at such times the intruder silently withdrew and not until the red bow was seen gaily erect upon the gifted brow did anyone dare address jo 
 she did not think herself a genius by any means but when the writing fit came on she gave herself up to it with entire abandon and led a blissful life unconscious of want care or bad weather while she sat safe and happy in an imaginary world full of friends almost as real and dear to her as any in the flesh sleep forsook her eyes meals stood untasted day and night were all too short to enjoy the happiness which blessed her only at such times and made these hours worth living even if they bore no other fruit the devine afflatus usually lasted a week or two and then she emerged from her vortex hungry sleepy cross or despondent 
 she was just recovering from one of these attacks when she was prevailed upon to escort miss crocker to a lecture and in return for her virtue was rewarded with a new idea it was a course the lecture on the pyramids and jo rather wondered at the choice of such a subject for such an audience but took it for granted that some great social evil would be remedied or some great want supplied by unfolding the glories of the pharaohs to an audience whose thoughts were busy with the price of coal and flour and whose lives were spent in trying to solve harder riddles than that of the sphinx 
 they were early and while miss crocker set the heel of her stocking jo amused herself by examining the faces of the people who occupied the seat with them on her left were two matrons with massive foreheads and bonnets to match discussing rights and making tatting beyond sat a pair of humble lovers artlessly holding each other by the hand a somber spinster eating peppermints out of a paper bag and an old gentleman taking his preparatory nap behind a yellow bandanna on her right her only neighbor was a studious looking lad absorbed in a newspaper 
 it was a pictorial sheet and jo examined the work of art nearest her idly wondering what fortuitous concatenation of circumstances needed the melodramatic illustration of an indian in full war costume tumbling over a precipice with a wolf at his throat while two infuriated young gentlemen with unnaturally small feet and big stabbing each other close by and a disheveled female was flying away in the background with her mouth wide open pausing to turn a page the lad saw her looking and with boyish good nature offered half his paper saying bluntly want to read it a story 
 jo accepted it with a smile for she had never outgrown her liking for lads and soon found herself involved in the usual labyrinth of love mystery and murder for the story belonged to that class of light literature in which the passions have a holiday and when the invention fails a grand catastrophe clears the stage of one half the dramatis personae leaving the other half to exult over their downfall 
 prime it asked the boy as her eye went down the last paragraph of her portion 
 i think you and i could do as well as that if we tried returned jo amused at his admiration of the trash 
 i should think i was a pretty lucky chap if i could she makes a good living out of such stories they say and he pointed to the name of mrs northbury under the title of the tale 
 do you know her asked jo with sudden interest 
 no but i read all her pieces and i know a fellow who works in the office where this paper is printed do you say she makes a good living out of stories like this and jo looked more respectfully at the agitated group and thickly sprinkled exclamation points that adorned the page 
 guess she does she knows just what folks like and gets paid well for writing it 
 here the lecture began but jo heard very little of it for while professor sands was prosing away about belzoni cheops scarabei and hieroglyphics she was covertly taking down the address of the paper and boldly resolving to try for the prize offered in its columns for a sensational story by the time the lecture ended and the audience awoke she had built up a splendid fortune for herself not the first founded on paper and was already deep in the concoction of her story being unable to decide whether the duel should come before the elopement or after the murder 
 she said nothing of her plan at home but fell to work next day much to the disquiet of her mother who always looked a little anxious when genius took to burning jo had never tried this style before contenting herself with very mild romances for the spread eagle her experience and miscellaneous reading were of service now for they gave her some idea of dramatic effect and supplied plot language and costumes her story was as full of desperation and despair as her limited acquaintance with those uncomfortable emotions enabled her to make it and having located it in lisbon she wound up with an earthquake as a striking and appropriate denouement the manuscript was privately dispatched accompanied by a note modestly saying that if the tale get the prize which the writer hardly dared expect she would be very glad to receive any sum it might be considered worth 
 six weeks is a long time to wait and a still longer time for a girl to keep a secret but jo did both and was just beginning to give up all hope of ever seeing her manuscript again when a letter arrived which almost took her breath away for on opening it a check for a hundred dollars fell into her lap for a minute she stared at it as if it had been a snake then she read her letter and began to cry if the amiable gentleman who wrote that kindly note could have known what intense happiness he was giving a fellow creature i think he would devote his leisure hours if he has any to that amusement for jo valued the letter more than the money because it was encouraging and after years of effort it was so pleasant to find that she had learned to do something though it was only to write a sensation story 
 a prouder young woman was seldom seen than she when havingcomposed herself she electrified the family by appearing before them with the letter in one hand the check in the other announcing that she had won the prize of course there was a great jubilee and when the story came everyone read and praised it though after her father had told her that the language was good the romance fresh and hearty and the tragedy quite thrilling he shook his head and said in his unworldly way 
 you can do better than this jo aim at the highest and never mind the money 
 i think the money is the best part of it what will you do with such a fortune asked amy regarding the magic slip of paper with a reverential eye 
 send beth and mother to the seaside for a month or two answered jo promptly 
 to the seaside they went after much discussion and though beth come home as plump and rosy as could be desired she was much better while mrs march declared she felt ten years younger so jo was satisfied with the investment of her prize money and fell to work with a cheery spirit bent on earning more of those delightful checks she did earn several that year and began to feel herself a power in the house for by the magic of a pen her rubbish turned into comforts for them all the daughter paid the bill a phantom hand put down a new carpet and the curse of the coventrys proved the blessing of the marches in the way of groceries and gowns 
 wealth is certainly a most desirable thing but poverty has its sunny side and one of the sweet uses of adversity is the genuine satisfaction which comes from hearty work of head or hand and to the inspiration of necessity we owe half the wise beautiful and useful blessings of the world jo enjoyed a taste of this satisfaction and ceased to envy richer girls taking great comfort in the knowledge that she could supply her own wants and need ask no one for a penny 
 little notice was taken of her stories but they found a market and encouraged by this fact she resolved to make a bold stroke for fame and fortune having copied her novel for the fourth time read it to all her confidential friends and submitted it with fear and trembling to three publishers she at last disposed of it on condition that she would cut it down one third and omit all the parts which she particularly admired 
 now i must either bundle it back in to my tin kitchen to mold pay for printing it myself or chop it up to suit purchasers and get what i can for it fame is a very good thing to have in the house but cash is more convenient so i wish to take the sense of the meeting on this important subject said jo calling a family council 
 spoil your book my girl for there is more in it than you know and the idea is well worked out let it wait and ripen was her advice and he practiced what he preached having waited patiently thirty years for fruit of his own to ripen and being in no haste to gather it even now when it was sweet and mellow 
 it seems to me that jo will profit more by taking the trial than by waiting said mrs march criticism is the best test of such work for it will show her both unsuspected merits and faults and help her to do better next time we are too partial but the praise and blame of outsiders will prove useful even if she gets but little money 
 yes said jo knitting her brows just it been fussing over the thing so long i really know whether good bad or indifferent it will be a great help to have cool impartial persons take a look at it and tell me what they think of it 
 i leave a word out of it spoil it if you do for the interest of the story is more in the minds than in the actions of the people and it will be all a muddle if you explain as you go on said meg who firmly believed that this book was the most remarkable novel ever written 
 but mr allen says leave out the explanations make it brief and dramatic and let the characters tell the story interrupted jo turning to the note 
 do as he tells you he knows what will sale and we make a good popular book and get as much money as you can when got a name you can afford to digress and have philosophical and metaphysical people in your novels said amy who took a strictly practical view of the subject 
 well said jo laughing if my people are philosophical and metaphysical it my fault for i know nothing about such things except what i hear father say sometimes if got some of his wise ideas jumbled up with my romance so much the better for me now beth what do you say 
 i should so like to see it printed soon was all beth said and smiled in saying it but there was an unconscious emphasis on the last word and a wistful look in the eyes that never lost their childlike candor which chilled heart for a minute with a forboding fear and decided her to make her little venture soon 
 so with spartan firmness the young authoress laid her on her table and chopped it up as ruthlessly as any ogre in the hope of pleasing everyone she took advice and like the old man and his donkey in the fable suited nobody 
 her father liked the metaphysical streak which had unconsciously got into it so that was allowed to remain though she had her doubts about it her mother thought that there was a trifle too much description out therefore it came and with it many necessary links in the story meg admired the tragedy so jo piled up the agony to suit her while amy objected to the fun and with the best intentions in life jo quenched the spritly scenes which relieved the somber character of the story then to complicate the ruin she cut it down one third and confidingly sent the poor little romance like a picked robin out into the big busy world to try its fate 
 well it was printed and she got three hundred dollars for it likewise plenty of praise and blame both so much greater than she expected that she was thrown into a state of bewilderment from which it took her some time to recover 
 you said mother that criticism would help me but how can it when so contradictory that i know whether written a promising book or broken all the ten commandments cried poor jo turning over a heap of notices the perusal of which filled her with pride and joy one minute wrath and dismay the next this man says an exquisite book full of truth beauty and earnestness 
 all is sweet pure and healthy continued the perplexed authoress the next the theory of the book is bad full of morbid fancies spiritualistic ideas and unnatural characters now as i had no theory of any kind believe in spiritualism and copied my characters from life i see how this critic can be right another says one of the best american novels which has appeared for years i know better than that and the next asserts that though it is original and written with great force and feeling it is a dangerous book some make fun of it some overpraise and nearly all insist that i had a deep theory to expound when i only wrote it for the pleasure and the money i wish printed the whole or not at all for i do hate to be so misjudged 
 her family and friends administered comfort and commendation liberally yet it was a hard time for sensitive jo who meant so well and had apparently done so ill but it did her good for those whose opinion had real value gave her the critism which is an best education and when the first soreness was over she could laugh at her poor little book yet believe in it still and feel herself the wiser and stronger for the buffeting she had received 
 not being a genius like keats it kill me she said stoutly and got the joke on my side after all for the parts that were taken straight out of real life are denounced as impossible and absurd and the scenes that i made up out of my own silly head are pronounced charmingly natural tender and true so comfort myself with that and when ready up again and take another

 one of the best things about the aftermath of the second task was that everybody was very keen to hear details of what had happened down in the lake which meant that ron was getting to share limelight for once harry noticed that version of events changed subtly with every retelling at first he gave what seemed to be the truth it tallied with story anyway dumbledore had put all the hostages into a bewitched sleep in professor office first assuring them that they would be quite safe and would awake when they were back above the water one week later however ron was telling a thrilling tale of kidnap in which he struggled against fifty heavily armed merpeople who had to beat him into submission before tying him up 
 
 but i had my wand hidden up my sleeve he assured padma patil who seemed to be a lot keener on ron now that he was getting so much attention and was making a point of talking to him every time they passed in the corridors i taken those any time i wanted 
 
 what were you going to do snore at them said hermione waspishly people had been teasing her so much about being the thing that viktor krum would most miss that she was in a rather tetchy mood 
 
 ears went red and thereafter he reverted to the bewitched sleep version of events 
 
 as they entered march the weather became drier but cruel winds skinned their hands and faces every time they went out onto the grounds there were delays in the post because the owls kept being blown off course the brown owl that harry had sent to sirius with the dates of the hogsmeade weekend turned up at breakfast on friday morning with half its feathers sticking up the wrong way harry had no sooner torn off reply than it took flight clearly afraid it was going to be sent outside again 
 
 letter was almost as short as the previous one 
 
 be at stile at end of road out of hogsmeade past dervish and banges at two on saturday afternoon bring as much food as you can 
 he come back to hogsmeade said ron incredulously 
 
 it looks like it it said hermione 
 
 i believe him said harry tensely if caught 
 
 made it so far though he said ron and not like the place is swarming with dementors anymore 
 
 harry folded up the letter thinking if he was honest with himself he really wanted to see sirius again he therefore approached the final lesson of the afternoon double potions feeling considerably more cheerful than he usually did when descending the steps to the dungeons 
 
 malfoy crabbe and goyle were standing in a huddle outside the classroom door with pansy gang of slytherin girls all of them were looking at something harry see and sniggering heartily pansys face peered excitedly around broad back as harry ron and hermione approached 
 
 there they are there they are she giggled and the knot of slytherins broke apart harry saw that pansy had a magazine in her hands witch weekly the moving picture on the front showed a witch who was smiling toothily and pointing at a large sponge cake with her wand 
 
 you might find something to interest you in there granger pansy said loudly and she threw the magazine at hermione who caught it looking startled at that moment the dungeon door opened and snape beckoned them all inside 
 
 hermione harry and ron headed for a table at the back of the dungeon as usual once snape had turned his back on them to write up the ingredients of todays potion on the blackboard hermione hastily rifled through the magazine under the desk at last in the center pages hermione found what they were looking for harry and ron leaned in closer a color photograph of harry headed a short piece entitled 
 
 harry secret heartache 
 a boy like no other perhaps yet a boy suffering all the usual pangs of adolescence writes rita skeeter deprived of love since the tragic demise of his parents harry potter thought he had found solace in his steady girlfriend at hogwarts hermione granger little did he know that he would shortly be suffering yet another emotional blow in a life already littered with personal loss 
 miss granger a plain but ambitious girl seems to have a taste for famous wizards that harry alone cannot satisfy since the arrival at hogwarts of viktor krum bulgarian seeker and hero of the last world quidditch cup miss granger has been toying with both boys affections krum who is openly smitten with the devious miss granger has already invited her to visit him in bulgaria over the summer holidays and insists that he has never felt this way about any other girl 
 however it might not be miss doubtful natural charms that have captured these unfortunate boys interest 
 really ugly says pansy parkinson a pretty and vivacious student but be well up to making a love potion quite brainy i think how doing it 
 love potions are of course banned at hogwarts and no doubt albus dumbledore will want to investigate these claims in the meantime harry potters must hope that next time he bestows his heart on a worthier candidate 
 i told you ron hissed at hermione as she stared down at the article i told you not to annoy rita skeeter made you out to be some sort of of scarlet woman 
 
 hermione stopped looking astonished and snorted with laughter scarlet woman she repeated shaking with suppressed giggles as she looked around at ron 
 
 what my mum calls them ron muttered his ears going red 
 
 if the best rita can do losing her touch said hermione still giggling as she threw witch weekly onto the empty chair beside her what a pile of old rubbish 
 
 she looked over at the slytherins who were all watching her and harry closely across the room to see if they had been upset by the article hermione gave them a sarcastic smile and a wave and she harry and ron started unpacking the ingredients they would need for their potion 
 
 something funny though said hermione ten minutes later holding her pestle suspended over a bowl of scarab beetles how could rita skeeter have known 
 
 known what said ron quickly you been mixing up love potions have you 
 
 be stupid hermione snapped starting to pound up her beetles again no justhow did she know viktor asked me to visit him over the summer 
 
 hermione blushed scarlet as she said this and determinedly avoided eyes 
 
 what said ron dropping his pestle with a loud clunk 
 
 he asked me right after pulled me out of the lake 
 
 hermione muttered after got rid of his head madam pomfrey gave us both blankets and then he sort of pulled me away from the judges so they hear and he said if i doing anything over the summer would i like to 
 
 and what did you say said ron who had picked up his pestle and was grinding it on the desk a good six inches from his bowl because he was looking at hermione 
 
 and he did say never felt the same way about anyone else hermione went on going so red now that harry could almost feel the heat coming from her but how could rita skeeter have heard him she thereor was she maybe she has got an invisibility cloak maybe she sneaked onto the grounds to watch the second task 
 
 and what did you say ron repeated pounding his pestle down so hard that it dented the desk 
 
 well i was too busy seeing whether you and harry were okay to 
 
 fascinating though your social life undoubtedly is miss granger said an icy voice right behind them and all three of them jumped i must ask you not to discuss it in my class ten points from gryffindor 
 
 snape had glided over to their desk while they were talking the whole class was now looking around at them malfoy took the opportunity to flash potter stinks across the dungeon at harry 
 
 ahreading magazines under the table as well snape added snatching up the copy of witch weekly a further ten points from gryffindoroh but of course black eyes glittered as they fell on rita article potter has to keep up with his press cuttings 
 
 the dungeon rang with the slytherins laughter and an unpleasant smile curled thin mouth to fury he began to read the article aloud 
 
 harry secret heartachedear dear potter ailing you now a boy like no other perhaps 
 
 harry could feel his face burning snape was pausing at the end of every sentence to allow the slytherins a hearty laugh the article sounded ten times worse when read by snape even hermione was blushing scarlet now 
 
 harry must hope that next time he bestows his heart upon a worthier candidate how very touching sneered snape rolling up the magazine to continued gales of laughter from the slytherins well i think i had better separate the three of you so you can keep your minds on your potions rather than on your tangled love lives weasley you stay here miss granger over there beside miss parkinson potter that table in front of my desk move now 
 
 furious harry threw his ingredients and his bag into his cauldron and dragged it up to the front of the dungeon to the empty table snape followed sat down at his desk and watched harry unload his cauldron determined not to look at snape harry resumed the mashing of his scarab beetles imagining each one to have face 
 
 all this press attention seems to have inflated your already head potter said snape quietly once the rest of the class had settled down again 
 
 harry answer he knew snape was trying to provoke him he had done this before no doubt he was hoping for an excuse to take a round fifty points from gryffindor before the end of the class 
 
 you might be laboring under the delusion that the entire wizarding world is impressed with you snape went on so quietly that no one else could hear him harry continued to pound his scarab beetles even though he had already reduced them to a very fine powder but i care how many times your picture appears in the papers to me potter you are nothing but a nasty little boy who considers rules to be beneath him 
 
 harry tipped the powdered beetles into his cauldron and started cutting up his ginger roots his hands were shaking slightly out of anger but he kept his eyes down as though he hear what snape was saying to him 
 
 so i give you fair warning potter snape continued in a sorter and more dangerous voice celebrity or not if i catch you breaking into my office one more time 
 
 i been anywhere near your office said harry angrily forgetting his feigned deafness 
 
 lie to me snape hissed his fathomless black eyes boring into boomslang skin gillyweed both come from my private stores and i know who stole them 
 
 harry stared back at snape determined not to blink or to look guilty in truth he stolen either of these things from snape hermione had taken the boomslang skin back in their second year they had needed it for the polyjuice potion and while snape had suspected harry at the time he had never been able to prove it dobby of course had stolen the gillyweed 
 
 i know what talking about harry lied coldly 
 
 you were out of bed on the night my office was broken into snape hissed i know it potter now moody might have joined your fan club but i will not tolerate your behavior one more nighttime stroll into my office potter and you will pay 
 
 right said harry coolly turning back to his ginger roots bear that in mind if i ever get the urge to go in there 
 
 eyes flashed he plunged a hand into the inside of his black robes for one wild moment harry thought snape was about to pull out his wand and curse him then he saw that snape had drawn out a small crystal bottle of a completely clear potion harry stared at it 
 
 do you know what this is potter snape said his eyes glittering dangerously again 
 
 no said harry with complete honesty this time 
 
 it is veritaserum a truth potion so powerful that three drops would have you spilling your innermost secrets for this entire class to hear said snape viciously now the use of this potion is controlled by very strict ministry guidelines but unless you watch your step you might just find that my hand slips he shook the crystal bottle slightly right over your evening pumpkin juice and then potterthen find out whether been in my office or not 
 
 harry said nothing he turned back to his ginger roots once more picked up his knife and started slicing them again he like the sound of that truth potion at all nor would he put it past snape to slip him some he repressed a shudder at the thought of what might come spilling out of his mouth if snape did itquite apart from landing a whole lot of people in trouble hermione and dobby for a start there were all the other things he was concealinglike the fact that he was in contact with siriusand his insides squirmed at the thought how he felt about tipped his ginger roots into the cauldron too and wondered whether he ought to take a leaf out of book and start drinking only from a private hip flask 
 
 there was a knock on the dungeon door 
 
 enter said snape in his usual voice 
 
 the class looked around as the door opened professor karkaroff came in everyone watched him as he walked up toward desk he was twisting his finger around his goatee and looking agitated 
 
 we need to talk said karkaroff abruptly when he had reached snape he seemed so determined that nobody should hear what he was saying that he was barely opening his lips it was as though he were a rather poor ventriloquist harry kept his eyes on his ginger roots listening hard 
 
 talk to you after my lesson karkaroff snape muttered but karkaroff interrupted him 
 
 i want to talk now while you slip off severus been avoiding me 
 
 after the lesson snape snapped 
 
 under the pretext of holding up a measuring cup to see if poured out enough armadillo bile harry sneaked a sidelong glance at the pair of them karkaroff looked extremely worried and snape looked angry 
 
 karkaroff hovered behind desk for the rest of the double period he seemed intent on preventing snape from slipping away at the end of class keen to hear what karkaroff wanted to say harry deliberately knocked over his bottle of armadillo bile with two minutes to go to the bell which gave him an excuse to duck down behind his cauldron and mop up while the rest of the class moved noisily toward the door 
 
 so urgent he heard snape hiss at karkaroff 
 
 this said karkaroff and harry peering around the edge of his cauldron saw karkaroff pull up the sleeve of his robe and show snape something on his inner forearm 
 
 well said karkaroff still making every effort not to move his lips do you see never been this clear never since 
 
 put it away snarled snape his black eyes sweeping the classroom 
 
 but you must have noticed karkaroff began in an agitated voice 
 
 we can talk later karkaroff spat snape potter what are you doing 
 
 clearing up my armadillo bile professor said harry innocently straightening up and showing snape the sodden rag he was holding 
 
 karkaroff turned on his heel and strode out of the dungeon he looked both worried and angry not wanting to remain alone with an exceptionally angry snape harry threw his books and ingredients back into his bag and left at top speed to tell ron and hermione what he had just witnessed 
 
 
 
 they left the castle at noon the next day to find a weak silver sun shining down upon the grounds the weather was milder than it had been all year and by the time they arrived in hogsmeade all three of them had taken off their cloaks and thrown them over their shoulders the food sirius had told them to bring was in bag they had sneaked a dozen chicken legs a loaf of bread and a flask of pumpkin juice from the lunch table 
 
 they went into gladrags wizardwear to buy a present for dobby where they had fun selecting the most lurid socks they could find including a pair patterned with flashing gold and silver stars and another that screamed loudly when they became too smelly then at half past one they made their way up the high street past dervish and banges and out toward the edge of the village 
 
 harry had never been in this direction before the winding lane was leading them out into the wild countryside around hogsmeade the cottages were fewer here and their gardens larger they were walking toward the foot of the mountain in whose shadow hogsmeade lay then they turned a corner and saw a stile at the end of the lane waiting for them its front paws on the topmost bar was a very large shaggy black dog which was carrying some newspapers in its mouth and looking very familiar 
 
 hello sirius said harry when they had reached him 
 
 the black dog sniffed bag eagerly wagged its tail once then turned and began to trot away from them across the scrubby patch of ground that rose to meet the rocky foot of the mountain harry ron and hermione climbed over the stile and followed 
 
 sirius led them to the very foot of the mountain where the ground was covered with boulders and rocks it was easy for him with his four paws but harry ron and hermione were soon out of breath they followed sirius higher up onto the mountain itself for nearly half an hour they climbed a steep winding and stony path following wagging tail sweating in the sun the shoulder straps of bag cutting into his shoulders 
 
 then at last sirius slipped out of sight and when they reached the place where he had vanished they saw a narrow fissure in the rock they squeezed into it and found themselves in a cool dimly lit cave tethered at the end of it one end of his rope around a large rock was buckbeak the hippogriff half gray horse half giant eagle fierce orange eye flashed at the sight of them all three of them bowed low to him and after regarding them imperiously for a moment buckbeak bent his scaly front knees and allowed hermione to rush forward and stroke his feathery neck harry however was looking at the black dog which had just turned into his godfather 
 
 sirius was wearing ragged gray robes the same ones he had been wearing when he had left azkaban his black hair was longer than it had been when he had appeared in the fire and it was untidy and matted once more he looked very thin 
 
 chicken he said hoarsely after removing the old daily prophets from his mouth and throwing them down onto the cave floor 
 
 harry pulled open his bag and handed over the bundle of chicken legs and bread 
 
 thanks said sirius opening it grabbing a drumstick sitting down on the cave floor and tearing off a large chunk with his teeth been living off rats mostly steal too much food from hogsmeade draw attention to myself 
 
 he grinned up at harry but harry returned the grin only reluctantly 
 
 you doing here sirius he said 
 
 fulfilling my duty as godfather said sirius gnawing on the chicken bone in a very doglike way worry about it pretending to be a lovable stray 
 
 he was still grinning but seeing the anxiety in face said more seriously i want to be on the spot your last letterwell just say things are getting fishier been stealing the paper every time someone throws one out and by the looks of things not the only one getting worried 
 
 he nodded at the yellowing daily prophets on the cave floor and ron picked them up and unfolded them harry however continued to stare at sirius 
 
 what if they catch you what if seen 
 
 you three and dumbledore are the only ones around here who know an animagus said sirius shrugging and continuing to devour the chicken leg 
 
 ron nudged harry and passed him the daily prophets there were two the first bore the headline mystery illness of bartemius crouch the second ministry witch still missing minister of magic now personally involved 
 
 harry scanned the story about crouch phrases jumped out at him been seen in public since novemberhouse appears desertedst hospital for magical maladies and injuries decline commentministry refuses to confirm rumors of critical illness 
 
 making it sound like dying said harry slowly but he be that ill if he managed to get up here 
 
 my brothers personal assistant ron informed sirius he says crouch is suffering from overwork 
 
 mind you he did look ill last time i saw him up close said harry slowly still reading the story the night my name came out of the goblet 
 
 getting his comeuppance for sacking winky he said hermione an edge to her voice she was stroking buckbeak who was crunching up chicken bones i bet he wishes he done it now bet he feels the difference now not there to look after him 
 
 obsessed with ron muttered to sirius casting hermione a dark look sirius however looked interested 
 
 crouch sacked his 
 
 yeah at the quidditch world cup said harry and he launched into the story of the dark appearance and winky being found with wand clutched in her hand and mr fury when harry had finished sirius was on his feet again and had started pacing up and down the cave 
 
 let me get this straight he said after a while brandishing a fresh chicken leg you first saw the elfin the top box she was saving crouch a seat right 
 
 right said harry ron and hermione together 
 
 but crouch turn up for the match 
 
 no said harry i think he said been too busy 
 
 sirius paced all around the cave in silence then he said harry did you check your pockets for your wand after left the top box 
 
 erm harry thought hard no he said finally i need to use it before we got in the forest and then i put my hand in my pocket and all that was in there were my omnioculars he stared at sirius are you saying whoever conjured the mark stole my wand in the top box 
 
 possible said sirius 
 
 winky steal that wand hermione insisted 
 
 the elf the only one in that box said sirius his brow furrowed as he continued to pace who else was sitting behind you 
 
 loads of people said harry some bulgarian ministerscornelius fudgethe malfoys 
 
 the malfoys said ron suddenly so loudly that his voice echoed all around the cave and buckbeak tossed his head nervously i bet it was lucius malfoy 
 
 anyone else said sirius 
 
 no one said harry 
 
 yes there was there was ludo bagman hermione reminded him 
 
 oh yeah 
 
 i know anything about bagman except that he used to be beater for the wimbourne wasps said sirius still pacing he like 
 
 okay said harry he keeps offering to help me with the triwizard tournament 
 
 does he now said sirius frowning more deeply i wonder why do that 
 
 says taken a liking to me said harry 
 
 hmm said sirius looking thoughtful 
 
 we saw him in the forest just before the dark mark appeared hermione told sirius remember she said to harry and ron 
 
 yeah but he stay in the forest did he said ron the moment we told him about the riot he went off to the campsite 
 
 how know hermione shot back how know where he disapparated to 
 
 come off it said ron incredulously are you saying you reckon ludo bagman conjured the dark mark 
 
 more likely he did it than winky said hermione stubbornly 
 
 told you said ron looking meaningfully at sirius told you obsessed with house 
 
 but sirius held up a hand to silence ron 
 
 when the dark mark had been conjured and the elf had been discovered holding wand what did crouch do 
 
 went to look in the bushes said harry but there anyone else there 
 
 of course sirius muttered pacing up and down of course want to pin it on anyone but his own elfand then he sacked her 
 
 yes said hermione in a heated voice he sacked her just because she stayed in her tent and let herself get trampled 
 
 hermione will you give it a rest with the elf said ron 
 
 sirius shook his head and said got the measure of crouch better than you have ron if you want to know what a mans like take a good look at how he treats his inferiors not his equals 
 
 he ran a hand over his unshaven face evidently thinking hard 
 
 all these absences of barty goes to the trouble of making sure his saves him a seat at the quidditch world cup but bother to turn up and watch he works very hard to reinstate the triwizard tournament and then stops coming to that not like crouch if ever taken a day off work because of illness before this eat buckbeak 
 
 know crouch then said harry 
 
 face darkened he suddenly looked as menacing as he had the night when harry first met him the night when harry still believed sirius to be a murderer 
 
 oh i know crouch all right he said quietly he was the one who gave the order for me to be sent to azkaban without a trial 
 
 what said ron and hermione together 
 
 kidding said harry 
 
 no not said sirius taking another great bite of chicken crouch used to be head of the department of magical law enforcement you know 
 
 harry ron and hermione shook their heads 
 
 he was tipped for the next minister of magic said sirius a great wizard barty crouch powerfully magical and oh never a voldemort supporter he said reading the look on face no barty crouch was always very outspoken against the dark side but then a lot of people who were against the dark sidewell you too young 
 
 what my dad said at the world cup said ron with a trace of irritation in his voice try us why you 
 
 a grin flashed across thin face 
 
 all right try you he walked once up the cave back again and then said imagine that powerful now you know who his supporters are you know working for him and who you know he can control people so that they do terrible things without being able to stop themselves scared for yourself and your family and your friends every week news comes of more deaths more disappearances more torturingthe ministry of in disarray they know what to do trying to keep everything hidden from the muggles but meanwhile muggles are dying too terror how it used to be 
 
 well times like that bring out the best in some people and the worst in others principles been good in the beginning i know he rose quickly through the ministry and he started ordering very harsh measures against supporters the aurors were given new powers powers to kill rather than capture for instance and i the only one who was handed straight to the dementors without trial crouch fought violence with violence and authorized the use of the unforgivable curses against suspects i would say he became as ruthless and cruel as many on the dark side he had his supporters mind you plenty of people thought he was going about things the right way and there were a lot of witches and wizards clamoring for him to take over as minister of magic when voldemort disappeared it looked like only a matter of time until crouch got the top job but then something rather unfortunate happened sirius smiled grimly own son was caught with a group of death eaters managed to talk their way out of azkaban apparently they were trying to find voldemort and return him to power 
 
 son was caught gasped hermione 
 
 yep said sirius throwing his chicken bone to buckbeak flinging himself back down on the ground beside the loaf of bread and tearing it in half nasty little shock for old barty i magine should have spent a bit more time at home with his family he ought to have left the office early once in a whilegotten to know his own son 
 
 he began to wolf down large pieces of bread 
 
 was his son a death eater said harry 
 
 no idea said sirius still stuffing down bread i was in azkaban myself when he was brought in this is mostly stuff found out since i got out the boy was definitely caught in the company of people bet my life were death eaters but he might have been in the wrong place at the wrong time just like the 
 
 did crouch try and get his son off hermione whispered 
 
 sirius let out a laugh that was much more like a bark 
 
 crouch let his son off i thought you had the measure of him hermione anything that threatened to tarnish his reputation had to go he had dedicated his whole life to becoming minister of magic you saw him dismiss a devoted because she associated him with the dark mark again that tell you what like fatherly affection stretched just far enough to give his son a trial and by all accounts it much more than an excuse for crouch to show how much he hated the boythen he sent him straight to azkaban 
 
 he gave his own son to the dementors asked harry quietly 
 
 right said sirius and he look remotely amused now i saw the dementors bringing him in watched them through the bars in my cell door he have been more than nineteen they took him into a cell near mine he was screaming for his mother by nightfall he went quiet after a few days thoughthey all went quiet in the endexcept when they shrieked in their sleep 
 
 for a moment the deadened look in eyes became more pronounced than ever as though shutters had closed behind them 
 
 so still in azkaban harry said 
 
 no said sirius dully no not in there anymore he died about a year after they brought him in 
 
 he died 
 
 he the only one said sirius bitterly most go mad in there and plenty stop eating in the end they lose the will to live you could always tell when a death was coming because the dementors could sense it they got excited that boy looked pretty sickly when he arrived crouch being an important ministry member he and his wife were allowed a deathbed visit that was the last time i saw barty crouch half carrying his wife past my cell she died herself apparently shortly afterward grief wasted away just like the boy crouch never came for his body the dementors buried him outside the fortress i watched them do it 
 
 sirius threw aside the bread he had just lifted to his mouth and instead picked up the flask of pumpkin juice and drained it 
 
 so old crouch lost it all just when he thought he had it made he continued wiping his mouth with the back of his hand one moment a hero poised to become minister of magicnext his son dead his wife dead the family name dishonored and so heard since i escaped a big drop in popularity once the boy had died people started feeling a bit more sympathetic toward the son and started asking how a nice young lad from a good family had gone so badly astray the conclusion was that his father never cared much for him so cornelius fudge got the top job and crouch was shunted sideways into the department of international magical cooperation 
 
 there was a long silence harry was thinking of the way eyes had bulged as looked down at his disobedient back in the wood at the quidditch world cup this then must have been why crouch had overreacted to winky being found beneath the dark mark it had brought back memories of his son and the old scandal and his fall from grace at the ministry 
 
 moody says crouch is obsessed with catching dark wizards harry told sirius 
 
 yeah heard become a bit of a mania with him said sirius nodding if you ask me he still thinks he can bring back the old popularity by catching one more death eater 
 
 and he sneaked up here to search office said ron triumphantly looking at hermione 
 
 yes and that make sense at all said sirius 
 
 yeah it does said ron excitedly but sirius shook his head 
 
 listen if crouch wants to investigate snape why he been coming to judge the tournament it would be an ideal excuse to make regular visits to hogwarts and keep an eye on him 
 
 so you think snape could be up to something then asked harry but hermione broke in 
 
 look i care what you say dumbledore trusts snape 
 
 oh give it a rest hermione said ron impatiently i know dumbledores brilliant and everything but that mean a really clever dark wizard fool him 
 
 why did snape save life in the first year then why he just let him die 
 
 i dunno maybe he thought dumbledore would kick him out 
 
 what think sirius harry said loudly and ron and hermione stopped bickering to listen 
 
 i think both got a point said sirius looking thoughtfully at ron and hermione ever since i found out snape was teaching here wondered why dumbledore hired him always been fascinated by the dark arts he was famous for it at school slimy oily kid he was sirius added and harry and ron grinned at each other snape knew more curses when he arrived at school than half the kids in seventh year and he was part of a gang of slytherins who nearly all turned out to be death eaters 
 
 sirius held up his fingers and began ticking off names 
 
 rosier and wilkes they were both killed by aurors the year before voldemort fell the lestranges a married couple in azkaban avery from what heard he wormed his way out of trouble by saying been acting under the imperius curse still at large but as far as i know snape was never even accused of being a death eater not that that means much plenty of them were never caught and certainly clever and cunning enough to keep himself out of trouble 
 
 snape knows karkaroff pretty well but he wants to keep that quiet said ron 
 
 yeah you seen face when karkaroff turned up in potions yesterday said harry quickly karkaroff wanted to talk to snape he says been avoiding him karkaroff looked really worried he showed snape something on his arm but i see what it was 
 
 he showed snape something on his arm said sirius looking frankly bewildered he ran his fingers distractedly through his filthy hair then shrugged again well no idea what aboutbut if genuinely worried and going to snape for answers 
 
 sirius stared at the cave wall then made a grimace of frustration 
 
 still the fact that dumbledore trusts snape and i know dumbledore trusts where a lot of other people but i just see him letting snape teach at hogwarts if ever worked for voldemort 
 
 why are moody and crouch so keen to get into office then said ron stubbornly 
 
 well said sirius slowly i put it past to have searched every single office when he got to hogwarts he takes his defense against the dark arts seriously moody not sure he trusts anyone at all and after the things seen not surprising say this for moody though he never killed if he could help it always brought people in alive where possible he was tough but he never descended to the level of the death eaters crouch a different matteris he really ill if he is why did he make the effort to drag himself up to office and if he up to what was he doing at the world cup that was so important he turn up in the top box he been doing while he should have been judging the tournament 
 
 sirius lapsed into silence still staring at the cave wall buckbeak was ferreting around on the rocky floor looking for bones he might have overlooked finally sirius looked up at ron 
 
 you say your personal assistant any chance you could ask him if seen crouch lately 
 
 i can try said ron doubtfully better not make it sound like i reckon crouch is up to anything dodgy though percy loves crouch 
 
 and you might try and find out whether got any leads on bertha jorkins while at it said sirius gesturing to the second copy of the daily prophet 
 
 bagman told me they said harry 
 
 yes quoted in the article in there said sirius nodding at the paper blustering on about how bad memory is well maybe changed since i knew her but the bertha i knew forgetful at all quite the reverse she was a bit dim but she had an excellent memory for gossip it used to get her into a lot of trouble she never knew when to keep her mouth shut i can see her being a bit of a liability at the ministry of magicmaybe why bagman bother to look for her for so long 
 
 sirius heaved an enormous sigh and rubbed his shadowed eyes 
 
 the time 
 
 harry checked his watch then remembered it been working since it had spent over an hour in the lake 
 
 half past three said hermione 
 
 better get back to school sirius said getting to his feet now listen he looked particularly hard at harry i want you lot sneaking out of school to see me all right just send notes to me here i still want to hear about anything odd but not to go leaving hogwarts without permission it would be an ideal opportunity for someone to attack you 
 
 no tried to attack me so far except a dragon and a couple of grindylows harry said but sirius scowled at him 
 
 i breathe freely again when this over and not until june and forget if talking about me among yourselves call me snuffles okay 
 
 he handed harry the empty napkin and flask and went to pat buckbeak walk to the edge of the village with you said sirius see if i can scrounge another paper 
 
 he transformed into the great black dog before they left the cave and they walked back down the mountainside with him across the ground and back to the stile here he allowed each of them to pat him on the head before turning and setting off at a run around the outskirts of the village harry ron and hermione made their way back into hogsmeade and up toward hogwarts 
 
 wonder if percy knows all that stuff about crouch ron said as they walked up the drive to the castle but maybe he probably just make him admire crouch even more yeah percy loves rules just say crouch was refusing to break them for his own son 
 
 percy would never throw any of his family to the dementors said hermione severely 
 
 i know said ron if he thought we were standing in the way of his really ambitious you know 
 
 they walked up the stone steps into the entrance hall where the delicious smells of dinner wafted toward them from the great hall 
 
 poor old snuffles said ron breathing deeply he must really like you having to live off rats 
 
 rowling

lionfish nov chapter the centaur and the sneakcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 bet you wish you given up divination now you hermione asked parvati smirking 
 
 it was breakfast time two days after the sacking of professor trelawney and parvati was curling her eyelashes around her wand and examining the effect in the back of her spoon they were to have their first lesson with firenze that morning 
 
 not really said hermione indifferently who was reading the daily never really liked horses 
 
 she turned a page of the newspaper and scanned its columns 
 
 not a horse a centaur said lavender sounding shocked 
 
 a gorgeous centaur sighed parvati 
 
 either way still got four legs said hermione coolly anyway i thought you two were all upset that trelawney had gone 
 
 we are lavender assured her we went up to her office to see her we took her some daffodils not the honking ones that got nice ones 
 
 how is she asked harry 
 
 not very good poor thing said lavender sympathetically she was crying and saying rather leave the castle for ever than stay here where umbridge is and i blame her umbridge was horrible to her she 
 
 got a feeling umbridge has only just started being horrible said hermione darkly 
 
 impossible said ron who was tucking into a large plate of eggs and bacon she get any worse than been already 
 
 you mark my words going to want revenge on dumbledore for appointing a new teacher without consulting her said hermione closing the newspaper especially another you saw the look on her face when she saw firenze 
 
 after breakfast hermione departed for her arithmancy class as harry and ron followed parvati and lavender into the entrance hall heading for divination 
 
 we going up to north tower asked ron looking puzzled as parvati bypassed the marble staircase 
 
 parvati looked at him scornfully over her shoulder 
 
 how expect firenze to climb that ladder in classroom eleven now it was on the noticeboard yesterday 
 
 classroom eleven was on the ground floor along the corridor leading off the entrance hall from the opposite side to the great hall harry knew it was one of those classrooms that were never used regularly and therefore had the slightly neglected feeling of a cupboard or storeroom when he entered it right behind ron and found himself in the middle of a forest clearing he was therefore momentarily stunned 
 
 what the 
 
 the classroom floor had become springily mossy and trees were growing out of it their leafy branches fanned across the ceiling and windows so that the room was full of slanting shafts of soft dappled green light the students who had already arrived were sitting on the earthy floor with their backs resting against tree trunks or boulders arms wrapped around their knees or folded tightly across their chests and all looking rather nervous in the middle of the clearing where there were no trees stood firenze 
 
 harry potter he said holding out a hand when harry entered 
 
 erhi said harry shaking hands with the centaur who surveyed him unblinkingly through those astonishingly blue eyes but did not smile ergood to see you 
 
 and you said the centaur inclining his head it was foretold that we would meet again 
 
 harry noticed there was the shadow of a bruise on chest as he turned to join the rest of the class on the ground he saw they were all looking at him in awe apparently deeply impressed that he was on speaking terms with firenze whom they seemed to find intimidating 
 
 when the door was closed and the last student had sat down on a tree stump beside the wastepaper basket firenze gestured around the room 
 
 professor dumbledore has kindly arranged this classroom for us said firenze when everyone had settled down in imitation of my natural habitat i would have preferred to teach you in the forbidden forest which wasuntil mondaymy home but that is no longer possible 
 
 pleaseer sir said parvati breathlessly raising her not been in there with hagrid not frightened 
 
 it is not a question of your bravery said firenze but of my position i cannot return to the forest my herd has banished me 
 
 herd said lavender in a confused voice and harry knew she was thinking of cows what oh 
 
 comprehension dawned on her face there are more of you she said stunned 
 
 did hagrid breed you like the thestrals asked dean eagerly 
 
 firenze turned his head very slowly to face dean who seemed to realise at once that he had said something very offensive 
 
 i meantsorry he finished in a hushed voice 
 
 centaurs are not the servants or playthings of humans said firenze quietly there was a pause then parvati raised her hand again 
 
 please sir why have the other centaurs banished you 
 
 because i have agreed to work for professor dumbledore said firenze they see this as a betrayal of our kind 
 
 harry remembered how nearly four years ago the centaur bane had shouted at firenze for allowing harry to ride to safety on his back he had called him a common mule he wondered whether it had been bane who had kicked firenze in the chest 
 
 let us begin said firenze he swished his long palomino tail raised his hand towards the leafy canopy overhead then lowered it slowly and as he did so the light in the room dimmed so that they now seemed to be sitting in a forest clearing by twilight and stars appeared on the ceiling there were oohs and gasps and ron said audibly blimey 
 
 lie back on the floor said firenze in his calm voice and observe the heavens here is written for those who can see the fortune of our races 
 
 harry stretched out on his back and gazed upwards at the ceiling a twinkling red star winked at him from overhead 
 
 i know that you have learned the names of the planets and their moons in astronomy said calm voice and that you have mapped the stars progress through the heavens centaurs have unravelled the mysteries of these movements over centuries our findings teach us that the future may be glimpsed in the sky above us 
 
 professor trelawney did astrology with us said parvati excitedly raising her hand in front of her so that it stuck up in the air as she lay on her back mars causes accidents and burns and things like that and when it makes an angle to saturn like now she drew a in the air above her that means people need to be extra careful when handling hot things 
 
 that said firenze calmly is human nonsense 
 
 hand fell limply to her side 
 
 trivial hurts tiny human accidents said firenze as his hooves thudded over the mossy floor these are of no more significance than the scurryings of ants to the wide universe and are unaffected by planetary movements 
 
 professor trelawney began parvati in a hurt and indignant voice 
 
 is a human said firenze simply and is therefore blinkered and fettered by the limitations of your kind 
 
 harry turned his head very slightly to look at parvati she looked very offended as did several of the people surrounding her 
 
 sybill trelawney may have seen i do not know continued firenze and harry heard the swishing of his tail again as he walked up and down before them but she wastes her time in the main on the nonsense humans call i however am here to explain the wisdom of centaurs which is impersonal and impartial we watch the skies for the great tides of evil or change that are sometimes marked there it may take ten years to be sure of what we are seeing 
 
 firenze pointed to the red star directly above harry 
 
 in the past decade the indications have been that wizardkind is living through nothing more than a brief calm between two wars mars bringer of battle shines brightly above us suggesting that the fight must soon break out again how soon centaurs may attempt to divine by the burning of certain herbs and leaves by the observation of fume and flame 
 
 it was the most unusual lesson harry had ever attended they did indeed burn sage and mallowsweet there on the classroom floor and firenze told them to look for certain shapes and symbols in the pungent fumes but he seemed perfectly unconcerned that not one of them could see any of the signs he described telling them that humans were hardly ever good at this that it took centaurs years and years to become competent and finished by telling them that it was foolish to put too much faith in such things anyway because even centaurs sometimes read them wrongly he was nothing like any human teacher harry had ever had his priority did not seem to be to teach them what he knew but rather to impress upon them that nothing not even centaurs knowledge was foolproof 
 
 not very definite on anything is he said ron in a low voice as they put out their mallowsweet fire i mean i could do with a few more details about this war about to have you 
 
 the bell rang right outside the classroom door and everyone jumped harry had completely forgotten they were still inside the castle and quite convinced that he was really in the forest the class filed out looking slightly perplexed 
 
 harry and ron were on the point of following them when firenze called harry potter a word please 
 
 harry turned the centaur advanced a little towards him ron hesitated 
 
 you may stay firenze told him but close the door please 
 
 ron hastened to obey 
 
 harry potter you are a friend of are you not said the centaur 
 
 yes said harry 
 
 then give him a warning from me his attempt is not working he would do better to abandon it 
 
 his attempt is not working harry repeated blankly 
 
 and he would do better to abandon it said firenze nodding i would warn hagrid myself but i am banishedit would be unwise for me to go too near the forest now hagrid has troubles enough without a centaurs battle 
 
 hagrid attempting to do said harry nervously 
 
 firenze surveyed harry impassively 
 
 hagrid has recently rendered me a great service said firenze and he has long since earned my respect for the care he shows all living creatures i shall not betray his secret but he must be brought to his senses the attempt is not working tell him harry potter to you 
 
 the happiness harry had felt in the aftermath of the quibbler interview had long since evaporated as a dull march blurred into a squally april his life seemed to have become one long series of worries and problems again 
 
 umbridge had continued attending all care of magical creatures lessons so it had been very difficult to deliver warning to hagrid at last harry had managed it by pretending lost his copy of fantastic beasts and where to find them and doubling back after class one day when repeated words hagrid gazed at him for a moment through his puffy blackened eyes apparently taken aback then he seemed to pull himself together 
 
 nice bloke firenze he said gruffly but he don know what talkin abou on this the comin on fine 
 
 hagrid you up to asked harry seriously because got to be careful umbridge has already sacked trelawney and if you ask me on a roll if doing anything you be be 
 
 things more importan than keepin a job said hagrid though his hands shook slightly as he said this and a basin full of knarl droppings crashed to the floor don worry abou me harry jus get along now a good lad 
 
 harry had no choice but to leave hagrid mopping up the dung all over his floor but he felt thoroughly dispirited as he trudged back up to the castle 
 
 meanwhile as the teachers and hermione persisted in reminding them the owls were drawing ever nearer all the were suffering from stress to some degree but hannah abbott became the first to receive a calming draught from madam pomfrey after she burst into tears during herbology and sobbed that she was too stupid to take exams and wanted to leave school now 
 
 if it had not been for the da lessons harry thought he would have been extremely unhappy he sometimes felt he was living for the hours he spent in the room of requirement working hard but thoroughly enjoying himself at the same time swelling with pride as he looked around at his fellow da members and saw how far they had come indeed harry sometimes wondered how umbridge was going to react when all the members of the da received outstanding in their defence against the dark arts owls 
 
 they had finally started work on patronuses which everybody had been very keen to practise though as harry kept reminding them producing a patronus in the middle of a brightly lit classroom when they were not under threat was very different from producing it when confronted by something like a dementor 
 
 oh be such a killjoy said cho brightly watching her silvery patronus soar around the room of requirement during their last lesson before easter so pretty 
 
 not supposed to be pretty supposed to protect you said harry patiently what we really need is a boggart or something how i learned i had to conjure a patronus while the boggart was pretending to be a dementor 
 
 but that would be really scary said lavender who was shooting puffs of silver vapour out of the end of her wand and i it she added angrily 
 
 neville was having trouble too his face was screwed up in concentration but only feeble wisps of silver smoke issued from his wand tip 
 
 got to think of something happy harry reminded him 
 
 trying said neville miserably who was trying so hard his round face was actually shining with sweat 
 
 harry i think doing it yelled seamus who had been brought along to his first ever da meeting by dean gone but it was definitely something hairy harry 
 
 patronus a shining silver otter was gambolling around her 
 
 they are sort of nice they she said looking at it fondly 
 
 the door of the room of requirement opened and closed harry looked round to see who had entered but there did not seem to be anybody there it was a few moments before he realised that the people close to the door had fallen silent next thing he knew something was tugging at his robes somewhere near the knee he looked down and saw to his very great astonishment dobby the peering up at him from beneath his usual eight woolly hats 
 
 hi dobby he said what are wrong 
 
 the eyes were wide with terror and he was shaking the members of the da closest to harry had fallen silent everybody in the room was watching dobby the few patronuses people had managed to conjure faded away into silver mist leaving the room looking much darker than before 
 
 harry potter sir squeaked the elf trembling from head to foot harry potter sir dobby has come to warn you but the have been warned not to tell 
 
 he ran at the wall harry who had some experience of dobby s habits of made to seize him but dobby merely bounced off the stone cushioned by his eight hats hermione and a few of the other girls let out squeaks of fear and sympathy 
 
 happened dobby harry asked grabbing the tiny arm and holding him away from anything with which he might seek to hurt himself 
 
 harry potter she she 
 
 dobby hit himself hard on the nose with his free fist harry seized that too 
 
 she dobby 
 
 but he thought he knew surely only one she could induce such fear in dobby the elf looked up at him slightly and mouthed wordlessly 
 
 umbridge asked harry horrified 
 
 dobby nodded then tried to bang his head on knees harry held him at length 
 
 what about her dobbyshe found out about thisabout usabout the da 
 
 he read the answer in the stricken face his hands held fast by harry the elf tried to kick himself and fell to the floor 
 
 is she coming harry asked quietly 
 
 dobby let out a howl and began beating his bare feet hard on the floor 
 
 yes harry potter yes 
 
 harry straightened up and looked around at the motionless terrified people gazing at the thrashing elf 
 
 what are you waiting for harry bellowed run 
 
 they all pelted towards the exit at once forming a scrum at the door then people burst through harry could hear them sprinting along the corridors and hoped they had the sense not to try and make it all the way to their dormitories it was only ten to nine if they just took refuge in the library or the owlery which were both nearer 
 
 harry come on shrieked hermione from the centre of the knot of people now fighting to get out 
 
 he scooped up dobby who was still attempting to do himself serious injury and ran with the elf in his arms to join the back of the queue 
 
 dobbythis is an orderget back down to the kitchen with the other elves and if she asks you whether you warned me lie and say no said harry and i forbid you to hurt yourself he added dropping the elf as he made it over the threshold at last and slammed the door behind him 
 
 thank you harry potter squeaked dobby and he streaked off harry glanced left and right the others were all moving so fast he caught only glimpses of flying heels at either end of the corridor before they vanished he started to run right there was a boys bathroom up ahead he could pretend been in there all the time if he could just reach it 
 
 aaargh 
 
 something caught him around the ankles and he fell spectacularly skidding along on his front for six feet before coming to a halt someone behind him was laughing he rolled over on to his back and saw malfoy concealed in a niche beneath an ugly vase 
 
 trip jinx potter he said hey professorprofessor got one 
 
 umbridge came bustling round the far corner breathless but wearing a delighted smile 
 
 him she said jubilantly at the sight of harry on the floor excellent draco excellent oh very goodfifty points to slytherin take him from here stand up potter 
 
 harry got to his feet glaring at the pair of them he had never seen umbridge looking so happy she seized his arm in a grip and turned beaming broadly to malfoy 
 
 you hop along and see if you can round up any more of them draco she said tell the others to look in the libraryanybody out of breathcheck the bathrooms miss parkinson can do the girls onesoff you goand you she added in her softest most dangerous voice as malfoy walked away you can come with me to the office potter 
 
 they were at the stone gargoyle within minutes harry wondered how many of the others had been caught he thought of ronmrs weasley would kill himand of how hermione would feel if she was expelled before she could take her owls and it had been very first meeting and neville had been getting so good 
 
 fizzing whizzbee sang umbridge the stone gargoyle jumped aside the wall behind split open and they ascended the moving stone staircase they reached the polished door with the griffin knocker but umbridge did not bother to knock she strode straight inside still holding tight to harry 
 
 the office was full of people dumbledore was sitting behind his desk his expression serene the tips of his long fingers together professor mcgonagall stood rigidly beside him her face extremely tense cornelius fudge minister for magic was rocking backwards and forwards on his toes beside the fire apparently immensely pleased with the situation kingsley shacklebolt and a wizard with very short wiry hair whom harry did not recognise were positioned either side of the door like guards and the freckled bespectacled form of percy weasley hovered excitedly beside the wall a quill and a heavy scroll of parchment in his hands apparently poised to take notes 
 
 the portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses were not shamming sleep tonight all of them were alert and serious watching what was happening below them as harry entered a few flitted into neighbouring frames and whispered urgently into their ear 
 
 harry pulled himself free of grasp as the door swung shut behind them cornelius fudge was glaring at him with a kind of vicious satisfaction on his face 
 
 well he said well well well 
 
 harry replied with the dirtiest look he could muster his heart drummed madly inside him but his brain was oddly cool and clear 
 
 he was heading back to gryffindor tower said umbridge there was an indecent excitement in her voice the same callous pleasure harry had heard as she watched professor trelawney dissolving with misery in the entrance hall the malfoy boy cornered him 
 
 did he did he said fudge appreciatively i must remember to tell lucius well potter i expect you know why you are here 
 
 harry fully intended to respond with a defiant yes his mouth had opened and the word was when he caught sight of face dumbledore was not looking directly at harryhis eyes were fixed on a point just over his shoulderbut as harry stared at him he shook his head a fraction of an inch to each side 
 
 harry changed direction 
 
 yeno 
 
 i beg your pardon said fudge 
 
 no said harry firmly 
 
 you know why you are here 
 
 no i said harry 
 
 fudge looked incredulously from harry to professor umbridge harry took advantage of his momentary inattention to steal another quick look at dumbledore who gave the carpet the tiniest of nods and the shadow of a wink 
 
 so you have no idea said fudge in a voice positively sagging with sarcasm why professor umbridge has brought you to this office you are not aware that you have broken any school rules 
 
 school rules said harry no 
 
 or ministry decrees amended fudge angrily 
 
 not that aware of said harry blandly 
 
 his heart was still hammering very fast it was almost worth telling these lies to watch fudges blood pressure rising but he could not see how on earth he would get away with them if somebody had tipped off umbridge about the da then he the leader might as well be packing his trunk right now 
 
 so news to you is it said fudge his voice now thick with anger that an illegal student organisation has been discovered within this school 
 
 yes it is said harry hoisting an unconvincing look of innocent surprise on to his face 
 
 i think minister said umbridge silkily from beside him we might make better progress if i fetch our informant 
 
 yes yes do said fudge nodding and he glanced maliciously at dumbledore as umbridge left the room nothing like a good witness is there dumbledore 
 
 nothing at all cornelius said dumbledore gravely inclining his head 
 
 there was a wait of several minutes in which nobody looked at each other then harry heard the door open behind him umbridge moved past him into the room gripping by the shoulder friend marietta who was hiding her face in her hands 
 
 be scared dear be frightened said professor umbridge softly patting her on the back quite all right now you have done the right thing the minister is very pleased with you be telling your mother what a good girl been mother minister she added looking up at fudge is madam edgecombe from the department of magical transportation floo network office been helping us police the fires you know 
 
 jolly good jolly good said fudge heartily like mother like daughter eh well come on now dear look up be shy hear what got togalloping gargoyles 
 
 as marietta raised her head fudge leapt backwards in shock nearly landing himself in the fire he cursed and stamped on the hem of his cloak which had started to smoke marietta gave a wail and pulled the neck of her robes right up to her eyes but not before everyone had seen that her face was horribly disfigured by a series of purple pustules that had spread across her nose and cheeks to form the word sneak 
 
 never mind the spots now dear said umbridge impatiently just take your robes away from your mouth and tell the minister 
 
 but marietta gave another muffled wail and shook her head frantically 
 
 oh very well you silly girl tell him snapped umbridge she hitched her sickly smile back on to her face and said well minister miss edgecombe here came to my office shortly after dinner this evening and told me she had something she wanted to tell me she said that if i proceeded to a secret room on the seventh floor sometimes known as the room of requirement i would find out something to my advantage i questioned her a little further and she admitted that there was to be some kind of meeting there unfortunately at that point this hex she waved impatiently at concealed face came into operation and upon catching sight of her face in my mirror the girl became too distressed to tell me any more 
 
 well now said fudge fixing marietta with what he evidently imagined was a kind and fatherly look it is very brave of you my dear coming to tell professor umbridge you did exactly the right thing now will you tell me what happened at this meeting what was its purpose who was there 
 
 but marietta would not speak she merely shook her head again her eyes wide and fearful 
 
 we got a for this fudge asked umbridge impatiently gesturing at face so she can speak freely 
 
 i have not yet managed to find one umbridge admitted grudgingly and harry felt a surge of pride in jinxing ability but it matter if she speak i can take up the story from here 
 
 you will remember minister that i sent you a report back in october that potter had met a number of fellow students in the head in hogsmeade 
 
 and what is your evidence for that cut in professor mcgonagall 
 
 i have testimony from willy widdershins minerva who happened to be in the bar at the time he was heavily bandaged it is true but his hearing was quite unimpaired said umbridge smugly he heard every word potter said and hastened straight to the school to report to me 
 
 oh so why he prosecuted for setting up all those regurgitating toilets said professor mcgonagall raising her eyebrows what an interesting insight into our justice system 
 
 blatant corruption roared the portrait of the corpulent wizard on the wall behind desk the ministry did not cut deals with petty criminals in my day no sir they did not 
 
 thank you fortescue that will do said dumbledore softly 
 
 the purpose of meeting with these students continued professor umbridge was to persuade them to join an illegal society whose aim was to learn spells and curses the ministry has decided are inappropriate for 
 
 i think find wrong there dolores said dumbledore quietly peering at her over the spectacles perched halfway down his crooked nose 
 
 harry stared at him he could not see how dumbledore was going to talk him out of this one if willy widdershins had indeed heard every word he had said in the head there was simply no escaping it 
 
 oho said fudge bouncing up and down on the balls of his feet again yes do hear the latest story designed to pull potter out of trouble go on then dumbledore go on 
 
 willy widdershins was lying was he or was it identical twin in the head that day or is there the usual simple explanation involving a reversal of time a dead man coming back to life and a couple of invisible dementors 
 
 percy weasley let out a hearty laugh 
 
 oh very good minister very good 
 
 harry could have kicked him then he saw to his astonishment that dumbledore was smiling gently too 
 
 cornelius i do not denyand nor i am sure does harrythat he was in the head that day nor that he was trying to recruit students to a defence against the dark arts group i am merely pointing out that dolores is quite wrong to suggest that such a group was at that time illegal if you remember the ministry decree banning all student societies was not put into effect until two days after hogsmeade meeting so he was not breaking any rules at all in the head 
 
 percy looked as though he had been struck in the face by something very heavy fudge remained motionless in his mouth hanging open 
 
 umbridge recovered first 
 
 all very fine headmaster she said smiling sweetly but we are now nearly six months on from the introduction of educational decree number if the first meeting was not illegal all those that have happened since most certainly are 
 
 well said dumbledore surveying her with polite interest over the top of his interlocked fingers they certainly would be if they had continued after the decree came into effect do you have any evidence that any such meetings continued 
 
 as dumbledore spoke harry heard a rustle behind him and rather thought kingsley whispered something he could have sworn too that he felt something brush against his side a gentle something like a draught or bird wings but looking down he saw nothing there 
 
 evidence repeated umbridge with that horrible wide smile have you not been listening dumbledore why do you think miss edgecombe is here 
 
 oh can she tell us about six months worth of meetings said dumbledore raising his eyebrows i was under the impression that she was merely reporting a meeting tonight 
 
 miss edgecombe said umbridge at once tell us how long these meetings have been going on dear you can simply nod or shake your head sure that make the spots worse have they been happening regularly over the last six months 
 
 harry felt a horrible plummeting in his stomach this was it they had hit a dead end of solid evidence that not even dumbledore would be able to shift aside 
 
 just nod or shake your head dear umbridge said coaxingly to marietta come on now that the jinx 
 
 everyone in the room was gazing at the top of face only her eyes were visible between the robes and her curly fringe perhaps it was a trick of the firelight but her eyes looked oddly blank and thento utter amazementmarietta shook her head 
 
 umbridge looked quickly at fudge then back at marietta 
 
 i think you understood the question did you dear asking whether been going to these meetings for the past six months you have you 
 
 again marietta shook her head 
 
 what do you mean by shaking your head dear said umbridge in a testy voice 
 
 i would have thought her meaning was quite clear said professor mcgonagall harshly there have been no secret meetings for the past six months is that correct miss edgecombe 
 
 marietta nodded 
 
 but there was a meeting tonight said umbridge furiously there was a meeting miss edgecombe you told me about it in the room of requirement and potter was the leader was he not potter organised it potterwhy are you shaking your head girl 
 
 well usually when a person shakes their head said mcgonagall coldly they mean no so unless miss edgecombe is using a form of as yet unknown to humans 
 
 professor umbridge seized marietta pulled her round to face her and began shaking her very hard a split second later dumbledore was on his feet his wand raised kingsley started forwards and umbridge leapt back from marietta waving her hands in the air as though they had been burned 
 
 i cannot allow you to manhandle my students dolores said dumbledore and for the first time he looked angry 
 
 you want to calm yourself madam umbridge said kingsley in his deep slow voice you want to get yourself into trouble now 
 
 no said umbridge breathlessly glancing up at the towering figure of kingsley i mean right shackleboltii forgot myself 
 
 marietta was standing exactly where umbridge had released her she seemed neither perturbed by sudden attack nor relieved by her release she was still clutching her robe up to her oddly blank eyes and staring straight ahead of her 
 
 a sudden suspicion connected to whisper and the thing he had felt shoot past him sprang into mind 
 
 dolores said fudge with the air of trying to settle something once and for all the meeting tonightthe one we know definitely happened 
 
 yes said umbridge pulling herself together yes well miss edgecombe tipped me off and i proceeded at once to the seventh floor accompanied by certain trustworthy students so as to catch those in the meeting it appears that they were forewarned of my arrival however because when we reached the seventh floor they were running in every direction it does not matter however i have all their names here miss parkinson ran into the room of requirement for me to see if they had left anything behind we needed evidence and the room provided 
 
 and to horror she withdrew from her pocket the list of names that had been pinned upon the room of wall and handed it to fudge 
 
 the moment i saw name on the list i knew what we were dealing with she said softly 
 
 excellent said fudge a smile spreading across his face excellent dolores and by thunder 
 
 he looked up at dumbledore who was still standing beside marietta his wand held loosely in his hand 
 
 see what named themselves said fudge quietly army 
 
 dumbledore reached out and took the piece of parchment from fudge he gazed at the heading scribbled by hermione months before and for a moment seemed unable to speak then he looked up smiling 
 
 well the game is up he said simply would you like a written confession from me cornelius or will a statement before these witnesses suffice 
 
 harry saw mcgonagall and kingsley look at each other there was fear in both faces he did not understand what was going on and nor apparently did fudge 
 
 statement said fudge slowly whati 
 
 army cornelius said dumbledore still smiling as he waved the list of names before face not army army 
 
 butbut 
 
 understanding blazed suddenly in face he took a horrified step backwards yelped and jumped out of the fire again 
 
 you he whispered stamping again on his smouldering cloak 
 
 right said dumbledore pleasantly 
 
 you organised this 
 
 i did said dumbledore 
 
 you recruited these students forfor your army 
 
 tonight was supposed to be the first meeting said dumbledore nodding merely to see whether they would be interested in joining me i see now that it was a mistake to invite miss edgecombe of course 
 
 marietta nodded fudge looked from her to dumbledore his chest swelling 
 
 then you have been plotting against me he yelled 
 
 right said dumbledore cheerfully 
 
 no shouted harry 
 
 kingsley flashed a look of warning at him mcgonagall widened her eyes threateningly but it had suddenly dawned on harry what dumbledore was about to do and he could not let it happen 
 
 noprofessor dumbledore 
 
 be quiet harry or i am afraid you will have to leave my office said dumbledore calmly 
 
 yes shut up potter barked fudge who was still ogling dumbledore with a kind of horrified delight well well welli came here tonight expecting to expel potter and instead 
 
 instead you get to arrest me said dumbledore smiling like losing a knut and finding a galleon it 
 
 weasley cried fudge now positively quivering with delight weasley have you written it all down everything said his confession have you got it 
 
 yes sir i think so sir said percy eagerly whose nose was splattered with ink from the speed of his 
 
 the bit about how been trying to build up an army against the ministry how been working to destabilise me 
 
 yes sir got it yes said percy scanning his notes joyfully 
 
 very well then said fudge now radiant with glee duplicate your notes weasley and send a copy to the daily prophet at once if we send a fast owl we should make the morning edition percy dashed from the room slamming the door behind him and fudge turned back to dumbledore you will now be escorted back to the ministry where you will be formally charged then sent to azkaban to await trial 
 
 ah said dumbledore gently yes yes i thought we might hit that little snag 
 
 snag said fudge his voice still vibrating with joy i see no snag dumbledore 
 
 well said dumbledore apologetically afraid i do 
 
 oh really 
 
 just that you seem to be labouring under the delusion that i am going towhat is the am afraid i am not going to come quietly at all cornelius i have absolutely no intention of being sent to azkaban i could break out of coursebut what a waste of time and frankly i can think of a whole host of things i would rather be doing 
 
 face was growing steadily redder she looked as though she was being filled with boiling water fudge stared at dumbledore with a very silly expression on his face as though he had just been stunned by a sudden blow and could not quite believe it had happened he made a small choking noise then looked round at kingsley and the man with short grey hair who alone of everyone in the room had remained entirely silent so far the latter gave fudge a reassuring nod and moved forwards a little away from the wall harry saw his hand drift almost casually towards his pocket 
 
 be silly dawlish said dumbledore kindly sure you are an excellent aurori seem to remember that you achieved outstanding in all your newtsbut if you attempt toerbring me in by force i will have to hurt you 
 
 the man called dawlish blinked rather foolishly he looked towards fudge again but this time seemed to be hoping for a clue as to what to do next 
 
 so sneered fudge recovering himself you intend to take on dawlish shacklebolt dolores and myself do you dumbledore 
 
 beard no said dumbledore smiling not unless you are foolish enough to force me to 
 
 he will not be said professor mcgonagall loudly plunging her hand inside her robes 
 
 oh yes he will minerva said dumbledore sharply hogwarts needs you 
 
 enough of this rubbish said fudge pulling out his own wand dawlish shacklebolt take him 
 
 a streak of silver light flashed around the room there was a bang like a gunshot and the floor trembled a hand grabbed the scruff of neck and forced him down on the floor as a second silver flash went off several of the portraits yelled fawkes screeched and a cloud of dust filled the air coughing in the dust harry saw a dark figure fall to the ground with a crash in front of him there was a shriek and a thud and somebody cried no then there was the sound of breaking glass frantically scuffling footsteps a groan and silence 
 
 harry struggled around to see who was him and saw professor mcgonagall crouched beside him she had forced both him and marietta out of way dust was still floating gently down through the air on to them panting slightly harry saw a very tall figure moving towards them 
 
 are you all right dumbledore asked 
 
 yes said professor mcgonagall getting up and dragging harry and marietta with her 
 
 the dust was clearing the wreckage of the office loomed into view desk had been overturned all of the spindly tables had been knocked to the floor their silver instruments in pieces fudge umbridge kingsley and dawlish lay motionless on the floor fawkes the phoenix soared in wide circles above them singing softly 
 
 unfortunately i had to hex kingsley too or it would have looked very suspicious said dumbledore in a low voice he was remarkably quick on the uptake modifying miss memory like that while everyone was looking the other way thank him for me you minerva 
 
 now they will all awake very soon and it will be best if they do not know that we had time to communicateyou must act as though no time has passed as though they were merely knocked to the ground they will not remember 
 
 where will you go dumbledore whispered professor mcgonagall grimmauld place 
 
 oh no said dumbledore with a grim smile i am not leaving to go into hiding fudge will soon wish never dislodged me from hogwarts i promise you 
 
 professor dumbledore harry began 
 
 he did not know what to say first how sorry he was that he had started the da in the first place and caused all this trouble or how terrible he felt that dumbledore was leaving to save him from expulsion but dumbledore cut him off before he could say another word 
 
 listen to me harry he said urgently you must study occlumency as hard as you can do you understand me do everything professor snape tells you and practise it particularly every night before sleeping so that you can close your mind to bad dreamsyou will understand why soon enough but you must promise me 
 
 the man called dawlish was stirring dumbledore seized wrist 
 
 rememberclose your mind 
 
 but as fingers closed over skin a pain shot through the scar on his forehead and he felt again that terrible snakelike longing to strike dumbledore to bite him to hurt him 
 
 you will understand whispered dumbledore 
 
 fawkes circled the office and swooped low over him dumbledore released harry raised his hand and grasped the long golden tail there was a flash of fire and the pair of them were gone 
 
 where is he yelled fudge pushing himself up from the floor where is he 
 
 i know shouted kingsley also leaping to his feet 
 
 well he have disapparated cried umbridge you do it from inside this school 
 
 the stairs cried dawlish and he flung himself upon the door wrenched it open and disappeared followed closely by kingsley and umbridge fudge hesitated then got slowly to his feet brushing dust from his front there was a long and painful silence 
 
 well minerva said fudge nastily straightening his torn shirtsleeve afraid this is the end of your friend dumbledore 
 
 you think so do you said professor mcgonagall scornfully 
 
 fudge seemed not to hear her he was looking around at the wrecked office a few of the portraits hissed at him one or two even made rude hand gestures 
 
 better get those two off to bed said fudge looking back at professor mcgonagall with a dismissive nod towards harry and marietta 
 
 professor mcgonagall said nothing but marched harry and marietta to the door as it swung closed behind them harry heard phineas voice 
 
 you know minister i disagree with dumbledore on many counts but you cannot deny got style

 once back under the starry sky harry heaved dumbledore on to the top of the nearest boulder and then to his feet sodden and shivering weight still upon him harry concentrated harder than he had ever done upon his destination hogsmeade closing his eyes gripping arm as tightly as he could he stepped forwards into that feeling of horrible compression 
 
 he knew it had worked before he opened his eyes the smell of salt the sea breeze had gone he and dumbledore were shivering and dripping in the middle of the dark high street in hogsmeade for one horrible moment imagination showed him more inferi creeping towards him around the sides of shops but he blinked and saw that nothing was stirring all was still the darkness complete but for a few streetlamps and lit upper windows 
 
 we did it professor harry whispered with difficulty he suddenly realised that he had a searing stitch in his chest we did it we got the horcrux 
 
 dumbledore staggered against him for a moment harry thought that his inexpert apparition had thrown dumbledore then he saw his face paler and damper than ever in the distant light of a streetlamp 
 
 sir are you all right 
 
 been better said dumbledore weakly though the corners of his mouth twitched that potion was no health drink 
 
 and to horror dumbledore sank on to the ground 
 
 okay sir going to be all right worry 
 
 he looked around desperately for help but there was nobody to be seen and all he could think was that he must somehow get dumbledore quickly to the hospital wing 
 
 we need to get you up to the school sir madam pomfrey 
 
 no said is professor snape whom i need but i do not think i can walk very far just yet 
 
 rightsir going to knock on a door find a place you can staythen i can run and get madam 
 
 severus said dumbledore clearly i need severus 
 
 all right then snapebut going to have to leave you for a moment so i can 
 
 before harry could make a move however he heard running footsteps his heart leapt somebody had seen somebody knew they needed helpand looking around he saw madam rosmerta scurrying down the dark street towards them on fluffy slippers wearing a silk embroidered with dragons 
 
 i saw you apparate as i was pulling my bedroom curtains thank goodness thank goodness i think what tobut wrong with albus 
 
 she came to a halt panting and stared down at dumbledore 
 
 hurt said harry madam rosmerta can he come into the three broomsticks while i go up to the school and get help for him 
 
 you go up there alone you you seen 
 
 if you help me support him said harry not listening to her i think we can get him inside 
 
 what has happened asked dumbledore rosmerta wrong 
 
 thethe dark mark albus 
 
 and she pointed into the sky in the direction of hogwarts dread flooded harry at the sound of the words he turned and looked 
 
 there it was hanging in the sky above the school the blazing green skull with a serpent tongue the mark death eaters left behind whenever they had entered a building wherever they had murdered 
 
 when did it appear asked dumbledore and his hand clenched painfully upon shoulder as he struggled to his feet 
 
 must have been minutes ago it there when i put the cat out but when i got upstairs 
 
 we need to return to the castle at once said dumbledore rosmerta and though he staggered a little he seemed wholly in command of the situation we need transportbrooms 
 
 got a couple behind the bar she said looking very frightened shall i run and fetch 
 
 no harry can do it 
 
 harry raised his wand at once 
 
 accio brooms 
 
 a second later they heard a loud bang as the front door of the pub burst open two brooms had shot out into the street and were racing each other to side where they stopped dead quivering slightly at waist height 
 
 rosmerta please send a message to the ministry said dumbledore as he mounted the broom nearest him it might be that nobody within hogwarts has yet realised anything is wrong harry put on your invisibility cloak 
 
 harry pulled his cloak out of his pocket and threw it over himself before mounting his broom madam rosmerta was already tottering back towards her pub as harry and dumbledore kicked off from the ground and rose up into the air as they sped towards the castle harry glanced sideways at dumbledore ready to grab him should he fall but the sight of the dark mark seemed to have acted upon dumbledore like a stimulant he was bent low over his broom his eyes fixed upon the mark his long silver hair and beard flying behind him in the night air and harry too looked ahead at the skull and fear swelled inside him like a venomous bubble compressing his lungs driving all other discomfort from his mind 
 
 how long had they been away had ron hermione and luck run out by now was it one of them who had caused the mark to be set over the school or was it neville or luna or some other member of the da and if it was he was the one who had told them to patrol the corridors he had asked them to leave the safety of their beds would he be responsible again for the death of a friend 
 
 as they flew over the dark twisting lane down which they had walked earlier harry heard over the whistling of the night air in his ears dumbledore muttering in some strange language again he thought he understood why as he felt his broom shudder for a moment when they flew over the boundary wall into the grounds dumbledore was undoing the enchantments he himself had set around the castle so that they could enter at speed the dark mark was glittering directly above the astronomy tower the highest of the castle did that mean the death had occurred there 
 
 dumbledore had already crossed the crenellated ramparts and was dismounting harry landed next to him seconds later and looked around 
 
 the ramparts were deserted the door to the spiral staircase that led back into the castle was closed there was no sign of a struggle of a fight to the death of a body 
 
 what does it mean harry asked dumbledore looking up at the green skull with its tongue glinting evilly above them is it the real mark has someone definitely beenprofessor 
 
 in the dim green glow from the mark harry saw dumbledore clutching at his chest with his blackened hand 
 
 go and wake severus said dumbledore faintly but clearly tell him what has happened and bring him to me do nothing else speak to nobody else and do not remove your cloak i shall wait here 
 
 but 
 
 you swore to obey me harrygo 
 
 harry hurried over to the door leading to the spiral staircase but his hand had only just closed upon the iron ring of the door when he heard running footsteps on the other side he looked round at dumbledore who gestured to him to retreat harry backed away drawing his wand as he did so 
 
 the door burst open and somebody erupted through it and shouted expelliarmus 
 
 body became instantly rigid and immobile and he felt himself fall back against the tower wall propped like an unsteady statue unable to move or speak he could not understand how it had happenedexpelliarmus was not a freezing charm 
 
 then by the light of the mark he saw wand flying in an arc over the edge of the ramparts and understood dumbledore had wordlessly immobilised harry and the second he had taken to perform the spell had cost him the chance of defending himself 
 
 standing against the ramparts very white in the face dumbledore still showed no sign of panic or distress he merely looked across at his disarmer and said good evening draco 
 
 malfoy stepped forwards glancing around quickly to check that he and dumbledore were alone his eyes fell upon the second broom 
 
 who else is here 
 
 a question i might ask you or are you acting alone 
 
 harry saw pale eyes shift back to dumbledore in the greenish glare of the mark 
 
 no he said got there are death eaters here in your school tonight 
 
 well well said dumbledore as though malfoy was showing him an ambitious homework project very good indeed you found a way to let them in did you 
 
 yeah said malfoy who was panting right under your nose and you never realised 
 
 ingenious said dumbledore yet forgive me where are they now you seem unsupported 
 
 they met some of your guard having a fight down below they be long i came on ahead got a job to do 
 
 well then you must get on and do it my dear boy said dumbledore softly 
 
 there was silence harry stood imprisoned within his own invisible paralysed body staring at the two of them his ears straining to hear sounds of the death eaters distant fight and in front of him draco malfoy did nothing but stare at albus dumbledore who incredibly smiled 
 
 draco draco you are not a killer 
 
 how do you know said malfoy at once 
 
 he seemed to realise how childish the words had sounded harry saw him flush in the greenish light 
 
 you know what capable of said malfoy more forcefully you know what done 
 
 oh yes i do said dumbledore mildly you almost killed katie bell and ronald weasley you have been trying with increasing desperation to kill me all year forgive me draco but they have been feeble attempts so feeble to be honest that i wonder whether your heart has been really in it 
 
 it has been in it said malfoy vehemently been working on it all year and tonight 
 
 somewhere in the depths of the castle below harry heard a muffled yell malfoy stiffened and glanced over his shoulder 
 
 somebody is putting up a good fight said dumbledore conversationally but you were saying yes you have managed to introduce death eaters into my school which i admit i thought impossible how did you do it 
 
 but malfoy said nothing he was still listening to whatever was happening below and seemed almost as paralysed as harry was 
 
 perhaps you ought to get on with the job alone suggested dumbledore what if your has been thwarted by my guard as you have perhaps realised there are members of the order of the phoenix here tonight too and after all you really need help i have no wand at the moment i cannot defend myself 
 
 malfoy merely stared at him 
 
 i see said dumbledore kindly when malfoy neither moved nor spoke you are afraid to act until they join you 
 
 not afraid snarled malfoy though he still made no move to hurt you who should be scared 
 
 but why i think you will kill me draco killing is not nearly as easy as the innocent believe so tell me while we wait for your friends how did you smuggle them in here it seems to have taken you a long time to work out how to do it 
 
 malfoy looked as though he was fighting down the urge to shout or to vomit he gulped and took several deep breaths glaring at dumbledore his wand pointing directly at the heart then as though he could not help himself he said i had to mend that broken vanishing cabinet that no used for years the one montague got lost in last year 
 
 aaaah 
 
 sigh was half a groan he closed his eyes for a moment 
 
 that was clever there is a pair i take it 
 
 the in borgin and burkes said malfoy and they make a kind of passage between them montague told me that when he was stuck in the hogwarts one he was trapped in limbo but sometimes he could hear what was going on at school and sometimes what was going on in the shop as if the cabinet was travelling between them but he make anyone hear him in the end he managed to apparate out even though never passed his test he nearly died doing it everyone thought it was a really good story but i was the only one who realised what it meanteven borgin know i was the one who realised there could be a way into hogwarts through the cabinets if i fixed the broken one 
 
 very good murmured dumbledore so the death eaters were able to pass from borgin and burkes into the school to help you a clever plan a very clever plan and as you say right under my nose 
 
 yeah said malfoy who bizarrely seemed to draw courage and comfort from praise yeah it was 
 
 but there were times dumbledore went on there when you were not sure you would succeed in mending the cabinet and you resorted to crude and badly judged measures such as sending me a cursed necklace that was bound to reach the wrong hands poisoning mead there was only the slightest chance i might drink 
 
 yeah well you still realise who was behind that stuff did you sneered malfoy as dumbledore slid a little down the ramparts the strength in his legs apparently fading and harry struggled fruitlessly mutely against the enchantment binding him 
 
 as a matter of fact i did said dumbledore i was sure it was you 
 
 why you stop me then malfoy demanded 
 
 i tried draco professor snape has been keeping watch over you on my orders 
 
 he been doing your orders he promised my mother 
 
 of course that is what he would tell you draco but 
 
 a you stupid old man he working for you you just think he is 
 
 we must agree to differ on that draco it so happens that i trust professor snape 
 
 well losing your grip then sneered malfoy been offering me plenty of helpwanting all the glory for himselfwanting a bit of the are you doing did you do the necklace that was stupid it could have blown everything but i told him what been doing in the room of requirement going to wake up tomorrow and all be over and he be the dark favourite any more be nothing compared to me nothing 
 
 very gratifying said dumbledore mildly we all like appreciation for our own hard work of course but you must have had an accomplice all the same someone in hogsmeade someone who was able to slip katie thetheaaaah 
 
 dumbledore closed his eyes again and nodded as though he was about to fall asleep 
 
 of course rosmerta how long has she been under the imperius curse 
 
 got there at last have you malfoy taunted 
 
 there was another yell from below rather louder than the last malfoy looked nervously over his shoulder again then back at dumbledore who went on so poor rosmerta was forced to lurk in her own bathroom and pass that necklace to any hogwarts student who entered the room unaccompanied and the poisoned mead well naturally rosmerta was able to poison it for you before she sent the bottle to slughorn believing that it was to be my christmas present yes very neat very neat poor mr filch would not of course think to check a bottle of tell me how have you been communicating with rosmerta i thought we had all methods of communication in and out of the school monitored 
 
 enchanted coins said malfoy as though he was compelled to keep talking though his wand hand was shaking badly i had one and she had the other and i could send her messages 
 
 that the secret method of communication the group that called themselves army used last year asked dumbledore his voice was light and conversational but harry saw him slip an inch lower down the wall as he said it 
 
 yeah i got the idea from them said malfoy with a twisted smile i got the idea of poisoning the mead from the mudblood granger as well i heard her talking in the library about filch not recognising potions 
 
 please do not use that offensive word in front of me said dumbledore 
 
 malfoy gave a harsh laugh 
 
 you care about me saying mudblood when about to kill you 
 
 yes i do said dumbledore and harry saw his feet slide a little on the floor as he struggled to remain upright but as for being about to kill me draco you have had several long minutes now we are quite alone i am more defenceless than you can have dreamed of finding me and still you have not acted 
 
 mouth contorted involuntarily as though he had tasted something very bitter 
 
 now about tonight dumbledore went on i am a little puzzled about how it happened you knew that i had left the school but of course he answered his own question rosmerta saw me leaving she tipped you off using your ingenious coins sure 
 
 right said malfoy but she said you were just going for a drink be back 
 
 well i certainly did have a drink and i came back after a fashion mumbled dumbledore so you decided to spring a trap for me 
 
 we decided to put the dark mark over the tower and get you to hurry up here to see been killed said malfoy and it worked 
 
 well yes and no said dumbledore but am i to take it then that nobody has been murdered 
 
 dead said malfoy and his voice seemed to go up an octave as he said it one of your people i know who it was dark i stepped over the body i was supposed to be waiting up here when you got back only your phoenix lot got in the way 
 
 yes they do that said dumbledore 
 
 there was a bang and shouts from below louder than ever it sounded as though people were fighting on the actual spiral staircase that led to where dumbledore malfoy and harry stood and heart thundered unheard in his invisible chest someone was dead malfoy had stepped over the body but who was it 
 
 there is little time one way or another said dumbledore so let us discuss your options draco 
 
 my options said malfoy loudly standing here with a about to kill you 
 
 my dear boy let us have no more pretence about that if you were going to kill me you would have done it when you first disarmed me you would not have stopped for this pleasant chat about ways and means 
 
 i got any options said malfoy and he was suddenly as white as dumbledore got to do it kill me kill my whole family 
 
 i appreciate the difficulty of your position said dumbledore why else do you think i have not confronted you before now because i knew that you would have been murdered if lord voldemort realised that i suspected you 
 
 malfoy winced at the sound of the name 
 
 i did not dare speak to you of the mission with which i knew you had been entrusted in case he used legilimency against you continued dumbledore but now at last we can speak plainly to each other no harm has been done you have hurt nobody though you are very lucky that your unintentional victims survived i can help you draco 
 
 no you said malfoy his wand hand shaking very badly indeed nobody can he told me to do it or kill me got no choice 
 
 come over to the right side draco and we can hide you more completely than you can possibly imagine what is more i can send members of the order to your mother tonight to hide her likewise your father is safe at the moment in azkaban when the time comes we can protect him too come over to the right side draco you are not a killer 
 
 malfoy stared at dumbledore 
 
 but i got this far i he said slowly they thought die in the attempt but here and in my power the one with the wand at my mercy 
 
 no draco said dumbledore quietly it is my mercy and not yours that matters now 
 
 malfoy did not speak his mouth was open his wand hand still trembling harry thought he saw it drop by a fraction 
 
 but suddenly footsteps were thundering up the stairs and a second later malfoy was buffeted out of the way as four people in black robes burst through the door on to the ramparts still paralysed his eyes staring unblinkingly harry gazed in terror upon four strangers it seemed the death eaters had won the fight below 
 
 a man with an odd lopsided leer gave a wheezy giggle 
 
 dumbledore cornered he said and he turned to a stocky little woman who looked as though she could be his sister and who was grinning eagerly dumbledore wandless dumbledore alone well done draco well done 
 
 good evening amycus said dumbledore calmly as though welcoming the man to a tea party and brought alecto too charming 
 
 the woman gave an angry little titter 
 
 think your little help you on your death bed then she jeered 
 
 jokes no no these are manners replied dumbledore 
 
 do it said the stranger standing nearest to harry a big rangy man with matted grey hair and whiskers whose black death robes looked uncomfortably tight he had a voice like none that harry had ever heard a rasping bark of a voice harry could smell a powerful mixture of dirt sweat and unmistakeably of blood coming from him his filthy hands had long yellowish nails 
 
 is that you fenrir asked dumbledore 
 
 right rasped the other pleased to see me dumbledore 
 
 no i cannot say that i am 
 
 fenrir greyback grinned showing pointed teeth blood trickled down his chin and he licked his lips slowly obscenely 
 
 but you know how much i like kids dumbledore 
 
 am i to take it that you are attacking even without the full moon now this is most unusual you have developed a taste for human flesh that cannot be satisfied once a month 
 
 right said greyback shocks you that does it dumbledore frightens you 
 
 well i cannot pretend it does not disgust me a little said dumbledore and yes i am a little shocked that draco here invited you of all people into the school where his friends live 
 
 i breathed malfoy he was not looking at greyback he did not seem to want to even glance at him i know he was going to come 
 
 i want to miss a trip to hogwarts dumbledore rasped greyback not when there are throats to be ripped out delicious delicious 
 
 and he raised a yellow fingernail and picked at his front teeth leering at dumbledore 
 
 i could do you for afters dumbledore 
 
 no said the fourth death eater sharply he had a heavy face got orders got to do it now draco and quickly 
 
 malfoy was showing less resolution than ever he looked terrified as he stared into face which was even paler and rather lower than usual as he had slid so far down the rampart wall 
 
 not long for this world anyway if you ask me said the lopsided man to the accompaniment of his wheezing giggles look at happened to you then dumby 
 
 oh weaker resistance slower reflexes amycus said dumbledore old age in short one day perhaps it will happen to you if you are lucky 
 
 that mean then that mean yelled the death eater suddenly violent always the same yeh dumby talking and doing nothing nothing i even know why the dark bothering to kill yeh come on draco do it 
 
 but at that moment there were renewed sounds of scuffling from below and a voice shouted blocked the stairsreducto reducto 
 
 heart leapt so these four had not eliminated all opposition but merely broken through the fight to the top of the tower and by the sound of it created a barrier behind them 
 
 now draco quickly said the man angrily 
 
 but hand was shaking so badly that he could barely aim 
 
 do it snarled greyback moving towards dumbledore with his hands outstretched his teeth bared 
 
 i said no shouted the man there was a flash of light and the werewolf was blasted out of the way he hit the ramparts and staggered looking furious heart was hammering so hard it seemed impossible that nobody could hear him standing there imprisoned by spellif he could only move he could aim a curse from under the cloak 
 
 draco do it or stand aside so one of us screeched the woman but at that precise moment the door to the ramparts burst open once more and there stood snape his wand clutched in his hand as his black eyes swept the scene from dumbledore slumped against the wall to the four death eaters including the enraged werewolf and malfoy 
 
 got a problem snape said the lumpy amycus whose eyes and wand were fixed alike upon dumbledore the boy seem able 
 
 but somebody else had spoken name quite softly 
 
 severus 
 
 the sound frightened harry beyond anything he had experienced all evening for the first time dumbledore was pleading 
 
 snape said nothing but walked forwards and pushed malfoy roughly out of the way the three death eaters fell back without a word even the werewolf seemed cowed 
 
 snape gazed for a moment at dumbledore and there was revulsion and hatred etched in the harsh lines of his face 
 
 severus please 
 
 snape raised his wand and pointed it directly at dumbledore 
 
 avada kedavra 
 
 a jet of green light shot from the end of wand and hit dumbledore squarely in the chest scream of horror never left him silent and unmoving he was forced to watch as dumbledore was blasted into the air for a split second he seemed to hang suspended beneath the shining skull and then he fell slowly backwards like a great rag doll over the battlements and out of sight

lionfish nov chapter the final hiding placecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 there was no means of steering the dragon could not see where it was going and harry knew that if it turned sharply or rolled in midair they would find it impossible to cling onto its broad back nevertheless as they climbed higher and higher london unfurling below them like a map harrys overwhelming feeling was of gratitude for an escape that had seemed impossible crouching low over the beasts neck he clung tight to the metallic scales and the cool breeze was soothing on his burned and blistered skin the dragons wings beating the air like the sails of a windmill behind him whether from delight or fear he could not tell ron kept swearing at the top of his voice and hermione seemed to be sobbing 
 
 after five minutes or so harry lost some of his immediate dread that the dragon was going to throw them off for it seemed intent on nothing but getting as far away from its underground prison as possible but the question of how and when they were to dismount remained rather frightening he had no idea how long dragons could fly without landing nor how this particular dragon which could barely see would locate a good place to put down he glanced around constantly imagining that he could feel his seat prickling 
 
 how long would it be before voldemort knew that they had broken into the lestranges vault how soon would the goblins of gringotts notify bellatrix how quickly would they realize what had been taken and then when they discovered that the golden cup was missing voldemort would know at last that they were hunting horcruxes 
 
 the dragon seemed to crave cooler and fresher air it climbed steadily until they were flying through wisps of chilly cloud and harry could no longer make out the little colored dots which were cars pouring in and out of the capital on and on they flew over countryside parceled out in patches of green and brown over roads and rivers winding through the landscape like strips of matte and glossy ribbon 
 
 what do you reckon its looking for ron yelled as they flew farther and farther north 
 
 no idea harry bellow back his hands were numb with cold but he did not date attempt to shift his grip he had been wondering for some time what they would do if they saw the coast sail beneath them if the dragon headed for open seal he was cold and numb not to mention desperately hungry and thirsty when he wondered had the beast itself last eaten surely it would need sustenance before long and what if at that point it realized it had three highly edible humans sitting on its back 
 
 the sun slipped lower in the sky which was turning indigo and still the dragon flew cities and towns gliding out of sight beneath them its enormous shadow sliding over the earth like a giant dark cloud every part of harry ached with the effort of holding on to the dragons back 
 
 is it my imagination shouted ron after a considerable stretch of silence or are we losing height 
 
 harry looked down and saw deep green mountains and lakes coppery in the sunset the landscape seemed to grow larger and more detailed as he squinted over the side of the dragon and he wondered whether it had divined the presence of fresh water by the flashes of reflected sunlight 
 
 lower and lower the dragon flew in great spiraling circles honing in it seemed upon one of the smaller lakes 
 
 i say we jump when it gets low enough harry called back to the others straight into the water before it realizes were here 
 
 they agreed hermione a little faintly and now harry could see the dragons wide yellow underbelly rippling in the surface of the water 
 
 now 
 
 he slithered over the side of the dragon and plummeted feetfirst toward the surface of the lake the drop was greater than he had estimated and he hit the water hard plunging like a stone into a freezing green world he kicked toward the surface and emerged panting to see enormous ripples emanating in circles from the places where ron and hermione had fallen the dragon did not seem to have noticed anything it was already fifty feet away swooping low over the lake to scoop up water in its scarred snout as ron and hermione emerged spluttering and gasping from the depths of the lake the dragon flew on its wings beating hard and landed at last on a distant bank 
 
 harry ron and hermione struck out for the opposite shore the lake did not seem to be deep soon it was more a question of fighting their way through reeds and mud than swimming and at last they flopped sodden panting and exhausted onto slippery grass 
 
 hermione collapsed coughing and shuddering though harry could have happily lain down and slept he staggered to his feet drew out his wand and started casting the usual protective spells around them 
 
 when he had finished he joined the others it was the first time that he had seen them properly since escaping from the vault both had angry red burns all over their faces and arms and their clothing was singed away in places they were wincing as they dabbed essence of dittany onto their many injuries hermione handed harry the bottle then pulled out three bottles of pumpkin juice she had brought from shell cottage and clean dry robes for all of them they changes and then gulped down the juice 
 
 well on the upside said ron finally who was sitting watching the skin on his hands regrow we got the horcrux on the downside 
 
 c no sword said harry through gritted teeth as he dripped dittany through the singed hole in his jeans onto the angry burn beneath 
 
 no sword repeated ron that little scab 
 
 harry pulled the horcrux from the pocket of the wet jacket he had just taken off and set it down on the grass in front of them glinting in the sun it drew their eyes as they swigged their bottles of juice 
 
 at least we cant wear it this time thatd look a bit weird hanging around our necks said ron wiping his mouth on the back of his hand 
 
 hermione looked across the lake to the far bank where the dragon was still drinking 
 
 whatll happen to it do you think she asked will it be alright 
 
 you sound like hagrid said ron its a dragon hermione it can look after itself its us we need to worry about 
 
 what do you mean 
 
 well i dont know how to break this to you said ron but i think they might have noticed we broke into gringotts 
 
 all three of them started to laugh and once started it was difficult to stop harrys ribs ached he felt lightheaded with hunger but he lay back on the grass beneath the reddening sky and laughed until his throat was raw 
 
 what are we going to do though said hermione finally hiccuping herself back to seriousness hell know wont he will know we know about his horcruxes 
 
 maybe theyll be too scared to tell him said ron hopefully maybe theyll cover up c 
 
 the sky the smell of the lake water the sound of rons voice were extinguished pain cleaved harrys head like a sword stroke 
 
 
 
 
 he was standing in a dimly lit room and a semicircle of wizards faced him and on the floor at his feet knelt a small quaking figure 
 
 what did you say to me his voice was high and cold but fury and fear burned inside him the one thing that he had dreaded c but it could not be true he could not see how 
 
 the goblin was trembling unable to meet the red eyes high above his 
 
 say it again murmured voldemort say it again 
 
 lord stammered the goblin its black eyes wide with terror lord we to them my lord broke broke into the c into the lestranges vault 
 
 impostors what impostors i thought gringotts had ways of revealing impostors who were they 
 
 it was it was the and the accomplices 
 
 and they took he said his voice rising a terrible fear gripping him tell me what did they take 
 
 a a golden lord 
 
 the scream of rage of denial left him as if it were a strangers he was crazed frenzied it could not be true it was impossible nobody had known how was it possible that the boy could have discovered his secret 
 
 the elder wand slashed through the air and green light erupted through the room the kneeling goblin rolled over dead the watching wizards scattered before him terrified bellatrix and lucius malfoy threw others behind them in their race for the door and again and again his wand fell and those who were left were slain all of them for bringing him this news for hearing about the golden cup alone amongst the dead he stomped up and down and they passed before him in vision his treasures his safeguards his anchors to immortality c the diary was destroyed and the cup was stolen what if what if the boy knew about the others could he know had he already acted had he traced more of them was dumbledore at the root of this dumbledore who had always suspected him dumbledore dead on his orders dumbledore whose wand was his now yet who reached out from the ignominy of death through the boy the boy 
 
 but surely if the boy had destroyed any of his horcruxes he lord voldemort would have known would have felt it he the greatest wizard of them all he the most powerful he the killer of dumbledore and of how many other worthless nameless men how could lord voldemort not have known if he himself most important and precious had been attacked mutilated 
 
 true he had not felt it when the diary had been destroyed but he had thought that was because he had no body to fell being less than ghost no surely the rest were safe the other horcruxes must be intact 
 
 but he must know he must be sure he paced the room kicking aside the goblins corpse as he passed and the pictures blurred and burned in his boiling brain the lake the shack and hogwarts 
 
 a modicum of calm cooled his rage now how could the boy know that he had hidden the ring in the gaunt shack no one had ever known him to be related to the gaunts he had hidden the connection the killings had never been traced to him the ring surely was safe 
 
 and how could the boy or anybody else know about the cave or penetrate its protection the idea of the locket being stolen was absurd 
 
 as for the school he alone knew where in hogwarts he had stowed the horcrux because he alone had plumed the deepest secrets of that place 
 
 and there was still nagini who must remain close now no longer sent to do his bidding under his protection 
 
 but to be sure to be utterly sure he must return to each of his hiding places he must redouble protection around each of his horcruxes a job like the quest for the elder wand that he must undertake alone 
 
 which should he visit first which was in most danger an old unease flickered inside him dumbledore had known his middle name dumbledore might have made the connection with the gaunts their abandoned home was perhaps the least secure of his hiding places it was there that he would go first 
 
 the lake surely impossible though was there a slight possibility that dumbledore might have known some of his past misdeeds through the orphanage 
 
 and hogwarts but he knew the his horcrux there was safe it would be impossible for potter to enter hogsmeade without detection let alone the school nevertheless it would be prudent to alert snape to the fact that the boy might try to reenter the castle to tell snape why the boy might return would be foolish of course it had been a grave mistake to trust bellatrix and malfoy didnt their stupidity and carelessness prove how unwise it was ever to trust 
 
 he would visit the gaunt shack first then and take nagini with him he would not be parted from the snake anymore and he strode from the room through the hall and out into the dark garden where the fountain played he called the snake in parseltongue and it slithered out to join him like a long shadow 
 
 
 
 
 harrys eyes flew open as he wrenched himself back to the present he was lying on the bank of the lake in the setting sun and ron and hermione were looking down at him judging by their worried looks and by the continued pounding of his scar his sudden excursion into voldemorts mind had not passed unnoticed he struggled up shivering vaguely surprised that he was still wet to his skin and saw the cup lying innocently in the grass before him and the lake deep blue shot with gold in the falling sun 
 
 he knows his own voice sounded strange and low after voldemorts high screams he knows and hes going to check where the others are and the last one he was already on his feet is at hogwarts i knew it i knew it 
 
 what 
 
 ron was gaping at him hermione sat up looking worried 
 
 but what did you see how do you know 
 
 i saw him find out about the cup i c i was in his head hes c harry remembered the killings c hes seriously angry and scared too he cant understand how we knew and now hes going to check the others are safe the ring first he things the hogwarts one is safest because snapes there because itll be so hard not to be seen getting in i think hell check that one last but he could still be there within hours c 
 
 did you see where in hogwarts it is asked ron now scrambling to his feet too 
 
 no he was concentrating on warning snape he didnt think about exactly where it is c 
 
 wait wait cried hermione as ron caught up to the horcrux and harry pulled out the invisibility cloak again we cant just go we havent got a plan we need to c 
 
 we need to get going said harry firmly he had been hoping to sleep looking forward to getting into the new tent but that was impossible now can you imagine what hes going to do once he realizes the ring and the locket are gone what if he moves the hogwarts horcrux decides it isnt safe enough 
 
 but how are we going to get in 
 
 well go to hogsmeade said harry and try to work something out once we see what the protection around the schools like get under the cloak hermione i want to stick together this time 
 
 but we dont really fit c 
 
 itll be dark no ones going to notice our feet 
 
 the flapping of enormous wings echoed across the black water the dragon had drunk its fill and risen into the air they paused in their preparations to watch it climb higher and higher now black against the rapidly darkening sky until it vanished over a nearby mountain then hermione walked forward and took her place between the other two harry pulled the cloak down as far as it would go and together they turned on the spot into the crushing darkness

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 poultry family 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 poultry meg was the only person who lived in the new stately 
 dwelling that had been built for the fowls and ducks belonging to 
 the manor house it stood there where once the old knightly building 
 had stood with its tower its pointed gables its moat and its 
 drawbridge close by it was a wilderness of trees and thicket here 
 the garden had been and had stretched out to a great lake which 
 was now moorland crows and choughs flew screaming over the old trees and there were crowds of birds they did not seem to get fewer when any one shot among them but seemed rather to increase one heard the screaming into the where poultry meg sat with the ducklings running to and fro over her wooden shoes she knew every fowl and every duck from the moment it crept out of the shell and she was fond of her fowls and her ducks and proud of the stately house that had been built for them her own little room in the house was clean and neat for that was the wish of the gracious lady to whom the house belonged she often came in the company of grand noble guests to whom she showed the hens and ducks barracks as she called the little house 
 
 here were a clothes cupboard and an and even a 
 chest of drawers and on these drawers a polished metal plate had been placed whereon was engraved the word grubbe and this was the name of the noble family that had lived in the house of old the brass plate had been found when they were digging the foundation and the clerk has said it had no value except in being an old relic the clerk knew all about the place and about the old times for he had his 
 knowledge from books and many a memorandum had been written and put in his but the oldest of the crows perhaps knew more than he and screamed it out in her own language but that was the language and the clerk did not understand that clever as he was 
 
 after the hot summer days the mist sometimes hung over the 
 moorland as if a whole lake were behind the old trees among which the crows and the daws were fluttering and thus it had looked when the good knight grubbe had lived here when the old manor house stood with its thick red walls the used to reach in those days quite over the gateway through the tower one went into a paved passage which led to the rooms the windows were narrow and the panes were small even in the great hall where the dancing used to be but in the time of the last grubbe there had been no dancing in the hall within the memory of man although an old drum still lay there that had served as part of the music here stood a quaintly carved 
 cupboard in which rare were kept for my lady grubbe was fond of plants and cultivated trees and shrubs her husband 
 preferred riding out to shoot wolves and boars and his little 
 daughter marie always went with him part of the way when she was only five years old she would sit proudly on her horse and look saucily round with her great black eyes it was a great amusement to her to hit out among the with her whip but her father would rather have seen her hit among the peasant boys who came running up to stare at their lord 
 
 the peasant in the clay hut close by the knightly house had a 
 son named soren of the same age as the gracious little lady the 
 boy could climb well and had always to bring her down the 
 nests the birds screamed as loud as they could and one of the 
 greatest of them hacked him with its beak over the eye so that the 
 blood ran down and it was at first thought the eye had been 
 destroyed but it had not been injured after all marie grubbe used to 
 call him her soren and that was a great favor and was an advantage 
 to father poor jon who had one day committed a fault and 
 was to be punished by riding on the wooden horse this same horse 
 stood in the courtyard and had four poles for legs and a single 
 narrow plant for a back on this jon had to ride astride and some 
 heavy bricks were fastened to his feet into the bargain that he might 
 not sit too comfortably he made horrible grimaces and soren wept and implored little marie to interfere she immediately ordered that 
 father should be taken down and when they did not obey her she stamped on the floor and pulled at her sleeve till it 
 was torn to pieces she would have her way and she got her way and father was taken down 
 
 lady grubbe who now came up parted her little hair 
 from the brow and looked at her affectionately but marie did 
 not understand why 
 
 she wanted to go to the hounds and not to her mother who went 
 down into the garden to the lake where the bloomed and 
 the heads of bulrushes nodded amid the reeds and she looked at all 
 this beauty and freshness how pleasant she said in the garden 
 stood at that time a rare tree which she herself had planted it 
 was called the a kind of negro growing among the other 
 trees so dark brown were the leaves this tree required much 
 sunshine for in continual shade it would become bright green like the 
 other trees and thus lose its distinctive character in the lofty 
 chestnut trees were many birds nests and also in the thickets and in 
 the grassy meadows it seemed as though the birds knew that they 
 were protected here and that no one must fire a gun at them 
 
 little marie came here with soren he knew how to climb as we 
 have already said and eggs and young birds were 
 brought down the birds great and small flew about in terror and 
 tribulation the peewit from the fields and the crows and daws from 
 the high trees screamed and screamed it was just such din as the 
 family will raise to the present day 
 
 what are you doing you children cried the gentle lady that 
 is sinful 
 
 soren stood abashed and even the little gracious lady looked down 
 a little but then he said quite short and pretty 
 
 my father lets me do it 
 
 from here cried the great black birds and 
 they flew away but on the following day they came back for they were at home here 
 
 the quiet gentle lady did not remain long at home here on earth 
 for the good god called her away and indeed her home was rather 
 with him than in the knightly house and the church bells tolled 
 solemnly when her corpse was carried to the church and the eyes of 
 the poor people were wet with tears for she had been good to them 
 when she was gone no one attended to her plantations and the 
 garden ran to waste grubbe the knight was a hard man they said 
 but his daughter young as she was knew how to manage him he used to laugh and let her have her way she was now twelve years old and strongly built she looked the people through and through with her black eyes rode her horse as bravely as a man and could fire off her gun like a practiced hunter 
 
 one day there were great visitors in the neighborhood the 
 grandest visitors who could come the young king and his and comrade the lord ulric frederick gyldenlowe they wanted to hunt the wild boar and to pass a few days at the castle of grubbe 
 
 gyldenlowe sat at table next to marie grubbe and he took her by 
 the hand and gave her a kiss as if she had been a relation but she 
 gave him a box on the ear and told him she could not bear him at 
 which there was great laughter as if that had been a very amusing 
 thing 
 
 and perhaps it was very amusing for five years afterwards 
 when marie had fulfilled her seventeenth year a messenger arrived 
 with a letter in which lord gyldenlowe proposed for the hand of the 
 noble young lady there was a thing for you 
 
 he is the grandest and most gallant gentleman in the whole 
 country said grubbe the knight that is not a thing to despise 
 
 i care so very much about him said marie grubbe but 
 she did not despise the grandest man of all the country who sat by 
 the side 
 
 silver plate and fine linen and woollen went off to copenhagen 
 in a ship while the bride made the journey by land in ten days but 
 the outfit met with contrary winds or with no winds at all for 
 four months passed before it arrived and when it came my lady 
 gyldenlowe was gone 
 
 rather lie on coarse sacking than lie in his silken beds 
 she declared rather walk barefoot than drive with him in a 
 coach 
 
 late one evening in november two women came riding into the town 
 of aarhuus they were the gracious lady gyldenlowe marie grubbe and her maid they came from the town of weile whither they had come in a ship from copenhagen they stopped at lord stone mansion in aarhuus grubbe was not well pleased with this visit marie was accosted in hard words but she had a bedroom given her and got her beer soup of a morning but the evil part of her nature was aroused against her and she was not used to that she was not of a gentle temper and we often answer as we are addressed she answered openly and spoke with bitterness and hatred of her husband with whom she declared she would not live she was too honorable for that 
 
 a year went by but it did not go by pleasantly there were evil 
 words between the father and the daughter and that ought never to be 
 
 bad words bear bad fruit what could be the end of such a state of 
 things 
 
 we two cannot live under the same roof said the father one day 
 
 go away from here to our old manor house but you had better bite 
 your tongue off than spread any lies among the people 
 
 and so the two parted she went with her maid to the old castle 
 where she had been born and near which the gentle pious lady her 
 mother was lying in the church vault an old cowherd lived in the 
 courtyard and was the only other inhabitant of the place in the 
 rooms heavy black cobwebs hung down covered with dust in the 
 garden everything grew just as it would hops and climbing plants 
 ran like a net between the trees and bushes and the hemlock and 
 nettle grew larger and stronger the had been outgrown 
 by other trees and now stood in the shade and its leaves were 
 green like those of the common trees and its glory had departed 
 crows and choughs in great close masses flew past over the tall 
 chestnut trees and chattered and screamed as if they had something 
 very important to tell one another as if they were saying now 
 come back again the little girl who had their eggs and their young 
 ones stolen from them and as for the thief who had got them down 
 he had to climb up a leafless tree for he sat on a tall 
 mast and was beaten with a end if he did not behave himself 
 
 the clerk told all this in our own times he had collected it and looked it up in books and memoranda it was to be found with many other writings locked up in his 
 
 upward and downward is the course of the world said he it 
 is strange to hear 
 
 and we will hear how it went with marie grubbe we need not for 
 that forget poultry meg who is sitting in her capital in 
 our own time marie grubbe sat down in her times but not with the 
 same spirit that old poultry meg showed 
 
 the winter passed away and the spring and the summer passed away and the autumn came again with the damp cold it was a lonely desolate life in the old manor house marie grubbe took her gun in her hand and went out to the heath and shot hares and foxes and whatever birds she could hit more than once she met the noble sir palle dyre of norrebak who was also wandering about with his gun and his dogs he was tall and strong and boasted of this when they talked together he could have measured himself against the deceased mr brockenhuus of egeskov of whom the people still talked palle dyre had after the example of brockenhuus caused an iron chain with a to be hung in his gateway and when he came riding home he used to seize the chain and lift himself and his horse from the ground and blow the horn 
 
 come yourself and see me do that dame marie he said one can breathe fresh and free at norrebak 
 
 when she went to his castle is not known but on the altar 
 candlestick in the church of norrebak it was inscribed that they 
 were the gift of palle dyre and marie grubbe of norrebak castle 
 a great stout man was palle dyre he drank like a sponge he was 
 like a tub that could never get full he snored like a whole sty of 
 pigs and he looked red and bloated 
 
 he is treacherous and malicious said dame pally dyre 
 daughter soon she was weary of her life with him but that 
 did not make it better 
 
 one day the table was spread and the dishes grew cold palle dyre 
 was out hunting foxes and the gracious lady was nowhere to be 
 found towards midnight palle dyre came home but dame dyre came neither at midnight nor next morning she had turned her back upon norrebak and had ridden away without saying 
 
 it was gray wet weather the wind grew cold and a flight of 
 black screaming birds flew over her head they were not so homeless as she 
 
 first she journeyed southward quite down into the german land 
 a couple of golden rings with costly stones were turned into money 
 and then she turned to the east and then she turned again and went 
 towards the west she had no food before her eyes and murmured 
 against everything even against the good god himself so wretched was her soul soon her body became wretched too and she was scarcely able to move a foot the peewit flew up as she stumbled over the mound of earth where it had built its nest the bird cried as it always cried you thief you thief she had never stolen her goods but as a little girl she had caused eggs and young birds to be taken from the trees and she thought of that now 
 
 from where she lay she could see the by the seashore 
 lived fishermen but she could not get so far she was so ill the 
 great white flew over her head and screamed as the crows and daws screamed at home in the garden of the manor house the birds flew quite close to her and at last it seemed to her as if they became black as crows and then all was night before her eyes 
 
 when she opened her eyes again she was being lifted and 
 carried a great strong man had taken her up in his arms and she 
 was looking straight into his bearded face he had a scar over one 
 eye which seemed to divide the eyebrow into two parts weak as she 
 was he carried her to the ship where he got a rating for it from the 
 captain 
 
 the next day the ship sailed away madame grubbe had not been 
 put ashore so she sailed away with it but she will return will 
 she not yes but where and when 
 
 the clerk could tell about this too and it was not a story 
 which he patched together himself he had the whole strange history 
 out of an old authentic book which we ourselves can take out and 
 read the danish historian ludwig holberg who has written so many useful books and merry comedies from which we can get such a good idea of his times and their people tells in his letters of marie 
 grubbe where and how he met her it is well worth hearing but for 
 all that we at all forget poultry meg who is sitting 
 cheerful and comfortable in the charming 
 
 the ship sailed away with marie grubbe where we left off 
 long years went by 
 
 the plague was raging at copenhagen it was in the year 
 the queen of denmark went away to her german home the king quitted the capital and everybody who could do so hurried away 
 the students even those who had board and lodging gratis left the city one of these students the last who had remained in the free college at last went away too it was two in the morning he was carrying his knapsack which was better stacked with books and writings than with clothes a damp mist hung over the town not a person was to be seen in the streets the around were marked with crosses as a sign that the plague was within or that all the inmates were dead a great wagon rattled past him the coachman brandished his whip and the horses flew by at a gallop the wagon was filled with corpses the young student kept his hand before his face and smelt at some strong spirits that he had with him on a sponge in a little brass out of a small tavern in one of the streets there were sounds of singing and of unhallowed laughter from people who drank the night through to forget that the plague was at their doors and that they might be put into the wagon as the others had been the student turned his steps towards the canal at the castle bridge where a couple of small ships were lying one of these was weighing anchor to get away from the city 
 
 if god spares our lives and grants us a fair wind we are going 
 to gronmud near falster said the captain and he asked the name 
 of the student who wished to go with him 
 
 ludwig holberg answered the student and the name sounded 
 like any other but now there sounds in it one of the proudest names 
 of denmark then it was the name of a young unknown student 
 the ship glided past the castle it was not yet bright day when it 
 was in the open sea a light wind filled the sails and the young 
 student sat down with his face turned towards the fresh wind and went to sleep which was not exactly the most prudent thing he could have done 
 
 already on the third day the ship lay by the island of falster 
 
 do you know any one here with whom i could lodge cheaply 
 holberg asked the captain 
 
 i should think you would do well to go to the in 
 borrehaus answered the captain if you want to be very civil to 
 her her name is mother soren sorensen muller but it may happen 
 that she may fly into a fury if you are too polite to her the man 
 is in custody for a crime and why she manages the 
 herself she has fists of her own 
 
 the student took his knapsack and betook himself to the 
 the house door was not locked it opened and he went 
 into a room with a brick floor where a bench with a great coverlet 
 of leather formed the chief article of furniture a white hen who 
 had a brood of chickens was fastened to the bench and had overturned the pipkin of water so that the wet ran across the floor 
 there were no people either here or in the adjoining room only a cradle stood there in which was a child the came back with only one person in it whether that person was a man or a woman was not an easy matter to determine the person in question was wrapped in a great cloak and wore a kind of hood presently the boat lay to 
 
 it was a woman who got out of it and came into the room she 
 looked very stately when she straightened her back two proud eyes 
 looked forth from beneath her black eyebrows it was mother soren the the crows and daws might have called out another name for her which we know better 
 
 she looked morose and did not seem to care to talk but this much 
 was settled that the student should board in her house for an 
 indefinite time while things looked so bad in copenhagen 
 
 this or that honest citizen would often come to the 
 from the neighboring little town there came frank the cutler and 
 sivert the exciseman they drank a mug of beer in the and used to converse with the student for he was a clever young man who knew his practica as they called it he could read greek and latin and was well up in learned subjects 
 
 the less one knows the less it presses upon one said mother 
 soren 
 
 you have to work hard said holberg one day when she was 
 dipping clothes in the strong soapy water and was obliged herself 
 to split the logs for the fire 
 
 my affair she replied 
 
 have you been obliged to toil in this way from your childhood 
 you can read that from my hands she replied and held out her 
 hands that were small indeed but hard and strong with bitten nails 
 you are learned and can read 
 
 at it began to snow heavily the cold came on 
 the wind blue sharp as if there were vitriol in it to wash the 
 faces mother soren did not let that disturb her she threw 
 her cloak around her and drew her hood over her head early in the 
 afternoon it was already dark in the house she laid wood and turf on 
 the hearth and then she sat down to darn her stockings for there was 
 no one to do it for her towards evening she spoke more words to the student than it was customary with her to use she spoke of her 
 husband 
 
 he killed a sailor of dragor by mischance and for that he has to 
 work for three years in irons only a common sailor and 
 therefore the law must take its course 
 
 the law is there for people of high rank too said holberg 
 do you think so said mother soren then she looked into the 
 fire for a while but after a time she began to speak again have you 
 heard of kai lykke who caused a church to be pulled down and when the clergyman master martin thundered from the pulpit about it he had him put in irons and sat in judgment upon him and condemned him to death yes and the clergyman was obliged to bow his head to the stroke and yet kai lykke went 
 
 he had a right to do as he did in those times said holberg 
 
 but now we have left those times behind us 
 
 you may get a fool to believe that cried mother soren and 
 she got up and went into the room where the child lay she lifted up 
 the child and laid it down more comfortably then she arranged the 
 of the student he had the green coverlet for he felt the 
 cold more than she though he was born in norway 
 
 on new morning it was a bright sunshiny day the frost 
 had been so strong and was still so strong that the fallen snow 
 had become a hard mass and one could walk upon it the bells of the little town were tolling for church student holberg wrapped himself up in his woollen cloak and wanted to go to the town 
 
 over the the crows and daws were flying with loud 
 cries one could hardly hear the church bells for their screaming 
 mother soren stood in front of the house filling a brass pot with 
 snow which she was going to put on the fire to get drinking water 
 she looked up to the crowd of birds and thought her own thoughts 
 student holberg went to church on his way there and on his return 
 he passed by the house of sivert by the here 
 he was invited to take a mug of brown beer with treacle and sugar 
 the discourse fell upon mother soren but the tax collector did not know much about her and indeed few knew much about her she did not belong to the island of falster he said she had a little property of her own at one time her husband was a common sailor a fellow of a very hot temper and had killed a sailor of dragor and he beat his wife and yet she defended him 
 
 i should not endure such treatment said the 
 wife i am come of more respectable people my father was 
 to the court 
 
 and consequently you have married a governmental official 
 said holberg and made a bow to her and to the collector 
 it was on twelfth night the evening of the festival of the 
 three kings mother soren lit up for holberg a candle that 
 is a tallow candle with three wicks which she had herself prepared 
 
 a light for each man said holberg 
 
 for each man repeated the woman looking sharply at him 
 
 for each of the wise men from the east said holberg 
 
 you mean it that way said she and then she was silent for a 
 long time but on this evening he learned more about her than he had 
 yet known 
 
 you speak very affectionately of your husband observed holberg 
 
 and yet the people say that he you every day 
 
 no business but mine she replied the blows might 
 have done me good when i was a child now i suppose i get them for my sins but i know what good he has done me and she rose up when i lay sick upon the desolate heath and no one would have pity on me and no one would have anything to do with me except the crows and daws which came to peck me to bits he carried me in his arms and had to bear hard words because of the burden he brought on board ship not in my nature to be sick and so i got well every man has his own way and soren has his but the horse must not be judged by the halter taking one thing with another i have lived more agreeably with him than with the man whom they called the most noble and gallant of the subjects i have had the stadtholder gyldenlowe the for my husband and afterwards i took palle dyre one is as good as another each in his own way and i in mine that was a long gossip but now you know all about me 
 
 and with those words she left the room 
 it was marie grubbe so strangely had fate played with her she 
 did not live to see many anniversaries of the festival of the three 
 kings holberg has recorded that she died in june but he has 
 not written down for he did not know that a number of great black 
 birds circled over the when mother soren as she was 
 called was lying there a corpse they did not scream as if they knew 
 that at a burial silence should be observed so soon as she lay in the 
 earth the birds disappeared but on the same evening in jutland at 
 the old manor house an enormous number of crows and choughs were seen they all cried as loud as they could as if they had some 
 announcement to make perhaps they talked of him who as a little boy had taken away their eggs and their young of the son who had to wear an iron garter and of the noble young lady who ended by being a wife 
 
 brave brave they cried 
 
 and the whole family cried brave brave when the old house was 
 pulled down 
 
 they are still crying and yet nothing to cry about 
 said the clerk when he told the story the family is extinct the 
 house has been pulled down and where it stood is now the stately 
 with gilded weathercocks and the old poultry meg 
 she rejoices greatly in her beautiful dwelling if she had not come 
 here the old clerk added she would have had to go into the 
 
 
 the pigeons cooed over her the gobbled and the 
 ducks quacked 
 
 nobody knew her they said she belongs to no family pure 
 charity that she is here at all she has neither a drake father nor 
 a hen mother and has no descendants 
 
 she came of a great family for all that but she did not know it 
 and the old clerk did not know it though he had so much written down but one of the old crows knew about it and told about it she had heard from her own mother and grandmother about poultry mother and grandmother and we know the grandmother too we saw her ride as child over the bridge looking proudly around her as if the whole world belonged to her and all the birds nests in it and we saw her on the heath by the and last of all in the the granddaughter the last of her race had come back to the old home where the old castle had stood where the black wild birds were screaming but she sat among the tame birds and these knew her and were fond of her poultry meg had nothing left to wish for she looked forward with pleasure to her death and she was old enough to die 
 
 grave grave cried the crows 
 
 and poultry meg has a good grave which nobody knew except the old crow if the old crow is not dead already 
 
 and now we know the story of the old manor house of its old 
 proprietors and of all poultry family

 recruits 
 the band augmented every moment 
 near the rue des billettes a man of lofty stature whose hair was turning gray and whose bold and daring mien was remarked by courfeyrac enjolras and combeferre but whom none of them knew joined them 
 gavroche who was occupied in singing whistling humming running on ahead and pounding on the shutters of the shops with the butt of his triggerless pistol paid no attention to this man 
 it chanced that in the rue de la verrerie they passed in front of door 
 this happens just right said courfeyrac i have forgotten my purse and i have lost my hat 
 he quitted the mob and ran up to his quarters at full speed he seized an old hat and his purse 
 he also seized a large square coffer of the dimensions of a large valise which was concealed under his soiled linen 
 as he descended again at a run the portress hailed him 
 monsieur de courfeyrac 
 your name portress 
 the portress stood bewildered 
 why you know perfectly well the concierge my name is mother veuvain 
 well if you call me monsieur de courfeyrac again i shall call you mother de veuvain 
 now speak the matter 
 what do you want 
 there is some one who wants to speak with you 
 who is it 
 i know 
 where is he 
 in my lodge 
 the devil ejaculated courfeyrac 
 but the person has been waiting your return for over an hour said the portress 
 at the same time a sort of pale thin small freckled and youthful artisan clad in a tattered blouse and patched trousers of ribbed velvet and who had rather the air of a girl accoutred as a man than of a man emerged from the lodge and said to courfeyrac in a voice which was not the least in the world like a voice 
 monsieur marius if you please 
 he is not here 
 will he return this evening 
 i know nothing about it 
 and courfeyrac added 
 for my part i shall not return 
 the young man gazed steadily at him and said 
 why not 
 because 
 where are you going then 
 what business is that of yours 
 would you like to have me carry your coffer for you 
 i am going to the barricades 
 would you like to have me go with you 
 if you like replied courfeyrac 
 the street is free the pavements belong to every one 
 and he made his escape at a run to join his friends 
 when he had rejoined them he gave the coffer to one of them to carry it was only a quarter of an hour after this that he saw the young man who had actually followed them 
 a mob does not go precisely where it intends 
 we have explained that a gust of wind carries it away 
 they overshot and found themselves without precisely knowing how in the rue

 mind cannot grasp the causes of events in their completeness but the desire to find those causes is implanted in soul and without considering the multiplicity and complexity of the conditions any one of which taken separately may seem to be the cause he snatches at the first approximation to a cause that seems to him intelligible and says this is the cause in historical events where the actions of men are the subject of observation the first and most primitive approximation to present itself was the will of the gods and after that the will of those who stood in the most prominent position the heroes of history but we need only penetrate to the essence of any historic event which lies in the activity of the general mass of men who take part in it to be convinced that the will of the historic hero does not control the actions of the mass but is itself continually controlled it may seem to be a matter of indifference whether we understand the meaning of historical events this way or that yet there is the same difference between a man who says that the people of the west moved on the east because napoleon wished it and a man who says that this happened because it had to happen as there is between those who declared that the earth was stationary and that the planets moved round it and those who admitted that they did not know what upheld the earth but knew there were laws directing its movement and that of the other planets there is and can be no cause of an historical event except the one cause of all causes but there are laws directing events and some of these laws are known to us while we are conscious of others we cannot comprehend the discovery of these laws is only possible when possible when we have quite abandoned the attempt to find the cause in the will of some one man just as the discovery of the laws of the motion of the planets was possible only when men abandoned the conception of the fixity of the earth 
 the historians consider that next to the battle of borodino and the occupation of moscow by the enemy and its destruction by fire the most important episode of the war of was the movement of the russian army from the ryazana to the kaluga road and to the tarutino camp the flank march across the krasnaya pakhra river they ascribe the glory of that achievement of genius to different men and dispute as to whom the honor is due even foreign historians including the french acknowledge the genius of the russian commanders when they speak of that flank march but it is hard to understand why military writers and following them others consider this flank march to be the profound conception of some one man who saved russia and destroyed napoleon in the first place it is hard to understand where the profundity and genius of this movement lay for not much mental effort was needed to see that the best position for an army when it is not being attacked is where there are most provisions and even a dull boy of thirteen could have guessed that the best position for an army after its retreat from moscow in was on the kaluga road so it is impossible to understand by what reasoning the historians reach the conclusion that this maneuver was a profound one and it is even more difficult to understand just why they think that this maneuver was calculated to save russia and destroy the french for this flank march had it been preceded accompanied or followed by other circumstances might have proved ruinous to the russians and salutary for the french if the position of the russian army really began to improve from the time of that march it does not at all follow that the march was the cause of it 
 that flank march might not only have failed to give any advantage to the russian army but might in other circumstances have led to its destruction what would have happened had moscow not burned down if murat had not lost sight of the russians if napoleon had not remained inactive if the russian army at krasnaya pakhra had given battle as bennigsen and barclay advised what would have happened had the french attacked the russians while they were marching beyond the pakhra what would have happened if on approaching tarutino napoleon had attacked the russians with but a tenth of the energy he had shown when he attacked them at smolensk what would have happened had the french moved on petersburg in any of these eventualities the flank march that brought salvation might have proved disastrous 
 the third and most incomprehensible thing is that people studying history deliberately avoid seeing that this flank march cannot be attributed to any one man that no one ever foresaw it and that in reality like the retreat from fili it did not suggest itself to anyone in its entirety but resulted moment by moment step by step event by event from an endless number of most diverse circumstances and was only seen in its entirety when it had been accomplished and belonged to the past 
 at the council at fili the prevailing thought in the minds of the russian commanders was the one naturally suggesting itself namely a direct retreat by the nizhni road in proof of this there is the fact that the majority of the council voted for such a retreat and above all there is the conversation after the council between the commander in chief and lanskoy who was in charge of the commissariat department lanskoy informed the commander in chief that the army supplies were for the most part stored along the oka in the tula and ryazan provinces and that if they retreated on nizhni the army would be separated from its supplies by the broad river oka which cannot be crossed early in winter this was the first indication of the necessity of deviating from what had previously seemed the most natural course a direct retreat on the army turned more to the south along the ryazan road and nearer to its supplies subsequently the in activity of the french who even lost sight of the russian army concern for the safety of the arsenal at tula and especially the advantages of drawing nearer to its supplies caused the army to turn still further south to the tula road having crossed over by a forced march to the tula road beyond the pakhra the russian commanders intended to remain at podolsk and had no thought of the tarutino position but innumerable circumstances and the reappearance of french troops who had for a time lost touch with the russians and projects of giving battle and above all the abundance of provisions in kaluga province obliged our army to turn still more to the south and to cross from the tula to the kaluga road and go to tarutino which was between the roads along which those supplies lay just as it is impossible to say when it was decided to abandon moscow so it is impossible to say precisely when or by whom it was decided to move to tarutino only when the army had got there as the result of innumerable and varying forces did people begin to assure themselves that they had desired this movement and long ago foreseen its result

 history of corinthe from its foundation 
 the parisians who nowadays on entering on the rue rambuteau at the end near the halles notice on their right opposite the rue mondetour a shop having for its sign a basket in the form of napoleon the great with this inscription 
 napoleon is made wholly of willow 
 have no suspicion of the terrible scenes which this very spot witnessed hardly thirty years ago 
 it was there that lay the rue de la chanvrerie which ancient deeds spell chanverrerie and the celebrated called corinthe 
 the reader will remember all that has been said about the barricade effected at this point and eclipsed by the way by the barricade it was on this famous barricade of the rue de la chanvrerie now fallen into profound obscurity that we are about to shed a little light 
 may we be permitted to recur for the sake of clearness in the recital to the simple means which we have already employed in the case of waterloo 
 persons who wish to picture to themselves in a tolerably exact manner the constitution of the houses which stood at that epoch near the pointe at the northeast angle of the halles of paris where lies the embouchure of the rue rambuteau have only to imagine an n touching the rue with its summit and the halles with its base and whose two vertical bars should form the rue de la and the rue de la chanvrerie and whose transverse bar should be formed by the rue de la the old rue mondetour cut the three strokes of the n at the most crooked angles so that the labyrinthine confusion of these four streets sufficed to form on a space three fathoms square between the halles and the rue on the one hand and between the rue du cygne and the rue des precheurs on the other seven islands of houses oddly cut up of varying sizes placed crosswise and and barely separated like the blocks of stone in a dock by narrow crannies 
 we say narrow crannies and we can give no more just idea of those dark contracted alleys lined with buildings these buildings were so decrepit that in the rue de la chanvrerie and the rue de la the fronts were shored up with beams running from one house to another 
 the street was narrow and the gutter broad the pedestrian there walked on a pavement that was always wet skirting little stalls resembling cellars big posts encircled with iron hoops excessive heaps of refuse and gates armed with enormous gratings 
 the rue rambuteau has devastated all that 
 the name of mondetour paints marvellously well the sinuosities of that whole set of streets 
 a little further on they are found still better expressed by the rue pirouette which ran into the rue mondetour 
 the who got entangled from the rue in the rue de la chanvrerie beheld it gradually close in before him as though he had entered an elongated funnel 
 at the end of this street which was very short he found further passage barred in the direction of the halles by a tall row of houses and he would have thought himself in a blind alley had he not perceived on the right and left two dark cuts through which he could make his escape 
 this was the rue mondetour which on one side ran into the rue de precheurs and on the other into the rue du cygne and the at the bottom of this sort of at the angle of the cutting on the right there was to be seen a house which was not so tall as the rest and which formed a sort of cape in the street it is in this house of two stories only that an illustrious had been merrily installed three hundred years before this tavern created a joyous noise in the very spot which old theophilus described in the following couplet la branle le squelette horrible 
 pauvre amant qui se pendit 
 there swings the horrible skeleton of a poor lover who hung himself 
 the situation was good and succeeded each other there from father to son 
 in the time of mathurin regnier this cabaret was called the and as the rebus was then in fashion it had for its a post poteau painted in the last century the worthy natoire one of the fantastic masters nowadays despised by the stiff school having got drunk many times in this at the very table where regnier had drunk his fill had painted by way of gratitude a bunch of corinth grapes on the pink post the keeper of the cabaret in his joy had changed his device and had caused to be placed in gilt letters beneath the bunch these words at the bunch of corinth grapes au raisin de corinthe hence the name of corinthe 
 nothing is more natural to drunken men than ellipses the ellipsis is the of the phrase 
 corinthe gradually dethroned the the last proprietor of the dynasty father hucheloup no longer acquainted even with the tradition had the post painted blue 
 a room on the ground floor where the bar was situated one on the first floor containing a a wooden spiral staircase piercing the ceiling wine on the tables smoke on the walls candles in broad was the style of this cabaret a staircase with a in the lower room led to the cellar on the second floor were the lodgings of the hucheloup family they were reached by a staircase which was a ladder rather than a staircase and had for their entrance only a private door in the large room on the first floor 
 under the roof in two mansard attics were the nests for the servants 
 the kitchen shared the with the 
 father hucheloup had possibly been born a chemist but the fact is that he was a cook people did not confine themselves to drinking alone in his they also ate there 
 hucheloup had invented a capital thing which could be eaten nowhere but in his house stuffed carps which he called carpes au gras 
 these were eaten by the light of a tallow candle or of a lamp of the time of louis xvi on tables to which were nailed waxed cloths in lieu of people came thither from a distance 
 hucheloup one fine morning had seen fit to notify of this specialty he had dipped a brush in a pot of black paint and as he was an orthographer on his own account as well as a cook after his own fashion he had improvised on his wall this remarkable inscription 
 carpes ho gras 
 one winter the and the showers had taken a fancy to obliterate the s which terminated the first word and the g which began the third this is what ho ras 
 time and rain assisting a humble gastronomical announcement had become a profound piece of advice 
 in this way it came about that though he knew no french father hucheloup understood latin that he had evoked philosophy from his kitchen and that desirous simply of effacing lent he had equalled horace and the striking thing about it was that that also meant enter my 
 nothing of all this is in existence now 
 the mondetour labyrinth was disembowelled and widely opened in and probably no longer exists at the present moment 
 the rue de la chanvrerie and corinthe have disappeared beneath the pavement of the rue rambuteau 
 as we have already said corinthe was the if not the of courfeyrac and his friends 
 it was grantaire who had discovered corinthe 
 he had entered it on account of the carpe horas and had returned thither on account of the carpes au gras 
 there they drank there they ate there they shouted they did not pay much they paid badly they did not pay at all but they were always welcome 
 father hucheloup was a jovial host 
 hucheloup that amiable man as was just said was a with a mustache an amusing variety 
 he always had an air seemed to wish to intimidate his customers grumbled at the people who entered his establishment and had rather the mien of seeking a quarrel with them than of serving them with soup 
 and yet we insist upon the word people were always welcome there 
 this oddity had attracted customers to his shop and brought him young men who said to each other 
 come hear father hucheloup growl 
 he had been a all of a sudden he would burst out laughing a big voice a good fellow 
 he had a comic foundation under a tragic exterior he asked nothing better than to frighten you very much like those which are in the shape of a pistol the detonation makes one sneeze 
 mother hucheloup his wife was a bearded and a very homely creature 
 about father hucheloup died 
 with him disappeared the secret of stuffed carps 
 his inconsolable widow continued to keep the but the cooking deteriorated and became execrable the wine which had always been bad became fearfully bad nevertheless courfeyrac and his friends continued to go to corinthe out of pity as bossuet said 
 the widow hucheloup was breathless and misshapen and given to rustic recollections 
 she deprived them of their flatness by her pronunciation 
 she had a way of her own of saying things which spiced her reminiscences of the village and of her springtime it had formerly been her delight so she affirmed to hear the chanter dans les ogrepines hear the redbreasts sing in the 
 the hall on the first floor where the restaurant was situated was a large and long apartment encumbered with stools chairs benches and tables and with a crippled lame old it was reached by a spiral staircase which terminated in the corner of the room at a square hole like the hatchway of a ship 
 this room lighted by a single narrow window and by a lamp that was always burning had the air of a garret 
 all the furniture comported itself as though it had but three legs the whitewashed walls had for their only ornament the following quatrain in honor of mame etonne a dix pas elle epouvente a deux 
 une verrue habite en son nez hasardeux 
 on tremble a chaque instant ne vous la mouche 
 et beau jour son nez ne tombe dans sa bouche 
 she astounds at ten paces she frightens at two a wart inhabits her hazardous nose you tremble every instant lest she should blow it at you and lest some fine day her nose should tumble into her mouth 
 this was scrawled in charcoal on the wall 
 mame hucheloup a good likeness went and came from morning till night before this quatrain with the most perfect tranquillity two named matelote and gibelotte and who had never been known by any other names helped mame hucheloup to set on the tables the jugs of poor wine and the various broths which were served to the hungry patrons in earthenware bowls matelote large plump redhaired and noisy the favorite of the defunct hucheloup was homelier than any mythological monster be it what it may still as it becomes the servant to always keep in the rear of the mistress she was less homely than mame hucheloup 
 gibelotte tall delicate white with a lymphatic pallor with circles round her eyes and drooping lids always languid and weary afflicted with what may be called chronic lassitude the first up in the house and the last in bed waited on every one even the other maid silently and gently smiling through her fatigue with a vague and sleepy smile 
 matelote 
 a culinary preparation of various fishes gibelotte 
 stewed rabbits 
 before entering the restaurant room the visitor read on the door the following line written there in chalk by si tu peux et mange si tu 
 treat if you can and eat if you dare

 the famous flank movement merely consisted in this after the advance of the french had ceased the russian army which had been continually retreating straight back from the invaders deviated from that direct course and not finding itself pursued was naturally drawn toward the district where supplies were abundant 
 if instead of imagining to ourselves commanders of genius leading the russian army we picture that army without any leaders it could not have done anything but make a return movement toward moscow describing an arc in the direction where most provisions were to be found and where the country was richest 
 that movement from the nizhni to the ryazan tula and kaluga roads was so natural that even the russian marauders moved in that direction and demands were sent from petersburg for kutuzov to take his army that way at tarutino kutuzov received what was almost a reprimand from the emperor for having moved his army along the ryazan road and the letter indicated to him the very position he had already occupied near kaluga 
 having rolled like a ball in the direction of the impetus given by the whole campaign and by the battle of borodino the russian army when the strength of that impetus was exhausted and no fresh push was received assumed the position natural to it 
 merit lay not in any strategic maneuver of genius as it is called but in the fact that he alone understood the significance of what had happened he alone then understood the meaning of the french inactivity he alone continued to assert that the battle of borodino had been a victory he alone who as commander in chief might have been expected to be eager to attack employed his whole strength to restrain the russian army from useless engagements 
 the beast wounded at borodino was lying where the fleeing hunter had left him but whether he was still alive whether he was strong and merely lying low the hunter did not know suddenly the beast was heard to moan 
 the moan of that wounded beast the french army which betrayed its calamitous condition was the sending of lauriston to camp with overtures for peace 
 napoleon with his usual assurance that whatever entered his head was right wrote to kutuzov the first words that occurred to him though they were meaningless 
 monsieur le prince koutouzov i am sending one of my to discuss several interesting questions with you i beg your highness to credit what he says to you especially when he expresses the sentiment of esteem and special regard i have long entertained for your person this letter having no other object i pray god monsieur le prince koutouzov to keep you in his holy and gracious protection 
 napoleon 
 moscow october 
 kutuzov replied i should be cursed by posterity were i looked on as the initiator of a settlement of any sort such is the present spirit of my nation but he continued to exert all his powers to restrain his troops from attacking 
 during the month that the french troops were pillaging in moscow and the russian troops were quietly encamped at tarutino a change had taken place in the relative strength of the two armies both in spirit and in number as a result of which the superiority had passed to the russian side though the condition and numbers of the french army were unknown to the russians as soon as that change occurred the need of attacking at once showed itself by countless signs these signs were mission the abundance of provisions at tarutino the reports coming in from all sides of the inactivity and disorder of the french the flow of recruits to our regiments the fine weather the long rest the russian soldiers had enjoyed and the impatience to do what they had been assembled for which usually shows itself in an army that has been resting curiosity as to what the french army so long lost sight of was doing the boldness with which our outposts now scouted close up to the french stationed at tarutino the news of easy successes gained by peasants and guerrilla troops over the french the envy aroused by this the desire for revenge that lay in the heart of every russian as long as the french were in moscow and above all a dim consciousness in every mind that the relative strength of the armies had changed and that the advantage was now on our side there was a substantial change in the relative strength and an advance had become inevitable and at once as a clock begins to strike and chime as soon as the minute hand has completed a full circle this change was shown by an increased activity whirring and chiming in the higher spheres

 preliminary gayeties 
 laigle de meaux as the reader knows lived more with joly than elsewhere 
 he had a lodging as a bird has one on a branch the two friends lived together ate together slept together they had everything in common even musichetta to some extent they were what the subordinate monks who accompany monks are called bini 
 on the morning of the th of june they went to corinthe to breakfast 
 joly who was all stuffed up had a catarrh which laigle was beginning to share 
 coat was threadbare but joly was well dressed 
 it was about nine in the morning when they opened the door of corinthe 
 they ascended to the first floor 
 matelote and gibelotte received them 
 oysters cheese and ham said laigle 
 and they seated themselves at a table 
 the was empty there was no one there but themselves 
 gibelotte knowing joly and laigle set a bottle of wine on the table 
 while they were busy with their first oysters a head appeared at the hatchway of the staircase and a voice said 
 i am passing by 
 i smell from the street a delicious odor of brie cheese 
 i enter 
 it was grantaire 
 grantaire took a stool and drew up to the table 
 at the sight of grantaire gibelotte placed two bottles of wine on the table 
 that made three 
 are you going to drink those two bottles 
 laigle inquired of grantaire 
 grantaire replied 
 all are ingenious thou alone art ingenuous 
 two bottles never yet astonished a man 
 the others had begun by eating grantaire began by drinking half a bottle was rapidly gulped down 
 so you have a hole in your stomach began laigle again 
 you have one in your elbow said grantaire 
 and after having emptied his glass he added 
 ah by the way laigle of the funeral oration your coat is old 
 i should hope so retorted laigle 
 why we get on well together my coat and i it has acquired all my folds it does not bind me anywhere it is moulded on my deformities it falls in with all my movements i am only conscious of it because it keeps me warm 
 old coats are just like old friends 
 true ejaculated joly striking into the dialogue an old goat is an old abi ami friend 
 especially in the mouth of a man whose head is stuffed up said grantaire 
 grantaire demanded laigle have you just come from the boulevard 
 no 
 we have just seen the head of the procession pass joly and i 
 a marvellous sight said joly 
 how quiet this street is exclaimed laigle 
 who would suspect that paris was turned upside down 
 how plainly it is to be seen that in former days there were nothing but convents here in this neighborhood 
 du breul and sauval give a list of them and so does the abbe lebeuf 
 they were all round here they fairly swarmed booted and barefooted shaven bearded gray black white franciscans minims capuchins carmelites little augustines great augustines old was no end of them 
 talk of monks interrupted grantaire it makes one want to scratch self 
 then he exclaimed 
 bouh 
 just swallowed a bad oyster 
 now hypochondria is taking possession of me again 
 the oysters are spoiled the servants are ugly i hate the human race 
 i just passed through the rue richelieu in front of the big public library 
 that pile of which is called a library is disgusting even to think of 
 what paper what ink 
 what scrawling 
 and all that has been written 
 what rascal was it who said that man was a featherless biped and then i met a pretty girl of my acquaintance who is as beautiful as the spring worthy to be called floreal and who is delighted enraptured as happy as the angels because a wretch yesterday a frightful banker all spotted with deigned to take a fancy to her alas woman keeps on the watch for a protector as much as for a lover cats chase mice as well as birds 
 two months ago that young woman was virtuous in an attic she adjusted little brass rings in the of corsets what do you call it 
 she sewed she had a camp bed she dwelt beside a pot of flowers she was contented now here she is a bankeress 
 this transformation took place last night i met the victim this morning in high spirits 
 the hideous point about it is that the jade is as pretty as she was yesterday her financier did not show in her face 
 roses have this advantage or disadvantage over women that the traces left upon them by caterpillars are visible 
 ah there is no morality on earth i call to witness the myrtle the symbol of love the laurel the symbol of air the olive that ninny the symbol of peace the which came nearest rangling adam with its pips and the the grandfather of petticoats 
 as for right do you know what right is 
 the gauls covet clusium rome protects clusium and demands what wrong clusium has done to them 
 brennus answers the wrong that alba did to you the wrong that fidenae did to you the wrong that the eques the volsci and the sabines have done to you 
 they were your neighbors 
 the clusians are ours we understand neighborliness just as you do 
 you have stolen alba we shall take clusium 
 rome said 
 you shall not take clusium brennus took rome 
 then he cried 
 vae victis 
 that is what right is ah what beasts of prey there are in this world 
 what eagles it makes my flesh creep 
 bipede sans plume 
 biped without 
 he held out his glass to joly who filled it then he drank and went on having hardly been interrupted by this glass of wine of which no one not even himself had taken any notice 
 brennus who takes rome is an eagle the banker who takes the grisette is an eagle 
 there is no more modesty in the one case than in the other 
 so we believe in nothing 
 there is but one reality 
 drink 
 whatever your opinion may be in favor of the lean cock like the canton of uri or in favor of the fat cock like the canton of glaris it matters little drink 
 you talk to me of the boulevard of that procession et caetera et caetera come now is there going to be another revolution 
 this poverty of means on the part of the good god astounds me 
 he has to keep greasing the groove of events every moment 
 there is a hitch it work 
 quick a revolution 
 the good god has his hands perpetually black with that if i were in his place be perfectly simple about it i would not wind up my mechanism every minute lead the human race in a straightforward way weave matters mesh by mesh without breaking the thread i would have no provisional arrangements i would have no extraordinary repertory 
 what the rest of you call progress advances by means of two motors men and events 
 but sad to say from time to time the exceptional becomes necessary 
 the ordinary troupe suffices neither for event nor for men 
 among men geniuses are required among events revolutions 
 great accidents are the law the order of things cannot do without them and judging from the apparition of comets one would be tempted to think that heaven itself finds actors needed for its performance 
 at the moment when one expects it the least god placards a meteor on the wall of the firmament some queer star turns up underlined by an enormous tail and that causes the death of caesar 
 brutus deals him a blow with a knife and god a blow with a comet 
 crac and behold an aurora borealis behold a revolution behold a great man in big letters napoleon on guard the comet of at the head of the poster 
 ah what a beautiful blue theatre all studded with unexpected flashes 
 boum 
 boum extraordinary show raise your eyes boobies 
 everything is in disorder the star as well as the drama 
 good god it is too much and not enough these resources gathered from exception seem magnificence and poverty my friends providence has come down to expedients 
 what does a revolution prove 
 that god is in a quandry 
 he effects a coup because he god has not been able to make both ends meet in fact this confirms me in my conjectures as to fortune and when i see so much distress in heaven and on earth from the bird who has not a grain of millet to myself without a hundred thousand livres of income when i see human destiny which is very badly worn and even royal destiny which is threadbare witness the prince de conde hung when i see winter which is nothing but a rent in the zenith through which the wind blows when i see so many rags even in the perfectly new purple of the morning on the crests of hills when i see the drops of dew those mock pearls when i see the frost that paste when i see humanity ripped apart and events patched up and so many spots on the sun and so many holes in the moon when i see so much misery everywhere i suspect that god is not rich the appearance exists it is true but i feel that he is hard up he gives a revolution as a tradesman whose is empty gives a ball 
 god must not be judged from appearances beneath the gilding of heaven i perceive a universe creation is bankrupt 
 that is why i am discontented 
 here it is the th of june it is almost night ever since this morning i have been waiting for daylight to come it has not come and i bet that it come all day 
 this is the inexactness of an clerk 
 yes everything is badly arranged nothing fits anything else this old world is all warped i take my stand on the opposition everything goes awry the universe is a tease like children those who want them have none and those who want them have them 
 total 
 vexed 
 besides laigle de meaux that offends my sight 
 it humiliates me to think that i am of the same age as that baldy 
 however i criticise but i do not insult 
 the universe is what it is 
 i speak here without evil intent and to ease my conscience 
 receive eternal father the assurance of my distinguished consideration 
 ah by all the saints of olympus and by all the gods of paradise i was not intended to be a parisian that is to say to rebound forever like a shuttlecock between two battledores from the group of the loungers to the group of the roysterers 
 i was made to be a turk watching oriental houris all day long executing those exquisite egyptian dances as sensuous as the dream of a chaste man or a beauceron peasant or a venetian gentleman surrounded by gentlewoman or a petty german prince furnishing the half of a to the germanic confederation and occupying his leisure with drying his breeches on his hedge that is to say his frontier those are the positions for which i was born 
 yes i have said a turk and i will not retract 
 i do not understand how people can habitually take turks in bad part mohammed had his good points respect for the inventor of seraglios with houris and paradises with odalisques 
 let us not insult mohammedanism the only religion which is ornamented with a now i insist on a drink the earth is a great piece of stupidity 
 and it appears that they are going to fight all those imbeciles and to break each profiles and to massacre each other in the heart of summer in the month of june when they might go off with a creature on their arm to breathe the immense heaps of hay in the meadows really people do commit altogether too many follies 
 an old broken lantern which i have just seen at a suggests a reflection to my mind it is time to enlighten the human race yes behold me sad again 
 what comes of swallowing an oyster and a revolution the wrong way 
 i am growing melancholy once more 
 oh frightful old world 
 people strive turn each other out prostitute themselves kill each other and get used to it 
 and grantaire after this fit of eloquence had a fit of coughing which was well earned 
 a propos of revolution said joly it is decidedly abberent that barius is in lub 
 does any one know with whom demanded laigle 
 do 
 no 
 do 
 i tell you 
 marius love affairs exclaimed grantaire 
 i can imagine it marius is a fog and he must have found a vapor 
 marius is of the race of poets 
 he who says poet says fool madman tymbraeus apollo marius and his marie or his marion or his maria or his mariette they must make a queer pair of lovers 
 i know just what it is like ecstasies in which they forget to kiss 
 pure on earth but joined in heaven 
 they are souls possessed of senses 
 they lie among the stars 
 grantaire was attacking his second bottle and possibly his second harangue when a new personage emerged from the square aperture of the stairs 
 it was a boy less than ten years of age ragged very small yellow with an odd phiz a vivacious eye an enormous amount of hair drenched with rain and wearing a contented air 
 the child unhesitatingly making his choice among the three addressed himself to laigle de meaux 
 are you monsieur bossuet 
 that is my nickname replied laigle 
 what do you want with me 
 this 
 a tall blonde fellow on the boulevard said to me do you know mother hucheloup 
 i said 
 yes rue chanvrerie the old widow he said to me 
 go there 
 there you will find m bossuet 
 tell him from me 
 a b c a joke that playing on you it 
 he gave me ten sous 
 joly lend me ten sous said laigle and turning to grantaire grantaire lend me ten sous 
 this made twenty sous which laigle handed to the lad 
 thank you sir said the urchin 
 what is your name inquired laigle 
 navet friend 
 stay with us said laigle 
 breakfast with us said grantaire 
 the child replied 
 i i belong in the procession the one to shout down with polignac 
 and executing a prolonged scrape of his foot behind him which is the most respectful of all possible salutes he took his departure 
 the child gone grantaire took the word 
 that is the gamin 
 there are a great many varieties of the gamin species 
 the gamin is called the gamin is called a scullion the gamin is called a mitron the gamin is called a groom the marine gamin is called the the gamin is called the the gamin is called the gamin is called an the courtesan gamin is called the minion the kingly gamin is called the dauphin the god gamin is called the bambino 
 in the meantime laigle was engaged in reflection he said half aloud 
 a b c that is to say 
 the burial of lamarque 
 the tall blonde remarked grantaire is enjolras who is sending you a warning 
 shall we go ejaculated bossuet 
 raiding said joly 
 i have sworn to go through fire but not through water 
 i wand to ged a gold 
 i shall stay here said grantaire 
 i prefer a breakfast to a hearse 
 conclusion 
 we remain said laigle 
 well then let us drink besides we might miss the funeral without missing the riot 
 ah the riot i am with you cried joly 
 laigle rubbed his hands 
 now going to touch up the revolution of 
 as a matter of fact it does hurt the people along the seams 
 i think much of your revolution said grantaire 
 i execrate this government 
 it is the crown tempered by the cotton it is a sceptre ending in an umbrella 
 in fact i think that with the present weather louis philippe might utilize his royalty in two directions he might extend the tip of the sceptre end against the people and open the umbrella end against heaven 
 the room was dark large clouds had just finished the extinction of daylight 
 there was no one in the or in the street every one having gone off to watch events 
 is it or midnight cried bossuet 
 you see your hand before your face 
 gibelotte fetch a light 
 grantaire was drinking in a melancholy way 
 enjolras disdains me he muttered 
 enjolras said 
 joly is ill grantaire is drunk 
 it was to bossuet that he sent navet if he had come for me i would have followed him 
 so much the worse for enjolras 
 i go to his funeral 
 this resolution once arrived at bossuet joly and grantaire did not stir from the by two in the afternoon the table at which they sat was covered with empty bottles two candles were burning on it one in a flat copper candlestick which was perfectly green the other in the neck of a cracked carafe grantaire had seduced joly and bossuet to wine bossuet and joly had conducted grantaire back towards cheerfulness 
 as for grantaire he had got beyond wine that merely moderate inspirer of dreams ever since wine enjoys only a conventional popularity with serious drinkers 
 there is in fact in the matter of inebriety white magic and black magic wine is only white magic grantaire was a daring drinker of dreams 
 the blackness of a terrible fit of drunkenness yawning before him far from arresting him attracted him 
 he had abandoned the bottle and taken to the beerglass the is the abyss 
 having neither opium nor hashish on hand and being desirous of filling his brain with twilight he had had recourse to that fearful mixture of brandy stout absinthe which produces the most terrible of lethargies 
 it is of these three vapors beer brandy and absinthe that the lead of the soul is composed 
 they are three grooms the celestial butterfly is drowned in them and there are formed there in a membranous smoke vaguely condensed into the wing of the bat three mute furies nightmare night and death which hover about the slumbering psyche 
 grantaire had not yet reached that lamentable phase far from it he was tremendously gay and bossuet and joly retorted they clinked glasses 
 grantaire added to the eccentric accentuation of words and ideas a peculiarity of gesture he rested his left fist on his knee with dignity his arm forming a right angle and with cravat untied seated astride a stool his full glass in his right hand he hurled solemn words at the big matelote 
 let the doors of the palace be thrown open 
 let every one be a member of the french academy and have the right to embrace madame hucheloup let us drink 
 and turning to madame hucheloup he added 
 woman ancient and consecrated by use draw near that i may contemplate thee 
 and joly exclaimed 
 matelote and gibelotte gib grantaire anything more to drink he has already devoured since this bording in wild prodigality two francs and centibes 
 and grantaire began again 
 who has been unhooking the stars without my permission and putting them on the table in the guise of candles 
 bossuet though very drunk preserved his equanimity 
 he was seated on the sill of the open window wetting his back in the falling rain and gazing at his two friends 
 all at once he heard a tumult behind him hurried footsteps cries of to arms 
 he turned round and saw in the rue at the end of the rue de la chanvrerie enjolras passing gun in hand and gavroche with his pistol feuilly with his sword courfeyrac with his sword and jean prouvaire with his blunderbuss combeferre with his gun bahorel with his gun and the whole armed and stormy rabble which was following them 
 the rue de la chanvrerie was not more than a gunshot long bossuet improvised a from his two hands placed around his mouth and shouted 
 courfeyrac 
 courfeyrac 
 hohee 
 courfeyrac heard the shout caught sight of bossuet and advanced a few paces into the rue de la chanvrerie shouting 
 what do you want which crossed a where are you going 
 to make a barricade replied courfeyrac 
 well here 
 this is a good place 
 make it here 
 true aigle said courfeyrac 
 and at a signal from courfeyrac the mob flung themselves into the rue de la chanvrerie

 chapter iii 
 
 the russian army was commanded by kutuzov and his staff and also by the emperor from petersburg before the news of the abandonment of moscow had been received in petersburg a detailed plan of the whole campaign had been drawn up and sent to kutuzov for his guidance though this plan had been drawn up on the supposition that moscow was still in our hands it was approved by the staff and accepted as a basis for action kutuzov only replied that movements arranged from a distance were always difficult to execute so fresh instructions were sent for the solution of difficulties that might be encountered as well as fresh people who were to watch actions and report upon them 
 besides this the whole staff of the russian army was now reorganized the posts left vacant by bagration who had been killed and by barclay who had gone away in dudgeon had to be filled very serious consideration was given to the question whether it would be better to put a in place and b in or on the contrary to put d in place and so on as if anything more than or satisfaction depended on this 
 as a result of the hostility between kutuzov and bennigsen his chief of staff the presence of confidential representatives of the emperor and these transfers a more than usually complicated play of parties was going on among the staff of the army a was undermining b d was undermining c and so on in all possible combinations and permutations in all these plottings the subject of intrigue was generally the conduct of the war which all these men believed they were directing but this affair of the war went on independently of them as it had to go that is never in the way people devised but flowing always from the essential attitude of the masses only in the highest spheres did all these schemes crossings and interminglings appear to be a true reflection of what had to happen 
 prince michael ilarionovich wrote the emperor on the second of october in a letter that reached kutuzov after the battle at tarutino since september moscow has been in the hands of the enemy your last reports were written on the twentieth and during all this time not only has no action been taken against the enemy or for the relief of the ancient capital but according to your last report you have even retreated farther serpukhov is already occupied by an enemy detachment and tula with its famous arsenal so indispensable to the army is in danger from general reports i see that an enemy corps of ten thousand men is moving on the petersburg road another corps of several thousand men is moving on dmitrov a third has advanced along the vladimir road and a fourth rather considerable detachment is stationed between ruza and mozhaysk napoleon himself was in moscow as late as the in view of all this information when the enemy has scattered his forces in large detachments and with napoleon and his guards in moscow is it possible that the forces confronting you are so considerable as not to allow of your taking the offensive on the contrary he is probably pursuing you with detachments or at most with an army corps much weaker than the army entrusted to you it would seem that availing yourself of these circumstances you might advantageously attack a weaker one and annihilate him or at least oblige him to retreat retaining in our hands an important part of the provinces now occupied by the enemy and thereby averting danger from tula and other towns in the interior you will be responsible if the enemy is able to direct a force of any size against petersburg to threaten this capital in which it has not been possible to retain many troops for with the army entrusted to you and acting with resolution and energy you have ample means to avert this fresh calamity remember that you have still to answer to our offended country for the loss of moscow you have experienced my readiness to reward you that readiness will not weaken in me but i and russia have a right to expect from you all the zeal firmness and success which your intellect military talent and the courage of the troops you command justify us in expecting 
 but by the time this letter which proved that the real relation of the forces had already made itself felt in petersburg was dispatched kutuzov had found himself unable any longer to restrain the army he commanded from attacking and a battle had taken place 
 on the second of october a cossack shapovalov who was out scouting killed one hare and wounded another following the wounded hare he made his way far into the forest and came upon the left flank of army encamped there without any precautions the cossack laughingly told his comrades how he had almost fallen into the hands of the french a cornet hearing the story informed his commander 
 the cossack was sent for and questioned the cossack officers wished to take advantage of this chance to capture some horses but one of the superior officers who was acquainted with the higher authorities reported the incident to a general on the state of things on the staff had of late been exceedingly strained ermolov had been to see bennigsen a few days previously and had entreated him to use his influence with the commander in chief to induce him to take the offensive 
 if i did not know you i should think you did not want what you are asking for i need only advise anything and his highness is sure to do the opposite replied bennigsen 
 the report confirmed by horse patrols who were sent out was the final proof that events had matured the tightly coiled spring was released the clock began to whirr and the chimes to play despite all his supposed power his intellect his experience and his knowledge of men kutuzov having taken into consideration the report a note from bennigsen who sent personal reports to the emperor the wishes he supposed the emperor to hold and the fact that all the generals expressed the same wish could no longer check the inevitable movement and gave the order to do what he regarded as useless and harmful gave his approval that is to the accomplished fact

 night begins to descend upon grantaire 
 the spot was in fact admirably adapted the entrance to the street widened out the other extremity narrowed together into a pocket without exit 
 corinthe created an obstacle the rue mondetour was easily barricaded on the right and the left no attack was possible except from the rue that is to say in front and in full sight 
 bossuet had the comprehensive glance of a fasting hannibal 
 terror had seized on the whole street at the irruption of the mob there was not a who did not get out of sight 
 in the space of a flash of lightning in the rear to right and left shops stables windows blinds attic skylights shutters of every description were closed from the ground floor to the roof 
 a terrified old woman fixed a mattress in front of her window on two for drying linen in order to deaden the effect of musketry 
 the alone remained open and that for a very good reason that the mob had rushed into my god 
 ah my god sighed mame hucheloup 
 bossuet had gone down to meet courfeyrac 
 joly who had placed himself at the window exclaimed 
 courfeyrac you ought to have brought an umbrella 
 you will gatch gold 
 in the meantime in the space of a few minutes twenty iron bars had been wrenched from the grated front of the ten fathoms of street had been unpaved gavroche and bahorel had seized in its passage and overturned the dray of a named anceau this dray contained three barrels of lime which they placed beneath the piles of enjolras raised the cellar trap and all the widow empty casks were used to flank the barrels of lime feuilly with his fingers skilled in painting the delicate sticks of fans had backed up the barrels and the dray with two massive heaps of blocks of rough stone 
 blocks which were improvised like the rest and procured no one knows where the beams which served as props were torn from the neighboring and laid on the casks 
 when bossuet and courfeyrac turned round half the street was already barred with a rampart higher than a man 
 there is nothing like the hand of the populace for building everything that is built by demolishing 
 matelote and gibelotte had mingled with the workers 
 gibelotte went and came loaded with rubbish 
 her lassitude helped on the barricade she served the barricade as she would have served wine with a sleepy air 
 an omnibus with two white horses passed the end of the street 
 bossuet strode over the ran to it stopped the driver made the passengers alight offered his hand to the ladies 
 dismissed the conductor and returned leading the vehicle and the horses by the bridle 
 omnibuses said he do not pass the corinthe 
 non licet omnibus adire corinthum 
 an instant later the horses were unharnessed and went off at their will through the rue mondetour and the omnibus lying on its side completed the bar across the street 
 mame hucheloup quite upset had taken refuge in the first story 
 her eyes were vague and stared without seeing anything and she cried in a low tone 
 her terrified shrieks did not dare to emerge from her throat 
 the end of the world has come she muttered 
 joly deposited a kiss on mame fat red wrinkled neck and said to grantaire 
 my dear fellow i have always regarded a neck as an infinitely delicate thing 
 but grantaire attained to the highest regions of dithryamb matelote had mounted to the first floor once more grantaire seized her round her waist and gave vent to long bursts of laughter at the window 
 matelote is homely he cried 
 matelote is of a dream of ugliness matelote is a chimaera 
 this is the secret of her birth a gothic pygmalion who was making gargoyles for cathedrals fell in love with one of them the most horrible one fine morning he besought love to give it life and this produced matelote look at her citizens 
 she has hair like mistress and she is a good girl 
 i guarantee that she will fight well 
 every good girl contains a hero 
 as for mother hucheloup an old warrior 
 look at her moustaches she inherited them from her husband 
 a hussar indeed 
 she will fight too 
 these two alone will strike terror to the heart of the banlieue 
 comrades we shall overthrow the government as true as there are fifteen intermediary acids between margaric acid and formic acid however that is a matter of perfect indifference to me 
 gentlemen my father always detested me because i could not understand mathematics 
 i understand only love and liberty i am grantaire the good fellow 
 having never had any money i never acquired the habit of it and the result is that i have never lacked it but if i had been rich there would have been no more poor people 
 you would have seen 
 oh if the kind hearts only had fat purses how much better things would go 
 i picture myself jesus christ with fortune 
 how much good he would do 
 matelote embrace me 
 you are voluptuous and timid you have cheeks which invite the kiss of a sister and lips which claim the kiss of a lover 
 hold your tongue you cask said courfeyrac 
 grantaire retorted 
 i am the capitoul and the master of the floral games 
 municipal officer of toulouse 
 enjolras who was standing on the crest of the barricade gun in hand raised his beautiful austere face 
 enjolras as the reader knows had something of the spartan and of the puritan in his composition he would have perished at thermopylae with leonidas and burned at drogheda with cromwell 
 grantaire he shouted go get rid of the fumes of your wine somewhere else than here 
 this is the place for enthusiasm not for drunkenness 
 disgrace the barricade 
 this angry speech produced a singular effect on grantaire 
 one would have said that he had had a glass of cold water flung in his face he seemed to be rendered suddenly sober 
 he sat down put his elbows on a table near the window looked at enjolras with indescribable gentleness and said to him 
 let me sleep here 
 go and sleep somewhere else cried enjolras 
 but grantaire still keeping his tender and troubled eyes fixed on him replied 
 let me sleep i die 
 enjolras regarded him with disdainful eyes 
 grantaire you are incapable of believing of thinking of willing of living and of dying 
 grantaire replied in a grave tone 
 you will see 
 he stammered a few more unintelligible words then his head fell heavily on the table and as is the usual effect of the second period of inebriety into which enjolras had roughly and abruptly thrust him an instant later he had fallen asleep

 note and the information that the left flank of the french was unguarded were merely final indications that it was necessary to order an attack and it was fixed for the fifth of october 
 on the morning of the fourth of october kutuzov signed the dispositions toll read them to ermolov asking him to attend to the further arrangements 
 all right all right i time just now replied ermolov and left the hut 
 the dispositions drawn up by toll were very good as in the austerlitz dispositions it was written though not in german this time 
 the first column will march here and here the second column will march there and there and so on and on paper all these columns arrived at their places at the appointed time and destroyed the enemy everything had been admirably thought out as is usual in dispositions and as is always the case not a single column reached its place at the appointed time 
 when the necessary number of copies of the dispositions had been prepared an officer was summoned and sent to deliver them to ermolov to deal with a young officer of the horse guards orderly pleased at the importance of the mission entrusted to him went to quarters 
 gone away said orderly 
 the officer of the horse guards went to a general with whom ermolov was often to be found 
 no and the out too 
 the officer mounting his horse rode off to someone else 
 no gone out 
 if only they make me responsible for this delay what a nuisance it is thought the officer and he rode round the whole camp one man said he had seen ermolov ride past with some other generals others said he must have returned home the officer searched till six in the evening without even stopping to eat ermolov was nowhere to be found and no one knew where he was the officer snatched a little food at a and rode again to the vanguard to find miloradovich miloradovich too was away but here he was told that he had gone to a ball at general and that ermolov was probably there too 
 but where is it 
 why there over at echkino said a cossack officer pointing to a country house in the far distance 
 what outside our line 
 put two regiments as outposts and having such a spree there awful two bands and three sets of singers 
 the officer rode out beyond our lines to echkino while still at a distance he heard as he rode the merry sounds of a dance song proceeding from the house 
 in the meadows in the meadows he heard accompanied by whistling and the sound of a torban drowned every now and then by shouts these sounds made his spirits rise but at the same time he was afraid that he would be blamed for not having executed sooner the important order entrusted to him it was already past eight he dismounted and went up into the porch of a large country house which had remained intact between the russian and french forces in the refreshment room and the hall footmen were bustling about with wine and viands groups of singers stood outside the windows the officer was admitted and immediately saw all the chief generals of the army together and among them big imposing figure they all had their coats unbuttoned and were standing in a semicircle with flushed and animated faces laughing loudly in the middle of the room a short handsome general with a red face was dancing the trepak with much spirit and agility 
 ha ha ha bravo nicholas ivanych ha ha ha 
 the officer felt that by arriving with important orders at such a moment he was doubly to blame and he would have preferred to wait but one of the generals espied him and hearing what he had come about informed ermolov 
 ermolov came forward with a frown on his face and hearing what the officer had to say took the papers from him without a word 
 you think he went off just by chance said a comrade who was on the staff that evening to the officer of the horse guards referring to ermolov it was a trick it was done on purpose to get konovnitsyn into trouble see what a mess be tomorrow

 an attempt to console the widow hucheloup 
 bahorel in ecstasies over the barricade shouted 
 the street in its dress 
 how well it looks 
 courfeyrac as he demolished the to some extent sought to console the widowed proprietress 
 mother hucheloup you complaining the other day because you had had a notice served on you for infringing the law because gibelotte shook a counterpane out of your window 
 yes my good monsieur courfeyrac 
 ah good heavens are you going to put that table of mine in your horror too 
 and it was for the counterpane and also for a pot of flowers which fell from the attic window into the street that the government collected a fine of a hundred francs 
 if that an abomination what is 
 well mother hucheloup we are avenging you 
 mother hucheloup did not appear to understand very clearly the benefit which she was to derive from these reprisals made on her account 
 she was satisfied after the manner of that arab woman who having received a box on the ear from her husband went to complain to her father and cried for vengeance saying father you owe my husband affront for affront 
 the father asked on which cheek did you receive the blow 
 on the left cheek the father slapped her right cheek and said 
 now you are satisfied go tell your husband that he boxed my ears and that i have accordingly boxed his 
 the rain had ceased 
 recruits had arrived 
 workmen had brought under their blouses a barrel of powder a basket containing bottles of vitriol two or three carnival torches and a basket filled with left over from the festival this festival was very recent having taken place on the st of may it was said that these munitions came from a grocer in the faubourg named pepin 
 they smashed the only street lantern in the rue de la chanvrerie the lantern corresponding to one in the rue and all the lanterns in the surrounding streets de mondetour du cygne des precheurs and de la grande and de la 
 enjolras combeferre and courfeyrac directed everything 
 two barricades were now in process of construction at once both of them resting on the corinthe house and forming a right angle the larger shut off the rue de la chanvrerie the other closed the rue mondetour on the side of the rue de cygne 
 this last barricade which was very narrow was constructed only of casks and there were about fifty workers on it thirty were armed with guns for on their way they had effected a wholesale loan from an shop 
 nothing could be more bizarre and at the same time more motley than this troop 
 one had a a cavalry sabre and two another was in his with a round hat and a slung at his side a third wore a plastron of nine sheets of gray paper and was armed with a awl there was one who was shouting 
 let us exterminate them to the last man and die at the point of our bayonet 
 this man had no bayonet another spread out over his coat the and of a national guardsman the cover of the being ornamented with this inscription in red worsted 
 public order there were a great many guns bearing the numbers of the legions few hats no cravats many bare arms some pikes 
 add to this all ages all sorts of faces small pale young men and bronzed longshoremen 
 all were in haste and as they helped each other they discussed the possible chances 
 that they would receive 
 succor about three in the they were sure of one regiment that paris would rise 
 terrible sayings with which was mingled a sort of cordial joviality 
 one would have pronounced them brothers but they did not know each names great perils have this fine characteristic that they bring to light the fraternity of strangers 
 a fire had been lighted in the kitchen and there they were engaged in moulding into bullets pewter mugs spoons forks and all the brass of the establishment in the midst of it all they drank 
 caps and buckshot were mixed on the tables with glasses of wine 
 in the mame hucheloup matelote and gibelotte variously modified by terror which had stupefied one rendered another breathless and roused the third were tearing up old and making lint three insurgents were assisting them three jolly blades with beards and moustaches who plucked away at the linen with the fingers of seamstresses and who made them tremble 
 the man of lofty stature whom courfeyrac combeferre and enjolras had observed at the moment when he joined the mob at the corner of the rue des billettes was at work on the smaller barricade and was making himself useful there 
 gavroche was working on the larger one 
 as for the young man who had been waiting for courfeyrac at his lodgings and who had inquired for m marius he had disappeared at about the time when the omnibus had been overturned 
 gavroche completely carried away and radiant had undertaken to get everything in readiness 
 he went came mounted descended whistled and sparkled 
 he seemed to be there for the encouragement of all 
 had he any incentive 
 yes certainly his poverty had he wings yes certainly his joy 
 gavroche was a whirlwind 
 he was constantly visible he was incessantly audible he filled the air as he was everywhere at once 
 he was a sort of almost irritating ubiquity no halt was possible with him the enormous barricade felt him on its haunches 
 he troubled the loungers he excited the idle he reanimated the weary he grew impatient over the thoughtful he inspired gayety in some and breath in others wrath in others movement in all now pricking a student now biting an artisan he alighted paused flew off again hovered over the tumult and the effort sprang from one party to another murmuring and humming and harassed the whole company a fly on the immense revolutionary coach 
 perpetual motion was in his little arms and perpetual clamor in his little lungs 
 courage more more casks more machines where are you now 
 a hod of plaster for me to stop this hole with your barricade is very small 
 it must be carried up 
 put everything on it fling everything there stick it all in 
 break down the house a barricade is mother tea 
 hullo a glass door 
 this elicited an exclamation from the workers 
 a glass door what do you expect us to do with a glass door tubercle 
 hercules yourselves retorted gavroche 
 a glass door is an excellent thing in a barricade 
 it does not prevent an attack but it prevents the enemy taking it 
 so never prigged apples over a wall where there were broken bottles 
 a glass door cuts the corns of the national guard when they try to mount on the barricade pardi glass is a treacherous thing 
 well you a very wildly lively imagination comrades 
 however he was furious over his triggerless pistol 
 he went from one to another demanding 
 a gun i want a gun 
 why you give me a gun 
 give you a gun said combeferre 
 come now said gavroche why not 
 i had one in when we had a dispute with charles x 
 enjolras shrugged his shoulders 
 when there are enough for the men we will give some to the children 
 gavroche wheeled round haughtily and answered 
 if you are killed before me i shall take yours 
 gamin said enjolras 
 greenhorn said gavroche 
 a dandy who had lost his way and who lounged past the end of the street created a diversion 
 gavroche shouted to him 
 come with us young fellow well now we do anything for this old country of ours 
 the dandy fled

 next day the decrepit kutuzov having given orders to be called early said his prayers dressed and with an unpleasant consciousness of having to direct a battle he did not approve of got into his caleche and drove from letashovka a village three and a half miles from tarutino to the place where the attacking columns were to meet he sat in the caleche dozing and waking up by turns and listening for any sound of firing on the right as an indication that the action had begun but all was still quiet a damp dull autumn morning was just dawning on approaching tarutino kutuzov noticed cavalrymen leading their horses to water across the road along which he was driving kutuzov looked at them searchingly stopped his carriage and inquired what regiment they belonged to they belonged to a column that should have been far in front and in ambush long before then it may be a mistake thought the old commander in chief but a little further on he saw infantry regiments with their arms piled and the soldiers only partly dressed eating their rye porridge and carrying fuel he sent for an officer the officer reported that no order to advance had been received 
 how not rec kutuzov began but checked himself immediately and sent for a senior officer getting out of his caleche he waited with drooping head and breathing heavily pacing silently up and down when eykhen the officer of the general staff whom he had summoned appeared kutuzov went purple in the face not because that officer was to blame for the mistake but because he was an object of sufficient importance for him to vent his wrath on trembling and panting the old man fell into that state of fury in which he sometimes used to roll on the ground and he fell upon eykhen threatening him with his hands shouting and loading him with gross abuse another man captain brozin who happened to turn up and who was not at all to blame suffered the same fate 
 what sort of another blackguard are you have you shot scoundrels yelled kutuzov in a hoarse voice waving his arms and reeling 
 he was suffering physically he the commander in chief a serene highness who everybody said possessed powers such as no man had ever had in russia to be placed in this position made the laughingstock of the whole army i have been in such a hurry to pray about today or have kept awake thinking everything over all night thought he to himself when i was a chit of an officer no one would have dared to mock me so and now he was in a state of physical suffering as if from corporal punishment and could not avoid expressing it by cries of anger and distress but his strength soon began to fail him and looking about him conscious of having said much that was amiss he again got into his caleche and drove back in silence 
 his wrath once expended did not return and blinking feebly he listened to excuses and ermolov did not come to see him till the next day and to the insistence of bennigsen konovnitsyn and toll that the movement that had miscarried should be executed next day and once more kutuzov had to consent

 chapter vi 
 
 next day the troops assembled in their appointed places in the evening and advanced during the night it was an autumn night with dark purple clouds but no rain the ground was damp but not muddy and the troops advanced noiselessly only occasionally a jingling of the artillery could be faintly heard the men were forbidden to talk out loud to smoke their pipes or to strike a light and they tried to prevent their horses neighing the secrecy of the undertaking heightened its charm and they marched gaily some columns supposing they had reached their destination halted piled arms and settled down on the cold ground but the majority marched all night and arrived at places where they evidently should not have been 
 only count with his cossacks the least important detachment of all got to his appointed place at the right time this detachment halted at the outskirts of a forest on the path leading from the village of stromilova to dmitrovsk 
 toward dawn count who had dozed off was awakened by a deserter from the french army being brought to him this was a polish sergeant of corps who explained in polish that he had come over because he had been slighted in the service that he ought long ago to have been made an officer that he was braver than any of them and so he had left them and wished to pay them out he said that murat was spending the night less than a mile from where they were and that if they would let him have a convoy of a hundred men he would capture him alive count consulted his fellow officers 
 the offer was too tempting to be refused everyone volunteered to go and everybody advised making the attempt after much disputing and arguing grekov with two cossack regiments decided to go with the polish sergeant 
 now remember said count to the sergeant at parting if you have been lying have you hanged like a dog but if true you shall have a hundred gold pieces 
 without replying the sergeant with a resolute air mounted and rode away with grekov whose men had quickly assembled they disappeared into the forest and count having seen grekov off returned shivering from the freshness of the early dawn and excited by what he had undertaken on his own responsibility and began looking at the enemy camp now just visible in the deceptive light of dawn and the dying campfires our columns ought to have begun to appear on an open declivity to his right he looked in that direction but though the columns would have been visible quite far off they were not to be seen it seemed to the count that things were beginning to stir in the french camp and his adjutant confirmed this 
 oh it is really too late said count orlov looking at the camp 
 as often happens when someone we have trusted is no longer before our eyes it suddenly seemed quite clear and obvious to him that the sergeant was an impostor that he had lied and that the whole russian attack would be ruined by the absence of those two regiments which he would lead away heaven only knew where how could one capture a commander in chief from among such a mass of troops 
 i am sure that rascal was lying said the count 
 they can still be called back said one of his suite who like count orlov felt distrustful of the adventure when he looked at the camp 
 eh really what do you think should we let them go on or not 
 will you have them fetched back 
 fetch them back fetch them back said count orlov with sudden determination looking at his watch it will be too late it is quite light 
 and the adjutant galloped through the forest after grekov when grekov returned count excited both by the abandoned attempt and by vainly awaiting the infantry columns that still did not appear as well as by the proximity of the enemy resolved to advance all his men felt the same excitement 
 mount he commanded in a whisper the men took their places and crossed themselves forward with aid 
 reverberated in the forest and the cossack companies trailing their lances and advancing one after another as if poured out of a sack dashed gaily across the brook toward the camp 
 one desperate frightened yell from the first french soldier who saw the cossacks and all who were in the camp undressed and only just waking up ran off in all directions abandoning cannons muskets and horses 
 had the cossacks pursued the french without heeding what was behind and around them they would have captured murat and everything there that was what the officers desired but it was impossible to make the cossacks budge when once they had got booty and prisoners none of them listened to orders fifteen hundred prisoners and guns were taken on the spot besides standards and what seemed most important to the cossacks horses saddles horsecloths and the like all this had to be dealt with the prisoners and guns secured the booty divided not without some shouting and even a little themselves and it was on this that the cossacks all busied themselves 
 the french not being farther pursued began to recover themselves they formed into detachments and began firing still waiting for the other columns to arrive advanced no further 
 meantime according to the dispositions which said that the first column will march and so on the infantry of the belated columns commanded by bennigsen and directed by toll had started in due order and as always happens had got somewhere but not to their appointed places as always happens the men starting cheerfully began to halt murmurs were heard there was a sense of confusion and finally a backward movement adjutants and generals galloped about shouted grew angry quarreled said they had come quite wrong and were late gave vent to a little abuse and at last gave it all up and went forward simply to get somewhere we shall get somewhere or other and they did indeed get somewhere though not to their right places a few eventually even got to their right place but too late to be of any use and only in time to be fired at toll who in this battle played the part of weyrother at austerlitz galloped assiduously from place to place finding everything upside down everywhere thus he stumbled on corps in a wood when it was already broad daylight though the corps should long before have joined excited and vexed by the failure and supposing that someone must be responsible for it toll galloped up to the commander of the corps and began upbraiding him severely saying that he ought to be shot general bagovut a fighting old soldier of placid temperament being also upset by all the delay confusion and fell into a rage to surprise and quite contrary to his usual character and said disagreeable things to toll 
 i prefer not to take lessons from anyone but i can die with my men as well as anybody he said and advanced with a single division 
 coming out onto a field under the fire this brave general went straight ahead leading his men under fire without considering in his agitation whether going into action now with a single division would be of any use or no danger cannon balls and bullets were just what he needed in his angry mood one of the first bullets killed him and other bullets killed many of his men and his division remained under fire for some time quite uselessly

 waiting 
 during those hours of waiting what did they do 
 waiting 
 during those hours of waiting what did they do 
 we must needs tell since this is a matter of history 
 while the men made bullets and the women lint while a large saucepan of melted brass and lead destined to the smoked over a glowing brazier while the sentinels watched weapon in hand on the barricade while enjolras whom it was impossible to divert kept an eye on the sentinels combeferre courfeyrac jean prouvaire feuilly bossuet joly bahorel and some others sought each other out and united as in the most peaceful days of their conversations in their student life and in one corner of this which had been converted into a casement a couple of paces distant from the redoubt which they had built with their carbines loaded and primed resting against the backs of their chairs these fine young fellows so close to a supreme hour began to recite love verses 
 what verses 
 vous notre douce vie 
 lorsque nous etions si jeunes tous deux 
 et que nous au coeur envie 
 que bien mis et amoureux 
 ajoutant votre age a mon age 
 nous ne comptions pas a deux quarante ans 
 et que dans notre humble et petit menage 
 tout meme nous etait printemps 
 beaux jours manuel etait fier et sage 
 paris a de saints banquets 
 foy lancait la foudre et votre corsage 
 avait une epingle ou je me piquais 
 tout vous contemplait avocat sans causes 
 quand je vous menais au prado diner 
 vous etiez jolie au point que les roses 
 me faisaient de se retourner 
 je les entendais dire est elle belle 
 comme elle sent bon quels cheveux a flots 
 sous son mantelet elle cache une aile 
 son bonnet charmant est a peine eclos 
 avec toi pressant ton bras souple 
 les passants crovaient que charme 
 avait marie dans notre heureux couple 
 le doux mois au beau mois de mai 
 nous vivions caches contents porte close 
 devorant bon fruit defendu 
 ma bouche pas dit une chose 
 que deja ton coeur avait repondu 
 la sorbonne etait bucolique 
 ou je du soir au matin 
 ainsi ame amoureuse applique 
 la carte du tendre au pays latin 
 o place maubert o place dauphine 
 quand dans le taudis frais et printanier 
 tu tirais ton bas sur ton jambe fine 
 je voyais un astre au fond du grenier 
 fort lu platon mais rien ne reste 
 mieux que malebranche et que lamennais 
 tu me demontrais la bonte celeste 
 avec une fleur que tu me donnais 
 je tu m etais soumise 
 o grenier dore te lacer te voir 
 aller et venir des en chemise 
 mirant ton jeune front a ton vieux miroir 
 
 et qui done pourrait perde la memoire 
 de ces temps et de firmament 
 de rubans de fleurs de gaze et de moire 
 ou begaye un argot charmant 
 
 nos jardins etaient un pot de tulipe 
 tu masquais la vitre avec un jupon 
 je prenais le bol de terre de pipe 
 et je te donnais le tasse en japon 
 
 et ces grands malheurs qui nous faisaient rire 
 ton manchon brule ton boa perdu 
 et ce cher portrait du divin shakespeare 
 soir pour souper nons avons vendu 
 mendiant et toi charitable 
 je baisais au vol tes bras frais et ronds 
 dante in folio nous servait de table 
 pour manger gaiment un cent de marrons 
 la premiere fois mon joyeux bouge 
 je pris un baiser a ton levre en feu 
 quand tu allais decoiffee et rouge 
 je restai tout pale et je crus en dieu 
 te nos bonheurs sans nombre 
 et tous ces fichus changes en chiffons 
 oh que de soupirs de nos coeurs pleins 
 se sont envoles dans les cieux profonds 
 do you remember our sweet life when we were both so young and when we had no other desire in our hearts than to be well dressed and in love 
 when by adding your age to my age we could not count forty years between us and when in our humble and tiny household everything was spring to us even in winter fair days 
 manuel was proud and wise paris sat at sacred banquets foy launched thunderbolts and your corsage had a pin on which i pricked myself 
 everything gazed upon you 
 a briefless lawyer when i took you to the prado to dine you were so beautiful that the roses seemed to me to turn round and i heard them say is she not beautiful 
 how good she smells 
 what billowing hair beneath her mantle she hides a wing 
 her charming bonnet is hardly unfolded 
 i wandered with thee pressing thy supple arm the thought that love bewitched had wedded in our happy couple the gentle month of april to the fair month of may we lived concealed content with closed doors devouring love that sweet forbidden fruit 
 my mouth had not uttered a thing when thy heart had already responded 
 the sorbonne was the bucolic spot where i adored thee from eve till morn 
 tis thus that an amorous soul applies the chart of the tender to the latin country o place maubert 
 o place dauphine 
 when in the fresh hut thou didst draw thy stocking on thy delicate leg i saw a star in the depths of the garret 
 i have read a great deal of plato but nothing of it remains by me better than malebranche and then lamennais thou didst demonstrate to me celestial goodness with a flower which thou gavest to me i obeyed thee thou didst submit to me oh gilded garret to lace thee to behold thee going and coming from dawn in thy chemise gazing at thy young brow in thine ancient mirror and who then would forego the memory of those days of aurora and the firmament of flowers of gauze and of moire when love stammers a charming slang 
 our gardens consisted of a pot of tulips thou didst mask the window with thy petticoat i took the earthenware bowl and i gave thee the japanese cup 
 and those great misfortunes which made us laugh 
 thy cuff scorched thy boa lost 
 and that dear portrait of the divine shakespeare which we sold one evening that we might sup 
 i was a beggar and thou wert charitable i kissed thy fresh round arms in haste 
 a folio dante served us as a table on which to eat merrily a worth of chestnuts the first time that in my joyous den i snatched a kiss from thy fiery lip when thou wentest forth dishevelled and blushing i turned deathly pale and i believed in god 
 dost thou recall our innumerable joys and all those fichus changed to rags 
 oh what sighs from our hearts full of gloom fluttered forth to the heavenly depths 
 the hour the spot these souvenirs of youth recalled a few stars which began to twinkle in the sky the funeral repose of those deserted streets the imminence of the inexorable adventure which was in preparation gave a pathetic charm to these verses murmured in a low tone in the dusk by jean prouvaire who as we have said was a gentle poet 
 in the meantime a lamp had been lighted in the small barricade and in the large one one of those wax torches such as are to be met with on in front of vehicles loaded with masks on their way to la courtille 
 these torches as the reader has seen came from the faubourg 
 the torch had been placed in a sort of cage of closed on three sides to shelter it from the wind and disposed in such a fashion that all the light fell on the flag 
 the street and the barricade remained sunk in gloom and nothing was to be seen except the red flag formidably illuminated as by an enormous 
 this light enhanced the scarlet of the flag with an indescribable and terrible purple

 meanwhile another column was to have attacked the french from the front but kutuzov accompanied that column he well knew that nothing but confusion would come of this battle undertaken against his will and as far as was in his power held the troops back he did not advance 
 he rode silently on his small gray horse indolently answering suggestions that they should attack 
 the word attack is always on your tongue but you see that we are unable to execute complicated maneuvers said he to miloradovich who asked permission to advance 
 we take murat prisoner this morning or get to the place in time and nothing can be done now he replied to someone else 
 when kutuzov was informed that at the french rear where according to the reports of the cossacks there had previously been nobody there were now two battalions of poles he gave a sidelong glance at ermolov who was behind him and to whom he had not spoken since the previous day 
 you see they are asking to attack and making plans of all kinds but as soon as one gets to business nothing is ready and the enemy forewarned takes measures accordingly 
 ermolov screwed up his eyes and smiled faintly on hearing these words he understood that for him the storm had blown over and that kutuzov would content himself with that hint 
 having a little fun at my expense said ermolov softly nudging with his knee raevski who was at his side 
 soon after this ermolov moved up to kutuzov and respectfully remarked 
 it is not too late yet your highness the enemy has not gone away if you were to order an attack if not the guards will not so much as see a little smoke 
 kutuzov did not reply but when they reported to him that troops were in retreat he ordered an advance though at every hundred paces he halted for three quarters of an hour 
 the whole battle consisted in what cossacks had done the rest of the army merely lost some hundreds of men uselessly 
 in consequence of this battle kutuzov received a diamond decoration and bennigsen some diamonds and a hundred thousand rubles others also received pleasant recognitions corresponding to their various grades and following the battle fresh changes were made in the staff 
 how everything is done with us all said the russian officers and generals after the tarutino battle letting it be understood that some fool there is doing things all wrong but that we ourselves should not have done so just as people speak today but people who talk like that either do not know what they are talking about or deliberately deceive themselves no battle tarutino borodino or austerlitz takes place as those who planned it anticipated that is an essential condition 
 a countless number of free forces for nowhere is man freer than during a battle where it is a question of life and death influence the course taken by the fight and that course never can be known in advance and never coincides with the direction of any one force 
 if many simultaneously and variously directed forces act on a given body the direction of its motion cannot coincide with any one of those forces but will always be a mean what in mechanics is represented by the diagonal of a parallelogram of forces 
 if in the descriptions given by historians especially french ones we find their wars and battles carried out in accordance with previously formed plans the only conclusion to be drawn is that those descriptions are false 
 the battle of tarutino obviously did not attain the aim toll had in view to lead the troops into action in the order prescribed by the dispositions nor that which count may have had in view to take murat prisoner nor the result of immediately destroying the whole corps which bennigsen and others may have had in view nor the aim of the officer who wished to go into action to distinguish himself nor that of the cossack who wanted more booty than he got and so on but if the aim of the battle was what actually resulted and what all the russians of that day desired to drive the french out of russia and destroy their army it is quite clear that the battle of tarutino just because of its incongruities was exactly what was wanted at that stage of the campaign it would be difficult and even impossible to imagine any result more opportune than the actual outcome of this battle with a minimum of effort and insignificant losses despite the greatest confusion the most important results of the whole campaign were attained the transition from retreat to advance an exposure of the weakness of the french and the administration of that shock which army had only awaited to begin its flight

 the man recruited in the rue des billettes 
 night was fully come nothing made its appearance 
 all that they heard was confused noises and at intervals fusillades but these were rare badly sustained and distant 
 this respite which was thus prolonged was a sign that the government was taking its time and collecting its forces 
 these fifty men were waiting for sixty thousand 
 enjolras felt attacked by that impatience which seizes on strong souls on the threshold of redoubtable events 
 he went in search of gavroche who had set to making cartridges in the by the dubious light of two candles placed on the counter by way of precaution on account of the powder which was scattered on the tables these two candles cast no gleam outside 
 the insurgents had moreover taken pains not to have any light in the upper stories 
 gavroche was deeply preoccupied at that moment but not precisely with his cartridges 
 the man of the rue des billettes had just entered the and had seated himself at the table which was the least lighted 
 a musket of large model had fallen to his share and he held it between his legs 
 gavroche who had been up to that moment distracted by a hundred amusing things had not even seen this man 
 when he entered gavroche followed him mechanically with his eyes admiring his gun then all at once when the man was seated the street urchin sprang to his feet 
 any one who had spied upon that man up to that moment would have seen that he was observing everything in the barricade and in the band of insurgents with singular attention but from the moment when he had entered this room he had fallen into a sort of brown study and no longer seemed to see anything that was going on 
 the gamin approached this pensive personage and began to step around him on tiptoe as one walks in the vicinity of a person whom one is afraid of waking at the same time over his childish countenance which was at once so impudent and so serious so giddy and so profound so gay and so passed all those grimaces of an old man which signify ah bah impossible 
 my sight is bad 
 i am dreaming can this be no it is not but yes why no etc 
 gavroche balanced on his heels clenched both fists in his pockets moved his neck around like a bird expended in a gigantic pout all the sagacity of his lower lip he was astounded uncertain incredulous convinced dazzled he had the mien of the chief of the eunuchs in the slave mart discovering a venus among the blowsy females and the air of an amateur recognizing a raphael in a heap of daubs 
 his whole being was at work the instinct which scents out and the intelligence which combines 
 it was evident that a great event had happened in life 
 it was at the most intense point of this preoccupation that enjolras accosted him 
 you are small said enjolras you will not be seen 
 go out of the barricade slip along close to the houses skirmish about a bit in the streets and come back and tell me what is going on 
 gavroche raised himself on his haunches 
 so the little chaps are good for something very lucky go 
 in the meanwhile trust to the little fellows and distrust the big ones 
 and gavroche raising his head and lowering his voice added as he indicated the man of the rue des billettes do you see that big fellow there 
 well 
 a police spy 
 are you sure of it 
 it two weeks since he pulled me off the cornice of the port royal where i was taking the air by my ear 
 enjolras hastily quitted the urchin and murmured a few words in a very low tone to a longshoreman from the winedocks who chanced to be at hand 
 the man left the room and returned almost immediately accompanied by three others 
 the four men four porters with broad shoulders went and placed themselves without doing anything to attract his attention behind the table on which the man of the rue des billettes was leaning with his elbows they were evidently ready to hurl themselves upon him 
 then enjolras approached the man and demanded of him 
 who are you 
 at this abrupt query the man started 
 he plunged his gaze deep into enjolras clear eyes and appeared to grasp the meaning he smiled with a smile than which nothing more disdainful more energetic and more resolute could be seen in the world and replied with haughty gravity 
 i see what it is 
 well yes 
 you are a police spy 
 i am an agent of the authorities 
 and your name 
 javert 
 enjolras made a sign to the four men 
 in the twinkling of an eye before javert had time to turn round he was collared thrown down pinioned and searched 
 they found on him a little round card pasted between two pieces of glass and bearing on one side the arms of france engraved and with this motto 
 supervision and vigilance and on the other this note javert inspector of police aged and the signature of the prefect of police of that day m gisquet 
 besides this he had his watch and his purse which contained several gold pieces 
 they left him his purse and his watch 
 under the watch at the bottom of his fob they felt and seized a paper in an envelope which enjolras unfolded and on which he read these five lines written in the very hand of the prefect of police 
 as soon as his political mission is accomplished inspector javert will make sure by special supervision whether it is true that the malefactors have instituted intrigues on the right bank of the seine near the jena bridge 
 the search ended they lifted javert to his feet bound his arms behind his back and fastened him to that celebrated post in the middle of the room which had formerly given the its name 
 gavroche who had looked on at the whole of this scene and had approved of everything with a silent toss of his head stepped up to javert and said to him 
 the mouse who has caught the cat 
 all this was so rapidly executed that it was all over when those about the noticed it 
 javert had not uttered a single cry 
 at the sight of javert bound to the post courfeyrac bossuet joly combeferre and the men scattered over the two barricades came running up 
 javert with his back to the post and so surrounded with ropes that he could not make a movement raised his head with the intrepid serenity of the man who has never lied 
 he is a police spy said enjolras 
 and turning to javert 
 you will be shot ten minutes before the barricade is taken 
 javert replied in his most imperious tone 
 why not at once 
 we are saving our powder 
 then finish the business with a blow from a knife 
 spy said the handsome enjolras we are judges and not assassins 
 then he called gavroche 
 here you go about your business 
 do what i told you 
 going cried gavroche 
 and halting as he was on the point of setting out 
 by the way you will give me his gun and he added 
 i leave you the musician but i want the clarionet 
 the gamin made the military salute and passed gayly through the opening in the large barricade

 napoleon enters moscow after the brilliant victory de la moskowa there can be no doubt about the victory for the battlefield remains in the hands of the french the russians retreat and abandon their ancient capital moscow abounding in provisions arms munitions and incalculable wealth is in hands the russian army only half the strength of the french does not make a single attempt to attack for a whole month position is most brilliant he can either fall on the russian army with double its strength and destroy it negotiate an advantageous peace or in case of a refusal make a menacing move on petersburg or even in the case of a reverse return to smolensk or vilna or remain in moscow in short no special genius would seem to be required to retain the brilliant position the french held at that time for that only very simple and easy steps were necessary not to allow the troops to loot to prepare winter clothing of which there was sufficient in moscow for the whole army and methodically to collect the provisions of which according to the french historians there were enough in moscow to supply the whole army for six months yet napoleon that greatest of all geniuses who the historians declare had control of the army took none of these steps 
 he not merely did nothing of the kind but on the contrary he used his power to select the most foolish and ruinous of all the courses open to him of all that napoleon might have done wintering in moscow advancing on petersburg or on or retiring by a more northerly or more southerly route say by the road kutuzov afterwards took nothing more stupid or disastrous can be imagined than what he actually did he remained in moscow till october letting the troops plunder the city then hesitating whether to leave a garrison behind him he quitted moscow approached kutuzov without joining battle turned to the right and reached again without attempting to break through and take the road kutuzov took but retiring instead to mozhaysk along the devastated smolensk road nothing more stupid than that could have been devised or more disastrous for the army as the sequel showed had aim been to destroy his army the most skillful strategist could hardly have devised any series of actions that would so completely have accomplished that purpose independently of anything the russian army might do 
 napoleon the man of genius did this but to say that he destroyed his army because he wished to or because he was very stupid would be as unjust as to say that he had brought his troops to moscow because he wished to and because he was very clever and a genius 
 in both cases his personal activity having no more force than the personal activity of any soldier merely coincided with the laws that guided the event 
 the historians quite falsely represent faculties as having weakened in moscow and do so only because the results did not justify his actions he employed all his ability and strength to do the best he could for himself and his army as he had done previously and as he did subsequently in his activity at that time was no less astounding than it was in egypt in italy in austria and in prussia we do not know for certain in how far his genius was genuine in egypt where forty centuries looked down upon his grandeur for his great exploits there are all told us by frenchmen we cannot accurately estimate his genius in austria or prussia for we have to draw our information from french or german sources and the incomprehensible surrender of whole corps without fighting and of fortresses without a siege must incline germans to recognize his genius as the only explanation of the war carried on in germany but we thank god have no need to recognize his genius in order to hide our shame we have paid for the right to look at the matter plainly and simply and we will not abandon that right 
 his activity in moscow was as amazing and as full of genius as elsewhere order after order order and plan after plan were issued by him from the time he entered moscow till the time he left it the absence of citizens and of a deputation and even the burning of moscow did not disconcert him he did not lose sight either of the welfare of his army or of the doings of the enemy or of the welfare of the people of russia or of the direction of affairs in paris or of diplomatic considerations concerning the terms of the anticipated peace

 chapter viii 
 
 many interrogation points with regard to a certain le cabuc whose name may not have been le cabuc 
 the tragic picture which we have undertaken would not be complete the reader would not see those grand moments of social in a revolutionary birth which contain convulsion mingled with effort in their exact and real relief were we to omit in the sketch here outlined an incident full of epic and savage horror which occurred almost immediately after departure 
 mobs as the reader knows are like a snowball and collect as they roll along a throng of tumultuous men 
 these men do not ask each other whence they come 
 among the who had joined the rabble led by enjolras combeferre and courfeyrac there had been a person wearing the jacket of a street porter which was very threadbare on the shoulders who gesticulated and vociferated and who had the look of a drunken savage 
 this man whose name or nickname was le cabuc and who was moreover an utter stranger to those who pretended to know him was very drunk or assumed the appearance of being so and had seated himself with several others at a table which they had dragged outside of the this cabuc while making those who vied with him drunk seemed to be examining with a thoughtful air the large house at the extremity of the barricade whose five stories commanded the whole street and faced the rue all at once he exclaimed 
 do you know comrades it is from that house yonder that we must fire when we are at the windows the deuce is in it if any one can advance into the street 
 yes but the house is closed said one of the drinkers 
 let us knock 
 they will not open 
 let us break in the door 
 le cabuc runs to the door which had a very massive knocker and knocks the door opens not 
 he strikes a second blow 
 no one answers a third stroke 
 the same silence 
 is there any one here shouts cabuc 
 nothing stirs 
 then he seizes a gun and begins to batter the door with the butt end 
 it was an ancient alley door low vaulted narrow solid entirely of oak lined on the inside with a sheet of iron and iron stays a genuine prison postern 
 the blows from the butt end of the gun made the house tremble but did not shake the door 
 nevertheless it is probable that the inhabitants were disturbed for a tiny square window was finally seen to open on the third story and at this aperture appeared the reverend and terrified face of a old man who was the porter and who held a candle 
 the man who was knocking paused 
 gentlemen said the porter what do you want 
 open said cabuc 
 that cannot be gentlemen 
 open nevertheless 
 impossible gentlemen 
 le cabuc took his gun and aimed at the porter but as he was below and as it was very dark the porter did not see him 
 will you open yes or no 
 no gentlemen 
 do you say no 
 i say no my goo 
 the porter did not finish 
 the shot was fired the ball entered under his chin and came out at the nape of his neck after traversing the jugular vein 
 the old man fell back without a sigh 
 the candle fell and was extinguished and nothing more was to be seen except a motionless head lying on the sill of the small window and a little whitish smoke which floated off towards the roof 
 there said le cabuc dropping the butt end of his gun to the pavement 
 he had hardly uttered this word when he felt a hand laid on his shoulder with the weight of an talon and he heard a voice saying to him 
 on your knees 
 the murderer turned round and saw before him enjolras cold white face 
 enjolras held a pistol in his hand 
 he had hastened up at the sound of the discharge 
 he had seized collar blouse shirt and suspender with his left hand 
 on your knees he repeated 
 and with an imperious motion the frail young man of twenty years bent the thickset and sturdy porter like a reed and brought him to his knees in the mire 
 le cabuc attempted to resist but he seemed to have been seized by a superhuman hand 
 enjolras pale with bare neck and dishevelled hair and his face had about him at that moment something of the antique themis his dilated nostrils his downcast eyes gave to his implacable greek profile that expression of wrath and that expression of chastity which as the ancient world viewed the matter befit justice 
 the whole barricade hastened up then all ranged themselves in a circle at a distance feeling that it was impossible to utter a word in the presence of the thing which they were about to behold 
 le cabuc vanquished no longer tried to struggle and trembled in every limb 
 enjolras released him and drew out his watch 
 collect yourself said he 
 think or pray 
 you have one minute 
 mercy murmured the murderer then he dropped his head and stammered a few inarticulate oaths 
 enjolras never took his eyes off of him 
 he allowed a minute to pass then he replaced his watch in his fob 
 that done he grasped le cabuc by the hair as the latter coiled himself into a ball at his knees and shrieked and placed the muzzle of the pistol to his ear many of those intrepid men who had so tranquilly entered upon the most terrible of adventures turned aside their heads 
 an explosion was heard the assassin fell to the pavement face downwards 
 enjolras straightened himself up and cast a convinced and severe glance around him 
 then he spurned the corpse with his foot and said 
 throw that outside 
 three men raised the body of the unhappy wretch which was still agitated by the last mechanical convulsions of the life that had fled and flung it over the little barricade into the rue mondetour 
 enjolras was thoughtful 
 it is impossible to say what grandiose shadows slowly spread over his redoubtable serenity 
 all at once he raised his voice 
 a silence fell upon them 
 citizens said enjolras what that man did is frightful what i have done is horrible 
 he killed therefore i killed him i had to do it because insurrection must have its discipline assassination is even more of a crime here than elsewhere we are under the eyes of the revolution we are the priests of the republic we are the victims of duty and must not be possible to slander our combat i have therefore tried that man and condemned him to death as for myself constrained as i am to do what i have done and yet abhorring it i have judged myself also and you shall soon see to what i have condemned myself 
 those who listened to him shuddered 
 we will share thy fate cried combeferre 
 so be it replied enjolras 
 one word more 
 in executing this man i have obeyed necessity but necessity is a monster of the old world name is fatality 
 now the law of progress is that monsters shall disappear before the angels and that fatality shall vanish before fraternity 
 it is a bad moment to pronounce the word love 
 no matter i do pronounce it and i glorify it 
 love the future is thine 
 death i make use of thee but i hate thee 
 citizens in the future there will be neither darkness nor thunderbolts neither ferocious ignorance nor bloody retaliation 
 as there will be no more satan there will be no more michael 
 in the future no one will kill any one else the earth will beam with radiance the human race will love the day will come citizens when all will be concord harmony light joy and life it will come and it is in order that it may come that we are about to die 
 enjolras ceased 
 his virgin lips closed and he remained for some time standing on the spot where he had shed blood in marble immobility his staring eye caused those about him to speak in low tones 
 jean prouvaire and combeferre pressed each hands silently and leaning against each other in an angle of the barricade they watched with an admiration in which there was some compassion that grave young man executioner and priest composed of light like crystal and also of rock 
 let us say at once that later on after the action when the bodies were taken to the morgue and searched a police card was found on le cabuc 
 the author of this book had in his hands in the special report on this subject made to the prefect of police in 
 we will add that if we are to believe a tradition of the police which is strange but probably well founded le cabuc was claquesous the fact is that dating from the death of le cabuc there was no longer any question of claquesous 
 claquesous had nowhere left any trace of his disappearance he would seem to have amalgamated himself with the invisible 
 his life had been all shadows his end was night 
 the whole insurgent group was still under the influence of the emotion of that tragic case which had been so quickly tried and so quickly terminated when courfeyrac again beheld on the barricade the small young man who had inquired of him that morning for marius 
 this lad who had a bold and reckless air had come by night to join the insurgents

 from the rue plumet to the quartier 
 the voice which had summoned marius through the twilight to the barricade of the rue de la chanvrerie had produced on him the effect of the voice of destiny 
 he wished to die the opportunity presented itself he knocked at the door of the tomb a hand in the darkness offered him the key 
 these melancholy openings which take place in the gloom before despair are tempting marius thrust aside the bar which had so often allowed him to pass emerged from the garden and said 
 i will go 
 mad with grief no longer conscious of anything fixed or solid in his brain incapable of accepting anything thenceforth of fate after those two months passed in the intoxication of youth and love overwhelmed at once by all the reveries of despair he had but one desire remaining to make a speedy end of all 
 he set out at rapid pace 
 he found himself most opportunely armed as he had pistols with him 
 the young man of whom he thought that he had caught a glimpse had vanished from his sight in the street 
 marius who had emerged from the rue plumet by the boulevard traversed the esplanade and the bridge of the invalides the champs elysees the place louis xv and reached the rue de rivoli the shops were open there the gas was burning under the arcades women were making their purchases in the stalls people were eating ices in the cafe laiter and nibbling small cakes at the english shop 
 only a few were setting out at a gallop from the hotel des princes and the hotel meurice 
 marius entered the rue through the passage delorme there the shops were closed the merchants were chatting in front of their doors people were walking about the street lanterns were lighted beginning with the first floor all the windows were lighted as usual 
 there was cavalry on the place du 
 marius followed the rue in proportion as he left the behind him there were fewer lighted windows the shops were fast shut no one was chatting on the thresholds the street grew sombre and at the same time the crowd increased in density 
 for the now amounted to a crowd 
 no one could be seen to speak in this throng and yet there arose from it a dull deep murmur 
 near the fountain of the there were assemblages motionless and gloomy groups which were to those who went and came as stones in the midst of running water 
 at the entrance to the rue des prouvaires the crowd no longer walked it formed a resisting massive solid compact almost impenetrable block of people who were huddled together and conversing in low tones 
 there were hardly any black coats or round hats now but smock frocks blouses caps and bristling and cadaverous heads this multitude undulated confusedly in the nocturnal gloom its whisperings had the hoarse accent of a vibration 
 although not one of them was walking a dull trampling was audible in the mire beyond this dense portion of the throng in the rue du roule in the rue des prouvaires and in the extension of the rue there was no longer a single window in which a candle was burning only the solitary and diminishing rows of lanterns could be seen vanishing into the street in the distance 
 the lanterns of that date resembled large red stars hanging to ropes and shed upon the pavement a shadow which had the form of a huge spider these streets were not deserted 
 there could be descried piles of guns moving bayonets and troops bivouacking 
 no curious observer passed that limit 
 there circulation ceased 
 there the rabble ended and the army began 
 marius willed with the will of a man who hopes no more 
 he had been summoned he must go 
 he found a means to traverse the throng and to pass the bivouac of the troops he shunned the patrols he avoided the sentinels 
 he made a circuit reached the rue de bethisy and directed his course towards the halles 
 at the corner of the rue des bourdonnais there were no longer any lanterns 
 after having passed the zone of the crowd he had passed the limits of the troops he found himself in something startling 
 there was no longer a no longer a soldier no longer a light there was no one solitude silence night i know not what chill which seized hold upon one 
 entering a street was like entering a cellar 
 he continued to advance 
 he took a few steps 
 some one passed close to him at a run 
 was it a man 
 or a woman 
 were there many of them he could not have told it had passed and vanished 
 proceeding from circuit to circuit he reached a lane which he judged to be the rue de la poterie near the middle of this street he came in contact with an obstacle 
 he extended his hands it was an overturned wagon his foot recognized pools of water gullies and scattered and piled up a barricade had been begun there and abandoned 
 he climbed over the stones and found himself on the other side of the barrier he walked very near the and guided himself along the walls of the houses 
 a little beyond the barricade it seemed to him that he could make out something white in front of him he approached it took on a form 
 it was two white horses the horses of the omnibus harnessed by bossuet in the morning who had been straying at random all day from street to street and had finally halted there with the weary patience of brutes who no more understand the actions of men than man understands the actions of providence 
 marius left the horses behind him 
 as he was approaching a street which seemed to him to be the rue du a shot coming no one knows whence and traversing the darkness at random whistled close by him and the bullet pierced a brass suspended above his head over a shop this pierced was still to be seen in in the rue du at the corner of the pillars of the market 
 this shot still betokened life 
 from that instant forth he encountered nothing more 
 the whole of this itinerary resembled a descent of black steps 
 nevertheless marius pressed forward

 but strange to say all these measures efforts and plans which were not at all worse than others issued in similar circumstances did not affect the essence of the matter but like the hands of a clock detached from the mechanism swung about in an arbitrary and aimless way without engaging the cogwheels 
 with reference to the military side the plan of campaign that work of genius of which thiers remarks that his genius never devised anything more profound more skillful or more admirable and enters into a polemic with m fain to prove that this work of genius must be referred not to the fourth but to the fifteenth of october that plan never was or could be executed for it was quite out of touch with the facts of the case the fortifying of the kremlin for which la mosquee as napoleon termed the church of basil the beatified was to have been razed to the ground proved quite useless the mining of the kremlin only helped toward fulfilling wish that it should be blown up when he left moscow as a child wants the floor on which he has hurt himself to be beaten the pursuit of the russian army about which napoleon was so concerned produced an result the french generals lost touch with the russian army of sixty thousand men and according to thiers it was only eventually found like a lost pin by the skill and apparently the genius of murat 
 with reference to diplomacy all arguments as to his magnanimity and justice both to tutolmin and to yakovlev whose chief concern was to obtain a greatcoat and a conveyance proved useless alexander did not receive these envoys and did not reply to their embassage 
 with regard to legal matters after the execution of the supposed incendiaries the rest of moscow burned down 
 with regard to administrative matters the establishment of a municipality did not stop the robberies and was only of use to certain people who formed part of that municipality and under pretext of preserving order looted moscow or saved their own property from being looted 
 with regard to religion as to which in egypt matters had so easily been settled by visit to a mosque no results were achieved two or three priests who were found in moscow did try to carry out wish but one of them was slapped in the face by a french soldier while conducting service and a french official reported of another that the priest whom i found and invited to say mass cleaned and locked up the church that night the doors were again broken open the padlocks smashed the books mutilated and other disorders perpetrated 
 with reference to commerce the proclamation to industrious workmen and to peasants evoked no response there were no industrious workmen and the peasants caught the commissaries who ventured too far out of town with the proclamation and killed them 
 as to the theaters for the entertainment of the people and the troops these did not meet with success either the theaters set up in the kremlin and in house were closed again at once because the actors and actresses were robbed 
 even philanthropy did not have the desired effect the genuine as well as the false paper money which flooded moscow lost its value the french collecting booty cared only for gold not only was the paper money valueless which napoleon so graciously distributed to the unfortunate but even silver lost its value in relation to gold 
 but the most amazing example of the ineffectiveness of the orders given by the authorities at that time was attempt to stop the looting and discipline 
 this is what the army authorities were reporting 
 looting continues in the city despite the decrees against it order is not yet restored and not a single merchant is carrying on trade in a lawful manner the sutlers alone venture to trade and they sell stolen goods 
 the neighborhood of my ward continues to be pillaged by soldiers of the rd corps who not satisfied with taking from the unfortunate inhabitants hiding in the cellars the little they have left even have the ferocity to wound them with their sabers as i have repeatedly witnessed 
 nothing new except that the soldiers are robbing and pillaging october 
 robbery and pillaging continue there is a band of thieves in our district who ought to be arrested by a strong force october 
 the emperor is extremely displeased that despite the strict orders to stop pillage parties of marauding guards are continually seen returning to the kremlin among the old guard disorder and pillage were renewed more violently than ever yesterday evening last night and today the emperor sees with regret that the picked soldiers appointed to guard his person who should set an example of discipline carry disobedience to such a point that they break into the cellars and stores containing army supplies others have disgraced themselves to the extent of disobeying sentinels and officers and have abused and beaten them 
 the grand marshal of the palace wrote the governor complains bitterly that in spite of repeated orders the soldiers continue to commit nuisances in all the courtyards and even under the very windows of the emperor 
 that army like a herd of cattle run wild and trampling underfoot the provender which might have saved it from starvation disintegrated and perished with each additional day it remained in moscow but it did not go away 
 it began to run away only when suddenly seized by a panic caused by the capture of transport trains on the smolensk road and by the battle of tarutino the news of that battle of tarutino unexpectedly received by napoleon at a review evoked in him a desire to punish the russians thiers says and he issued the order for departure which the whole army was demanding 
 fleeing from moscow the soldiers took with them everything they had stolen napoleon too carried away his own personal tresor but on seeing the baggage trains that impeded the army he was thiers says and yet with his experience of war he did not order all the superfluous vehicles to be burned as he had done with those of a certain marshal when approaching moscow he gazed at the caleches and carriages in which soldiers were riding and remarked that it was a very good thing as those vehicles could be used to carry provisions the sick and the wounded 
 the plight of the whole army resembled that of a wounded animal which feels it is perishing and does not know what it is doing to study the skillful tactics and aims of napoleon and his army from the time it entered moscow till it was destroyed is like studying the dying leaps and shudders of a mortally wounded animal very often a wounded animal hearing a rustle rushes straight at the gun runs forward and back again and hastens its own end napoleon under pressure from his whole army did the same thing the rustle of the battle of tarutino frightened the beast and it rushed forward onto the gun reached him turned back and finally like any wild beast ran back along the most disadvantageous and dangerous path where the old scent was familiar 
 during the whole of that period napoleon who seems to us to have been the leader of all these movements as the figurehead of a ship may seem to a savage to guide the vessel acted like a child who holding a couple of strings inside a carriage thinks he is driving it

 of expense 
 riches are for spending and spending for honour and good actions therefore extraordinary expense must be limited by the worth of the occasion for voluntary undoing may be as well for a country as for the kingdom of heaven but ordinary expense ought to be limited by a estate and governed with such regard as it 
 be within his compass and not subject to deceit and abuse of servants and ordered to the best show that the bills may be less than the estimation abroad 
 
 certainly if a man will keep but of even hand his ordinary expenses ought to be but to the half of his receipts and if he think to wax rich but to the third part 
 it is no baseness for the greatest to descend and look into their own estate some forbear it not upon negligence alone but doubting to bring themselves into melancholy in respect they shall find it broken but wounds cannot be cured without searching he that cannot look into his own estate at all had need both choose well those whom he employeth and change them often for new are more timorous and less subtle he that can look into his estate but seldom it behoveth him to turn all to certainties a man had need if he be plentiful in some kind of expense to be as saving again in some other as if he be plentiful in diet to be saving in apparel if he be plentiful in the hall to be saving in the stable and the like for he that is plentiful in expenses of all kinds will hardly be preserved from decay in clearing 
 of a estate he may as well hurt himself in being too sudden as in letting it run on too long for hasty selling is commonly as disadvantageable as interest 
 
 besides he that clears at once will relapse for finding himself out of straits he will revert to his customs but he that cleareth by degrees induceth a habit of frugality and gained as well upon his mind as upon his estate 
 certainly who hath a state to repair may not despise small things and commonly it is less dishonourable to abridge petty charges than to stoop to petty gettings a man ought warily to begin charges which once begun will continue but in matters that return not he may be more magnificent

 chapter xiii 
 
 little gervais 
 jean valjean left the town as though he were fleeing from it he set out at a very hasty pace through the fields taking whatever roads and paths presented themselves to him without perceiving that he was incessantly retracing his steps 
 he wandered thus the whole morning without having eaten anything and without feeling hungry he was the prey of a throng of novel sensations 
 he was conscious of a sort of rage he did not know against whom it was directed he could not have told whether he was touched or humiliated there came over him at moments a strange emotion which he resisted and to which he opposed the hardness acquired during the last twenty years of his life 
 this state of mind fatigued him 
 he perceived with dismay that the sort of frightful calm which the injustice of his misfortune had conferred upon him was giving way within him he asked himself what would replace this 
 at times he would have actually preferred to be in prison with the gendarmes and that things should not have happened in this way it would have agitated him less although the season was tolerably far advanced there were still a few late flowers in the here and there whose odor as he passed through them in his march recalled to him memories of his childhood 
 these memories were almost intolerable to him it was so long since they had recurred to him 
 unutterable thoughts assembled within him in this manner all day long 
 as the sun declined to its setting casting long shadows athwart the soil from every pebble jean valjean sat down behind a bush upon a large ruddy plain which was absolutely deserted 
 there was nothing on the horizon except the alps 
 not even the spire of a distant village jean valjean might have been three leagues distant from d a path which intersected the plain passed a few paces from the bush 
 in the middle of this meditation which would have contributed not a little to render his rags terrifying to any one who might have encountered him a joyous sound became audible 
 he turned his head and saw a little savoyard about ten years of age coming up the path and singing his on his hip and his on his back 
 one of those gay and gentle children who go from land to land affording a view of their knees through the holes in their trousers 
 without stopping his song the lad halted in his march from time to time and played at with some coins which he had in his whole fortune probably 
 among this money there was one piece 
 the child halted beside the bush without perceiving jean valjean and tossed up his handful of sous which up to that time he had caught with a good deal of adroitness on the back of his hand 
 this time the piece escaped him and went rolling towards the brushwood until it reached jean valjean 
 jean valjean set his foot upon it 
 in the meantime the child had looked after his coin and had caught sight of him 
 he showed no astonishment but walked straight up to the man 
 the spot was absolutely solitary 
 as far as the eye could see there was not a person on the plain or on the path 
 the only sound was the tiny feeble cries of a flock of birds of passage which was traversing the heavens at an immense height 
 the child was standing with his back to the sun which cast threads of gold in his hair and empurpled with its gleam the savage face of jean valjean 
 sir said the little savoyard with that childish confidence which is composed of ignorance and innocence my money 
 what is your name said jean valjean 
 little gervais sir 
 go away said jean valjean 
 sir resumed the child give me back my money 
 jean valjean dropped his head and made no reply 
 the child began again my money sir 
 jean eyes remained fixed on the earth 
 my piece of money cried the child my white piece my silver 
 it seemed as though jean valjean did not hear him 
 the child grasped him by the collar of his blouse and shook him 
 at the same time he made an effort to displace the big shoe which rested on his treasure 
 i want my piece of money my piece of forty sous 
 the child wept 
 jean valjean raised his head 
 he still remained seated 
 his eyes were troubled 
 he gazed at the child in a sort of amazement then he stretched out his hand towards his cudgel and cried in a terrible voice there 
 i sir replied the child 
 little gervais 
 i 
 give me back my forty sous if you please 
 take your foot away sir if you please 
 then irritated though he was so small and becoming almost menacing 
 come now will you take your foot away 
 take your foot away or see 
 ah 
 still you said jean valjean and rising abruptly to his feet his foot still resting on the silver piece he added 
 will you take yourself off 
 the frightened child looked at him then began to tremble from head to foot and after a few moments of stupor he set out running at the top of his speed without daring to turn his neck or to utter a cry 
 nevertheless lack of breath forced him to halt after a certain distance and jean valjean heard him sobbing in the midst of his own revery 
 at the end of a few moments the child had disappeared 
 the sun had set 
 the shadows were descending around jean valjean 
 he had eaten nothing all day it is probable that he was feverish 
 he had remained standing and had not changed his attitude after the flight 
 the breath heaved his chest at long and irregular intervals 
 his gaze fixed ten or twelve paces in front of him seemed to be scrutinizing with profound attention the shape of an ancient fragment of blue earthenware which had fallen in the grass all at once he shivered he had just begun to feel the chill of evening 
 he settled his cap more firmly on his brow sought mechanically to cross and button his blouse advanced a step and stopped to pick up his cudgel 
 at that moment he caught sight of the piece which his foot had half ground into the earth and which was shining among the pebbles 
 it was as though he had received a galvanic shock what is this he muttered between his teeth 
 he recoiled three paces then halted without being able to detach his gaze from the spot which his foot had trodden but an instant before as though the thing which lay glittering there in the gloom had been an open eye riveted upon him 
 at the expiration of a few moments he darted convulsively towards the silver coin seized it and straightened himself up again and began to gaze afar off over the plain at the same time casting his eyes towards all points of the horizon as he stood there erect and shivering like a terrified wild animal which is seeking refuge 
 he saw nothing 
 night was falling the plain was cold and vague great banks of violet haze were rising in the gleam of the twilight 
 he said ah and set out rapidly in the direction in which the child had disappeared 
 after about thirty paces he paused looked about him and saw nothing 
 then he shouted with all his might 
 little gervais 
 little gervais 
 he paused and waited 
 there was no reply 
 the landscape was gloomy and deserted 
 he was encompassed by space there was nothing around him but an obscurity in which his gaze was lost and a silence which engulfed his voice 
 an icy north wind was blowing and imparted to things around him a sort of lugubrious life 
 the bushes shook their thin little arms with incredible fury 
 one would have said that they were threatening and pursuing some one 
 he set out on his march again then he began to run and from time to time he halted and shouted into that solitude with a voice which was the most formidable and the most disconsolate that it was possible to hear little gervais 
 little gervais 
 assuredly if the child had heard him he would have been alarmed and would have taken good care not to show himself 
 but the child was no doubt already far away 
 he encountered a priest on horseback 
 he stepped up to him and said 
 monsieur le cure have you seen a child pass 
 no said the priest 
 one named little gervais 
 i have seen no one 
 he drew two pieces from his and handed them to the priest 
 monsieur le cure this is for your poor people 
 monsieur le cure he was a little lad about ten years old with a marmot i think and a one of those savoyards you know 
 i have not seen him 
 little gervais 
 there are no villages here 
 can you tell me 
 if he is like what you say my friend he is a little stranger such persons pass through these parts 
 we know nothing of them 
 jean valjean seized two more coins of five francs each with violence and gave them to the priest 
 for your poor he said 
 then he added wildly 
 monsieur have me arrested 
 i am a thief 
 the priest put spurs to his horse and fled in haste much alarmed 
 jean valjean set out on a run in the direction which he had first taken 
 in this way he traversed a tolerably long distance gazing calling shouting but he met no one 
 two or three times he ran across the plain towards something which conveyed to him the effect of a human being reclining or crouching down it turned out to be nothing but brushwood or rocks nearly on a level with the earth at length at a spot where three paths intersected each other he stopped 
 the moon had risen 
 he sent his gaze into the distance and shouted for the last time little gervais 
 little gervais little gervais 
 his shout died away in the mist without even awakening an echo 
 he murmured yet once more little gervais but in a feeble and almost inarticulate voice 
 it was his last effort his legs gave way abruptly under him as though an invisible power had suddenly overwhelmed him with the weight of his evil conscience he fell exhausted on a large stone his fists clenched in his hair and his face on his knees and he cried i am a wretch 
 then his heart burst and he began to cry 
 it was the first time that he had wept in nineteen years 
 when jean valjean left the house he was as we have seen quite thrown out of everything that had been his thought hitherto he could not yield to the evidence of what was going on within him he hardened himself against the angelic action and the gentle words of the old man 
 you have promised me to become an honest man i buy your soul 
 i take it away from the spirit of perversity i give it to the good god 
 this recurred to his mind unceasingly 
 to this celestial kindness he opposed pride which is the fortress of evil within us he was indistinctly conscious that the pardon of this priest was the greatest assault and the most formidable attack which had moved him yet that his obduracy was finally settled if he resisted this clemency that if he yielded he should be obliged to renounce that hatred with which the actions of other men had filled his soul through so many years and which pleased him that this time it was necessary to conquer or to be conquered and that a struggle a colossal and final struggle had been begun between his viciousness and the goodness of that man 
 in the presence of these lights he proceeded like a man who is intoxicated 
 as he walked thus with haggard eyes did he have a distinct perception of what might result to him from his adventure at d did he understand all those mysterious murmurs which warn or importune the spirit at certain moments of life did a voice whisper in his ear that he had just passed the solemn hour of his destiny that there no longer remained a middle course for him that if he were not henceforth the best of men he would be the worst that it behooved him now so to speak to mount higher than the bishop or fall lower than the convict that if he wished to become good be must become an angel that if he wished to remain evil he must become a monster 
 here again some questions must be put which we have already put to ourselves elsewhere 
 did he catch some shadow of all this in his thought in a confused way 
 misfortune certainly as we have said does form the education of the intelligence nevertheless it is doubtful whether jean valjean was in a condition to disentangle all that we have here indicated 
 if these ideas occurred to him he but caught glimpses of rather than saw them and they only succeeded in throwing him into an unutterable and almost painful state of emotion 
 on emerging from that black and deformed thing which is called the galleys the bishop had hurt his soul as too vivid a light would have hurt his eyes on emerging from the dark 
 the future life the possible life which offered itself to him henceforth all pure and radiant filled him with tremors and anxiety 
 he no longer knew where he really was 
 like an owl who should suddenly see the sun rise the convict had been dazzled and blinded as it were by virtue 
 that which was certain that which he did not doubt was that he was no longer the same man that everything about him was changed that it was no longer in his power to make it as though the bishop had not spoken to him and had not touched him 
 in this state of mind he had encountered little gervais and had robbed him of his forty sous 
 why 
 he certainly could not have explained it was this the last effect and the supreme effort as it were of the evil thoughts which he had brought away from the galleys a remnant of impulse a result of what is called in statics acquired force 
 it was that and it was also perhaps even less than that 
 let us say it simply it was not he who stole it was not the man it was the beast who by habit and instinct had simply placed his foot upon that money while the intelligence was struggling amid so many novel and hitherto thoughts besetting it 
 when intelligence and beheld that action of the brute jean valjean recoiled with anguish and uttered a cry of terror 
 it was phenomenon and one which was possible only in the situation in which he found stealing the money from that child he had done a thing of which he was no longer capable 
 however that may be this last evil action had a decisive effect on him it abruptly traversed that chaos which he bore in his mind and dispersed it placed on one side the thick obscurity and on the other the light and acted on his soul in the state in which it then was as certain chemical reagents act upon a troubled mixture by precipitating one element and clarifying the other 
 first of all even before examining himself and reflecting all bewildered like one who seeks to save himself he tried to find the child in order to return his money to him then when he recognized the fact that this was impossible he halted in despair at the moment when he exclaimed i am a wretch he had just perceived what he was and he was already separated from himself to such a degree that he seemed to himself to be no longer anything more than a phantom and as if he had there before him in flesh and blood the hideous jean valjean cudgel in hand his blouse on his hips his knapsack filled with stolen objects on his back with his resolute and gloomy visage with his thoughts filled with abominable projects 
 excess of unhappiness had as we have remarked made him in some sort a visionary 
 this then was in the nature of a vision he actually saw that jean valjean that sinister face before him he had almost reached the point of asking himself who that man was and he was horrified by him 
 his brain was going through one of those violent and yet perfectly calm moments in which revery is so profound that it absorbs reality one no longer beholds the object which one has before one and one sees as though apart from self the figures which one has in own mind 
 thus he contemplated himself so to speak face to face and at the same time athwart this hallucination he perceived in a mysterious depth a sort of light which he at first took for a torch 
 on scrutinizing this light which appeared to his conscience with more attention he recognized the fact that it possessed a human form and that this torch was the bishop 
 his conscience weighed in turn these two men thus placed before it the bishop and jean valjean 
 nothing less than the first was required to soften the second 
 by one of those singular effects which are peculiar to this sort of ecstasies in proportion as his revery continued as the bishop grew great and resplendent in his eyes so did jean valjean grow less and vanish 
 after a certain time he was no longer anything more than a shade 
 all at once he disappeared the bishop alone remained he filled the whole soul of this wretched man with a magnificent radiance 
 jean valjean wept for a long time 
 he wept burning tears he sobbed with more weakness than a woman with more fright than a child 
 as he wept daylight penetrated more and more clearly into his soul an extraordinary light a light at once ravishing and terrible his past life his first fault his long expiation his external brutishness his internal hardness his dismissal to liberty rejoicing in manifold plans of vengeance what had happened to him at the the last thing that he had done that theft of forty sous from a child a crime all the more cowardly and all the more monstrous since it had come after the this recurred to his mind and appeared clearly to him but with a clearness which he had never hitherto witnessed 
 he examined his life and it seemed horrible to him his soul and it seemed frightful to him in the meantime a gentle light rested over this life and this soul it seemed to him that he beheld satan by the light of paradise 
 how many hours did he weep thus 
 what did he do after he had wept whither did he go 
 no one ever knew 
 the only thing which seems to be authenticated is that that same night the carrier who served grenoble at that epoch and who arrived at d about three in the morning saw as he traversed the street in which the residence was situated a man in the attitude of prayer kneeling on the pavement in the shadow in front of the door of monseigneur welcome

 luke skywalker rested in the medical center of the rebel star cruiser where hewas attended by the surgeon droid called the youth sat while gently began to look at his wounded hand 
 gazing up luke saw leia followed by and enteringthe medical center to check his progress and perhaps bring him a little cheer butluke knew that the best therapy he had received yet aboard this cruiser was in theradiant image before him 
 princess leia was smiling her eyes were wide and sparkling with a wondrousglow she looked just as she had that first time he saw lifetime ago first projected her holographic image and in gown of purest white she looked angelic 
 raising his hand luke offered it to the expert service of thesurgeon droid examined the bionic hand that was skillfully fused to the robot wrapped a soft metalized strip about the hand and attached a smallelectronic unit to the strip tightening it slightly luke made a fist with his new handand felt the healing pulsations imparted by apparatus then he let hishand and arm relax 
 leia and the two droids moved closer to luke as a voice came over an intercomloudspeaker it was lando luke the voice blared ready for takeoff 
 lando calrissian sat in the millennium chair he had missedhis old freighter but now that he was once again its captain he felt quiteuncomfortable in his chair the great wookiee chewbacca noticed his discomfort while he began to throw the switches to ready the ship fortakeoff 
 voice came over comlink speaker meet you on tatooine 
 again lando spoke into his comlink microphone but this time he spoke to worry leia he said with emotion find han 
 and leaning over chewbacca barked his farewell into the barkthat may have transcended the limits of time and space to be heard by han the bounty hunter had taken him

 book one 
 chapter xxviii 
 
 prince andrew was to leave next evening the old prince not altering his routine retired as usual after dinner the little princess was in her room prince andrew in a traveling coat without epaulettes had been packing with his valet in the rooms assigned to him after inspecting the carriage himself and seeing the trunks put in he ordered the horses to be harnessed only those things he always kept with him remained in his room a small box a large canteen fitted with silver plate two turkish pistols and a saber a present from his father who had brought it from the siege of ochakov all these traveling effects of prince were in very good order new clean and in cloth covers carefully tied with tapes 
 when starting on a journey or changing their mode of life men capable of reflection are generally in a serious frame of mind at such moments one reviews the past and plans for the future prince face looked very thoughtful and tender with his hands behind him he paced briskly from corner to corner of the room looking straight before him and thoughtfully shaking his head did he fear going to the war or was he sad at leaving his wife perhaps both but evidently he did not wish to be seen in that mood for hearing footsteps in the passage he hurriedly unclasped his hands stopped at a table as if tying the cover of the small box and assumed his usual tranquil and impenetrable expression it was the heavy tread of princess mary that he heard 
 i hear you have given orders to harness she cried panting she had apparently been running and i did so wish to have another talk with you alone god knows how long we may again be parted you are not angry with me for coming you have changed so andrusha she added as if to explain such a question 
 she smiled as she uttered his pet name andrusha it was obviously strange to her to think that this stern handsome man should be andrusha the slender mischievous boy who had been her playfellow in childhood 
 and where is lise he asked answering her question only by a smile 
 she was so tired that she has fallen asleep on the sofa in my room oh andrew what a treasure of a wife you have said she sitting down on the sofa facing her brother she is quite a child such a dear merry child i have grown so fond of her 
 prince andrew was silent but the princess noticed the ironical and contemptuous look that showed itself on his face 
 one must be indulgent to little weaknesses who is free from them andrew forget that she has grown up and been educated in society and so her position now is not a rosy one we should enter into situation tout comprendre tout pardonner think it must be for her poor thing after what she has been used to to be parted from her husband and be left alone the country in her condition very hard 
 to understand all is to forgive all 
 prince andrew smiled as he looked at his sister as we smile at those we think we thoroughly understand 
 you live in the country and think the life terrible he replied 
 i different why speak of me i want any other life and for i know no other but think andrew for a young society woman to be buried in the country during the best years of her life all alone for papa is always busy and i well you know what poor resources i have for entertaining a woman used to the best society there is only mademoiselle bourienne 
 i like your mademoiselle bourienne at all said prince andrew 
 no she is very nice and kind and above all much to be pitied she has no one no one to tell the truth i need her and even in my way you know i always was a savage and now am even more so i like being alone father likes her very much she and michael ivanovich are the two people to whom he is always gentle and kind because he has been a benefactor to them both as sterne says we love people so much for the good they have done us as for the good we have done them father took her when she was homeless after losing her own father she is very and my father likes her way of reading she reads to him in the evenings and reads splendidly 
 to be quite frank mary i expect character sometimes makes things trying for you it prince andrew asked suddenly 
 princess mary was first surprised and then aghast at this question 
 for me for me trying for me said she 
 he always was rather harsh and now i should think getting very trying said prince andrew apparently speaking lightly of their father in order to puzzle or test his sister 
 you are good in every way andrew but you have a kind of intellectual pride said the princess following the train of her own thoughts rather than the trend of the conversation and a great sin how can one judge father but even if one might what feeling except veneration could such a man as my father evoke and i am so contented and happy with him i only wish you were all as happy as i am 
 her brother shook his head incredulously 
 the only thing that is hard for me i will tell you the truth andrew is way of treating religious subjects i understand how a man of his immense intellect can fail to see what is as clear as day and can go so far astray that is the only thing that makes me unhappy but even in this i can see lately a shade of improvement his satire has been less bitter of late and there was a monk he received and had a long talk with 
 ah my dear i am afraid you and your monk are wasting your powder said prince andrew banteringly yet tenderly 
 ah mon ami i only pray and hope that god will hear me andrew she said timidly after a silence i have a great favor to ask of you 
 what is it dear 
 no promise that you will not refuse it will give you no trouble and is nothing unworthy of you but it will comfort me promise andrusha said she putting her hand in her reticule but not yet taking out what she was holding inside it as if what she held were the subject of her request and must not be shown before the request was granted 
 she looked timidly at her brother 
 even if it were a great deal of trouble answered prince andrew as if guessing what it was about 
 think what you please i know you are just like father think as you please but do this for my sake please do father our grandfather wore it in all his wars she still did not take out what she was holding in her reticule so you promise 
 of course what is it 
 andrew i bless you with this icon and you must promise me you will never take it off do you promise 
 if it does not weigh a hundredweight and break my neck to please you said prince andrew but immediately noticing the pained expression his joke had brought to his face he repented and added i am glad really dear i am very glad 
 against your will he will save and have mercy on you and bring you to himself for in him alone is truth and peace said she in a voice trembling with emotion solemnly holding up in both hands before her brother a small oval antique icon of the saviour in a gold setting on a finely wrought silver chain 
 she crossed herself kissed the icon and handed it to andrew 
 please andrew for my sake 
 rays of gentle light shone from her large timid eyes those eyes lit up the whole of her thin sickly face and made it beautiful her brother would have taken the icon but she stopped him andrew understood crossed himself and kissed the icon there was a look of tenderness for he was touched but also a gleam of irony on his face 
 thank you my dear she kissed him on the forehead and sat down again on the sofa they were silent for a while 
 as i was saying to you andrew be kind and generous as you always used to be judge lise harshly she began she is so sweet so and her position now is a very hard one 
 i do not think i have complained of my wife to you masha or blamed her why do you say all this to me 
 red patches appeared on princess face and she was silent as if she felt guilty 
 i have said nothing to you but you have already been talked to and i am sorry for that he went on 
 the patches grew deeper on her forehead neck and cheeks she tried to say something but could not her brother had guessed right the little princess had been crying after dinner and had spoken of her forebodings about her confinement and how she dreaded it and had complained of her fate her and her husband after crying she had fallen asleep prince andrew felt sorry for his sister 
 know this masha i reproach have not reproached and never shall reproach my wife with anything and i cannot reproach myself with anything in regard to her and that always will be so in whatever circumstances i may be placed but if you want to know the truth if you want to know whether i am happy no is she happy no but why this is so i know 
 as he said this he rose went to his sister and stooping kissed her forehead his fine eyes lit up with a thoughtful kindly and unaccustomed brightness but he was looking not at his sister but over her head toward the darkness of the open doorway 
 let us go to her i must say or go and wake and come in a moment petrushka he called to his valet come here take these away put this on the seat and this to the right 
 princess mary rose and moved to the door then stopped and said andrew if you had faith you would have turned to god and asked him to give you the love you do not feel and your prayer would have been answered 
 well may be said prince andrew go masha come immediately 
 on the way to his room in the passage which connected one wing with the other prince andrew met mademoiselle bourienne smiling sweetly it was the third time that day that with an ecstatic and artless smile she had met him in secluded passages 
 oh i thought you were in your room she said for some reason blushing and dropping her eyes 
 prince andrew looked sternly at her and an expression of anger suddenly came over his face he said nothing to her but looked at her forehead and hair without looking at her eyes with such contempt that the frenchwoman blushed and went away without a word when he reached his room his wife was already awake and her merry voice hurrying one word after another came through the open door she was speaking as usual in french and as if after long she wished to make up for lost time 
 no but imagine the old countess zubova with false curls and her mouth full of false teeth as if she were trying to cheat old age ha ha ha mary 
 this very sentence about countess zubova and this same laugh prince andrew had already heard from his wife in the presence of others some five times he entered the room softly the little princess plump and rosy was sitting in an easy chair with her work in her hands talking incessantly repeating petersburg reminiscences and even phrases prince andrew came up stroked her hair and asked if she felt rested after their journey she answered him and continued her chatter 
 the coach with six horses was waiting at the porch it was an autumn night so dark that the coachman could not see the carriage pole servants with lanterns were bustling about in the porch the immense house was brilliant with lights shining through its lofty windows the domestic serfs were crowding in the hall waiting to bid to the young prince the members of the household were all gathered in the reception hall michael ivanovich mademoiselle bourienne princess mary and the little princess prince andrew had been called to his study as the latter wished to say to him alone all were waiting for them to come out 
 when prince andrew entered the study the old man in his spectacles and white dressing gown in which he received no one but his son sat at the table writing he glanced round 
 going and he went on writing 
 come to say 
 kiss me here and he touched his cheek thanks thanks 
 what do you thank me for 
 for not and not hanging to a apron strings the service before everything thanks thanks and he went on writing so that his quill spluttered and squeaked if you have anything to say say it these two things can be done together he added 
 about my wife i am ashamed as it is to leave her on your hands 
 why talk nonsense say what you want 
 when her confinement is due send to moscow for an accoucheur let him be here 
 the old prince stopped writing and as if not understanding fixed his stern eyes on his son 
 i know that no one can help if nature does not do her work said prince andrew evidently confused i know that out of a million cases only one goes wrong but it is her fancy and mine they have been telling her things she has had a dream and is frightened 
 hm hm muttered the old prince to himself finishing what he was writing do it 
 he signed with a flourish and suddenly turning to his son began to laugh 
 a bad business eh 
 what is bad father 
 the wife said the old prince briefly and significantly 
 i understand said prince andrew 
 no it be helped lad said the prince all like that one unmarry be afraid i tell anyone but you know it yourself 
 he seized his son by the hand with small bony fingers shook it looked straight into his face with keen eyes which seemed to see through him and again laughed his frigid laugh 
 the son sighed thus admitting that his father had understood him the old man continued to fold and seal his letter snatching up and throwing down the wax the seal and the paper with his accustomed rapidity 
 to be done pretty i will do everything make your mind easy said he in abrupt sentences while sealing his letter 
 andrew did not speak he was both pleased and displeased that his father understood him the old man got up and gave the letter to his son 
 listen said he worry about your wife what can be done shall be now listen give this letter to michael ilarionovich i have written that he should make use of you in proper places and not keep you long as an adjutant a bad position tell him i remember and like him write and tell me how he receives you if he is all right serve him nicholas son need not serve under anyone if he is in disfavor now come here 
 kutuzov 
 he spoke so rapidly that he did not finish half his words but his son was accustomed to understand him he led him to the desk raised the lid drew out a drawer and took out an exercise book filled with his bold tall close handwriting 
 i shall probably die before you so remember these are my memoirs hand them to the emperor after my death now here is a lombard bond and a letter it is a premium for the man who writes a history of wars send it to the academy here are some jottings for you to read when i am gone you will find them useful 
 andrew did not tell his father that he would no doubt live a long time yet he felt that he must not say it 
 i will do it all father he said 
 well now he gave his son his hand to kiss and embraced him remember this prince andrew if they kill you it will hurt me your old father he paused unexpectedly and then in a querulous voice suddenly shrieked but if i hear that you have not behaved like a son of nicholas bolkonski i shall be ashamed 
 you need not have said that to me father said the son with a smile 
 the old man was silent 
 i also wanted to ask you continued prince andrew if killed and if i have a son do not let him be taken away from you as i said yesterday let him grow up with you please 
 not let the wife have him said the old man and laughed 
 they stood silent facing one another the old sharp eyes were fixed straight on his something twitched in the lower part of the old face 
 said go he suddenly shouted in a loud angry voice opening his door 
 what is it what asked both princesses when they saw for a moment at the door prince andrew and the figure of the old man in a white dressing gown spectacled and wigless shouting in an angry voice 
 prince andrew sighed and made no reply 
 well he said turning to his wife 
 and this well sounded coldly ironic as if he were saying now go through your performance 
 andrew already said the little princess turning pale and looking with dismay at her husband 
 he embraced her she screamed and fell unconscious on his shoulder 
 he cautiously released the shoulder she leaned on looked into her face and carefully placed her in an easy chair 
 adieu mary said he gently to his sister taking her by the hand and kissing her and then he left the room with rapid steps 
 the little princess lay in the armchair mademoiselle bourienne chafing her temples princess mary supporting her still looked with her beautiful eyes full of tears at the door through which prince andrew had gone and made the sign of the cross in his direction from the study like pistol shots came the frequent sound of the old man angrily blowing his nose hardly had prince andrew gone when the study door opened quickly and the stern figure of the old man in the white dressing gown looked out 
 gone all right said he and looking angrily at the unconscious little princess he shook his head reprovingly and slammed the door
