 absolute continuity of motion is not comprehensible to the human mind laws of motion of any kind become comprehensible to man only when he examines arbitrarily selected elements of that motion but at the same time a large proportion of human error comes from the arbitrary division of continuous motion into discontinuous elements there is a well known sophism of the ancients consisting in this that achilles could never catch up with a tortoise he was following in spite of the fact that he traveled ten times as fast as the tortoise by the time achilles has covered the distance that separated him from the tortoise the tortoise has covered one tenth of that distance ahead of him when achilles has covered that tenth the tortoise has covered another one hundredth and so on forever this problem seemed to the ancients insoluble the absurd answer that achilles could never overtake the tortoise resulted from this that motion was arbitrarily divided into discontinuous elements whereas the motion both of achilles and of the tortoise was continuous 
 by adopting smaller and smaller elements of motion we only approach a solution of the problem but never reach it only when we have admitted the conception of the infinitely small and the resulting geometrical progression with a common ratio of one tenth and have found the sum of this progression to infinity do we reach a solution of the problem 
 a modern branch of mathematics having achieved the art of dealing with the infinitely small can now yield solutions in other more complex problems of motion which used to appear insoluble 
 this modern branch of mathematics unknown to the ancients when dealing with problems of motion admits the conception of the infinitely small and so conforms to the chief condition of motion absolute continuity and thereby corrects the inevitable error which the human mind cannot avoid when it deals with separate elements of motion instead of examining continuous motion 
 in seeking the laws of historical movement just the same thing happens the movement of humanity arising as it does from innumerable arbitrary human wills is continuous 
 to understand the laws of this continuous movement is the aim of history but to arrive at these laws resulting from the sum of all those human wills mind postulates arbitrary and disconnected units the first method of history is to take an arbitrarily selected series of continuous events and examine it apart from others though there is and can be no beginning to any event for one event always flows uninterruptedly from another 
 the second method is to consider the actions of some one man a king or a commander as equivalent to the sum of many individual wills whereas the sum of individual wills is never expressed by the activity of a single historic personage 
 historical science in its endeavor to draw nearer to truth continually takes smaller and smaller units for examination but however small the units it takes we feel that to take any unit disconnected from others or to assume a beginning of any phenomenon or to say that the will of many men is expressed by the actions of any one historic personage is in itself false 
 it needs no critical exertion to reduce utterly to dust any deductions drawn from history it is merely necessary to select some larger or smaller unit as the subject of observation as criticism has every right to do seeing that whatever unit history observes must always be arbitrarily selected 
 only by taking infinitesimally small units for observation the differential of history that is the individual tendencies of men and attaining to the art of integrating them that is finding the sum of these infinitesimals can we hope to arrive at the laws of history 
 the first fifteen years of the nineteenth century in europe present an extraordinary movement of millions of people men leave their customary pursuits hasten from one side of europe to the other plunder and slaughter one another triumph and are plunged in despair and for some years the whole course of life is altered and presents an intensive movement which first increases and then slackens what was the cause of this movement by what laws was it governed asks the mind of man 
 the historians replying to this question lay before us the sayings and doings of a few dozen men in a building in the city of paris calling these sayings and doings the revolution then they give a detailed biography of napoleon and of certain people favorable or hostile to him tell of the influence some of these people had on others and say that is why this movement took place and those are its laws 
 but the mind of man not only refuses to believe this explanation but plainly says that this method of explanation is fallacious because in it a weaker phenomenon is taken as the cause of a stronger the sum of human wills produced the revolution and napoleon and only the sum of those wills first tolerated and then destroyed them 
 but every time there have been conquests there have been conquerors every time there has been a revolution in any state there have been great men says history and indeed human reason replies every time conquerors appear there have been wars but this does not prove that the conquerors caused the wars and that it is possible to find the laws of a war in the personal activity of a single man whenever i look at my watch and its hands point to ten i hear the bells of the neighboring church but because the bells begin to ring when the hands of the clock reach ten i have no right to assume that the movement of the bells is caused by the position of the hands of the watch 
 whenever i see the movement of a locomotive i hear the whistle and see the valves opening and wheels turning but i have no right to conclude that the whistling and the turning of wheels are the cause of the movement of the engine 
 the peasants say that a cold wind blows in late spring because the oaks are budding and really every spring cold winds do blow when the oak is budding but though i do not know what causes the cold winds to blow when the oak buds unfold i cannot agree with the peasants that the unfolding of the oak buds is the cause of the cold wind for the force of the wind is beyond the influence of the buds i see only a coincidence of occurrences such as happens with all the phenomena of life and i see that however much and however carefully i observe the hands of the watch and the valves and wheels of the engine and the oak i shall not discover the cause of the bells ringing the engine moving or of the winds of spring to that i must entirely change my point of view and study the laws of the movement of steam of the bells and of the wind history must do the same and attempts in this direction have already been made 
 to study the laws of history we must completely change the subject of our observation must leave aside kings ministers and generals and the common infinitesimally small elements by which the masses are moved no one can say in how far it is possible for man to advance in this way toward an understanding of the laws of history but it is evident that only along that path does the possibility of discovering the laws of history lie and that as yet not a millionth part as much mental effort has been applied in this direction by historians as has been devoted to describing the actions of various kings commanders and ministers and propounding the historians own reflections concerning these actions

 enjolras and his lieutenants 
 it was about this epoch that enjolras in view of a possible catastrophe instituted a kind of mysterious census 
 all were present at a secret meeting at the cafe musain 
 enjolras said mixing his words with a few but significant metaphors 
 it is proper that we should know where we stand and on whom we may count 
 if combatants are required they must be provided it can do no harm to have something with which to strike always have more chance of being gored when there are bulls on the road than when there are none 
 let us therefore reckon a little on the herd 
 how many of us are there there is no question of postponing this task until revolutionists should always be hurried progress has no time to lose let us mistrust the unexpected 
 let us not be caught unprepared we must go over all the seams that we have made and see whether they hold fast 
 this business ought to be concluded courfeyrac you will see the polytechnic students 
 it is their day to go out is wednesday 
 feuilly you will see those of the glaciere will you not 
 combeferre has promised me to go to picpus there is a perfect swarm and an excellent one there 
 bahorel will visit the estrapade 
 prouvaire the masons are growing lukewarm you will bring us news from the lodge of the rue de joly will go to clinical lecture and feel the pulse of the medical school 
 bossuet will take a little turn in the court and talk with the young law licentiates 
 i will take charge of the cougourde myself 
 that arranges everything said courfeyrac 
 no 
 what else is there 
 a very important thing 
 what is that asked courfeyrac 
 the barriere du maine replied enjolras 
 enjolras remained for a moment as though absorbed in reflection then he resumed 
 at the barriere du maine there are painters and journeymen in the studios of sculptors 
 they are an enthusiastic family but liable to cool off 
 i know what has been the matter with them for some time past 
 they are thinking of something else they are becoming extinguished 
 they pass their time playing dominoes there is urgent need that some one should go and talk with them a little but with firmness 
 they meet at they are to be found there between twelve and one those ashes must be fanned into a glow 
 for that errand i had counted on that abstracted marius who is a good fellow on the whole but he no longer comes to us i need some one for the barriere du maine 
 i have no one 
 what about me said grantaire 
 here am i 
 you 
 i 
 you indoctrinate republicans you warm up hearts that have grown cold in the name of principle 
 why not 
 are you good for anything 
 i have a vague ambition in that direction said grantaire 
 you do not believe in everything 
 i believe in you 
 grantaire will you do me a service 
 anything 
 black your boots 
 well meddle with our affairs 
 sleep yourself sober from your absinthe 
 you are an ingrate enjolras 
 you the man to go to the barriere du maine 
 you capable of it 
 i am capable of descending the rue de gres of crossing the place of sloping through the rue of taking the rue de vaugirard of passing the carmelites of turning into the rue of reaching the rue du of leaving behind me the conseil de guerre of pacing the rue des vielles tuileries of striding across the boulevard of following the chaussee du maine of passing the barrier and entering i am capable of that my shoes are capable of that 
 do you know anything of those comrades who meet at 
 not much 
 we only address each other as thou 
 what will you say to them 
 i will speak to them of robespierre pardi 
 of danton of principles 
 you 
 i but i receive justice 
 when i set about it i am terrible i have read prudhomme i know the social contract i know my constitution of the year two by heart 
 the liberty of one citizen ends where the liberty of another citizen begins 
 do you take me for a brute 
 i have an old of the republic in my drawer the rights of man the sovereignty of the people sapristi 
 i am even a bit of a hebertist 
 i can talk the most superb twaddle for six hours by the clock watch in hand 
 be serious said enjolras 
 i am wild replied grantaire 
 enjolras meditated for a few moments and made the gesture of a man who has taken a resolution 
 grantaire he said gravely i consent to try you 
 you shall go to the barriere du maine 
 grantaire lived in furnished lodgings very near the cafe musain he went out and five minutes later he returned 
 he had gone home to put on a robespierre waistcoat 
 red said he as he entered and he looked intently at enjolras then with the palm of his energetic hand he laid the two scarlet points of the waistcoat across his breast 
 and stepping up to enjolras he whispered in his ear 
 be easy 
 he jammed his hat on resolutely and departed 
 a quarter of an hour later the back room of the cafe musain was deserted 
 all the friends of the a b c were gone each in his own direction each to his own task 
 enjolras who had reserved the cougourde of aix for himself was the last to leave 
 those members of the cougourde of aix who were in paris then met on the plain of issy in one of the abandoned quarries which are so numerous in that side of paris 
 as enjolras walked towards this place he passed the whole situation in review in his own mind 
 the gravity of events was when facts the premonitory symptoms of latent social malady move heavily the slightest complication stops and entangles them a phenomenon whence arises ruin and new births 
 enjolras descried a luminous uplifting beneath the gloomy skirts of the future who knows 
 perhaps the moment was at hand 
 the people were again taking possession of right and what a fine spectacle the revolution was again majestically taking possession of france and saying to the world 
 the sequel enjolras was content the furnace was being heated 
 he had at that moment a powder train of friends scattered all over paris 
 he composed in his own mind with philosophical and penetrating eloquence cosmopolitan enthusiasm dash smile jean melancholy science sarcasms a sort of electric spark which took fire nearly everywhere at once all hands to work 
 surely the result would answer to the effort this was well 
 this made him think of grantaire 
 hold said he to himself the barriere du maine will not take me far out of my way 
 what if i were to go on as far as let us have a look at what grantaire is about and see how he is getting on 
 one was striking from the vaugirard steeple when enjolras reached the richefeu 
 he pushed open the door entered folded his arms letting the door fall to and strike his shoulders and gazed at that room filled with tables men and smoke 
 a voice broke forth from the mist of smoke interrupted by another voice it was grantaire holding a dialogue with an adversary 
 grantaire was sitting opposite another figure at a marble table strewn with grains of bran and dotted with dominos 
 he was hammering the table with his fist and this is what enjolras heard 
 
 fours 
 the pig 
 i have no more 
 you are dead 
 a two 
 six

 one 
 my move 
 four points 
 not much 
 your turn

 book eleven 
 chapter ii 
 
 the forces of a dozen european nations burst into russia the russian army and people avoided a collision till smolensk was reached and again from smolensk to borodino the french army pushed on to moscow its goal its impetus ever increasing as it neared its aim just as the velocity of a falling body increases as it approaches the earth behind it were seven hundred miles of hostile country ahead were a few dozen miles separating it from its goal every soldier in army felt this and the invasion moved on by its own momentum 
 the more the russian army retreated the more fiercely a spirit of hatred of the enemy flared up and while it retreated the army increased and consolidated at borodino a collision took place neither army was broken up but the russian army retreated immediately after the collision as inevitably as a ball recoils after colliding with another having a greater momentum and with equal inevitability the ball of invasion that had advanced with such momentum rolled on for some distance though the collision had deprived it of all its force 
 the russians retreated eighty miles to beyond moscow and the french reached moscow and there came to a standstill for five weeks after that there was not a single battle the french did not move as a bleeding mortally wounded animal licks its wounds they remained inert in moscow for five weeks and then suddenly with no fresh reason fled back they made a dash for the kaluga road and after a victory for at the field of conflict again remained theirs without undertaking a single serious battle they fled still more rapidly back to smolensk beyond smolensk beyond the berezina beyond vilna and farther still 
 on the evening of the of august kutuzov and the whole russian army were convinced that the battle of borodino was a victory kutuzov reported so to the emperor he gave orders to prepare for a fresh conflict to finish the enemy and did this not to deceive anyone but because he knew that the enemy was beaten as everyone who had taken part in the battle knew it 
 but all that evening and next day reports came in one after another of losses of the loss of half the army and a fresh battle proved physically impossible 
 it was impossible to give battle before information had been collected the wounded gathered in the supplies of ammunition replenished the slain reckoned up new officers appointed to replace those who had been killed and before the men had had food and sleep and meanwhile the very next morning after the battle the french army advanced of itself upon the russians carried forward by the force of its own momentum now seemingly increased in inverse proportion to the square of the distance from its aim wish was to attack next day and the whole army desired to do so but to make an attack the wish to do so is not sufficient there must also be a possibility of doing it and that possibility did not exist it was impossible not to retreat a march and then in the same way it was impossible not to retreat another and a third march and at last on the first of september when the army drew near moscow despite the strength of the feeling that had arisen in all ranks the force of circumstances compelled it to retire beyond moscow and the troops retired one more last march and abandoned moscow to the enemy 
 for people accustomed to think that plans of campaign and battles are made by generals as any one of us sitting over a map in his study may imagine how he would have arranged things in this or that battle the questions present themselves why did kutuzov during the retreat not do this or that why did he not take up a position before reaching fili why did he not retire at once by the kaluga road abandoning moscow and so on people accustomed to think in that way forget or do not know the inevitable conditions which always limit the activities of any commander in chief the activity of a commander in chief does not all resemble the activity we imagine to ourselves when we sit at case in our studies examining some campaign on the map with a certain number of troops on this and that side in a certain known locality and begin our plans from some given moment a commander in chief is never dealing with the beginning of any event the position from which we always contemplate it the commander in chief is always in the midst of a series of shifting events and so he never can at any moment consider the whole import of an event that is occurring moment by moment the event is imperceptibly shaping itself and at every moment of this continuous uninterrupted shaping of events the commander in chief is in the midst of a most complex play of intrigues worries contingencies authorities projects counsels threats and deceptions and is continually obliged to reply to innumerable questions addressed to him which constantly conflict with one another 
 learned military authorities quite seriously tell us that kutuzov should have moved his army to the kaluga road long before reaching fili and that somebody actually submitted such a proposal to him but a commander in chief especially at a difficult moment has always before him not one proposal but dozens simultaneously and all these proposals based on strategics and tactics contradict each other 
 a commander in business it would seem is simply to choose one of these projects but even that he cannot do events and time do not wait for instance on the it is suggested to him to cross to the kaluga road but just then an adjutant gallops up from miloradovich asking whether he is to engage the french or retire an order must be given him at once that instant and the order to retreat carries us past the turn to the kaluga road and after the adjutant comes the commissary general asking where the stores are to be taken and the chief of the hospitals asks where the wounded are to go and a courier from petersburg brings a letter from the sovereign which does not admit of the possibility of abandoning moscow and the commander in rival the man who is undermining him and there are always not merely one but several such presents a new project diametrically opposed to that of turning to the kaluga road and the commander in chief himself needs sleep and refreshment to maintain his energy and a respectable general who has been overlooked in the distribution of rewards comes to complain and the inhabitants of the district pray to be defended and an officer sent to inspect the locality comes in and gives a report quite contrary to what was said by the officer previously sent and a spy a prisoner and a general who has been on reconnaissance all describe the position of the army differently people accustomed to misunderstand or to forget these inevitable conditions of a commander in actions describe to us for instance the position of the army at fili and assume that the commander in chief could on the first of september quite freely decide whether to abandon moscow or defend it whereas with the russian army less than four miles from moscow no such question existed when had that question been settled at drissa and at smolensk and most palpably of all on the of august at shevardino and on the at borodino and each day and hour and minute of the retreat from borodino to fili

 the meadow 
 marius had witnessed the unexpected termination of the ambush upon whose track he had set javert but javert had no sooner quitted the building bearing off his prisoners in three than marius also glided out of the house 
 it was only nine in the evening 
 marius betook himself to courfeyrac courfeyrac was no longer the imperturbable inhabitant of the latin quarter he had gone to live in the rue de la verrerie for political reasons this quarter was one where at that epoch insurrection liked to install itself 
 marius said to courfeyrac i have come to sleep with you 
 courfeyrac dragged a mattress off his bed which was furnished with two spread it out on the floor and said 
 there 
 at seven on the following morning marius returned to the hovel paid the rent which he owed to bougon had his books his bed his table his commode and his two chairs loaded on a and went off without leaving his address so that when javert returned in the course of the morning for the purpose of questioning marius as to the events of the preceding evening he found only bougon who answered moved away 
 bougon was convinced that marius was to some extent an accomplice of the robbers who had been seized the night before who would ever have said it she exclaimed to the portresses of the quarter a young man like that who had the air of a girl 
 marius had two reasons for this prompt change of residence the first was that he now had a horror of that house where he had beheld so close at hand and in its most repulsive and most ferocious development a social deformity which is perhaps even more terrible than the wicked rich man the wicked poor man the second was that he did not wish to figure in the lawsuit which would insue in all probability and be brought in to testify against thenardier 
 javert thought that the young man whose name he had forgotten was afraid and had fled or perhaps had not even returned home at the time of the ambush he made some efforts to find him however but without success 
 a month passed then another 
 marius was still with courfeyrac he had learned from a young licentiate in law an habitual frequenter of the courts that thenardier was in close confinement 
 every monday marius had five francs handed in to the office of la force for thenardier 
 as marius had no longer any money he borrowed the five francs from courfeyrac 
 it was the first time in his life that he had ever borrowed money 
 these periodical five francs were a double riddle to courfeyrac who lent and to thenardier who received them 
 to whom can they go thought courfeyrac 
 whence can this come to me thenardier asked himself 
 moreover marius was everything had plunged through a once more 
 he no longer saw anything before him his life was again buried in mystery where he wandered fumblingly he had for a moment beheld very close at hand in that obscurity the young girl whom he loved the old man who seemed to be her father those unknown beings who were his only interest and his only hope in this world and at the very moment when he thought himself on the point of grasping them a gust had swept all these shadows away not a spark of certainty and truth had been emitted even in the most terrible of collisions 
 no conjecture was possible 
 he no longer knew even the name that he thought he knew 
 it certainly was not ursule 
 and the lark was a nickname 
 and what was he to think of the old man 
 was he actually in hiding from the police the workman whom marius had encountered in the vicinity of the invalides recurred to his mind 
 it now seemed probable that that workingman and m leblanc were one and the same person 
 so he disguised himself 
 that man had his heroic and his equivocal sides why had he not called for help 
 why had he fled 
 was he or was he not the father of the young girl 
 was he in short the man whom thenardier thought that he recognized 
 thenardier might have been mistaken 
 these formed so many insoluble problems all this it is true detracted nothing from the angelic charms of the young girl of the luxembourg 
 distress marius bore a passion in his heart and night over his eyes he was thrust onward he was drawn and he could not stir all had vanished save love 
 of love itself he had lost the instincts and the sudden illuminations 
 ordinarily this flame which burns us lights us also a little and casts some useful gleams without but marius no longer even heard these mute counsels of passion he never said to himself 
 what if i were to go to such a place what if i were to try such and such a thing 
 the girl whom he could no longer call ursule was evidently somewhere nothing warned marius in what direction he should seek her 
 his whole life was now summed up in two words absolute uncertainty within an impenetrable fog to see her once again he still aspired to this but he no longer expected it 
 to crown all his poverty had returned 
 he felt that icy breath close to him on his heels 
 in the midst of his torments and long before this he had discontinued his work and nothing is more dangerous than discontinued work it is a habit which vanishes a habit which is easy to get rid of and difficult to take up again 
 a certain amount of dreaming is good like a narcotic in discreet doses it lulls to sleep the fevers of the mind at labor which are sometimes severe and produces in the spirit a soft and fresh vapor which corrects the contours of pure thought fills in gaps here and there binds together and rounds off the angles of the ideas 
 but too much dreaming sinks and drowns woe to the who allows himself to fall entirely from thought into revery 
 he thinks that he can with equal ease and he tells himself that after all it is the same thing 
 error 
 thought is the toil of the intelligence revery its voluptuousness to replace thought with revery is to confound a poison with a food 
 marius had begun in that way as the reader will remember passion had supervened and had finished the work of precipitating him into chimaeras without object or bottom 
 one no longer emerges from self except for the purpose of going off to dream idle production 
 tumultuous and stagnant gulf 
 and in proportion as labor diminishes needs increase 
 this is a law 
 man in a state of revery is generally prodigal and slack the unstrung mind cannot hold life within close bounds 
 there is in that mode of life good mingled with evil for if enervation is baleful generosity is good and healthful but the poor man who is generous and noble and who does not work is lost 
 resources are exhausted needs crop up 
 fatal declivity down which the most honest and the firmest as well as the most feeble and most vicious are drawn and which ends in one of two holds suicide or crime 
 by dint of going outdoors to think the day comes when one goes out to throw self in the water 
 excess of revery breeds men like escousse and lebras 
 marius was descending this declivity at a slow pace with his eyes fixed on the girl whom he no longer saw 
 what we have just written seems strange and yet it is true 
 the memory of an absent being kindles in the darkness of the heart the more it has disappeared the more it beams the gloomy and despairing soul sees this light on its horizon the star of the inner night 
 was marius whole thought 
 he meditated of nothing else he was confusedly conscious that his old coat was becoming an impossible coat and that his new coat was growing old that his shirts were wearing out that his hat was wearing out that his boots were giving out and he said to himself 
 if i could but see her once again before i die 
 one sweet idea alone was left to him that she had loved him that her glance had told him so that she did not know his name but that she did know his soul and that wherever she was however mysterious the place she still loved him perhaps who knows whether she were not thinking of him as he was thinking of her 
 sometimes in those inexplicable hours such as are experienced by every heart that loves though he had no reasons for anything but sadness and yet felt an obscure quiver of joy he said to himself it is her thoughts that are coming to me 
 then he added perhaps my thoughts reach her also 
 this illusion at which he shook his head a moment later was sufficient nevertheless to throw beams which at times resembled hope into his soul 
 from time to time especially at that evening hour which is the most depressing to even the dreamy he allowed the purest the most impersonal the most ideal of the reveries which filled his brain to fall upon a notebook which contained nothing else 
 he called this writing to her 
 it must not be supposed that his reason was deranged quite the contrary 
 he had lost the faculty of working and of moving firmly towards any fixed goal but he was endowed with more and rectitude than ever 
 marius surveyed by a calm and real although peculiar light what passed before his eyes even the most indifferent deeds and men he pronounced a just criticism on everything with a sort of honest dejection and candid disinterestedness 
 his judgment which was almost wholly disassociated from hope held itself aloof and soared on high 
 in this state of mind nothing escaped him nothing deceived him and every moment he was discovering the foundation of life of humanity and of destiny 
 happy even in the midst of anguish is he to whom god has given a soul worthy of love and of unhappiness he who has not viewed the things of this world and the heart of man under this double light has seen nothing and knows nothing of the true 
 the soul which loves and suffers is in a state of sublimity 
 however day followed day and nothing new presented itself it merely seemed to him that the sombre space which still remained to be traversed by him was growing shorter with every instant he thought that he already distinctly perceived the brink of the bottomless abyss 
 what he repeated to himself shall i not see her again before then 
 when you have ascended the rue left the barrier on one side and followed the old inner boulevard for some distance you reach the rue de la sante then the glaciere and a little while before arriving at the little river of the gobelins you come to a sort of field which is the only spot in the long and monotonous chain of the boulevards of paris where ruysdeel would be tempted to sit down 
 there is something indescribable there which exhales grace a green meadow traversed by tightly stretched lines from which flutter rags drying in the wind and an old house built in the time of louis xiii with its great roof oddly pierced with dormer windows dilapidated palisades a little water amid women voices laughter on the horizon the pantheon the pole of the the black squat fantastic amusing magnificent and in the background the severe square crests of the towers of notre dame 
 as the place is worth looking at no one goes thither 
 hardly one cart or wagoner passes in a quarter of an hour 
 it chanced that marius solitary strolls led him to this plot of ground near the water 
 that day there was a rarity on the boulevard a marius vaguely impressed with the almost savage beauty of the place asked this is the name of this spot 
 the person replied 
 it is the meadow 
 and he added 
 it was here that ulbach killed the shepherdess of ivry 
 but after the word lark marius heard nothing more 
 these sudden congealments in the state of revery which a single word suffices to evoke do occur 
 the entire thought is abruptly condensed around an idea and it is no longer capable of perceiving anything else 
 the lark was the appellation which had replaced ursule in the depths of marius said he with a sort of unreasoning stupor peculiar to these mysterious asides this is her meadow i shall know where she lives now 
 it was absurd but irresistible 
 and every day he returned to that meadow of the lark 
 the meadow 
 marius had witnessed the unexpected termination of the ambush upon whose track he had set javert but javert had no sooner quitted the building bearing off his prisoners in three than marius also glided out of the house 
 it was only nine in the evening 
 marius betook himself to courfeyrac courfeyrac was no longer the imperturbable inhabitant of the latin quarter he had gone to live in the rue de la verrerie for political reasons this quarter was one where at that epoch insurrection liked to install itself

 he no longer knew even the name that he thought he knew 
 it certainly was not ursule 
 and the lark was a nickname 
 and what was he to think of the old man 
 was he actually in hiding from the police the workman whom marius had encountered in the vicinity of the invalides recurred to his mind 
 it now seemed probable that that workingman and m leblanc were one and the same person 
 so he disguised himself 
 that man had his heroic and his equivocal sides why had he not called for help 
 why had he fled 
 was he or was he not the father of the young girl 
 was he in short the man whom thenardier thought that he recognized 
 thenardier might have been mistaken 
 these formed so many insoluble problems all this it is true detracted nothing from the angelic charms of the young girl of the luxembourg 
 distress marius bore a passion in his heart and night over his eyes he was thrust onward he was drawn and he could not stir all had vanished save love 
 of love itself he had lost the instincts and the sudden illuminations 
 ordinarily this flame which burns us lights us also a little and casts some useful gleams without but marius no longer even heard these mute counsels of passion he never said to himself 
 what if i were to go to such a place what if i were to try such and such a thing 
 the girl whom he could no longer call ursule was evidently somewhere nothing warned marius in what direction he should seek her 
 his whole life was now summed up in two words absolute uncertainty within an impenetrable fog to see her once again he still aspired to this but he no longer expected it 
 to crown all his poverty had returned 
 he felt that icy breath close to him on his heels 
 in the midst of his torments and long before this he had discontinued his work and nothing is more dangerous than discontinued work it is a habit which vanishes a habit which is easy to get rid of and difficult to take up again 
 a certain amount of dreaming is good like a narcotic in discreet doses it lulls to sleep the fevers of the mind at labor which are sometimes severe and produces in the spirit a soft and fresh vapor which corrects the contours of pure thought fills in gaps here and there binds together and rounds off the angles of the ideas 
 but too much dreaming sinks and drowns woe to the who allows himself to fall entirely from thought into revery 
 he thinks that he can with equal ease and he tells himself that after all it is the same thing 
 error 
 thought is the toil of the intelligence revery its voluptuousness to replace thought with revery is to confound a poison with a food 
 marius had begun in that way as the reader will remember passion had supervened and had finished the work of precipitating him into chimaeras without object or bottom 
 one no longer emerges from self except for the purpose of going off to dream idle production 
 tumultuous and stagnant gulf 
 and in proportion as labor diminishes needs increase 
 this is a law 
 man in a state of revery is generally prodigal and slack the unstrung mind cannot hold life within close bounds 
 there is in that mode of life good mingled with evil for if enervation is baleful generosity is good and healthful but the poor man who is generous and noble and who does not work is lost 
 resources are exhausted needs crop up 
 fatal declivity down which the most honest and the firmest as well as the most feeble and most vicious are drawn and which ends in one of two holds suicide or crime 
 by dint of going outdoors to think the day comes when one goes out to throw self in the water 
 excess of revery breeds men like escousse and lebras 
 marius was descending this declivity at a slow pace with his eyes fixed on the girl whom he no longer saw 
 what we have just written seems strange and yet it is true 
 the memory of an absent being kindles in the darkness of the heart the more it has disappeared the more it beams the gloomy and despairing soul sees this light on its horizon the star of the inner night 
 was marius whole thought 
 he meditated of nothing else he was confusedly conscious that his old coat was becoming an impossible coat and that his new coat was growing old that his shirts were wearing out that his hat was wearing out that his boots were giving out and he said to himself 
 if i could but see her once again before i die 
 one sweet idea alone was left to him that she had loved him that her glance had told him so that she did not know his name but that she did know his soul and that wherever she was however mysterious the place she still loved him perhaps who knows whether she were not thinking of him as he was thinking of her 
 sometimes in those inexplicable hours such as are experienced by every heart that loves though he had no reasons for anything but sadness and yet felt an obscure quiver of joy he said to himself it is her thoughts that are coming to me 
 then he added perhaps my thoughts reach her also 
 this illusion at which he shook his head a moment later was sufficient nevertheless to throw beams which at times resembled hope into his soul 
 from time to time especially at that evening hour which is the most depressing to even the dreamy he allowed the purest the most impersonal the most ideal of the reveries which filled his brain to fall upon a notebook which contained nothing else 
 he called this writing to her 
 it must not be supposed that his reason was deranged quite the contrary 
 he had lost the faculty of working and of moving firmly towards any fixed goal but he was endowed with more and rectitude than ever 
 marius surveyed by a calm and real although peculiar light what passed before his eyes even the most indifferent deeds and men he pronounced a just criticism on everything with a sort of honest dejection and candid disinterestedness 
 his judgment which was almost wholly disassociated from hope held itself aloof and soared on high 
 in this state of mind nothing escaped him nothing deceived him and every moment he was discovering the foundation of life of humanity and of destiny 
 happy even in the midst of anguish is he to whom god has given a soul worthy of love and of unhappiness he who has not viewed the things of this world and the heart of man under this double light has seen nothing and knows nothing of the true 
 the soul which loves and suffers is in a state of sublimity 
 however day followed day and nothing new presented itself it merely seemed to him that the sombre space which still remained to be traversed by him was growing shorter with every instant he thought that he already distinctly perceived the brink of the bottomless abyss 
 what he repeated to himself shall i not see her again before then 
 when you have ascended the rue left the barrier on one side and followed the old inner boulevard for some distance you reach the rue de la sante then the glaciere and a little while before arriving at the little river of the gobelins you come to a sort of field which is the only spot in the long and monotonous chain of the boulevards of paris where ruysdeel would be tempted to sit down 
 there is something indescribable there which exhales grace a green meadow traversed by tightly stretched lines from which flutter rags drying in the wind and an old house built in the time of louis xiii with its great roof oddly pierced with dormer windows dilapidated palisades a little water amid women voices laughter on the horizon the pantheon the pole of the the black squat fantastic amusing magnificent and in the background the severe square crests of the towers of notre dame 
 as the place is worth looking at no one goes thither 
 hardly one cart or wagoner passes in a quarter of an hour 
 it chanced that marius solitary strolls led him to this plot of ground near the water 
 that day there was a rarity on the boulevard a marius vaguely impressed with the almost savage beauty of the place asked this is the name of this spot 
 the person replied 
 it is the meadow 
 and he added 
 it was here that ulbach killed the shepherdess of ivry 
 but after the word lark marius heard nothing more 
 these sudden congealments in the state of revery which a single word suffices to evoke do occur 
 the entire thought is abruptly condensed around an idea and it is no longer capable of perceiving anything else 
 the lark was the appellation which had replaced ursule in the depths of marius said he with a sort of unreasoning stupor peculiar to these mysterious asides this is her meadow i shall know where she lives now 
 it was absurd but irresistible 
 and every day he returned to that meadow of the lark

 chapter iii 
 
 when ermolov having been sent by kutuzov to inspect the position told the field marshal that it was impossible to fight there before moscow and that they must retreat kutuzov looked at him in silence 
 give me your hand said he and turning it over so as to feel the pulse added you are not well my dear fellow think what you are saying 
 kutuzov could not yet admit the possibility of retreating beyond moscow without a battle 
 on the poklonny hill four miles from the dorogomilov gate of moscow kutuzov got out of his carriage and sat down on a bench by the roadside a great crowd of generals gathered round him and count rostopchin who had come out from moscow joined them this brilliant company separated into several groups who all discussed the advantages and disadvantages of the position the state of the army the plans suggested the situation of moscow and military questions generally though they had not been summoned for the purpose and though it was not so called they all felt that this was really a council of war the conversations all dealt with public questions if anyone gave or asked for personal news it was done in a whisper and they immediately reverted to general matters no jokes or laughter or smiles even were seen among all these men they evidently all made an effort to hold themselves at the height the situation demanded and all these groups while talking among themselves tried to keep near the commander in chief whose bench formed the center of the gathering and to speak so that he might overhear them the commander in chief listened to what was being said and sometimes asked them to repeat their remarks but did not himself take part in the conversations or express any opinion after hearing what was being said by one or other of these groups he generally turned away with an air of disappointment as though they were not speaking of anything he wished to hear some discussed the position that had been chosen criticizing not the position itself so much as the mental capacity of those who had chosen it others argued that a mistake had been made earlier and that a battle should have been fought two days before others again spoke of the battle of salamanca which was described by crosart a newly arrived frenchman in a spanish uniform this frenchman and one of the german princes serving with the russian army were discussing the siege of saragossa and considering the possibility of defending moscow in a similar manner count rostopchin was telling a fourth group that he was prepared to die with the city train bands under the walls of the capital but that he still could not help regretting having been left in ignorance of what was happening and that had he known it sooner things would have been different a fifth group displaying the profundity of their strategic perceptions discussed the direction the troops would now have to take a sixth group was talking absolute nonsense expression grew more and more preoccupied and gloomy from all this talk he saw only one thing that to defend moscow was a physical impossibility in the full meaning of those words that is to say so utterly impossible that if any senseless commander were to give orders to fight confusion would result but the battle would still not take place it would not take place because the commanders not merely all recognized the position to be impossible but in their conversations were only discussing what would happen after its inevitable abandonment how could the commanders lead their troops to a field of battle they considered it impossible to hold the officers and even the soldiers who too reason also considered the position impossible and therefore could not go to fight fully convinced as they were of defeat if bennigsen insisted on the position being defended and others still discussed it the question was no longer important in itself but only as a pretext for disputes and intrigue this kutuzov knew well 
 bennigsen who had chosen the position warmly displayed his russian patriotism kutuzov could not listen to this without wincing by insisting that moscow must be defended his aim was as clear as daylight to kutuzov if the defense failed to throw the blame on kutuzov who had brought the army as far as the sparrow hills without giving battle if it succeeded to claim the success as his own or if battle were not given to clear himself of the crime of abandoning moscow but this intrigue did not now occupy the old mind one terrible question absorbed him and to that question he heard no reply from anyone the question for him now was have i really allowed napoleon to reach moscow and when did i do so when was it decided can it have been yesterday when i ordered platov to retreat or was it the evening before when i had a nap and told bennigsen to issue orders or was it earlier still when when was this terrible affair decided moscow must be abandoned the army must retreat and the order to do so must be given to give that terrible order seemed to him equivalent to resigning the command of the army and not only did he love power to which he was accustomed the honours awarded to prince prozorovski under whom he had served in turkey galled him but he was convinced that he was destined to save russia and that that was why against the wish and by the will of the people he had been chosen commander in chief he was convinced that he alone could maintain command of the army in these difficult circumstances and that in all the world he alone could encounter the invincible napoleon without fear and he was horrified at the thought of the order he had to issue but something had to be decided and these conversations around him which were assuming too free a character must be stopped 
 he called the most important generals to him 
 my head be it good or bad must depend on itself said he rising from the bench and he rode to fili where his carriages were waiting

 embryonic formation of crimes in the incubation of prisons 
 triumph in the gorbeau hovel seemed complete but had not been so 
 in the first place and this constituted the principal anxiety javert had not taken the prisoner prisoner 
 the assassinated man who flees is more suspicious than the assassin and it is probable that this personage who had been so precious a capture for the ruffians would be no less fine a prize for the authorities 
 and then montparnasse had escaped javert 
 another opportunity of laying hands on that dandy must be waited for 
 montparnasse had in fact encountered eponine as she stood on the watch under the trees of the boulevard and had led her off preferring to play nemorin with the daughter rather than schinderhannes with the father 
 it was well that he did so he was free 
 as for eponine javert had caused her to be seized a mediocre consolation 
 eponine had joined azelma at les madelonettes 
 and finally on the way from the gorbeau house to la force one of the principal prisoners claquesous had been lost 
 it was not known how this had been effected the police agents and the sergeants could not understand it at all 
 he had converted himself into vapor he had slipped through the handcuffs he had trickled through the crevices of the carriage the fiacre was cracked and he had fled all that they were able to say was that on arriving at the prison there was no claquesous 
 either the fairies or the police had had a hand in it 
 had claquesous melted into the shadows like a in water 
 had there been unavowed connivance of the police agents did this man belong to the double enigma of order and disorder was he concentric with infraction and repression 
 had this sphinx his fore paws in crime and his hind paws in authority javert did not accept such comminations and would have bristled up against such compromises but his squad included other inspectors besides himself who were more initiated than he perhaps although they were his subordinates in the secrets of the prefecture and claquesous had been such a villain that he might make a very good agent it is an excellent thing for ruffianism and an admirable thing for the police to be on such intimate juggling terms with the night these rascals do exist 
 however that may be claquesous had gone astray and was not found again 
 javert appeared to be more irritated than amazed at this 
 as for marius that booby of a lawyer who had probably become frightened and whose name javert had forgotten javert attached very little importance to him 
 moreover a lawyer can be hunted up at any time 
 but was he a lawyer after all 
 the investigation had begun 
 the magistrate had thought it advisable not to put one of these men of the band of patron minette in close confinement in the hope that he would chatter 
 this man was brujon the man of the rue du he had been let loose in the charlemagne courtyard and the eyes of the watchers were fixed on him 
 this name of brujon is one of the souvenirs of la force in that hideous courtyard called the court of the new building which the administration called the court and which the robbers called the the ditch on that wall covered with scales and leprosy which rose on the left to a level with the roofs near an old door of rusty iron which led to the ancient chapel of the ducal residence of la force then turned in a dormitory for ruffians there could still be seen twelve years ago a sort of fortress roughly carved in the stone with a nail and beneath it this signature 
 brujon 
 the brujon of was the father of the brujon of 
 the latter of whom the reader caught but a glimpse at the gorbeau house was a very cunning and very adroit young spark with a bewildered and plaintive air 
 it was in consequence of this plaintive air that the magistrate had released him thinking him more useful in the charlemagne yard than in close confinement 
 robbers do not interrupt their profession because they are in the hands of justice 
 they do not let themselves be put out by such a trifle as that 
 to be in prison for one crime is no reason for not beginning on another crime 
 they are artists who have one picture in the salon and who toil none the less on a new work in their studios 
 brujon seemed to be stupefied by prison 
 he could sometimes be seen standing by the hour together in front of the window in the charlemagne yard staring like an idiot at the sordid list of prices which began with 
 garlic centimes and ended with 
 cigar centimes 
 or he passed his time in trembling chattering his teeth saying that he had a fever and inquiring whether one of the eight and twenty beds in the fever ward was vacant 
 all at once towards the end of february it was discovered that brujon that somnolent fellow had had three different commissions executed by the of the establishment not under his own name but in the name of three of his comrades and they had cost him in all fifty sous an exorbitant outlay which attracted the attention of the prison corporal 
 inquiries were instituted and on consulting the tariff of commissions posted in the parlor it was learned that the fifty sous could be analyzed as follows 
 three commissions one to the pantheon ten sous one to fifteen sous and one to the barriere de grenelle sous 
 this last was the dearest of the whole tariff 
 now at the pantheon at the and at the barriere de grenelle were situated the domiciles of the three very redoubtable prowlers of the barriers kruideniers alias bizarre glorieux an and upon whom the attention of the police was directed by this incident it was thought that these men were members of patron minette two of those leaders babet and gueulemer had been captured it was supposed that the messages which had been addressed not to houses but to people who were waiting for them in the street must have contained information with regard to some crime that had been plotted 
 they were in possession of other indications they laid hand on the three prowlers and supposed that they had circumvented some one or other of machinations 
 about a week after these measures had been taken one night as the superintendent of the watch who had been inspecting the lower dormitory in the was about to drop his chestnut in the was the means adopted to make sure that the watchmen performed their duties punctually every hour a chestnut must be dropped into all the boxes nailed to the doors of the dormitories a watchman looked through the of the dormitory and beheld brujon sitting on his bed and writing something by the light of the the guardian entered brujon was put in a solitary cell for a month but they were not able to seize what he had written the police learned nothing further about it 
 what is certain is that on the following morning a postilion was flung from the charlemagne yard into the lions ditch over the building which separated the two 
 what prisoners call a postilion is a pallet of bread artistically moulded which is sent into ireland that is to say over the roofs of a prison from one courtyard to another etymology 
 over england from one land to another into ireland this little pellet falls in the yard 
 the man who picks it up opens it and finds in it a note addressed to some prisoner in that yard if it is a prisoner who finds the treasure he forwards the note to its destination if it is a keeper or one of the prisoners secretly sold who are called sheep in prisons and foxes in the galleys the note is taken to the office and handed over to the police 
 on this occasion the postilion reached its address although the person to whom it was addressed was at that moment in solitary confinement 
 this person was no other than babet one of the four heads of patron minette 
 the postilion contained a roll of paper on which only these two lines were written 
 babet 
 there is an affair in the rue plumet 
 a gate on a garden 
 this is what brujon had written the night before 
 in spite of male and female searchers babet managed to pass the note on from la force to the salpetriere to a good friend whom he had and who was shut up there 
 this woman in turn transmitted the note to another woman of her acquaintance a certain magnon who was strongly suspected by the police though not yet arrested this magnon whose name the reader has already seen had relations with the thenardier which will be described in detail later on and she could by going to see eponine serve as a bridge between the salpetriere and les madelonettes 
 it happened that at precisely that moment as proofs were wanting in the investigation directed against thenardier in the matter of his daughters eponine and azelma were released 
 when eponine came out magnon who was watching the gate of the madelonettes handed her note to babet charging her to look into the matter 
 eponine went to the rue plumet recognized the gate and the garden observed the house spied lurked and a few days later brought to magnon who delivers in the rue clocheperce a biscuit which magnon transmitted to mistress in the salpetriere a biscuit in the shady symbolism of prisons signifies 
 nothing to be done 
 so that in less than a week from that time as brujon and babet met in the circle of la force the one on his way to the examination the other on his way from it 
 well asked brujon the rue p 
 biscuit replied babet 
 thus did the foetus of crime engendered by brujon in la force miscarry 
 this miscarriage had its consequences however which were perfectly distinct from programme 
 the reader will see what they were 
 often when we think we are knotting one thread we are tying quite another

 chapteriv iv 
 
 the council of war began to assemble at two in the afternoon in the better and roomier part of andrew hut the men women and children of the large peasant family crowded into the back room across the passage only malasha granddaughter whom his serene highness had petted and to whom he had given a lump of sugar while drinking his tea remained on the top of the brick oven in the larger room malasha looked down from the oven with shy delight at the faces uniforms and decorations of the generals who one after another came into the room and sat down on the broad benches in the corner under the icons granddad himself as malasha in her own mind called kutuzov sat apart in a dark corner behind the oven he sat sunk deep in a folding armchair and continually cleared his throat and pulled at the collar of his coat which though it was unbuttoned still seemed to pinch his neck those who entered went up one by one to the field marshal he pressed the hands of some and nodded to others his adjutant kaysarov was about to draw back the curtain of the window facing kutuzov but the latter moved his hand angrily and kaysarov understood that his serene highness did not wish his face to be seen 
 round the deal table on which lay maps plans pencils and papers so many people gathered that the orderlies brought in another bench and put it beside the table ermolov kaysarov and toll who had just arrived sat down on this bench in the foremost place immediately under the icons sat barclay de tolly his high forehead merging into his bald crown he had a st cross round his neck and looked pale and ill he had been feverish for two days and was now shivering and in pain beside him sat uvarov who with rapid gesticulations was giving him some information speaking in low tones as they all did chubby little dokhturov was listening attentively with eyebrows raised and arms folded on his stomach on the other side sat count seemingly absorbed in his own thoughts his broad head with its bold features and glittering eyes was resting on his hand raevski twitching forward the black hair on his temples as was his habit glanced now at kutuzov and now at the door with a look of impatience firm handsome and kindly face was lit up by a tender sly smile his glance met and the expression of his eyes caused the little girl to smile 
 they were all waiting for bennigsen who on the pretext of inspecting the position was finishing his savory dinner they waited for him from four till six and did not begin their deliberations all that time talked in low tones of other matters 
 only when bennigsen had entered the hut did kutuzov leave his corner and draw toward the table but not near enough for the candles that had been placed there to light up his face 
 bennigsen opened the council with the question are we to abandon ancient and sacred capital without a struggle or are we to defend it a prolonged and general silence followed there was a frown on every face and only angry grunts and occasional cough broke the silence all eyes were gazing at him malasha too looked at granddad she was nearest to him and saw how his face puckered he seemed about to cry but this did not last long 
 ancient and sacred capital he suddenly said repeating words in an angry voice and thereby drawing attention to the false note in them allow me to tell you your excellency that that question has no meaning for a russian he lurched his heavy body forward such a question cannot be put it is senseless the question i have asked these gentlemen to meet to discuss is a military one the question is that of saving russia is it better to give up moscow without a battle or by accepting battle to risk losing the army as well as moscow that is the question on which i want your opinion and he sank back in his chair 
 the discussion began bennigsen did not yet consider his game lost admitting the view of barclay and others that a defensive battle at fili was impossible but imbued with russian patriotism and the love of moscow he proposed to move troops from the right to the left flank during the night and attack the french right flank the following day opinions were divided and arguments were advanced for and against that project ermolov dokhturov and raevski agreed with bennigsen whether feeling it necessary to make a sacrifice before abandoning the capital or guided by other personal considerations these generals seemed not to understand that this council could not alter the inevitable course of events and that moscow was in effect already abandoned the other generals however understood it and leaving aside the question of moscow of the direction the army should take in its retreat malasha who kept her eyes fixed on what was going on before her understood the meaning of the council differently it seemed to her that it was only a personal struggle between granddad and as she termed bennigsen she saw that they grew spiteful when they spoke to one another and in her heart she sided with granddad in the midst of the conversation she noticed granddad give bennigsen a quick subtle glance and then to her joys he saw that granddad said something to which settled him bennigsen suddenly reddened and paced angrily up and down the room what so affected him was calm and quiet comment on the advantage or disadvantage of proposal to move troops by night from the right to the left flank to attack the french right wing 
 gentlemen said kutuzov i cannot approve of the plan moving troops in close proximity to an enemy is always dangerous and military history supports that view for instance kutuzov seemed to reflect searching for an example then with a clear naive look at bennigsen he added oh yes take the battle of friedland which i think the count well remembers and which was not fully successful only because our troops were rearranged too near the enemy 
 there followed a momentary pause which seemed very long to them all 
 the discussion recommenced but pauses frequently occurred and they all felt that there was no more to be said 
 during one of these pauses kutuzov heaved a deep sigh as if preparing to speak they all looked at him 
 well gentlemen i see that it is i who will have to pay for the broken crockery said he and rising slowly he moved to the table gentlemen i have heard your views some of you will not agree with me but i he paused by the authority entrusted to me by my sovereign and country order a retreat 
 after that the generals began to disperse with the solemnity and circumspect silence of people who are leaving after a funeral 
 some of the generals in low tones and in a strain very different from the way they had spoken during the council communicated something to their commander in chief 
 malasha who had long been expected for supper climbed carefully backwards down from the oven her bare little feet catching at its projections and slipping between the legs of the generals she darted out of the room 
 when he had dismissed the generals kutuzov sat a long time with his elbows on the table thinking always of the same terrible question when when did the abandonment of moscow become inevitable when was that done which settled the matter and who was to blame for it 
 i did not expect this said he to his adjutant schneider when the latter came in late that night i did not expect this i did not think this would happen 
 you should take some rest your serene highness replied schneider 
 but no they shall eat horseflesh yet like the turks exclaimed kutuzov without replying striking the table with his podgy fist they shall too if only

 apparition to father mabeuf 
 marius no longer went to see any one but he sometimes encountered father mabeuf by chance 
 while marius was slowly descending those melancholy steps which may be called the cellar stairs and which lead to places without light where the happy can be heard walking overhead m mabeuf was descending on his side 
 the flora of cauteretz no longer sold at all 
 the experiments on indigo had not been successful in the little garden of austerlitz which had a bad exposure 
 m mabeuf could cultivate there only a few plants which love shade and dampness 
 nevertheless he did not become discouraged 
 he had obtained a corner in the jardin des plantes with a good exposure to make his trials with indigo at his own expense 
 for this purpose he had pawned his copperplates of the flora 
 he had reduced his breakfast to two eggs and he left one of these for his old servant to whom he had paid no wages for the last fifteen months 
 and often his breakfast was his only meal he no longer smiled with his infantile smile he had grown morose and no longer received visitors 
 marius did well not to dream of going thither 
 sometimes at the hour when m mabeuf was on his way to the jardin des plantes the old man and the young man passed each other on the boulevard de they did not speak and only exchanged a melancholy sign of the head 
 a thing it is that there comes a moment when misery looses bonds two men who have been friends become two chance 
 royal the bookseller was dead 
 m mabeuf no longer knew his books his garden or his indigo 
 these were the three forms which happiness pleasure and hope had assumed for him 
 this sufficed him for his living 
 he said to himself 
 when i shall have made my balls of blueing i shall be rich i will withdraw my copperplates from the i will put my flora in vogue again with trickery plenty of money and advertisements in the newspapers and i will buy i know well where a copy of pierre de art de naviguer with edition of 
 in the meantime he toiled all day over his plot of indigo and at night he returned home to water his garden and to read his books 
 at that epoch m mabeuf was nearly eighty years of age 
 one evening he had a singular apparition 
 he had returned home while it was still broad daylight mother plutarque whose health was declining was ill and in bed he had dined on a bone on which a little meat lingered and a bit of bread that he had found on the kitchen table and had seated himself on an overturned stone post which took the place of a bench in his garden 
 near this bench there rose after the fashion in a sort of large chest of beams and planks much dilapidated a on the ground floor a on the first there was nothing in the hutch but there were a few apples in the remains of the provision 
 m mabeuf had set himself to turning over and reading with the aid of his glasses two books of which he was passionately fond and in which a serious thing at his age he was interested his natural timidity rendered him accessible to the acceptance of superstitions in a certain degree 
 the first of these books was the famous treatise of president delancre de des demons the other was a quarto by mutor de la rubaudiere sur les diables de vauvert et les gobelins de la bievre 
 this old volume interested him all the more because his garden had been one of the spots haunted by goblins in former times 
 the twilight had begun to whiten what was on high and to blacken all below as he read over the top of the book which he held in his hand father mabeuf was surveying his plants and among others a magnificent rhododendron which was one of his consolations four days of heat wind and sun without a drop of rain had passed the stalks were bending the buds drooping the leaves falling all this needed water the rhododendron was particularly sad father mabeuf was one of those persons for whom plants have souls the old man had toiled all day over his indigo plot he was worn out with fatigue but he rose laid his books on the bench and walked all bent over and with tottering footsteps to the well but when he had grasped the chain he could not even draw it sufficiently to unhook it 
 then he turned round and cast a glance of anguish toward heaven which was becoming studded with stars 
 the evening had that serenity which overwhelms the troubles of man beneath an indescribably mournful and eternal joy 
 the night promised to be as arid as the day had been 
 stars everywhere thought the old man not the tiniest cloud not a drop of water 
 and his head which had been upraised for a moment fell back upon his breast 
 he raised it again and once more looked at the sky murmuring 
 a tear of dew 
 a little pity 
 he tried again to unhook the chain of the well and could not 
 at that moment he heard a voice saying 
 father mabeuf would you like to have me water your garden for you 
 at the same time a noise as of a wild animal passing became audible in the hedge and he beheld emerging from the shrubbery a sort of tall slender girl who drew herself up in front of him and stared boldly at him 
 she had less the air of a human being than of a form which had just blossomed forth from the twilight 
 before father mabeuf who was easily terrified and who was as we have said quick to take alarm was able to reply by a single syllable this being whose movements had a sort of odd abruptness in the darkness had unhooked the chain plunged in and withdrawn the bucket and filled the and the goodman beheld this apparition which had bare feet and a tattered petticoat running about among the distributing life around her 
 the sound of the on the leaves filled father soul with ecstasy it seemed to him that the rhododendron was happy now 
 the first bucketful emptied the girl drew a second then a third she watered the whole garden 
 there was something about her as she thus ran about among paths where her outline appeared perfectly black waving her angular arms and with her fichu all in rags that resembled a bat 
 when she had finished father mabeuf approached her with tears in his eyes and laid his hand on her brow 
 god will bless you said he you are an angel since you take care of the flowers 
 no she replied 
 i am the devil but all the same to me 
 the old man exclaimed without either waiting for or hearing her response 
 what a pity that i am so unhappy and so poor and that i can 
 do nothing for you 
 you can do something said she 
 what 
 tell me where m marius lives 
 the old man did not understand 
 what monsieur marius 
 he raised his glassy eyes and seemed to be seeking something that had vanished 
 a young man who used to come here 
 in the meantime m mabeuf had searched his memory 
 ah yes he exclaimed 
 i know what you mean 
 wait monsieur baron marius pontmercy parbleu 
 he lives or rather he no longer well i know 
 as he spoke he had bent over to train a branch of rhododendron and he continued 
 hold i know now 
 he very often passes along the boulevard and goes in the direction of the glaciere rue croulebarbe the meadow of the lark 
 go there 
 it is not hard to meet him 
 when m mabeuf straightened himself up there was no longer any one there the girl had disappeared 
 he was decidedly terrified 
 really he thought if my garden had not been watered i should think that she was a spirit 
 an hour later when he was in bed it came back to him and as he fell asleep at that confused moment when thought like that fabulous bird which changes itself into a fish in order to cross the sea little by little assumes the form of a dream in order to traverse slumber he said to himself in a bewildered way 
 in sooth that greatly resembles what rubaudiere narrates of the goblins 
 could it have been a goblin 
 apparition to father mabeuf 
 marius no longer went to see any one but he sometimes encountered father mabeuf by chance 
 while marius was slowly descending those melancholy steps which may be called the cellar stairs and which lead to places without light where the happy can be heard walking overhead m mabeuf was descending on his side 
 the flora of cauteretz no longer sold at all 
 the experiments on indigo had not been successful in the little garden of austerlitz which had a bad exposure 
 m mabeuf could cultivate there only a few plants which love shade and dampness 
 nevertheless he did not become discouraged 
 he had obtained a corner in the jardin des plantes with a good exposure to make his trials with indigo at his own expense 
 for this purpose he had pawned his copperplates of the flora 
 he had reduced his breakfast to two eggs and he left one of these for his old servant to whom he had paid no wages for the last fifteen months 
 and often his breakfast was his only meal he no longer smiled with his infantile smile he had grown morose and no longer received visitors 
 marius did well not to dream of going thither 
 sometimes at the hour when m mabeuf was on his way to the jardin des plantes the old man and the young man passed each other on the boulevard de they did not speak and only exchanged a melancholy sign of the head 
 a thing it is that there comes a moment when misery looses bonds two men who have been friends become two chance 
 royal the bookseller was dead 
 m mabeuf no longer knew his books his garden or his indigo 
 these were the three forms which happiness pleasure and hope had assumed for him 
 this sufficed him for his living 
 he said to himself 
 when i shall have made my balls of blueing i shall be rich i will withdraw my copperplates from the i will put my flora in vogue again with trickery plenty of money and advertisements in the newspapers and i will buy i know well where a copy of pierre de art de naviguer with edition of 
 in the meantime he toiled all day over his plot of indigo and at night he returned home to water his garden and to read his books 
 at that epoch m mabeuf was nearly eighty years of age 
 one evening he had a singular apparition 
 he had returned home while it was still broad daylight mother plutarque whose health was declining was ill and in bed he had dined on a bone on which a little meat lingered and a bit of bread that he had found on the kitchen table and had seated himself on an overturned stone post which took the place of a bench in his garden 
 near this bench there rose after the fashion in a sort of large chest of beams and planks much dilapidated a on the ground floor a on the first there was nothing in the hutch but there were a few apples in the remains of the provision 
 m mabeuf had set himself to turning over and reading with the aid of his glasses two books of which he was passionately fond and in which a serious thing at his age he was interested his natural timidity rendered him accessible to the acceptance of superstitions in a certain degree 
 the first of these books was the famous treatise of president delancre de des demons the other was a quarto by mutor de la rubaudiere sur les diables de vauvert et les gobelins de la bievre 
 this old volume interested him all the more because his garden had been one of the spots haunted by goblins in former times 
 the twilight had begun to whiten what was on high and to blacken all below as he read over the top of the book which he held in his hand father mabeuf was surveying his plants and among others a magnificent rhododendron which was one of his consolations four days of heat wind and sun without a drop of rain had passed the stalks were bending the buds drooping the leaves falling all this needed water the rhododendron was particularly sad father mabeuf was one of those persons for whom plants have souls the old man had toiled all day over his indigo plot he was worn out with fatigue but he rose laid his books on the bench and walked all bent over and with tottering footsteps to the well but when he had grasped the chain he could not even draw it sufficiently to unhook it 
 then he turned round and cast a glance of anguish toward heaven which was becoming studded with stars 
 the evening had that serenity which overwhelms the troubles of man beneath an indescribably mournful and eternal joy 
 the night promised to be as arid as the day had been 
 stars everywhere thought the old man not the tiniest cloud not a drop of water 
 and his head which had been upraised for a moment fell back upon his breast 
 he raised it again and once more looked at the sky murmuring 
 a tear of dew 
 a little pity 
 he tried again to unhook the chain of the well and could not 
 at that moment he heard a voice saying 
 father mabeuf would you like to have me water your garden for you 
 at the same time a noise as of a wild animal passing became audible in the hedge and he beheld emerging from the shrubbery a sort of tall slender girl who drew herself up in front of him and stared boldly at him 
 she had less the air of a human being than of a form which had just blossomed forth from the twilight 
 before father mabeuf who was easily terrified and who was as we have said quick to take alarm was able to reply by a single syllable this being whose movements had a sort of odd abruptness in the darkness had unhooked the chain plunged in and withdrawn the bucket and filled the and the goodman beheld this apparition which had bare feet and a tattered petticoat running about among the distributing life around her

 at that very time in circumstances even more important than retreating without a battle namely the evacuation and burning of moscow rostopchin who is usually represented as being the instigator of that event acted in an altogether different manner from kutuzov 
 after the battle of borodino the abandonment and burning of moscow was as inevitable as the retreat of the army beyond moscow without fighting 
 every russian might have predicted it not by reasoning but by the feeling implanted in each of us and in our fathers 
 the same thing that took place in moscow had happened in all the towns and villages on russian soil beginning with smolensk without the participation of count rostopchin and his broadsheets the people awaited the enemy unconcernedly did not riot or become excited or tear anyone to pieces but faced its fate feeling within it the strength to find what it should do at that most difficult moment and as soon as the enemy drew near the wealthy classes went away abandoning their property while the poorer remained and burned and destroyed what was left 
 the consciousness that this would be so and would always be so was and is present in the heart of every russian and a consciousness of this and a foreboding that moscow would be taken was present in russian moscow society in those who had quitted moscow already in july and at the beginning of august showed that they expected this those who went away taking what they could and abandoning their houses and half their belongings did so from the latent patriotism which expresses itself not by phrases or by giving children to save the fatherland and similar unnatural exploits but unobtrusively simply organically and therefore in the way that always produces the most powerful results 
 it is disgraceful to run away from danger only cowards are running away from moscow they were told in his broadsheets rostopchin impressed on them that to leave moscow was shameful they were ashamed to be called cowards ashamed to leave but still they left knowing it had to be done why did they go it is impossible to suppose that rostopchin had scared them by his accounts of horrors napoleon had committed in conquered countries the first people to go away were the rich educated people who knew quite well that vienna and berlin had remained intact and that during occupation the inhabitants had spent their time pleasantly in the company of the charming frenchmen whom the russians and especially the russian ladies then liked so much 
 they went away because for russians there could be no question as to whether things would go well or ill under french rule in moscow it was out of the question to be under french rule it would be the worst thing that could happen they went away even before the battle of borodino and still more rapidly after it despite calls to defend moscow or the announcement of his intention to take the icon of the iberian mother of god and go to fight or of the balloons that were to destroy the french and despite all the nonsense rostopchin wrote in his broadsheets they knew that it was for the army to fight and that if it could not succeed it would not do to take young ladies and house serfs to the three hills quarter of moscow to fight napoleon and that they must go away sorry as they were to abandon their property to destruction they went away without thinking of the tremendous significance of that immense and wealthy city being given over to destruction for a great city with wooden buildings was certain when abandoned by its inhabitants to be burned they went away each on his own account and yet it was only in consequence of their going away that the momentous event was accomplished that will always remain the greatest glory of the russian people the lady who afraid of being stopped by count orders had already in june moved with her negroes and her women jesters from moscow to her saratov estate with a vague consciousness that she was not servant was really simply and truly carrying out the great work which saved russia but count rostopchin who now taunted those who left moscow and now had the government offices removed now distributed quite useless weapons to the drunken rabble now had processions displaying the icons and now forbade father augustin to remove icons or the relics of saints now seized all the private carts in moscow and on one hundred and of them removed the balloon that was being constructed by leppich now hinted that he would burn moscow and related how he had set fire to his own house now wrote a proclamation to the french solemnly upbraiding them for having destroyed his orphanage now claimed the glory of having hinted that he would burn moscow and now repudiated the deed now ordered the people to catch all spies and bring them to him and now reproached them for doing so now expelled all the french residents from moscow and now allowed madame the center of the whole french colony in moscow to remain but ordered the venerable old postmaster klyucharev to be arrested and exiled for no particular offense now assembled the people at the three hills to fight the french and now to get rid of them handed over to them a man to be killed and himself drove away by a back gate now declared that he would not survive the fall of moscow and now wrote french verses in albums concerning his share in the affair this man did not understand the meaning of what was happening but merely wanted to do something himself that would astonish people to perform some patriotically heroic feat and like a child he made sport of the momentous and unavoidable event the abandonment and burning of moscow and tried with his puny hand now to speed and now to stay the enormous popular tide that bore him along with it

 an apparition to marius 
 some days after this visit of a spirit to farmer mabeuf one morning it was on a monday the day when marius borrowed the piece from courfeyrac for had put this coin in his pocket and before carrying it to the office he had gone to take a little stroll in the hope that this would make him work on his return 
 it was always thus however 
 as soon as he rose he seated himself before a book and a sheet of paper in order to scribble some translation his task at that epoch consisted in turning into french a celebrated quarrel between germans the gans and savigny controversy he took savigny he took gans read four lines tried to write one could not saw a star between him and his paper and rose from his chair saying 
 i shall go out that will put me in spirits 
 and off he went to the meadow 
 there he beheld more than ever the star and less than ever savigny and gans 
 he returned home tried to take up his work again and did not succeed there was no means of a single one of the threads which were broken in his brain then he said to himself 
 i will not go out it prevents my working 
 and he went out every day 
 he lived in the meadow more than in lodgings that was his real address 
 boulevard de la sante at the seventh tree from the rue croulebarbe 
 that morning he had quitted the seventh tree and had seated himself on the parapet of the river des gobelins 
 a cheerful sunlight penetrated the freshly unfolded and luminous leaves 
 he was dreaming of her 
 and his meditation turning to a reproach fell back upon himself he reflected dolefully on his idleness his paralysis of soul which was gaining on him and of that night which was growing more dense every moment before him to such a point that he no longer even saw the sun 
 nevertheless athwart this painful extrication of indistinct ideas which was not even a monologue so feeble had action become in him and he had no longer the force to care to despair athwart this melancholy absorption sensations from without did reach him he heard behind him beneath him on both banks of the river the laundresses of the gobelins beating their linen and above his head the birds chattering and singing in the on the one hand the sound of liberty the careless happiness of the leisure which has wings on the other the sound of toil what caused him to meditate deeply and almost reflect were two cheerful sounds 
 all at once in the midst of his dejected ecstasy he heard a familiar voice saying 
 come 
 here he is 
 he raised his eyes and recognized that wretched child who had come to him one morning the elder of the thenardier daughters eponine he knew her name now 
 strange to say she had grown poorer and prettier two steps which it had not seemed within her power to take she had accomplished a double progress towards the light and towards distress 
 she was barefooted and in rags as on the day when she had so resolutely entered his chamber only her rags were two months older now the holes were larger the tatters more sordid it was the same harsh voice the same brow dimmed and wrinkled with tan the same free wild and vacillating glance 
 she had besides more than formerly in her face that indescribably terrified and lamentable something which sojourn in a prison adds to wretchedness 
 she had bits of straw and hay in her hair not like ophelia through having gone mad from the contagion of madness but because she had slept in the loft of some stable 
 and in spite of it all she was beautiful 
 what a star art thou o youth 
 in the meantime she had halted in front of marius with a trace of joy in her livid countenance and something which resembled a smile 
 she stood for several moments as though incapable of speech 
 so i have met you at last she said at length 
 father mabeuf was right it was on this boulevard 
 how i have hunted for you if you only knew 
 do you know 
 i have been in the jug 
 a fortnight they let me out seeing that there was nothing against me and that moreover i had not reached years of discretion 
 i lack two months of it 
 oh how i have hunted for you 
 these six weeks so you live down there any more 
 no said marius 
 ah 
 i understand 
 because of that affair 
 those are disagreeable 
 you cleared out 
 come now 
 why do you wear old hats like this 
 a young man like you ought to have fine clothes do you know monsieur marius father mabeuf calls you baron marius i know what 
 it true that you are a baron 
 barons are old fellows they go to the luxembourg in front of the chateau where there is the most sun and they read the quotidienne for a sou i once carried a letter to a baron of that sort 
 he was over a hundred years old 
 say where do you live now 
 marius made no reply 
 ah she went on you have a hole in your shirt 
 i must sew it up for you 
 she resumed with an expression which gradually clouded over 
 you seem glad to see me 
 marius held his peace she remained silent for a moment then exclaimed 
 but if i choose nevertheless i could force you to look glad 
 what demanded marius 
 what do you mean 
 ah you used to call me thou she retorted 
 well then what dost thou mean 
 she bit her lips she seemed to hesitate as though a prey to some sort of inward conflict 
 at last she appeared to come to a decision 
 so much the worse i care 
 you have a melancholy air i want you to be pleased 
 only promise me that you will smile i want to see you smile and hear you say 
 ah well good poor mr marius you know 
 you promised me that you would give me anything i like 
 yes 
 only speak 
 she looked marius full in the eye and said 
 i have the address 
 marius turned pale 
 all the blood flowed back to his heart 
 what address 
 the address that you asked me to get 
 she added as though with an effort 
 the know very well 
 yes stammered marius 
 of that young lady 
 this word uttered she sighed deeply 
 marius sprang from the parapet on which he had been sitting and seized her hand distractedly 
 oh 
 well lead me thither 
 tell me 
 ask of me anything you wish where is it 
 come with me she responded 
 i know the street or number very well it is in quite the other direction from here but i know the house well i will take you to it 
 she withdrew her hand and went on in a tone which could have rent the heart of an observer but which did not even graze marius in his intoxicated and ecstatic state 
 oh how glad you are 
 a cloud swept across marius brow 
 he seized eponine by the arm 
 swear one thing to me 
 swear said she what does that mean 
 come 
 you want me to swear 
 and she laughed 
 your father promise me eponine 
 swear to me that you will not give this address to your father 
 she turned to him with a stupefied air 
 eponine 
 how do you know that my name is eponine 
 promise what i tell you 
 but she did not seem to hear him 
 nice 
 you have called me eponine 
 marius grasped both her arms at once 
 but answer me in the name of heaven pay attention to what i am saying to you swear to me that you will not tell your father this address that you know 
 my father said she 
 ah yes my father 
 be at ease in close confinement 
 besides what do i care for my father 
 but you do not promise me exclaimed marius 
 let go of me she said bursting into a laugh how you do shake me yes 
 yes 
 i promise that 
 i swear that to you 
 what is that to me i will not tell my father the address 
 there 
 is that right is that it 
 nor to any one said marius 
 nor to any one 
 now resumed marius take me there 
 immediately 
 immediately 
 come along 
 ah how pleased he is said she 
 after a few steps she halted 
 you are following me too closely monsieur marius 
 let me go on ahead and follow me so without seeming to do it 
 a nice young man like you must not be seen with a woman like me 
 no tongue can express all that lay in that word woman thus pronounced by that child 
 she proceeded a dozen paces and then halted once more marius joined her she addressed him sideways and without turning towards him 
 by the way you know that you promised me something 
 marius fumbled in his pocket 
 all that he owned in the world was the five francs intended for thenardier the father 
 he took them and laid them in hand 
 she opened her fingers and let the coin fall to the ground and gazed at him with a gloomy air 
 i want your money said she

 chapter vi 
 
 helene having returned with the court from vilna to petersburg found herself in a difficult position 
 in petersburg she had enjoyed the special protection of a grandee who occupied one of the highest posts in the empire in vilna she had formed an intimacy with a young foreign prince when she returned to petersburg both the magnate and the prince were there and both claimed their rights helene was faced by a new problem how to preserve her intimacy with both without offending either 
 what would have seemed difficult or even impossible to another woman did not cause the least embarrassment to countess bezukhova who evidently deserved her reputation of being a very clever woman had she attempted concealment or tried to extricate herself from her awkward position by cunning she would have spoiled her case by acknowledging herself guilty but helene like a really great man who can do whatever he pleases at once assumed her own position to be correct as she sincerely believed it to be and that everyone else was to blame 
 the first time the young foreigner allowed himself to reproach her she lifted her beautiful head and half turning to him said firmly just like a man selfish and cruel i expected nothing else a woman sacrifices herself for you she suffers and this is her reward what right have you monseigneur to demand an account of my attachments and friendships he is a man who has been more than a father to me the prince was about to say something but helene interrupted him 
 well yes said she it may be that he has other sentiments for me than those of a father but that is not a reason for me to shut my door on him i am not a man that i should repay kindness with ingratitude know monseigneur that in all that relates to my intimate feelings i render account only to god and to my conscience she concluded laying her hand on her beautiful fully expanded bosom and looking up to heaven 
 but for sake listen to me 
 marry me and i will be your slave 
 but impossible 
 you deign to demean yourself by marrying me you said helene beginning to cry 
 the prince tried to comfort her but helene as if quite distraught said through her tears that there was nothing to prevent her marrying that there were precedents there were up to that time very few but she mentioned napoleon and some other exalted personages that she had never been her wife and that she had been sacrificed 
 but the law religion said the prince already yielding 
 the law religion what have they been invented for if they arrange that said helene 
 the prince was surprised that so simple an idea had not occurred to him and he applied for advice to the holy brethren of the society of jesus with whom he was on intimate terms 
 a few days later at one of those enchanting fetes which helene gave at her country house on the stone island the charming monsieur de jobert a man no longer young with snow white hair and brilliant black eyes a jesuit a robe courte was presented to her and in the garden by the light of the illuminations and to the sound of music talked to her for a long time of the love of god of christ of the sacred heart and of the consolations the one true catholic religion affords in this world and the next helene was touched and more than once tears rose to her eyes and to those of monsieur de jobert and their voices trembled a dance for which her partner came to seek her put an end to her discourse with her future directeur de conscience but the next evening monsieur de jobert came to see helene when she was alone and after that often came again 
 lay member of the society of jesus 
 one day he took the countess to a roman catholic church where she knelt down before the altar to which she was led the enchanting frenchman laid his hands on her head and as she herself afterward described it she felt something like a fresh breeze wafted into her soul it was explained to her that this was la grace 
 after that a abbe was brought to her she confessed to him and he absolved her from her sins next day she received a box containing the sacred host which was left at her house for her to partake of a few days later helene learned with pleasure that she had now been admitted to the true catholic church and that in a few days the pope himself would hear of her and would send her a certain document 
 all that was done around her and to her at this time all the attention devoted to her by so many clever men and expressed in such pleasant refined ways and the state of purity she was now in she wore only white dresses and white ribbons all that time gave her pleasure but her pleasure did not cause her for a moment to forget her aim and as it always happens in contests of cunning that a stupid person gets the better of cleverer ones helene having realized that the main object of all these words and all this trouble was after converting her to catholicism to obtain money from her for jesuit institutions as to which she received indications before parting with her money insisted that the various operations necessary to free her from her husband should be performed in her view the aim of every religion was merely to preserve certain proprieties while affording satisfaction to human desires and with this aim in one of her talks with her father confessor she insisted on an answer to the question in how far was she bound by her marriage 
 they were sitting in the twilight by a window in the drawing room the scent of flowers came in at the window helene was wearing a white dress transparent over her shoulders and bosom the abbe a man with a plump chin a pleasant firm mouth and white hands meekly folded on his knees sat close to helene and with a subtle smile on his lips and a peaceful look of delight at her beauty occasionally glanced at her face as he explained his opinion on the subject helene with an uneasy smile looked at his curly hair and his plump blackish cheeks and every moment expected the conversation to take a fresh turn but the abbe though he evidently enjoyed the beauty of his companion was absorbed in his mastery of the matter 
 the course of the father arguments ran as follows ignorant of the import of what you were undertaking you made a vow of conjugal fidelity to a man who on his part by entering the married state without faith in the religious significance of marriage committed an act of sacrilege that marriage lacked the dual significance it should have had yet in spite of this your vow was binding you swerved from it what did you commit by so acting a venial or a mortal sin a venial sin for you acted without evil intention if now you married again with the object of bearing children your sin might be forgiven but the question is again a twofold one firstly 
 but suddenly helene who was getting bored said with one of her bewitching smiles but i think that having espoused the true religion i cannot be bound by what a false religion laid upon me 
 the director of her conscience was astounded at having the case presented to him thus with the simplicity of columbus egg he was delighted at the unexpected rapidity of his progress but could not abandon the edifice of argument he had laboriously constructed 
 let us understand one another countess said he with a smile and began refuting his spiritual arguments

 book house in the rue plumet 
 chapter i 
 
 the house with a secret 
 about the middle of the last century a chief justice in the parliament of paris having a mistress and concealing the fact for at that period the grand seignors displayed their mistresses and the bourgeois concealed them had a little house built in the faubourg in the deserted rue blomet which is now called rue plumet not far from the spot which was then designated as combat des animaux 
 this house was composed of a pavilion two rooms on the ground floor two chambers on the first floor a kitchen down stairs a boudoir up stairs an attic under the roof the whole preceded by a garden with a large gate opening on the street this garden was about an acre and a half in extent 
 this was all that could be seen by but behind the pavilion there was a narrow courtyard and at the end of the courtyard a low building consisting of two rooms and a cellar a sort of preparation destined to conceal a child and nurse in case of need 
 this building communicated in the rear by a masked door which opened by a secret spring with a long narrow paved winding corridor open to the sky hemmed in with two lofty walls which hidden with wonderful art and lost as it were between garden enclosures and cultivated land all of whose angles and detours it followed ended in another door also with a secret lock which opened a quarter of a league away almost in another quarter at the solitary extremity of the rue du babylone 
 through this the chief justice entered so that even those who were spying on him and following him would merely have observed that the justice betook himself every day in a mysterious way somewhere and would never have suspected that to go to the rue de babylone was to go to the rue blomet 
 thanks to clever purchasers of land the magistrate had been able to make a secret passage on his own property and consequently without interference 
 later on he had sold in little parcels for gardens and market gardens the lots of ground adjoining the corridor and the proprietors of these lots on both sides thought they had a party wall before their eyes and did not even suspect the long paved ribbon winding between two walls amid their and their orchards only the birds beheld this curiosity 
 it is probable that the linnets and tomtits of the last century gossiped a great deal about the chief justice 
 the pavilion built of stone in the taste of mansard wainscoted and furnished in the watteau style rocaille on the inside on the outside walled in with a triple hedge of flowers had something discreet coquettish and solemn about it as befits a caprice of love and magistracy

 after that the house remained uninhabited and fell slowly to ruin as does every dwelling to which the presence of man does not communicate life it had remained fitted with its old furniture was always for sale or to let and the ten or a dozen people who passed through the rue plumet were warned of the fact by a yellow and illegible bit of writing which had hung on the garden wall since

 book eleven 
 chapter vii 
 
 helene understood that the question was very simple and easy from the ecclesiastical point of view and that her directors were making difficulties only because they were apprehensive as to how the matter would be regarded by the secular authorities 
 so she decided that it was necessary to prepare the opinion of society she provoked the jealousy of the elderly magnate and told him what she had told her other suitor that is she put the matter so that the only way for him to obtain a right over her was to marry her the elderly magnate was at first as much taken aback by this suggestion of marriage with a woman whose husband was alive as the younger man had been but imperturbable conviction that it was as simple and natural as marrying a maiden had its effect on him too had helene herself shown the least sign of hesitation shame or secrecy her cause would certainly have been lost but not only did she show no signs of secrecy or shame on the contrary with naivete she told her intimate friends and these were all petersburg that both the prince and the magnate had proposed to her and that she loved both and was afraid of grieving either 
 a rumor immediately spread in petersburg not that helene wanted to be divorced from her husband had such a report spread many would have opposed so illegal an intention but simply that the unfortunate and interesting helene was in doubt which of the two men she should marry the question was no longer whether this was possible but only which was the better match and how the matter would be regarded at court there were it is true some rigid individuals unable to rise to the height of such a question who saw in the project a desecration of the sacrament of marriage but there were not many such and they remained silent while the majority were interested in good fortune and in the question which match would be the more advantageous whether it was right or wrong to remarry while one had a husband living they did not discuss for that question had evidently been settled by people wiser than you or me as they said and to doubt the correctness of that decision would be to risk exposing stupidity and incapacity to live in society 
 only marya dmitrievna akhrosimova had come to petersburg that summer to see one of her sons allowed herself plainly to express an opinion contrary to the general one meeting helene at a ball she stopped her in the middle of the room and amid general silence said in her gruff voice so wives of living men have started marrying again perhaps you think you have invented a novelty you have been forestalled my dear it was thought of long ago it is done in all the brothels and with these words marya dmitrievna turning up her wide sleeves with her usual threatening gesture and glancing sternly round moved across the room 
 though people were afraid of marya dmitrievna she was regarded in petersburg as a buffoon and so of what she had said they only noticed and repeated in a whisper the one coarse word she had used supposing the whole sting of her remark to lie in that word 
 prince vasili who of late very often forgot what he had said and repeated one and the same thing a hundred times remarked to his daughter whenever he chanced to see her 
 helene i have a word to say to you and he would lead her aside drawing her hand downward i have heard of certain projects concerning you know well my dear child you know how your heart rejoices to know that you you have suffered so much but my dear child consult only your own heart that is all i have to say and concealing his unvarying emotion he would press his cheek against his and move away 
 bilibin who had not lost his reputation of an exceedingly clever man and who was one of one of the disinterested friends so brilliant a woman as helene always has men friends who can never change into lovers once gave her his view of the matter at a small and intimate gathering 
 listen bilibin said helene she always called friends of that sort by their surnames and she touched his coat sleeve with her white beringed fingers tell me as you would a sister what i ought to do which of the two 
 bilibin wrinkled up the skin over his eyebrows and pondered with a smile on his lips 
 you are not taking me unawares you know said he as a true friend i have thought and thought again about your affair you see if you marry the prince he meant the younger man and he crooked one finger you forever lose the chance of marrying the other and you will displease the court besides you know there is some kind of connection but if you marry the old count you will make his last days happy and as widow of the grand the prince would no longer be making a mesalliance by marrying you and bilibin smoothed out his forehead 
 a true friend said helene beaming and again touching sleeve but i love them you know and want to distress either of them i would give my life for the happiness of them both 
 bilibin shrugged his shoulders as much as to say that not even he could help in that difficulty 
 une what is called putting things squarely she would like to be married to all three at the same time thought he 
 a masterly woman 
 but tell me how will your husband look at the matter bilibin asked his reputation being so well established that he did not fear to ask so naive a question will he agree 
 oh he loves me so said helene who for some reason imagined that pierre too loved her he will do anything for me 
 bilibin puckered his skin in preparation for something witty 
 even divorce you said he 
 helene laughed 
 among those who ventured to doubt the justifiability of the proposed marriage was mother princess kuragina she was continually tormented by jealousy of her daughter and now that jealousy concerned a subject near to her own heart she could not reconcile herself to the idea she consulted a russian priest as to the possibility of divorce and remarriage during a lifetime and the priest told her that it was impossible and to her delight showed her a text in the gospel which as it seemed to him plainly remarriage while the husband is alive 
 armed with these arguments which appeared to her unanswerable she drove to her early one morning so as to find her alone 
 having listened to her objections helene smiled blandly and ironically 
 but it says plainly whosoever shall marry her that is divorced said the old princess 
 ah maman ne dites pas de betises vous ne comprenez rein dans ma position des devoirs said helene changing from russian in which language she always felt that her case did not sound quite clear into french which suited it better 
 oh mamma talk nonsense you understand anything in my position i have obligations 
 but my dear 
 oh mamma how is it you understand that the holy father who has the right to grant dispensations 
 just then the lady companion who lived with helene came in to announce that his highness was in the ballroom and wished to see her 
 non que je ne veux pas le voir que je suis furieuse contre lui parce m a manque parole 
 no tell him i wish to see him i am furious with him for not keeping his word to me 
 comtesse a tout peche misericorde said a young man with a long face and nose as he entered the room 
 countess there is mercy for every sin 
 the old princess rose respectfully and curtsied the young man who had entered took no notice of her the princess nodded to her daughter and sidled out of the room 
 yes she is right thought the old princess all her convictions dissipated by the appearance of his highness she is right but how is it that we in our irrecoverable youth did not know it yet it is so simple she thought as she got into her carriage 
 by the beginning of august affairs were clearly defined and she wrote a letter to her husband who as she imagined loved her very much informing him of her intention to marry and of her having embraced the one true faith and asking him to carry out all the formalities necessary for a divorce which would be explained to him by the bearer of the letter 
 and so i pray god to have you my friend in his holy and powerful keeping your friend helene 
 this letter was brought to house when he was on the field of borodino

 book house in the rue plumet 
 chapter ii 
 
 jean valjean as a national guard 
 however properly speaking he lived in the rue plumet and he had arranged his existence there in the following fashion 
 cosette and the servant occupied the pavilion she had the big with the painted the boudoir with the gilded fillets the furnished with tapestries and vast she had the garden 
 jean valjean had a canopied bed of antique damask in three colors and a beautiful persian rug purchased in the rue du at mother put into chamber and in order to redeem the severity of these magnificent old things he had amalgamated with this all the gay and graceful little pieces of furniture suitable to young girls an etagere a bookcase filled with books an inkstand a paper a incrusted with mother of pearl a a toilet service in japanese porcelain long damask curtains with a red foundation and three colors like those on the bed hung at the windows of the first floor on the ground floor the curtains were of tapestry 
 all winter long little house was heated from top to bottom 
 jean valjean inhabited the sort of lodge which was situated at the end of the back courtyard with a mattress on a a white wood table two straw chairs an earthenware a few old volumes on a shelf his beloved valise in one corner and never any fire 
 he dined with cosette and he had a loaf of black bread on the table for his own use 
 when toussaint came he had said to her 
 it is the young lady who is the mistress of this you monsieur 
 toussaint replied in am a much better thing than the master i am the father 
 cosette had been taught housekeeping in the convent and she regulated their expenditure which was very modest 
 every day jean valjean put his arm through and took her for a walk he led her to the luxembourg to the least frequented walk and every sunday he took her to mass at because that was a long way off 
 as it was a very poor quarter he bestowed alms largely there and the poor people surrounded him in church which had drawn down upon him epistle to the benevolent gentleman of the church of he was fond of taking cosette to visit the poor and the sick no stranger ever entered the house in the rue plumet 
 toussaint brought their provisions and jean valjean went himself for water to a fountain near by on the boulevard 
 their wood and wine were put into a hollow lined with which lay near the rue de babylone and which had formerly served the as a grotto for at the epoch of follies and little houses no love was without a grotto 
 in the door opening on the rue de babylone there was a box destined for the reception of letters and papers only as the three inhabitants of the pavilion in the rue plumet received neither papers nor letters the entire usefulness of that box formerly the of a love affair and the confidant of a lawyer was now limited to the notices and the summons of the guard for m fauchelevent independent gentleman belonged to the national guard he had not been able to escape through the fine meshes of the census of 
 the municipal information collected at that time had even reached the convent of the a sort of impenetrable and holy cloud whence jean valjean had emerged in venerable guise and consequently worthy of mounting guard in the eyes of the townhall 
 three or four times a year jean valjean donned his uniform and mounted guard he did this willingly however it was a correct disguise which mixed him with every one and yet left him solitary jean valjean had just attained his sixtieth birthday the age of legal exemption but he did not appear to be over fifty moreover he had no desire to escape his nor to quibble with comte de lobau he possessed no civil status he was concealing his name he was concealing his identity so he concealed his age he concealed everything and as we have just said he willingly did his duty as a national guard the sum of his ambition lay in resembling any other man who paid his taxes this man had for his ideal within the angel without the bourgeois 
 let us note one detail however when jean valjean went out with cosette he dressed as the reader has already seen and had the air of a retired officer 
 when he went out alone which was generally at night he was always dressed in a trousers and blouse and wore a cap which concealed his face 
 was this precaution or humility both 
 cosette was accustomed to the enigmatical side of her destiny and hardly noticed her peculiarities 
 as for toussaint she venerated jean valjean and thought everything he did right 
 one day her butcher who had caught a glimpse of jean valjean said to her 
 a queer fish 
 she replied 
 a saint 
 neither jean valjean nor cosette nor toussaint ever entered or emerged except by the door on the rue de babylone 
 unless seen through the garden gate it would have been difficult to guess that they lived in the rue plumet 
 that gate was always closed 
 jean valjean had left the garden uncultivated in order not to attract attention 
 in this possibly he made a mistake

 toward the end of the battle of borodino pierre having run down from battery a second time made his way through a gully to knyazkovo with a crowd of soldiers reached the dressing station and seeing blood and hearing cries and groans hurried on still entangled in the crowds of soldiers 
 the one thing he now desired with his whole soul was to get away quickly from the terrible sensations amid which he had lived that day and return to ordinary conditions of life and sleep quietly in a room in his own bed he felt that only in the ordinary conditions of life would he be able to understand himself and all he had seen and felt but such ordinary conditions of life were nowhere to be found 
 though shells and bullets did not whistle over the road along which he was going still on all sides there was what there had been on the field of battle there were still the same suffering exhausted and sometimes strangely indifferent faces the same blood the same soldiers overcoats the same sounds of firing which though distant now still aroused terror and besides this there were the foul air and the dust 
 having gone a couple of miles along the mozhaysk road pierre sat down by the roadside 
 dusk had fallen and the roar of guns died away pierre lay leaning on his elbow for a long time gazing at the shadows that moved past him in the darkness he was continually imagining that a cannon ball was flying toward him with a terrific whizz and then he shuddered and sat up he had no idea how long he had been there in the middle of the night three soldiers having brought some firewood settled down near him and began lighting a fire 
 the soldiers who threw sidelong glances at pierre got the fire to burn and placed an iron pot on it into which they broke some dried bread and put a little dripping the pleasant odor of greasy viands mingled with the smell of smoke pierre sat up and sighed the three soldiers were eating and talking among themselves taking no notice of him 
 and who may you be one of them suddenly asked pierre evidently meaning what pierre himself had in mind namely if you want to eat give you some food only let us know whether you are an honest man 
 i i said pierre feeling it necessary to minimize his social position as much as possible so as to be nearer to the soldiers and better understood by them by rights i am a militia officer but my men are not here i came to the battle and have lost them 
 there now said one of the soldiers 
 another shook his head 
 would you like a little mash the first soldier asked and handed pierre a wooden spoon after licking it clean 
 pierre sat down by the fire and began eating the mash as they called the food in the cauldron and he thought it more delicious than any food he had ever tasted as he sat bending greedily over it helping himself to large spoonfuls and chewing one after another his was lit up by the fire and the soldiers looked at him in silence 
 where have you to go to tell us said one of them 
 to mozhaysk 
 a gentleman you 
 yes 
 and your name 
 peter kirilych 
 well then peter kirilych come along with us take you there 
 in the total darkness the soldiers walked with pierre to mozhaysk 
 by the time they got near mozhaysk and began ascending the steep hill into the town the cocks were already crowing pierre went on with the soldiers quite forgetting that his inn was at the bottom of the hill and that he had already passed it he would not soon have remembered this such was his state of forgetfulness had he not halfway up the hill stumbled upon his groom who had been to look for him in the town and was returning to the inn the groom recognized pierre in the darkness by his white hat 
 your excellency he said why we were beginning to despair how is it you are on foot and where are you going please 
 oh yes said pierre 
 the soldiers stopped 
 so found your folk said one of them well peter kirilych it 
 peter kirilych pierre heard the other voices repeat 
 he said and turned with his groom toward the inn 
 i ought to give them something he thought and felt in his pocket no better not said another inner voice 
 there was not a room to be had at the inn they were all occupied pierre went out into the yard and covering himself up head and all lay down in his carriage

 foliis ac frondibus 
 the garden thus left to itself for more than half a century had become extraordinary and charming 
 the of forty years ago halted to gaze at it without a suspicion of the secrets which it hid in its fresh and verdant depths 
 more than one dreamer of that epoch often allowed his thoughts and his eyes to penetrate indiscreetly between the bars of that ancient padlocked gate twisted tottering fastened to two green and pillars and oddly crowned with a pediment of undecipherable arabesque 
 there was a stone bench in one corner one or two mouldy statues several lattices which had lost their nails with time were rotting on the wall and there were no walks nor turf but there was enough grass everywhere 
 gardening had taken its departure and nature had returned 
 weeds abounded which was a great piece of luck for a poor corner of land 
 the festival of gilliflowers was something splendid 
 nothing in this garden obstructed the sacred effort of things towards life venerable growth reigned there among them 
 the trees had bent over towards the nettles the plant had sprung upward the branch had inclined that which crawls on the earth had gone in search of that which expands in the air that which floats on the wind had bent over towards that which trails in the moss trunks boughs leaves fibres clusters tendrils shoots spines thorns had mingled crossed married confounded themselves in each other vegetation in a deep and close embrace had celebrated and accomplished there under the eye of the creator in that enclosure three hundred feet square the holy mystery of fraternity symbol of the human fraternity this garden was no longer a garden it was a colossal thicket that is to say something as impenetrable as a forest as peopled as a city quivering like a nest sombre like a cathedral fragrant like a bouquet solitary as a tomb living as a throng 
 in floreal this enormous thicket free behind its gate and within its four walls entered upon the secret labor of germination quivered in the rising sun almost like an animal which drinks in the breaths of cosmic love and which feels the sap of april rising and boiling in its veins and shakes to the wind its enormous wonderful green locks sprinkled on the damp earth on the defaced statues on the crumbling steps of the pavilion and even on the pavement of the deserted street flowers like stars dew like pearls fecundity beauty life joy perfumes 
 at midday a thousand white butterflies took refuge there and it was a divine spectacle to see that living summer snow whirling about there in flakes amid the shade 
 there in those gay shadows of verdure a throng of innocent voices spoke sweetly to the soul and what the twittering forgot to say the humming completed 
 in the evening a dreamy vapor exhaled from the garden and enveloped it a shroud of mist a calm and celestial sadness covered it the intoxicating perfume of the honeysuckles and convolvulus poured out from every part of it like an exquisite and subtle poison the last appeals of the woodpeckers and the wagtails were audible as they dozed among the branches one felt the sacred intimacy of the birds and the trees by day the wings rejoice the leaves by night the leaves protect the wings 
 from april to may 
 in winter the thicket was black dripping bristling shivering and allowed some glimpse of the house 
 instead of flowers on the branches 
 and dew in the flowers the long silvery tracks of the snails were visible on the cold thick carpet of yellow leaves but in any fashion under any aspect at all seasons spring winter summer autumn this tiny enclosure breathed forth melancholy contemplation solitude liberty the absence of man the presence of god and the rusty old gate had the air of saying 
 this garden belongs to me 
 it was of no avail that the pavements of paris were there on every side the classic and splendid hotels of the rue de varennes a couple of paces away the dome of the invalides close at hand the chamber of deputies not far off the carriages of the rue de bourgogne and of the rue rumbled luxuriously in vain in the vicinity in vain did the yellow brown white and red omnibuses cross each course at the neighboring the rue plumet was the desert and the death of the former proprietors the revolution which had passed over it the crumbling away of ancient fortunes absence forgetfulness forty years of abandonment and widowhood had sufficed to restore to this privileged spot ferns mulleins hemlock yarrow tall weeds great crimped plants with large leaves of pale green cloth lizards beetles uneasy and rapid insects to cause to spring forth from the depths of the earth and to reappear between those four walls a certain indescribable and savage grandeur and for nature which disconcerts the petty arrangements of man and which sheds herself always thoroughly where she diffuses herself at all in the ant as well as in the eagle to blossom out in a petty little parisian garden with as much rude force and majesty as in a virgin forest of the new world 
 nothing is small in fact any one who is subject to the profound and penetrating influence of nature knows this 
 although no absolute satisfaction is given to philosophy either to circumscribe the cause or to limit the effect the contemplator falls into those unfathomable ecstasies caused by these decompositions of force terminating in unity 
 everything toils at everything 
 algebra is applied to the clouds the radiation of the star profits the rose no thinker would venture to affirm that the perfume of the hawthorn is useless to the constellations 
 who then can calculate the course of a molecule 
 how do we know that the creation of worlds is not determined by the fall of grains of sand 
 who knows the reciprocal ebb and flow of the infinitely great and the infinitely little the reverberations of causes in the precipices of being and the avalanches of creation 
 the tiniest worm is of importance the great is little the little is great everything is balanced in necessity alarming vision for the mind 
 there are marvellous relations between beings and things in that inexhaustible whole from the sun to the grub nothing despises the other all have need of each other 
 the light does not bear away terrestrial perfumes into the azure depths without knowing what it is doing the night distributes stellar essences to the sleeping flowers all birds that fly have round their leg the thread of the infinite germination is complicated with the bursting forth of a meteor and with the peck of a swallow cracking its egg and it places on one level the birth of an earthworm and the advent of socrates where the telescope ends the microscope begins 
 which of the two possesses the larger field of vision 
 choose 
 a bit of mould is a pleiad of flowers a nebula is an of stars the same promiscuousness and yet more unprecedented exists between the things of the intelligence and the facts of substance elements and principles mingle combine wed multiply with each other to such a point that the material and the moral world are brought eventually to the same clearness 
 the phenomenon is perpetually returning upon itself 
 in the vast cosmic exchanges the universal life goes and comes in unknown quantities rolling entirely in the invisible mystery of effluvia employing everything not losing a single dream not a single slumber sowing an animalcule here crumbling to bits a planet there oscillating and winding making of light a force and of thought an element disseminated and invisible dissolving all except that geometrical point the i bringing everything back to the expanding everything in god entangling all activity from summit to base in the obscurity of a dizzy mechanism attaching the flight of an insect to the movement of the earth subordinating who knows 
 were it only by the identity of the law the evolution of the comet in the firmament to the whirling of the infusoria in the drop of water 
 a machine made of mind enormous gearing the prime motor of which is the gnat and whose final wheel is the zodiac

 chapter ix 
 
 scarcely had pierre laid his head on the pillow before he felt himself falling asleep but suddenly almost with the distinctness of reality he heard the boom boom boom of firing the thud of projectiles groans and cries and smelled blood and powder and a feeling of horror and dread of death seized him filled with fright he opened his eyes and lifted his head from under his cloak all was tranquil in the yard only orderly passed through the gateway splashing through the mud and talked to the innkeeper above head some pigeons disturbed by the movement he had made in sitting up fluttered under the dark roof of the penthouse the whole courtyard was permeated by a strong peaceful smell of stable yards delightful to pierre at that moment he could see the clear starry sky between the dark roofs of two penthouses 
 thank god there is no more of that he thought covering up his head again oh what a terrible thing is fear and how shamefully i yielded to it but they they were steady and calm all the time to the end thought he 
 they in mind were the soldiers those who had been at the battery those who had given him food and those who had prayed before the icon they those strange men he had not previously known stood out clearly and sharply from everyone else 
 to be a soldier just a soldier thought pierre as he fell asleep to enter communal life completely to be imbued by what makes them what they are but how cast off all the superfluous devilish burden of my outer man there was a time when i could have done it i could have run away from my father as i wanted to or i might have been sent to serve as a soldier after the duel with dolokhov and the memory of the dinner at the english club when he had challenged dolokhov flashed through mind and then he remembered his benefactor at torzhok and now a picture of a solemn meeting of the lodge presented itself to his mind it was taking place at the english club and someone near and dear to him sat at the end of the table yes that is he it is my benefactor but he died thought pierre yes he died and i did not know he was alive how sorry i am that he died and how glad i am that he is alive again on one side of the table sat anatole dolokhov nesvitski denisov and others like them in his dream the category to which these men belonged was as clearly defined in his mind as the category of those he termed they and he heard those people anatole and dolokhov shouting and singing loudly yet through their shouting the voice of his benefactor was heard speaking all the time and the sound of his words was as weighty and uninterrupted as the booming on the battlefield but pleasant and comforting pierre did not understand what his benefactor was saying but he knew the categories of thoughts were also quite distinct in his dream that he was talking of goodness and the possibility of being what they were and they with their simple kind firm faces surrounded his benefactor on all sides but though they were kindly they did not look at pierre and did not know him wishing to speak and to attract their attention he got up but at that moment his legs grew cold and bare he felt ashamed and with one arm covered his legs from which his cloak had in fact slipped for a moment as he was rearranging his cloak pierre opened his eyes and saw the same penthouse roofs posts and yard but now they were all bluish lit up and glittering with frost or dew 
 it is dawn thought pierre but not what i want i want to hear and understand my words again he covered himself up with his cloak but now neither the lodge nor his benefactor was there there were only thoughts clearly expressed in words thoughts that someone was uttering or that he himself was formulating 
 afterwards when he recalled those thoughts pierre was convinced that someone outside himself had spoken them though the impressions of that day had evoked them he had never it seemed to him been able to think and express his thoughts like that when awake 
 to endure war is the most difficult subordination of freedom to the law of god the voice had said simplicity is submission to the will of god you cannot escape from him and they are simple they do not talk but act the spoken word is silver but the unspoken is golden man can be master of nothing while he fears death but he who does not fear it possesses all if there were no suffering man would not know his limitations would not know himself the hardest thing pierre went on thinking or hearing in his dream is to be able in your soul to unite the meaning of all to unite all he asked himself no not to unite thoughts cannot be united but to harness all these thoughts together is what we need yes one must harness them must harness them he repeated to himself with inward rapture feeling that these words and they alone expressed what he wanted to say and solved the question that tormented him 
 yes one must harness it is time to harness 
 time to harness time to harness your excellency your excellency some voice was repeating we must harness it is time to harness 
 it was the voice of the groom trying to wake him the sun shone straight into face he glanced at the dirty innyard in the middle of which soldiers were watering their lean horses at the pump while carts were passing out of the gate pierre turned away with repugnance and closing his eyes quickly fell back on the carriage seat no i want that i want to see and understand that i want to understand what was revealing itself to me in my dream one second more and i should have understood it all but what am i to do harness but how can i harness everything and pierre felt with horror that the meaning of all he had seen and thought in the dream had been destroyed 
 the groom the coachman and the innkeeper told pierre that an officer had come with news that the french were already near mozhaysk and that our men were leaving it 
 pierre got up and having told them to harness and overtake him went on foot through the town 
 the troops were moving on leaving about ten thousand wounded behind them there were wounded in the yards at the windows of the houses and the streets were crowded with them in the streets around carts that were to take some of the wounded away shouts curses and blows could be heard pierre offered the use of his carriage which had overtaken him to a wounded general he knew and drove with him to moscow on the way pierre was told of the death of his anatole and of that of prince andrew

 change of gate 
 it seemed that this garden created in olden days to conceal wanton mysteries had been transformed and become fitted to shelter chaste mysteries 
 there were no longer either arbors or bowling greens or tunnels or grottos there was a magnificent dishevelled obscurity falling like a veil over all 
 paphos had been made over into eden it is impossible to say what element of repentance had rendered this retreat wholesome 
 this now offered her blossom to the soul 
 this coquettish garden formerly decidedly compromised had returned to virginity and modesty 
 a justice assisted by a gardener a goodman who thought that he was a continuation of lamoignon and another goodman who thought that he was a continuation of lenotre had turned it about cut ruffled decked moulded it to gallantry nature had taken possession of it once more had filled it with shade and had arranged it for love 
 there was also in this solitude a heart which was quite ready love had only to show himself he had here a temple composed of verdure grass moss the sight of birds tender shadows agitated branches and a soul made of sweetness of faith of candor of hope of aspiration and of illusion 
 cosette had left the convent when she was still almost a child she was a little more than fourteen and she was at the ungrateful age we have already said that with the exception of her eyes she was homely rather than pretty she had no ungraceful feature but she was awkward thin timid and bold at once a little girl in short 
 her education was finished that is to say she has been taught religion and even and above all devotion then history that is to say the thing that bears that name in convents geography grammar the participles the kings of france a little music a little drawing etc but in all other respects she was utterly ignorant which is a great charm and a great peril 
 the soul of a young girl should not be left in the dark later on mirages that are too abrupt and too lively are formed there as in a dark chamber she should be gently and discreetly enlightened rather with the reflection of realities than with their harsh and direct light a useful and graciously austere which dissipates puerile fears and obviates falls 
 there is nothing but the maternal instinct that admirable intuition composed of the memories of the virgin and the experience of the woman which knows how this is to be created and of what it should consist 
 nothing supplies the place of this instinct 
 all the nuns in the world are not worth as much as one mother in the formation of a young soul 
 cosette had had no mother 
 she had only had many mothers in the plural 
 as for jean valjean he was indeed all tenderness all solicitude but he was only an old man and he knew nothing at all 
 
 now in this work of education in this grave matter of preparing a woman for life what science is required to combat that vast ignorance which is called innocence 
 nothing prepares a young girl for passions like the convent the convent turns the thoughts in the direction of the unknown the heart thus thrown back upon itself works downward within itself since it cannot overflow and grows deep since it cannot expand hence visions suppositions conjectures outlines of romances a desire for adventures fantastic constructions edifices built wholly in the inner obscurity of the mind sombre and secret abodes where the passions immediately find a lodgement as soon as the open gate permits them to enter 
 the convent is a compression which in order to triumph over the human heart should last during the whole life 
 on quitting the convent cosette could have found nothing more sweet and more dangerous than the house in the rue plumet it was the continuation of solitude with the beginning of liberty a garden that was closed but a nature that was acrid rich voluptuous and fragrant the same dreams as in the convent but with glimpses of young men a grating but one that opened on the street 
 still when she arrived there we repeat she was only a child jean valjean gave this neglected garden over to her 
 do what you like with it he said to her 
 this amused cosette she turned over all the clumps and all the stones she hunted for beasts she played in it while awaiting the time when she would dream in it she loved this garden for the insects that she found beneath her feet amid the grass while awaiting the day when she would love it for the stars that she would see through the boughs above her head 
 and then she loved her father that is to say jean valjean with all her soul with an innocent filial passion which made the goodman a beloved and charming companion to her 
 it will be remembered that m madeleine had been in the habit of reading a great deal 
 jean valjean had continued this practice he had come to converse well he possessed the secret riches and the eloquence of a true and humble mind which has spontaneously cultivated itself he retained just enough sharpness to season his kindness his mind was rough and his heart was soft 
 during their conversations in the luxembourg he gave her explanations of everything drawing on what he had read and also on what he had suffered as she listened to him eyes wandered vaguely about 
 this simple man sufficed for thought the same as the wild garden sufficed for her eyes 
 when she had had a good chase after the butterflies she came panting up to him and said 
 ah 
 how i have run 
 he kissed her brow 
 cosette adored the goodman 
 she was always at his heels where jean valjean was there happiness was 
 jean valjean lived neither in the pavilion nor the garden she took greater pleasure in the paved back courtyard than in the enclosure filled with flowers and in his little lodge furnished with chairs than in the great hung with tapestry against which stood tufted jean valjean sometimes said to her smiling at his happiness in being importuned 
 do go to your own quarters leave me alone a little 
 she gave him those charming and tender scoldings which are so graceful when they come from a daughter to her father 
 father i am very cold in your rooms why you have a carpet here and a stove 
 dear child there are so many people who are better than i and who have not even a roof over their heads 
 then why is there a fire in my rooms and everything that is needed 
 because you are a woman and a child 
 bah must men be cold and feel uncomfortable 
 certain men 
 that is good i shall come here so often that you will be obliged to have a fire 
 and again she said to him 
 father why do you eat horrible bread like that 
 because my daughter 
 well if you eat it i will eat it too 
 then in order to prevent cosette eating black bread jean valjean ate white bread 
 cosette had but a confused recollection of her childhood 
 she prayed morning and evening for her mother whom she had never known the thenardiers had remained with her as two hideous figures in a dream 
 she remembered that she had gone one day at night to fetch water in a forest 
 she thought that it had been very far from paris 
 it seemed to her that she had begun to live in an abyss and that it was jean valjean who had rescued her from it her childhood produced upon her the effect of a time when there had been nothing around her but millepeds spiders and serpents when she meditated in the evening before falling asleep as she had not a very clear idea that she was jean daughter and that he was her father she fancied that the soul of her mother had passed into that good man and had come to dwell near her 
 when he was seated she leaned her cheek against his white hair and dropped a silent tear saying to herself 
 perhaps this man is my mother 
 cosette although this is a strange statement to make in the profound ignorance of a girl brought up in a convent maternity being also absolutely unintelligible to virginity had ended by fancying that she had had as little mother as possible she did not even know her name 
 whenever she asked jean valjean jean valjean remained silent 
 if she repeated her question he responded with a smile 
 once she insisted the smile ended in a tear 
 this silence on the part of jean valjean covered fantine with darkness 
 was it prudence 
 was it respect 
 was it a fear that he should deliver this name to the hazards of another memory than his own 
 so long as cosette had been small jean valjean had been willing to talk to her of her mother when she became a young girl it was impossible for him to do so 
 it seemed to him that he no longer dared 
 was it because of cosette 
 was it because of fantine 
 he felt a certain religious horror at letting that shadow enter thought and of placing a third in their destiny 
 the more sacred this shade was to him the more did it seem that it was to be feared he thought of fantine and felt himself overwhelmed with silence 
 through the darkness he vaguely perceived something which appeared to have its finger on its lips 
 had all the modesty which had been in fantine and which had violently quitted her during her lifetime returned to rest upon her after her death to watch in indignation over the peace of that dead woman and in its shyness to keep her in her grave 
 was jean valjean unconsciously submitting to the pressure we who believe in death are not among the number who will reject this mysterious explanation 
 hence the impossibility of uttering even for cosette that name of fantine 
 one day cosette said to him 
 father i saw my mother in a dream last night 
 she had two big wings my mother must have been almost a saint during her life 
 through martyrdom replied jean valjean 
 however jean valjean was happy 
 when cosette went out with him she leaned on his arm proud and happy in the plenitude of her heart 
 jean valjean felt his heart melt within him with delight at all these sparks of a tenderness so exclusive so wholly satisfied with himself alone 
 the poor man trembled inundated with angelic joy he declared to himself ecstatically that this would last all their lives he told himself that he really had not suffered sufficiently to merit so radiant a bliss and he thanked god in the depths of his soul for having permitted him to be loved thus he a wretch by that innocent being

 chapter x 
 on the thirteenth of august pierre reached moscow close to the gates of the city he was met by count adjutant 
 we have been looking for you everywhere said the adjutant the count wants to see you particularly he asks you to come to him at once on a very important matter 
 without going home pierre took a cab and drove to see the moscow commander in chief 
 count rostopchin had only that morning returned to town from his summer villa at sokolniki the anteroom and reception room of his house were full of officials who had been summoned or had come for orders vasilchikov and platov had already seen the count and explained to him that it was impossible to defend moscow and that it would have to be surrendered though this news was being concealed from the inhabitants the officials the heads of the various government departments knew that moscow would soon be in the hands just as count rostopchin himself knew it and to escape personal responsibility they had all come to the governor to ask how they were to deal with their various departments 
 as pierre was entering the reception room a courier from the army came out of private room 
 in answer to questions with which he was greeted the courier made a despairing gesture with his hand and passed through the room 
 while waiting in the reception room pierre with weary eyes watched the various officials old and young military and civilian who were there they all seemed dissatisfied and uneasy pierre went up to a group of men one of whom he knew after greeting pierre they continued their conversation 
 if sent out and brought back again later on it will do no harm but as things are now one answer for anything 
 but you see what he writes said another pointing to a printed sheet he held in his hand 
 another matter necessary for the people said the first 
 what is it asked pierre 
 oh a fresh broadsheet 
 pierre took it and began reading 
 his serene highness has passed through mozhaysk in order to join up with the troops moving toward him and has taken up a strong position where the enemy will not soon attack him forty eight guns with ammunition have been sent him from here and his serene highness says he will defend moscow to the last drop of blood and is even ready to fight in the streets do not be upset brothers that the law courts are closed things have to be put in order and we will deal with villains in our own way when the time comes i shall want both town and peasant lads and will raise the cry a day or two beforehand but they are not wanted yet so i hold my peace an ax will be useful a hunting spear not bad but a fork will be best of all a frenchman is no heavier than a sheaf of rye tomorrow after dinner i shall take the iberian icon of the mother of god to the wounded in the catherine hospital where we will have some water blessed that will help them to get well quicker i too am well now one of my eyes was sore but now i am on the lookout with both 
 but military men have told me that it is impossible to fight in the town said pierre and that the position 
 well of course what we were saying replied the first speaker 
 and what does he mean by one of my eyes was sore but now i am on the lookout with both asked pierre 
 the count had a sty replied the adjutant smiling and was very much upset when i told him people had come to ask what was the matter with him by the by count he added suddenly addressing pierre with a smile we heard that you have family troubles and that the countess your wife 
 i have heard nothing pierre replied unconcernedly but what have you heard 
 oh well you know people often invent things i only say what i heard 
 but what did you hear 
 well they say continued the adjutant with the same smile that the countess your wife is preparing to go abroad i expect nonsense 
 possibly remarked pierre looking about him and who is that he asked indicating a short old man in a clean blue peasant overcoat with a big beard and eyebrows and a ruddy face 
 he a tradesman that is to say the restaurant keeper vereshchagin perhaps you have heard of that affair with the proclamation 
 oh so that is vereshchagin said pierre looking at the firm calm face of the old man and seeking any indication of his being a traitor 
 not he himself the father of the fellow who wrote the proclamation said the adjutant the young man is in prison and i expect it will go hard with him 
 an old gentleman wearing a star and another official a german wearing a cross round his neck approached the speaker 
 a complicated story you know said the adjutant that proclamation appeared about two months ago the count was informed of it he gave orders to investigate the matter gabriel ivanovich here made the inquiries the proclamation had passed through exactly hands he asked one from whom did you get it from he went to the next one from whom did you get it and so on till he reached vereshchagin a half educated tradesman you know a pet of a trader said the adjutant smiling they asked him who gave it you and the point is that we knew whom he had it from he could only have had it from the postmaster but evidently they had come to some understanding he replied from no one i made it up myself they threatened and questioned him but he stuck to that i made it up myself and so it was reported to the count who sent for the man from whom did you get the proclamation i wrote it myself well you know the count said the adjutant cheerfully with a smile of pride he flared up dreadfully and just think of the audacity lying and obstinacy 
 and the count wanted him to say it was from klyucharev i understand said pierre 
 not at all rejoined the adjutant in dismay klyucharev had his own sins to answer for without that and that is why he has been banished but the point is that the count was much annoyed how could you have written it yourself said he and he took up the hamburg gazette that was lying on the table here it is you did not write it yourself but translated it and translated it abominably because you even know french you fool and what do you think no said he i have not read any papers i made it up myself if so a traitor and have you tried and be hanged say from whom you had it i have seen no papers i made it up myself and that was the end of it the count had the father fetched but the fellow stuck to it he was sent for trial and condemned to hard labor i believe now the father has come to intercede for him but a lad you know that sort of son a dandy and he attended some lectures somewhere and imagines that the devil is no match for him the sort of fellow he is his father keeps a cookshop here by the stone bridge and you know there was a large icon of god almighty painted with a scepter in one hand and an orb in the other well he took that icon home with him for a few days and what did he do he found some scoundrel of a painter

 of wisdom for a self 
 an ant is a wise creature for itself but it is a shrewd thing in an orchard or garden and certainly men that are great lovers of themselves waste the public 
 divide with reason between and society and be so true to thy self as thou be not false to others specially to thy king and country it is a poor centre of a actions himself 
 it is right earth for that only stands fast upon his own centre whereas all things that have affinity with the heavens move upon the centre of another which they benefit the referring of all to a self is more tolerable in a sovereign prince because themselves are not only themselves but their good and evil is at the peril 
 of the public fortune but it is a desperate evil in a servant to a prince or a citizen in a republic

 his own ends which must needs be often eccentric to the ends of his master or state therefore let princes or states choose such servants as have not this mark except they mean their service should be made but the accessory that which maketh the effect more pernicious is that all proportion is lost it were disproportion enough for the good to be preferred before the but yet it is a greater extreme when a little good of the servant shall cany things against a great good of the 
 and yet that is the case of bad officers treasurers ambassadors generals and other false and corrupt servants which set a bias upon their bowl of their own petty ends and envies to the overthrow of their great and important affairs and for the most part the good such servants receive is after the model of their own fortune 
 but the hurt they sell for mat good is after the model of their fortune 
 
 and certainly it is the nature of extreme as they will set an house on fire and it were but to roast their eggs and yet these men many times hold credit with their masters because their study is but to please them and profit themselves and for either respect they will abandon the good of their affairs 
 wisdom for a self is in many branches thereof a depraved thing it is the wisdom of rats that will be sure to leave a house somewhat before it fall it is the wisdom of the fox that thrusts out the badger who digged and made room for him 
 
 it is the wisdom of crocodiles that shed tears when they would devour but that which is specially to be noted is that those which as cicero says of pompey are sui amantes sine rivali are many times unfortunate and whereas they have all their time sacrificed to themselves they become in the end themselves sacrifices to the 
 inconstancy of fortune whose wings they thought by their to have pinioned

 book fall 
 chapter viii 
 
 billows and shadows 
 a man overboard 
 what matters it 
 the vessel does not halt 
 the wind blows that sombre ship has a path which it is forced to pursue it passes on 
 the man disappears then reappears he plunges he rises again to the surface he calls he stretches out his arms he is not heard the vessel trembling under the hurricane is wholly absorbed in its own workings the passengers and sailors do not even see the drowning man his miserable head is but a speck amid the immensity of the waves he gives vent to desperate cries from out of the depths 
 what a spectre is that retreating sail 
 he gazes and gazes at it frantically it retreats it grows dim it diminishes in size 
 he was there but just now he was one of the crew he went and came along the deck with the rest he had his part of breath and of sunlight he was a living man 
 now what has taken place 
 he has slipped he has fallen all is at an end 
 he is in the tremendous sea 
 under foot he has nothing but what flees and crumbles 
 the billows torn and lashed by the wind encompass him hideously the tossings of the abyss bear him away all the tongues of water dash over his head a populace of waves spits upon him confused openings half devour him every time that he sinks he catches glimpses of precipices filled with night frightful and unknown vegetations seize him knot about his feet draw him to them he is conscious that he is becoming an abyss that he forms part of the foam the waves toss him from one to another he drinks in the bitterness the cowardly ocean attacks him furiously to drown him the enormity plays with his agony 
 it seems as though all that water were hate 
 nevertheless he struggles 
 he tries to defend himself he tries to sustain himself he makes an effort he swims 
 he his petty strength all exhausted instantly combats the inexhaustible 
 where then is the ship 
 yonder 
 barely visible in the pale shadows of the horizon 
 the wind blows in gusts all the foam overwhelms him he raises his eyes and beholds only the lividness of the clouds he witnesses amid his the immense madness of the sea he is tortured by this madness he hears noises strange to man which seem to come from beyond the limits of the earth and from one knows not what frightful region beyond 
 there are birds in the clouds just as there are angels above human distresses but what can they do for him 
 they sing and fly and float and he he rattles in the death agony 
 he feels himself buried in those two infinities the ocean and the sky at one and the same time 
 the one is a tomb the other is a shroud 
 night descends he has been swimming for hours his strength is exhausted that ship that distant thing in which there were men has vanished he is alone in the formidable twilight gulf he sinks he stiffens himself he twists himself he feels under him the monstrous billows of the invisible he shouts 
 there are no more men 
 where is god 
 he shouts 
 help 
 help 
 he still shouts on 
 nothing on the horizon nothing in heaven 
 he implores the expanse the waves the seaweed the reef they are deaf 
 he beseeches the tempest the imperturbable tempest obeys only the infinite 
 around him darkness fog solitude the stormy and nonsentient tumult the undefined curling of those wild waters 
 in him horror and fatigue beneath him the depths 
 not a point of support 
 he thinks of the gloomy adventures of the corpse in the limitless shadow the bottomless cold paralyzes him 
 his hands contract convulsively they close and grasp nothingness 
 winds clouds whirlwinds gusts useless stars 
 what is to be done 
 the desperate man gives up he is weary he chooses the alternative of death he resists not he lets himself go he abandons his grip and then he tosses forevermore in the lugubrious dreary depths of engulfment 
 oh implacable march of human societies 
 oh losses of men and of souls on the way 
 ocean into which falls all that the law lets slip disastrous absence of help 
 oh moral death 
 the sea is the inexorable social night into which the penal laws fling their condemned 
 the sea is the immensity of wretchedness 
 the soul going down stream in this gulf may become a corpse who shall resuscitate it

 the empire strikes back 
 ix 
 
 only one being in the entire universe could instill fear in the dark spirit of darth he stood silent and alone in his dim chamber the dark lord of sith waited for avisit from his own dreaded master 
 as he waited his imperial star destroyer floated through a vast ocean of one on his ship would have dared disturb darth vader in his private cubicle butif they had they might have detected a slight trembling in that there might even have been a hint of terror to be seen upon his visage hadanyone been able to see through his concealing black breath mask 
 but no one approached and vader remained motionless as he kept his vigil soon a strange electronic whine broke the dead silence of the room anda flickering light began to glimmer on the dark cloak vader immediatelybowed deeply in homage to his royal master 
 the visitor arrived in the form of a hologram that materialized before vader andtowered above him the figure was clad in simple robes and itsface was concealed behind an enormous hood 
 when the hologram of the galactic emperor finally spoke it did so with a voiceeven deeper than the presence was awesome enough but thesound of his voice sent a thrill of terror coursing through powerful may rise my servant the emperor commanded 
 immediately vader straightened up but he did not dare gaze into his and instead cast his eyes down at his own black boots 
 what is thy bidding my master vader asked with all the solemnity of a priestattending his god 
 there is a grave disturbance in the force the emperor said 
 i have felt it the dark lord replied solemnly 
 the emperor emphasized the danger as he continued our situation is mostprecarious we have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction 
 our destruction who 
 the son of skywalker you must destroy him or he will be our undoing 
 skywalker 
 the thought was impossible how could the emperor be concerned with thisinsignificant youth 
 not a jedi vader reasoned just a boy could not havetaught him so much that 
 the emperor broke in the force is strong in him he insisted he must bedestroyed 
 the dark lord reflected for a moment perhaps there was another way to dealwith the boy a way that might benefit the imperial cause if he could be turned hewould be a powerful ally vader suggested 
 silently the emperor considered the possibility 
 after a moment he spoke again yesyes he said thoughtfully hewould be a great asset can it be done 
 for the first time in their meeting vader lifted his head to face his master will join us he answered firmly or die my master 
 with that the encounter had come to an end vader kneeled before the galacticemperor who passed his hand over his obedient servant in the next moment theholographic image had completely disappeared leaving darth vader alone toformulate what would be perhaps his most subtle plan of attack 
 the indicator lights on the control panel cast an eerie glow through the quietcockpit of the millennium falcon they softly lit princess face as she sat inthe chair thinking about han deep in thought she ran her hand along thecontrol panel in front of her she knew something was churned up within her certain that she was willing to acknowledge it and yet could she deny it 
 suddenly her attention was attracted by a flurry of movement outside the cockpitwindow a dark shape at first too swift and too shadowy to identify streakedtoward the millennium falcon in an instant it had attached itself to the frontwindow with something that looked like a soft suction cup cautiously leia movedforward for a closer look at the black smudgelike shape as she peered out thewindow a set of large yellow eyes suddenly popped open and stared right at her 
 leia started in shock and stumbled backward into the seat as she triedto compose herself she heard the scurry of feet and an inhuman screech suddenlythe black shape and its yellow eyes disappeared into the darkness of the asteroid cave 
 she caught her breath leaped up out of the chair and raced to the hold 
 the crew was finishing its work on the power system as theyworked the lights flickered weakly then came on and stayed on brightly hanfinished reconnecting the wires and began setting a floor panel back in place whilethe wookiee watched complete his work at the control panel 
 everything checks out here threepio reported if i might say so i believethat should do it 
 just then the princess rushed breathlessly into the hold 
 something out there leia cried 
 han looked up from his work where 
 outside she said in the cave 
 as she spoke they heard a sharp banging against the hull chewbaccalooked up and let out a loud bark of concern 
 whatever it sounds like trying to get in threepio observed worriedly 
 the captain began to move out of the hold going to see what it is heannounced 
 are you crazy leia looked at him in astonishment 
 the banging was getting louder 
 look we just got this bucket going again han explained not about tolet some varmint tear it apart 
 before leia could protest he had grabbed a breath mask off a supply rack andpulled it down over his head as han walked out the wookiee hurried up behindhim and grabbed his own face mask leia realized that as part of the crew she to join then 
 if more than one she told the captain going to need help 
 han looked at her affectionately as she removed a third breath mask and placed itover her lovely but determined face 
 then the three of them rushed out leaving the protocol droid to complainpitifully to the empty hold but that leave me here all alone 
 the darkness outside the millennium falcon was thick and dank it surroundedthe three figures as they carefully moved around their ship with each step theyheard unsettling noises squishing sounds that echoes through the dripping cavern 
 it was too dark to tell where the creature might be hiding they movedcautiously peering as well as they could into the deep gloom suddenly could see better in the dark than either his captain or the princess emitted amuffled bark and pointed toward the thing that moved along the hull 
 a shapeless leathery mass scurried over the top of the ship apparently startled bythe yelp han leveled his blaster at the creature and blasted the thing witha laser bolt the black shape screeched stumbled then fell off the with a thud at the feet 
 she leaned over to get a better look at the black mass looks like some kindof mynock she told han and chewbacca 
 han glanced quickly around the dark tunnel there will be more of them hepredicted they always travel in groups and nothing they like better thanto attach themselves to ships just what we need right now 
 but leia was more distracted by the consistency of the tunnel floor the tunnelitself struck her as peculiar the smell of the place was unlike that of any cave she hadever known the floor was especially cold and seemed to cling her feet 
 as she stamped her foot against the floor she felt the ground give a bit beneathher heel this asteroid has the strangest consistency she said look at theground not like rock at all 
 han knelt to inspect the floor more closely and noted how pliable it was as hestudied the floor he tried to make out how far it reached and to see the contours of thecave 
 an awful lot of moisture in here he said he stood up and aimed hishand blaster at the far side of the cave then fired toward the sound of a screechingmynock in the distance as soon as he shot the bolt the entire cavern began to shakeand the ground began to buckle i was afraid of that he shouted get outof here 
 chewbacca barked in agreement and bolted toward the millennium behind him leia and han rushed toward the ship covering their faces as aswarm of mynocks flew past them they reached the falcon and ran up theplatform into the ship as soon as they were on board chewbacca closed the hatchafter them careful that none of the mynocks could slip inside 
 chewie fire her up han yelled as he and leia darted through the getting out of here 
 chewbacca hurriedly lumbered to his seat in the cockpit while han rushed tocheck the scopes on the hold control panel 
 leia running to keep up warned they would spot us long before we could getup to speed 
 han seem to hear her he checked the controls then turned to rush backto the cockpit but as he passed her his comment made it clear he had heard everyword no time to discuss this in the committee 
 and with that he was gone racing to his chair where he began workingthe engine throttles the next minute the whine of the main engines resoundedthrough the ship 
 but leia hurried after him i am not a committee she shouted indignantly 
 it appear that he heard her the sudden was beginning tosubside but han was determined to get his ship out fast 
 leia began to strap herself into her seat 
 you make the jump to in the asteroid field she called overthe engine roar 
 solo grinned at her over his shoulder strap yourself in sweetheart he taking off 
 but the tremors have stopped 
 han was not about to stop his ship now already the craft moved passing the craggy walls of the tunnel suddenly chewbacca barked inhorror as he stared out the front windscreen 
 directly in front of them stood a jagged white row of stalactites and stalagmitescompletely surrounding the entrance 
 i see it chewie han shouted he pulled hard on the throttle and themillennium falcon surged forward hang on 
 the cave is collapsing leia screamed as she saw the entrance ahead growsmaller 
 this is no cave 
 what 
 threepio began jabbering in terror oh my no doomed leia captain 
 mouth dropped open as she stared at the rapidly approaching tunnelopening 
 han was right they were not in a cave as they came nearer the opening itwas apparent that the white mineral formations were giant teeth and it was veryapparent that as they soared out of this giant mouth those teeth were beginning toclose 
 chewbacca roared 
 bank chewie 
 it was an impossible maneuver but chewbacca responded immediately andonce again accomplished the impossible he rolled the millennium falcon steeplyon its side tilting the ship as he accelerated it between two of those gleaming whitefangs and not a second too soon for just as the falcon flew from that living jaws clamped shut 
 the falcon sped through the rocky crevice of the asteroid pursued by a titanicspace slug the enormous pink bulk intend to lose its tasty meal and pusheditself out of its crater to swallow the escaping ship but the monster was too another moment the freighter had soared out away from the slimy pursuer andinto space as it did so the ship plunged into yet another danger the millenniumfalcon had the deadly asteroid field 
 luke was panting nearly out of breath in this the latest of his endurance jedi taskmaster had ordered him out on a marathon run through the dense growthof his jungle not only had yoda sent luke on the exhausting run but hehad invited himself along for the ride as the puffed and sweated hisway on his rugged race the little jedi master observed his progress from a pouchstrapped to back 
 yoda shook his head and muttered to himself disparagingly about the of endurance 
 by the time they returned to the clearing where was patientlywaiting exhaustion had nearly overcome him as he stumbled into theclearing yoda had yet another test planned for him 
 before luke had caught his breath the little jedi on his back tossed a metal barin front of eyes in an instant luke ignited his laser sword and swungfrantically at the bar but he was not fast enough and the bar ground with a thud luke collapsed on the wet earth in complete exhaustion he moaned too tired 
 yoda who showed no sign of sympathy retorted it would be in seven you a jedi 
 but luke knew that he was not a yet anyway and the rigoroustraining program devised by yoda had left him nearly out of breath i thought i wasin good shape he gasped 
 yes but by what standard ask i the little instructor quizzed forget yourold measures unlearn unlearn 
 luke truly felt ready to unlearn all his old ways and willing to free himself tolearn all this jedi master had to teach it was rigorous training but as time strength and abilities increased and even his skeptical little master began to seehope but it was not easy 
 yoda spent long hours lecturing his student about the ways of the jedi as theysat under the trees near little house luke listened intently to all the of lessons and as luke listened yoda chewed on his gimer stick a shorttwig with three small branches at the far end 
 and there were physical tests of all kinds in particular luke was workinghard to perfect his leap once he felt ready to show yoda his improvement as themaster sat on a log next to a wide pond he heard the loud rustling of someoneapproaching through the vegetation 
 suddenly luke appeared on the other side of the pond coming toward the waterat a run as he approached the shore he made a running leap toward yoda risinghigh above the water as he hurtled himself through the air but he fell short of theother side and landed in the water with a loud splash completely soaking yoda 
 blue lips turned down in disappointment 
 but luke was not about to give up he was determined to become a jedi matter how foolish he might feel in the attempt would pass every test yoda set forhim so he complain when yoda told him to stand on his head a bitawkwardly at first luke inverted his body and after a few wobbly moments wasstanding firmly on his hands it seemed he had been in this position for hours but itwas less difficult than it would have been before his training his concentration hadimproved so much that he was able to maintain a perfect with yodaperched on the soles of his feet 
 but that was only part of the test yoda signaled luke by tapping on his legwith his gimer stick slowly carefully and with full concentration luke raised onehand off the ground his body wavered slightly with the weight lukekept his balance and concentrating started to lift a small rock in front of him butsuddenly a whistling and beeping r unit came rushing up to his youthful master 
 luke collapsed and yoda jumped clear of his falling body annoyed theyoung jedi student asked oh artoo what is it 
 rolled about in frantic circles as he tried to communicate hismessage through a series of electronic chirps luke watched as the droid scooted tothe edge of the swamp he hurried to follow and then saw what it was the littlerobot was trying to tell him 
 standing at the edge luke saw that all but the tip of the nosehad disappeared beneath the surface 
 oh no moaned luke never get it out now 
 yoda had joined them and stamped his foot in irritation at remark sosure are you yoda scolded tried have you always with you it be you nothing that i say his little wrinkled face puckered with a furious scowl 
 luke glanced at his master then looked doubtfully toward the sunken ship 
 master he said skeptically lifting rocks is one thing but this is a littledifferent yoda was really angry now no no different he shouted thedifferences are in your mind throw them out no longer of use are they to you 
 luke trusted his master if yoda said this could be done then maybe he shouldtry he looked at the downed and readied himself for maximumconcentration okay he said at last give it a try 
 again he had spoken the wrong words no yoda said impatiently try do or do not there is no try 
 luke close his eyes he tried to envision the contours the shape to feel theweight of his fighter and he concentrated on the movement it would makeas it rose from the murky waters 
 as he concentrated he began to hear the waters churn and gurgle and then beginto bubble with the emerging nose of the the tip of the fighter was slowlylifting from the water and it hovered there for a moment then sank back beneath thesurface with a loud splash 
 luke was drained and had to gasp for breath i he said too big 
 size has no meaning yoda insisted it matters not look at me judgeme by my size do you 
 luke chastened just shook his head 
 and well you the jedi master advised for my ally is the a powerful ally it is life creates it and make it grow its energy surrounds usand binds us luminous beings we are not this crude matter he said as he skin 
 yoda made a grand sweeping gesture to indicate the vastness of the universeabout him feel it you must feel the flow feel the force around you said as he pointed between you and me and that tree and that rock 
 while yoda gave his explanation of the force artoo spun his domed headaround trying without success to register this force on his scanners he whistledand beeped in bafflement 
 yes everywhere yoda continued ignoring the little droid waiting to be feltand used yes even between this land the that ship 
 then yoda turned and looked at the swamp and as he did the water began toswirl slowly from the gently bubbling waters the nose of the fighter appearedagain 
 luke gaped in astonishment as the gracefully rose from its watery tomband moved majestically toward the shore 
 he silently vowed never to use the word impossible again for on his tree root pedestal was tiny yoda effortlessly gliding the ship from thewater onto the shore it was a sight that luke could scarcely believe but he knewthat it was a potent example of jedi mastery over the force 
 artoo equally astounded but not so philosophical issued a series of loudwhistles then bolted off to hide behind some giant roots 
 the seemed to float onto the beach then gently came to a stop 
 luke was humbled by the feat he had witnessed and approached yoda in he began dazzled i believe it 
 that yoda stated emphatically is why you fail 
 bewildered luke shook his head wondering if he would ever rise to the stationof a jedi 
 bounty hunters among the most reviled of the inhabitants this classof amoral moneygrubbers included members of every species it was a repellentoccupation and it often attracted repellent creatures to its fold some of thesecreatures had been summoned by darth vader and now stood with him on the bridgeof his imperial star destroyer 
 admiral piett observed this motley group from a distance as he stood with one captains they saw that the dark lord had invited a particularly bizarreassortment of fortune hunters including bossk whose soft baggy face gawked atvader with huge bloodshot orbs next to bossk stood zuckuss and dengar twohuman types by innumerable unspeakable adventures a batteredand tarnished droid named ig was also with the group standingnext to the notorious boba fett a human bounty hunter fett was known for hisextremely ruthless methods he was dressed in a armoredspacesuit the kind worn by a group of evil warriors defeated by the jedi knightsduring the clone wars a few braided scalps completed his unsavory image thevery sight of boba fett sent a shudder of revulsion through the admiral bounty hunters piett said with disdain why should he bring them into rebels escape us 
 before the captain could reply a controller rushed up to the he said urgently we have a priority signal from the star destroyer avenger

 chapter xxiii 
 
 pierre well knew this large room divided by columns and an arch its walls hung round with persian carpets the part of the room behind the columns with a high mahogany bedstead on one side and on the other an immense case containing icons was brightly illuminated with red light like a russian church during evening service under the gleaming icons stood a long invalid chair and in that chair on smooth pillows evidently freshly changed pierre saw covered to the waist by a bright green quilt the familiar majestic figure of his father count bezukhov with that gray mane of hair above his broad forehead which reminded one of a lion and the deep characteristically noble wrinkles of his handsome ruddy face he lay just under the icons his large thick hands outside the quilt into the right hand which was lying palm downwards a wax taper had been thrust between forefinger and thumb and an old servant bending over from behind the chair held it in position by the chair stood the priests their long hair falling over their magnificent glittering vestments with lighted tapers in their hands slowly and solemnly conducting the service a little behind them stood the two younger princesses holding handkerchiefs to their eyes and just in front of them their eldest sister catiche with a vicious and determined look steadily fixed on the icons as though declaring to all that she could not answer for herself should she glance round anna mikhaylovna with a meek sorrowful and expression on her face stood by the door near the strange lady prince vasili in front of the door near the invalid chair a wax taper in his left hand was leaning his left arm on the carved back of a velvet chair he had turned round for the purpose and was crossing himself with his right hand turning his eyes upward each time he touched his forehead his face wore a calm look of piety and resignation to the will of god if you do not understand these sentiments he seemed to be saying so much the worse for you 
 behind him stood the the doctors and the menservants the men and women had separated as in church all were silently crossing themselves and the reading of the church service the subdued chanting of deep bass voices and in the intervals sighs and the shuffling of feet were the only sounds that could be heard anna mikhaylovna with an air of importance that showed that she felt she quite knew what she was about went across the room to where pierre was standing and gave him a taper he lit it and distracted by observing those around him began crossing himself with the hand that held the taper 
 sophie the rosy youngest princess with the mole watched him she smiled hid her face in her handkerchief and remained with it hidden for awhile then looking up and seeing pierre she again began to laugh she evidently felt unable to look at him without laughing but could not resist looking at him so to be out of temptation she slipped quietly behind one of the columns in the midst of the service the voices of the priests suddenly ceased they whispered to one another and the old servant who was holding the hand got up and said something to the ladies anna mikhaylovna stepped forward and stooping over the dying man beckoned to lorrain from behind her back the french doctor held no taper he was leaning against one of the columns in a respectful attitude implying that he a foreigner in spite of all differences of faith understood the full importance of the rite now being performed and even approved of it he now approached the sick man with the noiseless step of one in full vigor of life with his delicate white fingers raised from the green quilt the hand that was free and turning sideways felt the pulse and reflected a moment the sick man was given something to drink there was a stir around him then the people resumed their places and the service continued during this interval pierre noticed that prince vasili left the chair on which he had been leaning and with air which intimated that he knew what he was about and if others did not understand him it was so much the worse for them did not go up to the dying man but passed by him joined the eldest princess and moved with her to the side of the room where stood the high bedstead with its silken hangings on leaving the bed both prince vasili and the princess passed out by a back door but returned to their places one after the other before the service was concluded pierre paid no more attention to this occurrence than to the rest of what went on having made up his mind once for all that what he saw happening around him that evening was in some way essential 
 the chanting of the service ceased and the voice of the priest was heard respectfully congratulating the dying man on having received the sacrament the dying man lay as lifeless and immovable as before around him everyone began to stir steps were audible and whispers among which anna was the most distinct 
 pierre heard her say 
 certainly he must be moved onto the bed here it will be impossible 
 the sick man was so surrounded by doctors princesses and servants that pierre could no longer see the face with its gray mane which though he saw other faces as well he had not lost sight of for a single moment during the whole service he judged by the cautious movements of those who crowded round the invalid chair that they had lifted the dying man and were moving him 
 catch hold of my arm or drop him he heard one of the servants say in a frightened whisper catch hold from underneath here exclaimed different voices and the heavy breathing of the bearers and the shuffling of their feet grew more hurried as if the weight they were carrying were too much for them 
 as the bearers among whom was anna mikhaylovna passed the young man he caught a momentary glimpse between their heads and backs of the dying high stout uncovered chest and powerful shoulders raised by those who were holding him under the armpits and of his gray curly leonine head this head with its remarkably broad brow and cheekbones its handsome sensual mouth and its cold majestic expression was not disfigured by the approach of death it was the same as pierre remembered it three months before when the count had sent him to petersburg but now this head was swaying helplessly with the uneven movements of the bearers and the cold listless gaze fixed itself upon nothing 
 after a few minutes bustle beside the high bedstead those who had carried the sick man dispersed anna mikhaylovna touched hand and said come pierre went with her to the bed on which the sick man had been laid in a stately pose in keeping with the ceremony just completed he lay with his head propped high on the pillows his hands were symmetrically placed on the green silk quilt the palms downward when pierre came up the count was gazing straight at him but with a look the significance of which could not be understood by mortal man either this look meant nothing but that as long as one has eyes they must look somewhere or it meant too much pierre hesitated not knowing what to do and glanced inquiringly at his guide anna mikhaylovna made a hurried sign with her eyes glancing at the sick hand and moving her lips as if to send it a kiss pierre carefully stretching his neck so as not to touch the quilt followed her suggestion and pressed his lips to the large boned fleshy hand neither the hand nor a single muscle of the face stirred once more pierre looked questioningly at anna mikhaylovna to see what he was to do next anna mikhaylovna with her eyes indicated a chair that stood beside the bed pierre obediently sat down his eyes asking if he were doing right anna mikhaylovna nodded approvingly again pierre fell into the naively symmetrical pose of an egyptian statue evidently distressed that his stout and clumsy body took up so much room and doing his utmost to look as small as possible he looked at the count who still gazed at the spot where face had been before he sat down anna mikhaylovna indicated by her attitude her consciousness of the pathetic importance of these last moments of meeting between the father and son this lasted about two minutes which to pierre seemed an hour suddenly the broad muscles and lines of the face began to twitch the twitching increased the handsome mouth was drawn to one side only now did pierre realize how near death his father was and from that distorted mouth issued an indistinct hoarse sound anna mikhaylovna looked attentively at the sick eyes trying to guess what he wanted she pointed first to pierre then to some drink then named prince vasili in an inquiring whisper then pointed to the quilt the eyes and face of the sick man showed impatience he made an effort to look at the servant who stood constantly at the head of the bed 
 wants to turn on the other side whispered the servant and got up to turn the heavy body toward the wall 
 pierre rose to help him 
 while the count was being turned over one of his arms fell back helplessly and he made a fruitless effort to pull it forward whether he noticed the look of terror with which pierre regarded that lifeless arm or whether some other thought flitted across his dying brain at any rate he glanced at the refractory arm at face and again at the arm and on his face a feeble piteous smile appeared quite out of keeping with his features that seemed to deride his own helplessness at sight of this smile pierre felt an unexpected quivering in his breast and a tickling in his nose and tears dimmed his eyes the sick man was turned on to his side with his face to the wall he sighed 
 he is dozing said anna mikhaylovna observing that one of the princesses was coming to take her turn at watching let us go 
 pierre went out

 chapter 
 
 the rainy night had ushered in a misty frost half drizzle and temporary brooks crossed our from the uplands my feet were thoroughly wetted i was cross and low exactly the humour suited for making the most of these disagreeable things we entered the farmhouse by the kitchen way to ascertain whether mr heathcliff were really absent because i put slight faith in his own affirmation 
 joseph seemed sitting in a sort of elysium alone beside a roaring fire a quart of ale on the table near him bristling with large pieces of toasted oatcake and his black short pipe in his mouth catherine ran to the hearth to warm herself i asked if the master was in my question remained so long unanswered that i thought the old man had grown deaf and repeated it louder 
 he snarled or rather screamed through his nose yah muh goa back whear yah coom frough 
 joseph cried a peevish voice simultaneously with me from the inner room how often am i to call you there are only a few red ashes now joseph come this moment 
 vigorous puffs and a resolute stare into the grate declared he had no ear for this appeal the housekeeper and hareton were invisible one gone on an errand and the other at his work probably we knew tones and entered 
 oh i hope die in a garret starved to death said the boy mistaking our approach for that of his negligent attendant 
 he stopped on observing his error his cousin flew to him 
 is that you miss linton he said raising his head from the arm of the great chair in which he reclined kiss me it takes my breath dear me papa said you would call continued he after recovering a little from embrace while she stood by liking very contrite will you shut the door if you please you left it open and detestable creatures bring coals to the fire so cold 
 i stirred up the cinders and fetched a scuttleful myself the invalid complained of being covered with ashes but he had a tiresome cough and looked feverish and ill so i did not rebuke his temper 
 well linton murmured catherine when his corrugated brow relaxed are you glad to see me can i do you any good 
 why you come before he asked you should have come instead of writing it tired me dreadfully writing those long letters far rather have talked to you now i can neither bear to talk nor anything else i wonder where zillah is will you looking at me step into the kitchen and see 
 i had received no thanks for my other service and being unwilling to run out to and fro at his behest i replied 
 nobody is out there but joseph 
 i want to drink he exclaimed fretfully turning away zillah is constantly gadding off to gimmerton since papa went miserable and obliged to come down resolved never to hear me upstairs 
 is your father attentive to you master heathcliff i asked perceiving catherine to be checked in her friendly advances 
 attentive he makes them a little more attentive at least he cried the wretches do you know miss linton that brute hareton laughs at me i hate him indeed i hate them all they are odious beings 
 cathy began searching for some water she lighted on a pitcher in the dresser filled a tumbler and brought it he bid her add a spoonful of wine from a bottle on the table and having swallowed a small portion appeared more tranquil and said she was very kind 
 and are you glad to see me asked she reiterating her former question and pleased to detect the faint dawn of a smile 
 yes i am something new to hear a voice like yours he replied but i have been vexed because you come and papa swore it was owing to me he called me a pitiful shuffling worthless thing and said you despised me and if he had been in my place he would be more the master of the grange than your father by this time but you despise me do you miss 
 i wish you would say catherine or cathy interrupted my young lady despise you no next to papa and ellen i love you better than anybody living i love mr heathcliff though and i dare not come when he returns will he stay away many days 
 not many answered linton but he goes on to the moors frequently since the shooting season commenced and you might spend an hour or two with me in his absence do say you will i think i should not be peevish with you not provoke me and always be ready to help me you 
 yes said catherine stroking his long soft hair if i could only get consent spend half my time with you pretty linton i wish you were my brother 
 and then you would like me as well as your father observed he more cheerfully but papa says you would love me better than him and all the world if you were my wife so rather you were that 
 no i should never love anybody better than papa she returned gravely and people hate their wives sometimes but not their sisters and brothers and if you were the latter you would live with us and papa would be as fond of you as he is of me 
 linton denied that people ever hated their wives but cathy affirmed they did and in her wisdom instanced his own aversion to her aunt i endeavoured to stop her thoughtless tongue i succeed till everything she knew was out master heathcliff much irritated asserted her relation was false 
 papa told me and papa does not tell falsehoods she answered pertly 
 ny papa scorns yours cried linton he calls him a sneaking fool 
 yours is a wicked man retorted catherine and you are very naughty to dare to repeat what he says he must be wicked to have made aunt isabella leave him as she did 
 she leave him said the boy you contradict me 
 she did cried my young lady 
 well tell you something said linton your mother hated your father now then 
 oh exclaimed catherine too enraged to continue and she loved mine added he 
 you little liar i hate you now she panted and her face grew red with passion 
 she did she did sang linton sinking into the recess of his chair and leaning back his head to enjoy the agitation of the other disputant who stood behind 
 hush master heathcliff i said your tale too i suppose 
 it you hold your tongue he answered she did she did catherine she did she did 
 cathy beside herself gave the chair a violent push and caused him to fall against one arm he was immediately seized by a suffocating cough that soon ended his triumph it lasted so long that it frightened even me as to his cousin she wept with all her might aghast at the mischief she had done though she said nothing i held him till the fit exhausted itself then he thrust me away and leant his head down silently catherine quelled her lamentations also took a seat opposite and looked solemnly into the fire 
 how do you feel now master heathcliff i inquired after waiting ten minutes 
 i wish she felt as i do he replied spiteful cruel thing hareton never touches me he never struck me in his life and i was better today and there his voice died in a whimper 
 i strike you muttered cathy chewing her lip to prevent another burst of emotion 
 he sighed and moaned like one under great suffering and kept it up for a quarter of an hour on purpose to distress his cousin apparently for whenever he caught a stifled sob from her he put renewed pain and pathos into the inflections of his voice 
 sorry i hurt you linton she said at length racked beyond endurance but i have been hurt by that little push and i had no idea that you could either not much are you linton let me go home thinking done you harm answer speak to me 
 i speak to you he murmured hurt me so that i shall lie awake all night choking with this cough if you had it know what it was but be comfortably asleep while in agony and nobody near me i wonder how you would like to pass those fearful nights and he began to wail aloud for very pity of himself 
 since you are in the habit of passing dreadful nights i said it be miss who spoils your ease be the same had she never come however she shall not disturb you again and perhaps get quieter when we leave you 
 must i go asked catherine dolefully bending over him do you want me to go linton 
 you alter what done he replied pettishly shrinking from her unless you alter it for the worse by teasing me into a fever 
 well then i must go she repeated 
 let me alone at least said he i bear your talking 
 she lingered and resisted my persuasions to departure a tiresome while but as he neither looked up nor spoke she finally made a movement to the door and i followed we were recalled by a scream linton had slid from his seat on to the hearthstone and lay writhing in the mere perverseness of an indulged plague of a child determined to be as grievous and harassing as it can i thoroughly gauged his disposition from his behaviour and saw at once it would be folly to attempt humouring him not so my companion she ran back in terror knelt down and cried and soothed and entreated till he grew quiet from lack of breath by no means from compunction at distressing her 
 i shall lift him on the settle i said and he may roll about as he pleases we stop to watch him i hope you are satisfied miss cathy that you are not the person to benefit him and that his condition of health is not occasioned by attachment to you now then there he is come away as soon as he knows there is nobody by to care for his nonsense be glad to lie still 
 she placed a cushion under his head and offered him some water he rejected the latter and tossed uneasily on the former as if it were a stone or a block of wood she tried to put it more comfortably 
 i do with that he said not high enough 
 catherine brought another to lay above it 
 too high murmured the provoking thing 
 how must i arrange it then she asked despairingly 
 he twined himself up to her as she half knelt by the settle and converted her shoulder into a support 
 no that do i said be content with the cushion master heathcliff miss has wasted too much time on you already we cannot remain five minutes longer 
 yes yes we can replied cathy good and patient now beginning to think i shall have far greater misery than he will tonight if i believe he is the worse for my visit and then i dare not come again tell the truth about it linton for i come if i have hurt you 
 you must come to cure me he answered you ought to come because you have hurt me you know you have extremely i was not as ill when you entered as i am at i 
 but made yourself ill by crying and being in a passion 
 i do it at all said his cousin however be friends 
 now and you want me you would wish to see me sometimes really 
 i told you i did he replied impatiently sit on the settle and let me lean on your knee as mamma used to do whole afternoons together sit quite still and talk but you may sing a song if you can sing or you may say a nice long interesting of those you promised to teach me or a story rather have a ballad though begin 
 catherine repeated the longest she could remember the employment pleased both mightily linton would have another and after that another notwithstanding my strenuous objections and so they went on until the clock struck twelve and we heard hareton in the court returning for his dinner 
 and tomorrow catherine will you be here tomorrow asked young heathcliff holding her frock as she rose reluctantly 
 no i answered nor next day neither she however gave a different response evidently for his forehead cleared as she stooped and whispered in his ear 
 you go tomorrow recollect miss i commenced when we were out of the house you are not dreaming of it are you 
 oh take good care i continued have that lock mended and you can escape by no way else 
 i can get over the wall she said laughing the grange is not a prison ellen and you are not my jailer and besides almost seventeen a woman and certain linton would recover quickly if he had me to look after him older than he is you know and wiser less childish am i not and soon do as i direct him with some slight coaxing a pretty little darling when good make such a pet of him if he were mine we should never quarrel should we after we were used to each other you like him ellen 
 like him i exclaimed the bit of a sickly slip that ever struggled into its teens happily as mr heathcliff conjectured not win twenty i doubt whether see spring indeed and small loss to his family whenever he drops off and lucky it is for us that his father took him the kinder he was treated the more tedious and selfish be glad you have no chance of having him for a husband miss catherine 
 my companion waxed serious at hearing this speech to speak of his death so regardlessly wounded her feelings 
 younger than i she answered after a protracted pause of meditation and he ought to live the longest he must live as long as i do as strong now as when he first came into the north positive of that only a cold that ails him the same as papa has you say papa will get better and why he 
 well well i cried after all we trouble ourselves for listen miss and mind keep my you attempt going to wuthering heights again with or without me i shall inform mr linton and unless he allow it the intimacy with your cousin must not be revived 
 it has been revived muttered cathy sulkily must not be continued then i said 
 see was her reply and she set off at a gallop leaving me to toil in the rear 
 we both reached home before our dinner time my master supposed we had been wandering through the park and therefore he demanded no explanation of our absence as soon as i entered i hastened to change my soaked shoes and stockings but sitting such a while at the heights had done the mischief on the succeeding morning i was laid up and during three weeks i remained incapacitated for attending to my duties a calamity never experienced prior to that period and never i am thankful to say since 
 my little mistress behaved like an angel in coming to wait on me and cheer my solitude the confinement brought me exceedingly low it is wearisome to a stirring active body but few have slighter reasons for complaint than i had the moment catherine left mr room she appeared at my bedside her day was divided between us no amusement usurped a minute she neglected her meals her studies and her play and she was the fondest nurse that ever watched she must have had a warm heart when she loved her father so to give so much to me i said her days were divided between us but the master retired early and i generally needed nothing after six thus the evening was her own poor thing i never considered what she did with herself after tea and though frequently when she looked in to bid me good night i remarked a fresh colour in her cheeks and a pinkness over her slender fingers instead of fancying the hue borrowed from a cold ride across the moors i laid it to the charge of a hot fire in the library

 chapter 
 
 like bees swarming after their queen mother and daughters hovered about mr march the next day neglecting everything to look at wait upon and listen to the new invalid who was in a fair way to be killed by kindness as he sat propped up in a big chair by sofa with the other three close by and hannah popping in her head now and then to peek at the dear man nothing seemed needed to complete their happiness but something was needed and the elder ones felt it though none confessed the fact mr and mrs march looked at one another with an anxious expression as their eyes followed meg jo had sudden fits of sobriety and was seen to shake her fist at mr umbrella which had been left in the hall meg was shy and silent started when the bell rang and colored when name was mentioned amy said everyone seemed waiting for something and settle down which was queer since father was safe at home and beth innocently wondered why their neighbors run over as usual 
 laurie went by in the afternoon and seeing meg at the window seemed suddenly possessed with a melodramatic fit for he fell down on one knee in the snow beat his breast tore his hair and clasped his hands imploringly as if begging some boon and when meg told him to behave himself and go away he wrung imaginary tears out of his handkerchief and staggered round the corner as if in utter despair 
 what does the goose mean said meg laughing and trying to look unconscious 
 showing you how your john will go on touchin it answered jo scornfully 
 say my john it proper or true but voice lingered over the words as if they sounded pleasant to her please plague me jo told you i care much about him and there to be anything said but we are all to be friendly and go on as before 
 we for something has been said and mischief has spoiled you for me i see it and so does mother you are not like your old self a bit and seem ever so far away from me i mean to plague you and will bear it like a man but i do wish it was all settled i hate to wait so if you mean ever to do it make haste and have it over quickly said jo pettishly 
 i say anything till he speaks and he because father said i was too young began meg bending over her work with a queer little smile which suggested that she did not quite agree with her father on that point 
 if he did speak you know what to say but would cry or blush or let him have his own way instead of giving a good decided no 
 not so silly and weak as you think i know just what i should say for planned it all so i be taken unawares no knowing what may happen and i wished to be prepared 
 jo help smiling at the important air which meg had unconsciously assumed and which was as becoming as the pretty color varying in her cheeks 
 would you mind telling me what say asked jo more respectfully 
 not at all you are sixteen now quite old enough to be my confidente and my experience will be useful to you perhaps in your own affairs of this sort 
 mean to have any fun to watch other people philander but i should feel like a fool doing it myself said jo looking alarmed at the thought 
 i think not if you liked anyone very much and he liked you meg spoke as if to herself and glanced out at the lane where she had often seen lovers walking together in the summer twilight 
 i thought you were going to tell your speech to that man said jo rudely shortening her little reverie 
 oh i should merely say quite calmly and decidedly thank you mr brooke you are very kind but i agree with father that i am too young to enter into any engagement at present so please say no more but let us be friends as we were 
 hum stiff and cool enough i believe ever say it and i know he be satisfied if you do if he goes on like the rejected lovers in books give in rather than hurt his feelings 
 no i i shall tell him made up my mind and shall walk out of the room with dignity 
 meg rose as she spoke and was just going to rehearse the dignified exit when a step in the hall made her fly into her seat and begin to sew as fast as if her life depended on finishing that particular seam in a given time jo smothered a laugh at the sudden change and when someone gave a modest tap opened the door with a grim aspect which was anything but hospitable 
 good afternoon i came to get my umbrella that is to see how your father finds himself today said mr brooke getting a trifle confused as his eyes went from one telltale face to the other 
 very well in the rack get him and tell it you are here and having jumbled her father and the umbrella well together in her reply jo slipped out of the room to give meg a chance to make her speech and air her dignity but the instant she vanished meg began to sidle toward the door murmuring 
 mother will like to see you pray sit down call her 
 go are you afraid of me margaret and mr brooke looked so hurt that meg thought she must have done something very rude she blushed up to the little curls on her forehead for he had never called her margaret before and she was surprised to find how natural and sweet it seemed to hear him say it anxious to appear friendly and at her ease she put out her hand with a confiding gesture and said gratefully 
 how can i be afraid when you have been so kind to father i only wish i could thank you for it 
 shall i tell you how asked mr brooke holding the small hand fast in both his own and looking down at meg with so much love in the brown eyes that her heart began to flutter and she both longed to run away and to stop and listen 
 oh no please rather not she said trying to withdraw her hand and looking frightened in spite of her denial 
 i trouble you i only want to know if you care for me a little meg i love you so much dear added mr brooke tenderly 
 this was the moment for the calm proper speech but meg make it she forgot every word of it hung her head and answered i know so softly that john had to stoop down to catch the foolish little reply 
 he seemed to think it was worth the trouble for he smiled to himself as if quite satisfied pressed the plump hand gratefully and said in his most persuasive tone will you try and find out i want to know so much for i go to work with any heart until i learn whether i am to have my reward in the end or not 
 too young faltered meg wondering was she was so fluttered yet rather enjoying it 
 wait and in the meantime you could be learning to like me would it be a very hard lesson dear 
 not if i chose to learn it but 
 please choose to learn meg i love you to teach and this is easier than german broke in john getting possession of the other hand so that she had no way of hiding her face as he bent to look into it 
 his tone was properly beseeching but stealing a shy look at him meg saw that his eyes were merry as well as tender and that he wore the satisfied smile of one who had no doubt of his success this nettled her annie foolish lessons in coquetry came into her mind and the love of power which sleeps in the bosoms of the best of little women woke up all of a sudden and took possession of her she felt excited and strange and not knowing what else to do followed a capricious impulse and withdrawing her hands said petulantly i choose please go away and let me be 
 poor mr brooke looked as if his lovely castle in the air was tumbling about his ears for he had never seen meg in such a mood before and it rather bewildered him 
 do you really mean that he asked anxiously following her as she walked away 
 yes i do i want to be worried about such things father says i too soon and rather not 
 i hope change your mind wait and say nothing till you have had more time play with me meg i think that of you 
 think of me at all rather you said meg taking a naughty satisfaction in trying her patience and her own power he was grave and pale now and looked decidedly more like the novel heroes whom she admired but he neither slapped his forehead nor tramped about the room as they did he just stood looking at her so wistfully so tenderly that she found her heart relenting in spite of herself what would have happened next i cannot say if aunt march had not come hobbling in at this interesting minute 
 the old lady resist her longing to see her nephew for she had met laurie as she took her airing and hearing of mr arrival drove straight out to see him the family were all busy in the back part of the house and she had made her way quietly in hoping to surprise them she did surprise two of them so much that meg started as if she had seen a ghost and mr brooke vanished into the study 
 bless me all this cried the old lady with a rap of her cane as she glanced from the pale young gentleman to the scarlet young lady 
 friend so surprised to see you stammered meg feeling that she was in for a lecture now 
 evident returned aunt march sitting down but what is friend saying to make you look like a peony mischief going on and i insist upon knowing what it is with another rap 
 we were only talking mr brooke came for his umbrella began meg wishing that mr brooke and the umbrella were safely out of the house 
 brooke that tutor ah i understand now i know all about it jo blundered into a wrong message in one of your letters and i made her tell me you gone and accepted him child cried aunt march looking scandalized 
 hush hear i call mother said meg much troubled 
 not yet something to say to you and i must free my mind at once tell me do you mean to marry this cook if you do not one penny of my money ever goes to you remember that and be a sensible girl said the old lady impressively 
 now aunt march possessed in perfection the art of rousing the spirit of opposition in the gentlest people and enjoyed doing it the best of us have a spice of perversity in us especially when we are young and in love if aunt march had begged meg to accept john brooke she would probably have declared she think of it but as she was preemptorily ordered not to like him she immediately made up her mind that she would inclination as well as perversity made the decision easy and being already much excited meg opposed the old lady with unusual spirit i shall marry whom i please aunt march and you can leave your money to anyone you like she said nodding her head with a resolute air 
 is that the way you take my advice miss be sorry for it when tried love in a cottage and found it a failure 
 it be a worse one than some people find in big houses retorted meg 
 aunt march put on her glasses and took a look at the girl for she did not know her in this new mood meg hardly knew herself she felt so brave and independent so glad to defend john and assert her right to love him if she liked aunt march saw that she had begun wrong and after a little pause made a fresh start saying as mildly as she could now meg my dear be reasonable and take my advice i mean it kindly and want you to spoil your whole life by making a mistake at the beginning you ought to marry well and help your family your duty to make a rich match and it ought to be impressed upon you 
 father and mother think so they like john though he is poor 
 your parents my dear have no more worldly wisdom than a pair of babies 
 glad of it cried meg stoutly 
 aunt march took no notice but went on with her lecture this rook is poor and got any rich relations has he 
 no but he has many warm friends 
 you live on friends try it and see how cool grow he any business has he 
 not yet mr laurence is going to help him 
 that last long james laurence is a crotchety old fellow and not to be depended on so you intend to marry a man without money position or business and go on working harder than you do now when you might be comfortable all your days by minding me and doing better i thought you had more sense meg 
 i do better if i waited half my life john is good and wise got heaps of talent willing to work and sure to get on so energetic and brave everyone likes and respects him and proud to think he cares for me though so poor and young and silly said meg looking prettier than ever in her earnestness 
 he knows you have got rich relations child the secret of his liking i suspect 
 aunt march how dare you say such a thing john is above such meanness and i listen to you a minute if you talk so cried meg indignantly forgetting everything but the injustice of the old suspicions my john marry for money any more than i would we are willing to work and we mean to wait not afraid of being poor for been happy so far and i know i shall be with him because he loves me and i 
 meg stopped there remembering all of a sudden that she made up her mind that she had told her john to go away and that he might be overhearing her inconsistent remarks 
 aunt march was very angry for she had set her heart on having her pretty niece make a fine match and something in the happy young face made the lonely old woman feel both sad and sour 
 well i wash my hands of the whole affair you are a willful child and lost more than you know by this piece of folly no i stop disappointed in you and spirits to see your father now expect anything from me when you are married your mr friends must take care of you done with you forever 
 and slamming the door in face aunt march drove off in high dudgeon she seemed to take all the courage with her for when left alone meg stood for a moment undecided whether to laugh or cry before she could make up her mind she was taken possession of by mr brooke who said all in one breath i help hearing meg thank you for defending me and aunt march for proving that you do care for me a little bit 
 i know how much till she abused you began meg 
 and i go away but my stay and be happy may i dear 
 here was another fine chance to make the crushing speech and the stately exit but meg never thought of doing either and disgraced herself forever in eyes by meekly whispering yes john and hiding her face on mr waistcoat 
 fifteen minutes after aunt departure jo came softly downstairs paused an instant at the parlor door and hearing no sound within nodded and smiled with a satisfied expression saying to herself she has seen him away as we planned and that affair is settled go and hear the fun and have a good laugh over it 
 but poor jo never got her laugh for she was transfixed upon the threshold by a spectacle which held her there staring with her mouth nearly as wide open as her eyes going in to exult over a fallen enemy and to praise a sister for the banishment of an objectionable lover it certainly was a shock to behold the aforesaid enemy serenely sitting on the sofa with thestrongminded sister enthroned upon his knee and wearing an expression of the most abject submission jo gave a sort of gasp as if a cold shower bath had suddenly fallen upon her for such an unexpected turning of the tables actually took her breath away at the odd sound the lovers turned and saw her meg jumped up looking both proud and shy but that man as jo called him actually laughed and said coolly as he kissed the astonished newcomer sister jo congratulate us 
 that was adding insult to injury it was altogether too much and making some wild demonstration with her hands jo vanished without a word rushing upstairs she startled the invalids by exclaiming tragically as she burst into the room oh do somebody go down quick john brooke is acting dreadfully and meg likes it 
 mr and mrs march left the room with speed and casting herself upon the be jo cried and scolded tempestuously as she told the awful news to beth and amy the little girls however considered it a most agreeable and interesting event and jo got little comfort from them so she went up to her refuge in the garret and confided her troubles to the rats 
 nobody ever knew what went on in the parlor that afternoon but a great deal of talking was done and quiet mr brooke astonished his friends by the eloquence and spirit with which he pleaded his suit told his plans and persuaded them to arrange everything just as he wanted it 
 the tea bell rang before he had finished describing the paradise which he meant to earn for meg and he proudly took her in to supper both looking so happy that jo the heart to be jealous or dismal amy was very much impressed by devotion and dignity beth beamed at them from a distance while mr and mrs march surveyed the young couple with such tender satisfaction that it was perfectly evident aunt march was right in calling them as unworldly as a pair of babies no one ate much but everyone looked very happy and the old room seemed to brighten up amazingly when the first romance of the family began there 
 you say nothing pleasant ever happens now can you meg said amy trying to decide how she would group the lovers in a sketch she was planning to make no sure i how much has happened since i said that it seems a year ago answered meg who was in a blissful dream lifted far above such common things as bread and butter 
 the joys come close upon the sorrows this time and i rather think the changes have begun said mrs march in most families there comes now and then a year full of events this has been such a one but it ends well after all 
 hope the next will end better muttered jo who found it very hard to see meg absorbed in a stranger before her face for jo loved a few persons very dearly and dreaded to have their affection lost or lessened in any way i hope the third year from this will end better i mean it shall if i live to work out my plans said mr brooke smiling at meg as if everything had become possible to him now 
 it seem very long to wait asked amy who was in a hurry for the wedding 
 got so much to learn before i shall be ready it seems a short time to me answered meg with a sweet gravity in her face never seen there before 
 you have only to wait i am to do the work said john beginning his labors by picking up napkin with an expression which caused jo to shake her head and then say to herself with an air of relief as the front door banged here comes laurie now we shall have some sensible conversation 
 but jo was mistaken for laurie came prancing in overflowing with good spirits bearing a great bouquet for mrs john brooke and evidently laboring under the delusion that the whole affair had been brought about by his excellent management 
 i knew brooke would have it all his own way he always does for when he makes up his mind to accomplish anything done though the sky falls said laurie when he had presented his offering and his congratulations 
 much obliged for that recommendation i take it as a good omen for the future and invite you to my wedding on the spot answered mr brooke who felt at peace with all mankind even his mischievous pupil 
 come if at the ens of the earth for the sight of face alone on that occasion would be worth a long journey you look festive the matter asked laurie following her into a corner of the parlor whither all had adjourned to greet mr laurence 
 i approve of the match but made up my mind to bear it and shall not say a word against it said jo solemnly you know how hard it is for me to give up meg she continued with a little quiver in her voice you give her up you only go halves said laurie consolingly 
 it can never be the same again lost my dearest friend sighed jo 
 got me anyhow not good for much i know but stand by you jo all the days of my life upon my word i will and laurie meant what he said 
 i know you will and ever so much obliged you are always a great comfort to me teddy returned jo gratefully shaking hands well now be dismal a good fellow all right you see meg is happy brooke will fly round and get settled immediately grandpa will attend to him and it will be very jolly to see meg in her own little house have capital times after she is gone for i shall be through college before long and then go abroad on some nice trip or other that console you 
 i rather think it would but no knowing what may happen in three years said jo thoughtfully 
 true you wish you could take a look forward and wee where we shall all be then i do returned laurie 
 i think not for i might see something sad and everyone looks so happy now i believe they could be much improved and eyes went slowly round the room brightening as they looked for the prospect was a pleasant one 
 father and mother sat together quietly reliving the first chapter of the romance which for them began some twenty years ago amy was drawing the lovers who sat apart in a beautiful world of their own the light of which touched their faces with a grace the little artist could not copy beth lay on her sofa talking cheerily with her old friend who held her little hand as if he felt that it possessed the power to lead him along the peaceful way she walked jo lounged in her favorite low seat with the grave quiet look which best became her and laurie leaning on the back of her chair his chin on a level with her curly head smiled with his friendliest aspect and nodded at her in the long glass which reflected them both 
 so the curtain falls upon meg jo beth and amy whether it ever rises again depends upon the reception given the first act of the domestic drama called little women

 screams ready to die

 fast as you can to catch me 
 we close in on the racing columns of numbers shimmering 
 across the screen

 i thought i should call and let you know how things stand 
 we dive through the numbers surging up through the 
 darkness sucked towards a tight constellation of stars 
 neo 
 i know real proud of this world built the way it 
 works all the nice little rules and such but got some bad 
 news 
 we realize that the constellation is actually the holes 
 in the mouthpiece of a phone seen from inside 
 neo 
 decided to make a few 
 changes 
 we shoot through the holes as neo hangs up the phone 
 he steps out of the phone booth and starts walking 
 wearing a long black coat and dark glasses he passes a 
 mother dragging her little boy who cranes his neck as 
 neo takes off flying up into the air 
 boy 
 mommy mommy 
 mommy 
 what 
 boy 
 that man that man flies 
 mommy 
 be silly honey men fly 
 there is a rush of air as the boy stares up as neo shoots 
 overhead his coat billowing like a black leather cape 
 as he soars up up and away

lionfish nov chapter the yule ballcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 despite the very heavy load of homework that the fourth years had been given for the holidays harry was in no mood to work when term ended and spent the week leading up to christmas enjoying himself as fully as possible along with everyone else gryffindor tower was hardly less crowded now than during it seemed to have shrunk slightly too as its inhabitants were being so much rowdier than usual fred and george had had a great success with their canary creams and for the first couple of days of the holidays people kept bursting into feather all over the place before long however all the gryffindors had learned to treat food anybody else offered them with extreme caution in case it had a canary cream concealed in the center and george confided to harry that he and fred were now working on developing something else harry made a mental note never to accept so much as a crisp from fred and george in future he still forgotten dudley and the toffee 
 
 snow was falling thickly upon the castle and its grounds now the pale blue beauxbatons carriage looked like a large chilly frosted pumpkin next to the iced gingerbread house that was cabin while the durmstrang portholes were glazed with ice the rigging white with frost the down in the kitchen were outdoing themselves with a series of rich warming stews and savory puddings and only fleur delacour seemed to be able to find anything to complain about 
 
 it is too eavy all zis ogwarts food they heard her saying grumpily as they left the great hall behind her one evening ron skulking behind harry keen not to be spotted by fleur i will not fit into my dress robes 
 
 oooh a tragedy hermione snapped as fleur went out into the entrance hall she really thinks a lot of herself that one she 
 
 hermione who are you going to the ball with said ron 
 
 he kept springing this question on her hoping to startle her into a response by asking it when she least expected it however hermione merely frowned and said not telling you just make fun of me 
 
 joking weasley said malfoy behind them not telling me asked that to the ball not the mudblood 
 
 harry and ron both whipped around but hermione said loudly waving to somebody over shoulder hello professor moody 
 
 malfoy went pale and jumped backward looking wildly around for moody but he was still up at the staff table finishing his stew 
 
 twitchy little ferret you malfoy said hermione scathingly and she harry and ron went up the marble staircase laughing heartily 
 
 hermione said ron looking sideways at her suddenly frowning your teeth 
 
 what about them she said 
 
 well just noticed 
 
 of course they are did you expect me to keep those fangs malfoy gave me 
 
 no i mean different to how they were before he put that hex on allstraight and and 
 
 hermione suddenly smiled very mischievously and harry noticed it too it was a very different smile from the one he remembered 
 
 wellwhen i went up to madam pomfrey to get them shrunk she held up a mirror and told me to stop her when they were back to how they normally were she said and i justlet her carry on a bit she smiled even more widely mum and dad be too pleased been trying to persuade them to let me shrink them for ages but they wanted me to carry on with my braces you know dentists they just think teeth and magic should look back 
 
 tiny owl was twittering madly on the top of the banisters a scroll of parchment tied to his leg people passing him were pointing and laughing and a group of girls paused and said oh look at the weeny owl he cute 
 
 stupid little feathery git ron hissed hurrying up the stairs and snatching up pigwidgeon you bring letters to the addressee you hang around showing off 
 
 pigwidgeon hooted happily his head protruding over fist the girls all looked very shocked 
 
 clear off ron snapped at them waving the fist holding pigwidgeon who hooted more happily than ever as he soared through the air here take it harry ron added in an undertone as the girls scuttled away looking scandalized he pulled reply off pigwidgeons leg harry pocketed it and they hurried back to gryffindor tower to read it 
 
 everyone in the common room was much too busy in letting off more holiday steam to observe what anyone else was up to ron harry and hermione sat apart from everyone else by a dark window that was gradually filling up with snow and harry read out 
 
 dear harry 
 congratulations on getting past the horntail whoever put your name in that goblet be feeling too happy right now i was going to suggest a conjunctivitus curse as a eyes are its weakest point what krum did hermione whispered but your way was better impressed 
 get complacent though harry only done one task whoever put you in for the got plenty more opportunity if trying to hurt you keep your eyes open particularly when the person we discussed is around and concentrate on keeping yourself out of trouble 
 keep in touch i still want to hear about anything unusual 
 sirius 
 he sounds exactly like moody said harry quietly tucking the letter away again inside his robes constant vigilance think i walk around with my eyes shut banging off the walls 
 
 but right harry said hermione you have still got two tasks to do you really ought to have a look at that egg you know and start working out what it means 
 
 hermione got ages snapped ron want a game of chess harry 
 
 yeah okay said harry then spotting the look on face he said come on i supposed to concentrate with all this noise going on i even be able to hear the egg over this lot 
 
 oh i suppose not she sighed and she sat down to watch their chess match which culminated in an exciting checkmate of involving a couple of recklessly brave pawns and a very violent bishop 
 
 
 
 harry awoke very suddenly on christmas day wondering what had caused his abrupt return to consciousness he opened his eyes and saw something with very large round green eyes staring back at him in the darkness so close they were almost nose to nose 
 
 dobby harry yelled scrambling away from the elf so fast he almost fell out of bed do that 
 
 dobby is sorry sir squeaked dobby anxiously jumping backward with his long fingers over his mouth dobby is only wanting to wish harry potter merry christmas and bring him a present sir harry potter did say dobby could come and see him sometimes sir 
 
 okay said harry still breathing rather faster than usual while his heart rate returned to normal just just prod me or something in future all right bend over me like that 
 
 harry pulled back the curtains around his took his glasses from his bedside table and put them on his yell had awoken ron seamus dean and neville all of them were peering through the gaps in their own hangings and 
 
 someone attacking you harry seamus asked sleepily 
 
 no just dobby harry muttered go back to sleep 
 
 nahpresents said seamus spotting the large pile at the foot of his bed ron dean and neville decided that now they were awake they might as well get down to some too harry turned back to dobby who was now standing nervously next to bed still looking worried that he had upset harry there was a christmas bauble tied to the loop on top of his tea cozy 
 
 can dobby give harry potter his present he squeaked tentatively 
 
 course you can said harry got something for you too 
 
 it was a lie he bought anything for dobby at all but he quickly opened his trunk and pulled out a particularly knobbly pair of socks they were his oldest and foulest mustard yellow and had once belonged to uncle vernon the reason they were was that harry had been using them to cushion his sneakoscope for over a year now he pulled out the and handed the socks to dobby saying sorry i forgot to wrap them 
 
 but dobby was utterly delighted 
 
 socks are favorite favorite clothes sir he said ripping off his odd ones and pulling on uncle i has seven now sir he said his eyes widening having pulled both socks up to their highest extent so that they reached to the bottom of his shorts they has made a mistake in the shop harry potter they is giving you two the same 
 
 ah no harry how come you spot that said ron grinning over from his own bed which was now strewn with wrapping paper tell you what dobby here you go take these two and you can mix them up properly and your sweater 
 
 he threw dobby a pair of violet socks he had just unwrapped and the sweater mrs weasley had sent dobby looked quite overwhelmed 
 
 sir is very kind he squeaked his eyes brimming with tears again bowing deeply to ron dobby knew sir must be a great wizard for he is harry greatest friend but dobby did not know that he was also as generous of spirit as noble as selfless 
 
 only socks said ron who had gone slightly pink around the ears though he looked rather pleased all the same wow harry he had just opened present a chudley cannon hat cool he jammed it onto his head where it clashed horribly with his hair 
 
 dobby now handed harry a small package which turned out to be socks 
 
 dobby is making them himself sir the elf said happily he is buying the wool out of his wages sir 
 
 the left sock was bright red and had a pattern of broomsticks upon it the right sock was green with a pattern of snitches 
 
 reallywell thanks dobby said harry and he pulled them on causing eyes to leak with happiness again 
 
 dobby must go now sir we is already making christmas dinner in the kitchens said dobby and he hurried out of the dormitory waving to ron and the others as he passed 
 
 other presents were much more satisfactory than odd socks with the obvious exception of the dursleys which consisted of a single tissue an low harry supposed they too were remember ing the toffee hermione had given harry a book called quidditch teams of britain and ireland ron a bulging bag of dungbombs sirius a handy penknife with attachments to unlock any lock and undo any knot and hagrid a vast box of sweets including all favorites bertie every flavor beans chocolate frogs best blowing gum and fizzing whizbees there was also of course mrs usual package including a new sweater green with a picture of a dragon on it harry supposed charlie had told her all about the horntail and a large quantity of homemade mince pies 
 
 harry and ron met up with hermione in the common room and they went down to breakfast together they spent most of the morning in gryffindor tower where everyone was enjoying their presents then returned to the great hall for a magnificent lunch which included at least a hundred turkeys and christmas puddings and large piles of wizarding crackers 
 
 they went out onto the grounds in the afternoon the snow was untouched except for the deep channels made by the durmstrang and beauxbatons students on their way up to the castle hermione chose to watch harry and the weasleys snowball fight rather than join in and at five said she was going back upstairs to get ready for the ball 
 
 what you need three hours said ron looking at her incredulously and paying for his lapse in concentration when a large snowball thrown by george hit him hard on the side of the head you going with he yelled after hermione but she just waved and disappeared up the stone steps into the castle 
 
 there was no christmas tea today as the ball included a feast so at seven when it had become hard to aim properly the others abandoned their snowball fight and trooped back to the common room the fat lady was sitting in her frame with her friend violet from downstairs both of them extremely tipsy empty boxes of chocolate liqueurs littering the bottom other picture 
 
 lairy fights the one she giggled when they gave the password and she swung forward to let them inside 
 
 harry ron seamus dean and neville changed into their dress robes up in their dormitory all of them looking very but none as much as ron who surveyed himself in the long mirror in the corner with an appalled look on his face there was just no getting around the fact that his robes looked more like a dress than anything else in a desperate attempt to make them look more manly he used a severing charm on the ruff and cuffs it worked fairly well at least he was now although he done a very neat job and the edges still looked depressingly frayed as the boys set off downstairs 
 
 i still work out how you two got the girls in the year muttered dean 
 
 animal magnetism said ron gloomily pulling stray threads out of his cuffs 
 
 the common room looked strange full of people wearing different colors instead of the usual mass of black parvati was waiting for harry at the foot of the stairs she looked very pretty indeed in robes of shocking pink with her long dark plait braided with gold and gold bracelets glimmering at her wrists harry was relieved to see that she giggling 
 
 you er look nice he said awkwardly 
 
 thanks she said going to meet you in the entrance hall she added to ron 
 
 right said ron looking around hermione 
 
 parvati shrugged shall we go down then harry 
 
 okay said harry wishing he could just stay in the common room fred winked at harry as he passed him on the way out of the portrait hole 
 
 the entrance hall was packed with students too all milling around waiting for eight when the doors to the great hall would be thrown open those people who were meeting partners from different houses were edging through the crowd trying to find one another parvati found her sister padma and led her over to harry and ron 
 
 hi said padma who was looking just as pretty as parvati in robes of bright turquoise she look too enthusiastic about having ron as a partner though her dark eyes lingered on the frayed neck and sleeves of his dress robes as she looked him up and down 
 
 hi said ron not looking at her but staring around at the crowd oh no 
 
 he bent his knees slightly to hide behind harry because fleur delacour was passing looking stunning in robes of satin and accompanied by the ravenclaw quidditch captain roger davies when they had disappeared ron stood straight again and stared over the heads of the crowd 
 
 where is hermione he said again 
 
 a group of slytherins came up the steps from their dungeon common room malfoy was in front he was wearing dress robes of black velvet with a high collar which in opinion made him look like a vicar pansy parkinson in very frilly robes of pale pink was clutching arm crabbe and goyle were both wearing green they resembled boulders and neither of them harry was pleased to see had managed to find a partner 
 
 the oak front doors opened and everyone turned to look as the durmstrang students entered with professor karkaroff krum was at the front of the party accompanied by a pretty girl in blue robes harry know over their heads he saw that an area of lawn right in front of the castle had been transformed into a sort of grotto full of fairy lights meaning hundreds of actual living fairies were sitting in the rosebushes that had been conjured there and fluttering over the statues of what seemed to be father christmas and his reindeer 
 
 then professor voice called champions over here please 
 
 parvati readjusted her bangles beaming she and harry said see you in a minute to ron and padma and walked forward the chattering crowd parting to let them through professor mcgonagall who was wearing dress robes of red tartan and had arranged a rather ugly wreath of thistles around the brim other hat told them to wait on one side of the doors while everyone else went inside they were to enter the great hall in procession when the rest of the students had sat down fleur delacour and roger davies stationed themselves nearest the doors davies looked so stunned by his good fortune in having fleur for a partner that he could hardly take his eyes off her cedric and cho were close to harry too he looked away from them so he have to talk to them his eyes fell instead on the girl next to krum his jaw dropped 
 
 it was hermione 
 
 but she look like hermione at all she had done something with her hair it was no longer bushy but sleek and shiny and twisted up into an elegant knot at the back of her head she was wearing robes made of a floaty material and she was holding herself differently somehow or maybe it was merely the absence of the twenty or so books she usually had slung over her back she was also smiling rather nervously it was true but the reduction in the size of her front teeth was more noticeable than ever harry understand how he spotted it before 
 
 hi harry she said hi parvati 
 
 parvati was gazing at hermione in unflattering disbelief she the only one either when the doors to the great hall opened fan club from the library stalked past throwing hermione looks of deepest loathing pansy parkinson gaped at her as she walked by with malfoy and even he seem to be able to find an insult to throw at her ron however walked right past hermione without looking at her 
 
 once everyone else was settled in the hall professor mcgonagall told the champions and their partners to get in line in pairs and to follow her they did so and everyone in the great hall applauded as they entered and started walking up toward a large round table at the top of the hall where the judges were sitting 
 
 the walls of the hall had all been covered in sparkling silver frost with hundreds of garlands of mistletoe and ivy crossing the starry black ceiling the house tables had vanished instead there were about a hundred smaller ones each seating about a dozen people 
 
 harry concentrated on not tripping over his feet parvati seemed to be enjoying herself she was beaming around at everybody steering harry so forcefully that he felt as though he were a show dog she was putting through its paces he caught sight of ron and padma as he neared the top table ron was watching hermione pass with narrowed eyes padma was looking sulky 
 
 dumbledore smiled happily as the champions approached the top table but karkaroff wore an expression remarkably like as he watched krum and hermione draw nearer ludo bagman tonight in robes of bright purple with large yellow stars was clapping as enthusiastically as any of the students and madame maxime who had changed her usual uniform of black satin for a flowing gown of lavender silk was applauding them politely but mr crouch harry suddenly realized was not there the fifth seat at the table was occupied by percy weasley 
 
 when the champions and their partners reached the table percy drew out the empty chair beside him staring pointedly at harry harry took the hint and sat down next to percy who was wearing dress robes and an expression of such smugness that harry thought it ought to be fined 
 
 been promoted percy said before harry could even ask and from his tone he might have been announcing his election as supreme ruler of the universe now mr personal assistant and here representing him 
 
 why he come harry asked he looking forward to being lectured on cauldron bottoms all through dinner 
 
 afraid to say mr crouch well not well at all been right since the world cup hardly surprising overwork not as young as he was though still quite brilliant of course the mind remains as great as it ever was but the world cup was a fiasco for the whole ministry and then mr crouch suffered a huge personal shock with the misbehavior of that of his blinky or whatever she was called naturally he dismissed her immediately afterward but well as i say getting on he needs looking after and i think found a definite drop in his home comforts since she left and then we had the tournament to arrange and the aftermath of the cup to deal with that revolting skeeter woman buzzing around no poor man having a well earned quiet christmas just glad he knew he had someone he could rely upon to take his place 
 
 harry wanted very much to ask whether mr crouch had stopped calling percy weatherby yet but resisted the temptation 
 
 there was no food as yet on the glittering golden plates but small menus were lying in front of each of them harry picked his up uncertainly and looked around there were no waiters dumbledore however looked carefully down at his own menu then said very clearly to his plate pork chops 
 
 and pork chops appeared getting the idea the rest of the table placed their orders with their plates too harry glanced up at hermione to see how she felt about this new and more complicated method of dining surely it meant plenty of extra work for the but for once hermione seem to be thinking about she was deep in talk with viktor krum and hardly seemed to notice what she was eating 
 
 it now occurred to harry that he had never actually heard krum speak before but he was certainly talking now and very enthusiastically at that 
 
 veil ve have a castle also not as big as this nor as comfortable i am thinking he was telling hermione ve have just four floors and the fires are lit only for magical purposes but ve have grounds larger even than these though in vinter ve have very little daylight so ve are not enjoying them but in summer ve are flying every day over the lakes and the mountains 
 
 now now viktor said karkaroff with a laugh that reach his cold eyes go giving away anything else now or your charming friend will know exactly where to find us 
 
 dumbledore smiled his eyes twinkling igor all this secrecy one would almost think you want visitors 
 
 well dumbledore said karkaroff displaying his yellowing teeth to their fullest extent we are all protective of our private domains are we not do we not jealously guard the halls of learning that have been entrusted to us are we not right to be proud that we alone know our secrets and right to protect them 
 
 oh i would never dream of assuming i know all hogwarts secrets igor said dumbledore amicably only this morning for instance i took a wrong turning on the way to the bathroom and found myself in a beautifully proportioned room i have never seen before containing a really rather magnificent collection of chamber pots when i went back to investigate more closely i discovered that the room had vanished but i must keep an eye out for it possibly it is only accessible at in the morning or it may only appear at the quarter moon or when the seeker has an exceptionally full bladder 
 
 harry snorted into his plate of goulash percy frowned but harry could have sworn dumbledore had given him a very small wink 
 
 meanwhile fleur delacour was criticizing the hogwarts decorations to roger davies 
 
 zis is nothing she said dismissively looking around at the sparkling walls of the great hall at ze palace of beauxbatons we ave ice sculptures all around ze dining chamber at chreestmas zey do not melt of coursezey are like uge statues of diamond glittering around ze place and ze food is seemply superb and we ave choirs of wood nymphs oo serenade us as we eat we ave none of zis ugly armor in ze alls and eef a poltergeist ever entaired into beauxbatons e would be expelled like zat she slapped her hand onto the table impatiently 
 
 roger davies was watching her talk with a very dazed look on his face and he kept missing his mouth with his fork harry had the impression that davies was too busy staring at fleur to take in a word she was saying 
 
 absolutely right he said quickly slapping his own hand down on the table in imitation of fleur like that yeah 
 
 harry looked around the hall hagrid was sitting at one of the other staff tables he was back in his horrible hairy brown suit and gazing up at the top table harry saw him give a small wave and looking around saw madame maxime return it her opals glittering in the candlelight 
 
 hermione was now teaching krum to say her name properly he kept calling her 
 
 she said slowly and clearly 
 
 
 
 close enough she said catching eye and grinning 
 
 when all the food had been consumed dumbledore stood up and asked the students to do the same then with a wave of his wand all the tables zoomed back along the walls leaving the floor clear and then he conjured a raised platform into existence along the right wall a set of drums several guitars a lute a cello and some bagpipes were set upon it 
 
 the weird sisters now trooped up onto the stage to wildly enthusiastic applause they were all extremely hairy and dressed in black robes that had been artfully ripped and torn they picked up their instruments and harry who had been so interested in watching them that he had almost forgotten what was coming suddenly realized that the lanterns on all the other tables had gone out and that the other champions and their partners were standing up 
 
 come on parvati hissed supposed to dance 
 
 harry tripped over his dress robes as he stood up the weird sisters struck up a slow mournful tune harry walked onto the brightly lit dance floor carefully avoiding catching eye he could see seamus and dean waving at him and sniggering and next moment parvati had seized his hands placed one around her waist and was holding the other tightly in hers 
 
 it as bad as it could have been harry thought revolving slowly on the spot parvati was steering he kept his eyes fixed over the heads of the watching people and very soon many of them too had come onto the dance floor so that the champions were no longer the center of attention neville and ginny were dancing nearby he could see ginny wincing frequently as neville trod on her feet and dumbledore was waltzing with madame maxime he was so dwarfed by her that the top of his pointed hat barely tickled her chin however she moved very gracefully for a woman so large moody was doing an extremely ungainly with professor sinistra who was nervously avoiding his wooden leg 
 
 nice socks potter moody growled as he passed his magical eye staring through robes 
 
 oh yeah dobby the knitted them for me said harry grinning 
 
 he is so creepy parvati whispered as moody clunked away i think that eye should be allowed 
 
 
 
 harry heard the final quavering note from the bagpipe with relief the weird sisters stopped playing applause filled the hall once more and harry let go of parvati at once 
 
 sit down shall we 
 
 oh but this is a really good one parvati said as the weird sisters struck up a new song which was much faster 
 
 no i like it harry lied and he led her away from the dance floor past fred and angelina who were dancing so exhuberantly that people around them were backing away in fear of injury and over to the table where ron and padma were sitting 
 
 it going harry asked ron sitting down and opening a bottle of butterbeer 
 
 ron answer he was glaring at hermione and krum who were dancing nearby padma was sitting with her arms and legs crossed one foot jiggling in time to the music every now and then she threw a disgruntled look at ron who was completely ignoring her parvati sat down on other side crossed her arms and legs too and within minutes was asked to dance by a boy from beauxbatons 
 
 you mind do you harry parvati said 
 
 what said harry who was now watching cho and cedric 
 
 oh never mind snapped parvati and she went off with the boy from beauxbatons when the song ended she did not return 
 
 hermione came over and sat down in empty chair she was a bit pink in the face from dancing 
 
 hi said harry ron say anything 
 
 hot it said hermione fanning herself with her hand just gone to get some drinks 
 
 ron gave her a withering look viktor he said he asked you to call him vicky yet 
 
 hermione looked at him in surprise up with you she said 
 
 if you know said ron scathingly not going to tell you 
 
 hermione stared at him then at harry who shrugged 
 
 ron what 
 
 from durmstrang spat ron competing against harry against hogwarts you ron was obviously casting around for words strong enough to describe crime fraternizing with the enemy what doing 
 
 mouth fell open 
 
 be so stupid she said after a moment the enemy honestly who was the one who was all excited when they saw him arrive who was the one who wanted his autograph got a model of him up in their dormitory 
 
 ron chose to ignore this i he asked you to come with him while you were both in the library 
 
 yes he did said hermione the pink patches on her cheeks glowing more brightly so what 
 
 what happened trying to get him to join spew were you 
 
 no i if you really want to know he he said been coming up to the library every day to try and talk to me but he been able to pluck up the courage 
 
 hermione said this very quickly and blushed so deeply that she was the same color as robes 
 
 yeah well his story said ron nastily 
 
 and that supposed to mean 
 
 obvious it student he he knows who you hang around just trying to get closer to harry get inside information on him or get near enough to jinx him 
 
 hermione looked as though ron had slapped her when she spoke her voice quivered 
 
 for your information he asked me one single thing about harry not one 
 
 ron changed tack at the speed of light 
 
 then hoping help him find out what his egg means i suppose been putting your heads together during those cozy little library sessions 
 
 never help him work out that egg said hermione looking outraged never how could you say something like that i want harry to win the tournament harry knows that you harry 
 
 got a funny way of showing it sneered ron 
 
 this whole supposed to be about getting to know foreign wizards and making friends with them said hermione hotly 
 
 no it shouted ron about winning 
 
 people were starting to stare at them 
 
 ron said harry quietly i got a problem with hermione coming with krum 
 
 but ron ignored harry too 
 
 why you go and find vicky be wondering where you are said ron 
 
 call him vicky 
 
 hermione jumped to her feet and stormed off across the dance floor disappearing into the crowd ron watched her go with a mixture of anger and satisfaction on his face 
 
 are you going to ask me to dance at all padma asked him 
 
 no said ron still glaring after hermione 
 
 fine snapped padma and she got up and went to join parvati and the beauxbatons boy who conjured up one of his friends to join them so fast that harry could have sworn he had zoomed him there by a summoning charm 
 
 vare is said a voice 
 
 krum had just arrived at their table clutching two butterbeers 
 
 no idea said ron mulishly looking up at him lost her have you 
 
 krum was looking surly again 
 
 veil if you see her tell her i haff drinks he said and he slouched off 
 
 made friends with viktor krum have you ron 
 
 percy had bustled over rubbing his hands together and looking extremely pompous excellent the whole point you know international magical cooperation 
 
 to displeasure percy now took vacated seat the top table was now empty professor dumbledore was dancing with professor sprout ludo bagman with professor mcgonagall madame maxime and hagrid were cutting a wide path around the dance floor as they waltzed through the students and karkaroff was nowhere to be seen when the next song ended everybody applauded once more and harry saw ludo bagman kiss professor hand and make his way back through the crowds at which point fred and george accosted him 
 
 what do they think doing annoying senior ministry members percy hissed watching fred and george suspiciously no respect 
 
 ludo bagman shook off fred and george fairly quickly however and spotting harry waved and came over to their table 
 
 i hope my brothers bothering you mr bagman said percy at once 
 
 what oh not at all not at all said bagman no they were just telling me a bit more about those fake wands of theirs wondering if i could advise them on the marketing promised to put them in touch with a couple of contacts of mine at joke shop 
 
 percy look happy about this at all and harry was prepared to bet he would be rushing to tell mrs weasley about this the moment he got home apparently fred and plans had grown even more ambitious lately if they were hoping to sell to the public bagman opened his mouth to ask harry something but percy diverted him 
 
 how do you feel the going mr bagman our quite satisfied the hitch with the goblet of fire he glanced at harry was a little unfortunate of course but it seems to have gone very smoothly since you think 
 
 oh yes bagman said cheerfully all been enormous fun old barty doing shame he come 
 
 oh sure mr crouch will be up and about in no time said percy importantly but in the meantime more than willing to take up the slack of course not all attending balls he laughed airily oh no had to deal with all sorts of things that have cropped up in his absence you heard ali bashir was caught smuggling a consignment of flying carpets into the country and then been trying to persuade the transylvanians to sign the international ban on dueling got a meeting with their head of magical cooperation in the new year 
 
 go for a walk ron muttered to harry get away from percy 
 
 pretending they wanted more drinks harry and ron left the table edged around the dance floor and slipped out into the entrance hall the front doors stood open and the fluttering fairy lights in the rose garden winked and twinkled as they went down the front steps where they found themselves surrounded by bushes winding ornamental paths and large stone statues harry could hear splashing water which sounded like a fountain here and there people were sitting on carved benches he and ron set off along one of the winding paths through the rosebushes but they had gone only a short way when they heard an unpleasantly familiar voice 
 
 see what there is to fuss about igor 
 
 severus you cannot pretend this happening karkaroffs voice sounded anxious and hushed as though keen not to be overheard been getting clearer and clearer for months i am becoming seriously concerned i deny it 
 
 then flee said voice curtly flee i will make your excuses i however am remaining at hogwarts 
 
 snape and karkaroff came around the corner snape had his wand out and was blasting rosebushes apart his expression most squeals issued from many of the bushes and dark shapes emerged from them 
 
 ten points from ravenclaw fawcett snape snarled as a girl ran past him and ten points from hufflepuff too stebbins as a boy went rushing after her and what are you two doing he added catching sight of harry and ron on the path ahead karkaroff harry saw looked slightly discomposed to see them standing there his hand went nervously to his goatee and he began winding it around his finger 
 
 we re walking ron told snape shortly not against the law is it 
 
 keep walking then snape snarled and he brushed past them his long black cloak billowing out behind him karkaroff hurried away after snape harry and ron continued down the path 
 
 got karkaroff all worried ron muttered 
 
 and since when have he and snape been on harry slowly 
 
 they had reached a large stone reindeer now over which they could see the sparkling jets of a tall fountain the shadowy outlines of two enormous people were visible on a stone bench watching the water in the moonlight and then harry heard hagrid speak 
 
 momen i saw yeh i knew he was saying in an oddly husky voice 
 
 harry and ron froze this sound like the sort of scene they ought to walk in on looked around back up the path and saw fleur delacour and roger davies standing in a rosebush nearby he tapped ron on the shoulder and jerked his head toward them meaning that they could easily sneak off that way without being noticed fleur and davies looked very busy to harry but ron eyes widening in horror at the sight of fleur shook his head vigorously and pulled harry deeper into the shadows behind the reindeer 
 
 what did you know agrid said madame maxime a purr in her low voice 
 
 harry definitely want to listen to this he knew hagrid would hate to be overheard in a situation like this he certainly would have if it had been possible he would have put his fingers in his ears and hummed loudly but that really an option instead he tried to interest himself in a beetle crawling along the stone back but the beetle just interesting enough to block out next words 
 
 i jus knewknew you were like it yer mother or yer father 
 
 i i know what you mean agrid 
 
 it was my mother said hagrid quietly she was one o the las ones in britain course i can remember her too wellshe left see when i was abou three she wasn really the maternal sort not in their natures is it dunno what happened to hermight be dead fer all i know 
 
 madame maxime say anything and harry in spite of himself took his eyes off the beetle and looked over the top of the antlers had never heard hagrid talk about his childhood before 
 
 me dad was when she wen tiny little bloke my dad was by the time i was six i could lift him up an put him on top o the dresser if he annoyed me used ter make him deep voice broke madame maxime was listening motionless apparently staring at the silvery fountain dad raised mebut he died o course jus after i started school sorta had ter make me own way after that dumbledore was a real help mind very kind ter me he was 
 
 hagrid pulled out a large spotted silk handkerchief and blew his nose heavily 
 
 soanywayenough abou me what about you which side you got it on 
 
 but madame maxime had suddenly got to her feet 
 
 it is chilly she said but whatever the weather was doing it was nowhere near as cold as her voice i think i will go in now 
 
 eh said hagrid blankly no don go never met another one before 
 
 anuzzer what precisely said madame maxime her tone icy 
 
 harry could have told hagrid it was best not to answer he stood there in the shadows gritting his teeth hoping against hope he but it was no good 
 
 another o course said hagrid 
 
 ow dare you shrieked madame maxime her voice exploded through the peaceful night air like a foghorn behind him harry heard fleur and roger fall out of their rosebush i ave nevair been more insulted in my life moi i ave i ave big bones 
 
 she stormed away great multicolored swarms of fairies rose into the air as she passed angrily pushing aside bushes hagrid was still sitting on the bench staring after her it was much too dark to make out his expression then after about a minute he stood up and strode away not back to the castle but off out into the dark grounds in the direction of his cabin 
 
 harry said very quietly to ron go 
 
 but ron move 
 
 up said harry looking at him 
 
 ron looked around at harry his expression very serious indeed 
 
 did you know he whispered about hagrid being 
 
 no harry said shrugging so what 
 
 he knew immediately from the look ron was giving him that he was once again revealing his ignorance of the wizarding world brought up by the dursleys there were many things that wizards took for granted that were revelations to harry but these surprises had become fewer with each successive year now however he could tell that most wizards would not have said so what upon finding out that one of their friends had a giantess for a mother 
 
 explain inside said ron quietly 
 
 fleur and roger davies had disappeared probably into a more private clump of bushes harry and ron returned to the great hall parvati and padma were now sitting at a distant table with a whole crowd of beauxbatons boys and hermione was once more dancing with krum harry and ron sat down at a table far removed from the dance floor 
 
 so harry prompted ron the problem with giants 
 
 well ron struggled for words not very nice he finished lamely 
 
 who cares harry said nothing wrong with hagrid 
 
 i know there butblimey no wonder he keeps it quiet ron said shaking his head i always thought got in the way of a bad engorgement charm when he was a kid or something like to mention it 
 
 but it matter if his mother was a giantess said harry 
 
 wellno one who knows him will care cos know not dangerous said ron slowly butharry just vicious giants like hagrid said in their natures like trollsthey just like killing everyone knows that there any left in britain now though 
 
 what happened to them 
 
 well they were dying out anyway and then loads got themselves killed by aurors supposed to be giants abroad hide out in mountains mostly 
 
 i know who maxime thinks kidding harry said watching madame maxime sitting alone at the judges table looking very somber if she definitely is big only thing got bigger bones than her is a dinosaur 
 
 harry and ron spent the rest of the ball discussing giants in their corner neither of them having any inclination to dance harry tried not to watch cho and cedric too much it gave him a strong desire to kick something 
 
 when the weird sisters finished playing at midnight everyone gave them a last loud round of applause and started to wend their way into the entrance hall many people were expressing the wish that the ball could have gone on longer but harry was perfectly happy to be going to bed as far as he was concerned the evening been much fun 
 
 out in the entrance hall harry and ron saw hermione saying good night to krum before he went back to the durmstrang ship she gave ron a very cold look and swept past him up the marble staircase without speaking harry and ron followed her but halfway up the staircase harry heard someone calling him 
 
 
 
 it was cedric diggory harry could see cho waiting for him in the entrance hall below 
 
 yeah said harry coldly as cedric ran up the stairs toward him 
 
 cedric looked as though he want to say whatever it was in front of ron who shrugged looking and continued to climb the stairs 
 
 listen cedric lowered his voice as ron disappeared i owe you one for telling me about the dragons you know that golden egg does yours wail when you open it 
 
 yeah said harry 
 
 welltake a bath okay 
 
 what 
 
 take a bath and er take the egg with you and er just mull things over in the hot water help you me 
 
 harry stared at him 
 
 tell you what cedric said use the prefects bathroom fourth door to the left of that statue of boris the bewildered on the fifth floor pine fresh gotta gowant to say good night 
 
 he grinned at harry again and hurried back down the stairs to cho 
 
 harry walked back to gryffindor tower alone that had been extremely strange advice why would a bath help him to work out what the wailing egg meant was cedric pulling his leg was he trying to make harry look like a fool so cho would like him even more by comparison 
 
 the fat lady and her friend vi were snoozing in the picture over the portrait hole harry had to yell fairy lights before he woke them up and when he did they were extremely irritated he climbed into the common room and found ron and hermione having a blazing row standing ten feet apart they were bellowing at each other each scarlet in the face 
 
 well if you like it you know what the solution is you yelled hermione her hair was coming down out of its elegant bun now and her face was screwed up in anger 
 
 oh yeah ron yelled back that 
 
 next time a ball ask me before someone else does and not as a last resort 
 
 ron mouthed soundlessly like a goldfish out of water as hermione turned on her heel and stormed up the girls staircase to bed ron turned to look at harry 
 
 well he sputtered looking thunderstruck well that just proves completely missed the point 
 
 harry say anything he liked being back on speaking terms with ron too much to speak his mind right now but he somehow thought that hermione had gotten the point much better than ron had 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire 
 

lionfish nov chapter christmas on the closed wardcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 was this why dumbledore would no longer meet eyes did he expect to see voldemort staring out of them afraid perhaps that their vivid green might turn suddenly to scarlet with catlike slits for pupils harry remembered how the snakelike face of voldemort had once forced itself out of the back of professor head and ran his hand over the back of his own wondering what it would feel like if voldemort burst out of his skull 
 
 he felt dirty contaminated as though he were carrying some deadly germ unworthy to sit on the underground train back from the hospital with innocent clean people whose minds and bodies were free of the taint of voldemort he had not merely seen the snake he had been the snake he knew it now 
 
 a truly terrible thought then occurred to him a memory bobbing to the surface of his mind one that made his insides writhe and squirm like serpents 
 
 he after apart from followers 
 
 stuff he can only get by stealth like a weapon something he have last time 
 
 the weapon harry thought and it was as though poison were pumping through his veins chilling him bringing him out in a sweat as he swayed with the train through the dark tunnel the one trying to use why got guards around me everywhere i go not for my protection for other only not working they have someone on me all the time at hogwarts i did attack mr weasley last night it was me voldemort made me do it and he could be inside me listening to my right now 
 
 are you all right harry dear whispered mrs weasley leaning across ginny to speak to him as the train rattled along through its dark tunnel you look very well are you feeling sick 
 
 they were all watching him he shook his head violently and stared up at an advertisement for home insurance 
 
 harry dear are you sure all right said mrs weasley in a worried voice as they walked around the unkempt patch of grass in the middle of grimmauld place you look ever so pale are you sure you slept this morning you go upstairs to bed right now and you can have a couple of hours of sleep before dinner all right 
 
 he nodded here was a excuse not to talk to any of the others which was precisely what he wanted so when she opened the front door he hurried straight past the umbrella stand up the stairs and into his and bedroom 
 
 here he began to pace up and down past the two beds and phineas empty picture frame his brain teeming and seething with questions and ever more dreadful ideas 
 
 how had he become a snake perhaps he was an animagus no he be he would know perhaps voldemort was an animagus yes thought harry that would fit he would turn into a snake of course and when possessing me then we both transform that still explain how i got to london and back to my bed in the space of about five minutes but then about the most powerful wizard in the world apart from dumbledore probably no problem at all to him to transport people like that 
 
 and then with a terrible stab of panic he thought but this is insaneif possessing me giving him a clear view into the headquarters of the order of the phoenix right now know in the order and where sirius is and heard loads of stuff i have everything sirius told me the first night i was here 
 
 there was only one thing for it he would have to leave grimmauld place straightaway he would spend christmas at hogwarts without the others which would keep them safe over the holidays at least but no that do there were still plenty of people at hogwarts to maim and injure what if it was seamus dean or neville next time he stopped his pacing and stood staring at phineas empty frame a leaden sensation was settling in the pit of his stomach he had no alternative he was going to have to return to privet drive cut himself off from other wizards entirely 
 
 well if he had to do it he thought there was no point hanging around trying with all his might not to think how the dursleys were going to react when they found him on their doorstep six months earlier than they had expected he strode over to his trunk slammed the lid shut and locked it then glanced around automatically for hedwig before remembering that she was still at hogwartswell her cage would be one less thing to carryhe seized one end of his trunk and had dragged it halfway towards the door when a snide voice said running away are we 
 
 he looked around phineas nigellus had appeared on the canvas of his portrait and was leaning against the frame watching harry with an amused expression on his face 
 
 not running away no said harry shortly dragging his trunk a few more feet across the room 
 
 i thought said phineas nigellus stroking his pointed beard that to belong in gryffindor house you were supposed to be brave it looks to me as though you would have been better off in my own house we slytherins are brave yes but not stupid for instance given the choice we will always choose to save our own necks 
 
 not my own neck saving said harry tersely tugging the trunk over a patch of particularly uneven carpet right in front of the door 
 
 oh i see said phineas nigellus still stroking his beard this is no cowardly flightyou are being noble 
 
 harry ignored him his hand was on the doorknob when phineas nigellus said lazily i have a message for you from albus dumbledore 
 
 harry span round 
 
 what is it 
 
 stay where you are 
 
 i moved said harry his hand still upon the doorknob so the message 
 
 i have just given it to you dolt said phineas nigellus smoothly dumbledore says stay where you are 
 
 why said harry eagerly dropping the end of his trunk why does he want me to stay what else did he say 
 
 nothing whatsoever said phineas nigellus raising a thin black eyebrow as though he found harry impertinent 
 
 temper rose to the surface like a snake rearing from long grass he was exhausted he was confused beyond measure he had experienced terror relief then terror again in the last twelve hours and still dumbledore did not want to talk to him 
 
 so it is it he said loudly stay where you are all anyone could tell me after i got attacked by those dementors too just stay put while the sort it out harry we bother telling you anything though because your tiny little brain might not be able to cope with it 
 
 you know said phineas nigellus even more loudly than harry this is precisely why i loathed being a teacher young people are so infernally convinced that they are absolutely right about everything has it not occurred to you my poor popinjay that there might be an excellent reason why the headmaster of hogwarts is not confiding every tiny detail of his plans to you have you never paused while feeling to note that following orders has never yet led you into harm like all young people you are quite sure that you alone feel and think you alone recognise danger you alone are the only one clever enough to realise what the dark lord may be planning 
 
 he is planning something to do with me then said harry swiftly 
 
 did i say that said phineas nigellus idly examining his silk gloves now if you will excuse me i have better things to do than listen to adolescent agonising to you 
 
 and he strolled to the edge of his frame and out of sight 
 
 fine go then harry bellowed at the empty frame and tell dumbledore thanks for nothing 
 
 the empty canvas remained silent fuming harry dragged his trunk back to the foot of his bed then threw himself face down on the covers his eyes shut his body heavy and aching 
 
 he felt as though he had journeyed for miles and miles it seemed impossible that less than hours ago cho chang had been approaching him under the mistletoe he was so tired he was scared to sleep yet he did not know how long he could fight it dumbledore had told him to stay that must mean he was allowed to sleep but he was scared what if it happened again 
 
 he was sinking into shadows 
 
 it was as though a film in his head had been waiting to start he was walking down a deserted corridor towards a plain black door past rough stone walls torches and an open doorway on to a flight of stone steps leading downstairs on the left 
 
 he reached the black door but could not open it he stood gazing at it desperate for entry something he wanted with all his heart lay beyond a prize beyond his dreams if only his scar would stop prickling then he would be able to think more clearly 
 
 harry said voice from far far away mum says dinners ready but save you something if you want to stay in bed 
 
 harry opened his eyes but ron had already left the room 
 
 he want to be on his own with me harry thought not after what he heard moody say 
 
 he supposed none of them would want him there any more now that they knew what was inside him 
 
 he would not go down to dinner he would not inflict his company on them he turned over on to his other side and after a while dropped back off to sleep he woke much later in the early hours of the morning his insides aching with hunger and ron snoring in the next bed squinting around the room he saw the dark outline of phineas nigellus standing again in his portrait and it occurred to harry that dumbledore had probably sent phineas nigellus to watch over him in case he attacked somebody else 
 
 the feeling of being unclean intensified he he had not obeyed dumbledore if this was how life was going to be for him in grimmauld place from now on maybe he would be better off in privet drive after all 
 
 everybody else spent the following morning putting up christmas decorations harry could not remember sirius ever being in such a good mood he was actually singing carols apparently delighted that he was to have company over christmas harry could hear his voice echoing up through the floor in the cold drawing room where he was sitting alone watching the sky growing whiter outside the windows threatening snow all the time feeling a savage pleasure that he was giving the others the opportunity to keep talking about him as they were bound to be doing when he heard mrs weasley calling his name softly up the stairs around lunchtime he retreated further upstairs and ignored her 
 
 around six in the evening the doorbell rang and mrs black started screaming again assuming that mundungus or some other order member had come to call harry merely settled himself more comfortably against the wall of room where he was hiding trying to ignore how hungry he felt as he fed dead rats to the hippogriff it came as a slight shock when somebody hammered hard on the door a few minutes later 
 
 i know in there said voice will you please come out i want to talk to you 
 
 what are you doing here harry asked her pulling open the door as buckbeak resumed his scratching at the floor for any fragments of rat he may have dropped i thought you were skiing with your mum and dad 
 
 well to tell the truth not really my thing said hermione so come here for christmas there was snow in her hair and her face was pink with cold but tell ron i told him really good because he kept laughing so much mum and dad are a bit disappointed but told them that everyone who is serious about the exams is staying at hogwarts to study they want me to do well understand anyway she said briskly go to your bedroom mum has lit a fire in there and sent up sandwiches 
 
 harry followed her back to the second floor when he entered the bedroom he was rather surprised to see both ron and ginny waiting for them sitting on bed 
 
 i came on the knight bus said hermione airily pulling off her jacket before harry had time to speak dumbledore told me what had happened first thing this morning but i had to wait for term to end officially before setting off umbridge is already livid that you lot disappeared right under her nose even though dumbledore told her mr weasley was in st and given you all permission to visit so 
 
 she sat down next to ginny and the two girls and ron all looked up at harry 
 
 you feeling asked hermione 
 
 fine said harry stiffly 
 
 oh lie harry she said impatiently ron and ginny say been hiding from everyone since you got back from st 
 
 they do do they said harry glaring at ron and ginny ron looked down at his feet but ginny seemed quite unabashed 
 
 well you have she said and you look at any of us 
 
 you lot who look at me said harry angrily 
 
 maybe taking it in turns to look and keep missing each other suggested hermione the corners of her mouth twitching 
 
 very funny snapped harry turning away 
 
 oh stop feeling all misunderstood said hermione sharply look the others have told me what you overheard last night on the extendable ears 
 
 yeah growled harry his hands deep in his pockets as he watched the snow now falling thickly outside all been talking about me have you well getting used to it 
 
 we wanted to talk toyou harry said ginny but as been hiding ever since we got back 
 
 i want anyone to talk to me said harry who was feeling more and more nettled 
 
 well that was a bit stupid of you said ginny angrily seeing as you know anyone but me been possessed by and i can tell you how it feels 
 
 harry remained quite still as the impact of these words hit him then he wheeled round 
 
 i forgot he said 
 
 lucky you said ginny coolly 
 
 sorry harry said and he meant it so so do you think being possessed then 
 
 well can you remember everything been doing ginny asked are there big blank periods where you know what been up to 
 
 harry racked his brains 
 
 no he said 
 
 then ever possessed you said ginny simply when he did it to me i remember what been doing for hours at a time find myself somewhere and not know how i got there 
 
 harry hardly dared believe her yet his heart was lightening almost in spite of himself 
 
 that dream i had about your dad and the snake though 
 
 harry had these dreams before hermione said you had flashes of what voldemort was up to last year 
 
 this was different said harry shaking his head i was inside that snake it was like i was the snake what if voldemort somehow transported me to london 
 
 one day said hermione sounding thoroughly exasperated read hogwarts a history and perhaps it will remind you that you apparate or disapparaie inside hogwarts even voldemort just make you fly out of your dormitory harry 
 
 you leave your bed mate said ron i saw you thrashing around in your sleep for at least a minute before we could wake you up 
 
 harry started pacing up and down the room again thinking what they were all saying was not only comforting it made sense without really thinking he took a sandwich from the plate on the bed and crammed it hungrily into his mouth 
 
 not the weapon after all thought harry his heart swelled with happiness and relief and he felt like joining in as they heard sirius tramping past their door towards room singing god rest ye merry hippogriffs at the top of his voice 
 
 how could he have dreamed of returning to privet drive for christmas delight at having the house full again and especially at having harry back was infectious he was no longer their sullen host of the summer now he seemed determined that everyone should enjoy themselves as much if not more than they would have done at hogwarts and he worked tirelessly in the to christmas day cleaning and decorating with their help so that by the time they all went to bed on christmas eve the house was barely recognisable the tarnished chandeliers were no longer hung with cobwebs but with garlands of holly and gold and silver streamers magical snow glittered in heaps over the threadbare carpets a great christmas tree obtained by mundungus and decorated with live fairies blocked family tree from view and even the stuffed on the hall wall wore father christmas hats and beards 
 
 harry awoke on christmas morning to find a stack of presents at the foot of his bed and ron already halfway through opening his own rather larger pile 
 
 good haul this year he informed harry through a cloud of paper thanks for the broom compass excellent beats got me a homework planner 
 
 harry sorted through his presents and found one with handwriting on it she had given him too a book that resembled a diary except that every time he opened a page it said aloud things like do it today or later pay 
 
 sirius and lupin had given harry a set of excellent books entitled practical defensive magic and its use against the dark arts which had superb moving colour illustrations of all the and hexes it described harry flicked through the first volume eagerly he could see it was going to be highly useful in his plans for the da hagrid had sent a furry brown wallet that had fangs which were presumably supposed to be an device but unfortunately prevented harry putting any money in without getting his fingers ripped off present was a small working model of a firebolt which harry watched fly around the room wishing he still had his version ron had given him an enormous box of beans mr and mrs weasley the usual jumper and some mince pies and dobby a truly dreadful painting that harry suspected had been done by the elf himself he had just turned it to see whether it looked better that way when with a loud crack fred and george apparated at the foot of his bed 
 
 merry christmas said george go downstairs for a bit 
 
 why not said ron 
 
 crying again said fred heavily percy sent back his christmas jumper 
 
 without a note added george asked how dad is or visited him or anything 
 
 we tried to comfort her said fred moving around the bed to look at portrait told her nothing more than a humungous pile of rat droppings 
 
 work said george helping himself to a chocolate frog so lupin took over best let him cheer her up before we go down for breakfast i reckon 
 
 that supposed to be anyway asked fred squinting at dobbys painting looks like a gibbon with two black eyes 
 
 harry said george pointing at the back of the picture says so on the back 
 
 good likeness said fred grinning harry threw his new homework diary at him it hit the wall opposite and fell to the floor where it said happily if dotted the and crossed the then you may do whatever you please 
 
 they got up and dressed they could hear the various inhabitants of the house calling merry christmas to one another on their way downstairs they met hermione 
 
 thanks for the book harry she said happily been wanting that new theory of numerology for ages and that really unusual ron 
 
 no problem said ron that for anyway he added nodding at the neatly wrapped present she was carrying 
 
 kreacher said hermione brightly 
 
 it had better not be clothes ron warned her you know what sirius said kreacher knows too much we set him free 
 
 it clothes said hermione although if i had my way certainly give him something to wear other than that filthy old rag no a patchwork quilt i thought it would brighten up his bedroom 
 
 what bedroom said harry dropping his voice to a whisper as they were passing the portrait of mother 
 
 well sirius says not so much a bedroom more a kind ofden said hermione apparently he sleeps under the boiler in that cupboard off the kitchen 
 
 mrs weasley was the only person in the basement when they arrived there she was standing at the stove and sounded as though she had a bad head cold as she wished them merry christmas and they all averted their eyes 
 
 so is this bedroom said ron strolling over to a dingy door in the corner opposite the pantry harry had never seen it open 
 
 yes said hermione now sounding a little nervous er i think better knock 
 
 ron rapped on the door with his knuckles but there was no reply 
 
 he must be sneaking around upstairs he said and without further ado pulled open the door urgh 
 
 harry peered inside most of the cupboard was taken up with a very large and boiler but in the foot of space underneath the pipes kreacher had made himself something that looked like a nest a jumble of assorted rags and smelly old blankets were piled on the floor and the small dent in the middle of it showed where kreacher curled up to sleep every night here and there among the material were stale bread crusts and mouldy old bits of cheese in a far corner glinted small objects and coins that harry guessed kreacher had saved from purge of the house and he had also managed to retrieve the family photographs that sirius had thrown away over the summer their glass might be shattered but still the little people inside them peered up at him haughtily includinghe felt a little jolt in his stomachthe dark woman whose trial he had witnessed in pensieve bellatrix lestrange by the looks of it hers was favourite photograph he had placed it to the fore of all the others and had mended the glass clumsily with spellotape 
 
 i think just leave his present here said hermione laying the package neatly in the middle of the depression in the rags and blankets and closing the door quietly find it later be fine 
 
 come to think of it said sirius emerging from the pantry carrying a large turkey as they closed the cupboard door has anyone actually seen kreacher lately 
 
 i seen him since the night we came back here said harry you were ordering him out of the kitchen 
 
 yeah said sirius frowning you know i think the last time i saw him too he must be hiding upstairs somewhere 
 
 he have left could he said harry i mean when you said out maybe he thought you meant get out of the house 
 
 no no leave unless given clothes tied to their house said sirius 
 
 they can leave the house if they really want to harry contradicted him dobby did he left the to give me warnings two years ago he had to punish himself afterwards but he still managed it 
 
 sirius looked slightly disconcerted for a moment then said look for him later i expect find him upstairs crying his eyes out over my old bloomers or something of course he might have crawled into the airing cupboard and died but i get my hopes up 
 
 fred george and ron laughed hermione however looked reproachful 
 
 once they had eaten their christmas lunch the weasleys harry and hermione were planning to pay mr weasley another visit escorted by and lupin mundungus turned up in time for christmas pudding and trifle having managed to borrow a car for the occasion as the underground did not run on christmas day the car which harry doubted very much had been taken with the consent of its owner had been enlarged with a spell like the weasleys old ford anglia had once been although normally proportioned outside ten people with mundungus driving were able to fit into it quite comfortably mrs weasley hesitated before getting insideharry knew her disapproval of mundungus was battling with her dislike of travelling without magicbut finally the cold outside and her pleading triumphed and she settled herself into the back seat between fred and bill with good grace 
 
 the journey to st was quite quick as there was very little traffic on the roads a small trickle of witches and wizards was creeping furtively up the otherwise deserted street to visit the hospital harry and the others got out of the car and mundungus drove off around the corner to wait for them they strolled casually towards the window where the dummy in green nylon stood then one by one stepped through the glass 
 
 the reception area looked pleasantly festive the crystal orbs that illuminated st had been coloured red and gold to become gigantic glowing christmas baubles holly hung around every doorway and shining white christmas trees covered in magical snow and icicles glittered in every corner each one topped with a gleaming gold star it was less crowded than the last time they had been there although halfway across the room harry found himself shunted aside by a witch with a satsuma jammed up her left nostril 
 
 family argument eh smirked the blonde witch behind the desk the third seen today spell damage fourth floor 
 
 they found mr weasley propped up in bed with the remains of his turkey dinner on a tray on his lap and a rather sheepish expression on his face 
 
 everything all right arthur asked mrs weasley after they had all greeted mr weasley and handed over their presents 
 
 fine fine said mr weasley a little too heartily seen healer smethwyck have you 
 
 no said mrs weasley suspiciously why 
 
 nothing nothing said mr weasley airily starting to unwrap his pile of gifts well everyone had a good day what did you all get for christmas oh harry this is absolutely wonderful for he had just opened gift of and screwdrivers 
 
 mrs weasley did not seem entirely satisfied with mr answer as her husband leaned over to shake hand she peered at the bandaging under his nightshirt 
 
 arthur she said with a snap in her voice like a mousetrap had your bandages changed why have you had your bandages changed a day early arthur they told me they need doing until tomorrow 
 
 what said mr weasley looking rather frightened and pulling the bed covers higher up his chest no 
 
 he seemed to deflate under mrs piercing gaze 
 
 wellnow get upset molly but augustus pye had an idea the trainee healer you know lovely young chap and very interested in um complementary medicine i mean some of these old muggle remedies well called stitches molly and they work very well onon muggle wounds 
 
 mrs weasley let out an ominous noise somewhere between a shriek and a snarl lupin strolled away from the bed and over to the werewolf who had no visitors and was looking rather wistfully at the crowd around mr weasley bill muttered something about getting himself a cup of tea and fred and george leapt up to accompany him grinning 
 
 do you mean to tell me said mrs weasley her voice growing louder with every word and apparently unaware that her fellow visitors were scurrying for cover that you have been messing about with muggle remedies 
 
 not messing about molly dear said mr weasley imploringly it was justjust something pye and i thought tryonly most unfortunatelywell with these particular kinds of woundsit seem to work as well as hoped 
 
 meaning 
 
 well well i know whether you know whatwhat stitches are 
 
 it sounds as though been trying to sew your skin back together said mrs weasley with a snort of mirthless laughter but even you arthur be that stupid 
 
 i fancy a cup of tea too said harry jumping to his feet 
 
 hermione ron and ginny almost sprinted to the door with him as it swung closed behind them they heard mrs weasley shriek what do you mean the general idea 
 
 typical dad said ginny shaking her head as they set off up the corridor stitches i ask you 
 
 well you know they do work well on wounds said hermione fairly i suppose something in that venom dissolves them or something i wonder where the tearoom is 
 
 fifth floor said harry remembering the sign over the desk 
 
 they walked along the corridor through a set of double doors and found a rickety staircase lined with more portraits of healers as they climbed it the various healers called out to them diagnosing odd complaints and suggesting horrible remedies ron was seriously affronted when a medieval wizard called out that he clearly had a bad case of spattergroit 
 
 and that supposed to be he asked angrily as the healer pursued him through six more portraits shoving the occupants out of the way 
 
 tis a most grievous affliction of the skin young master that will leave you pockmarked and more gruesome even than you are now 
 
 watch who calling gruesome said ron his ears turning red 
 
 the only remedy is to take the liver of a toad bind it tight about your throat stand naked at the full moon in a barrel of eels eyes 
 
 i have not got spattergroit 
 
 but the unsightly blemishes upon your visage young master 
 
 freckles said ron furiously now get back in your own picture and leave me alone 
 
 he rounded on the others who were all keeping determinedly straight faces 
 
 what this 
 
 i think the fifth said hermione 
 
 nah the fourth said harry one more 
 
 but as he stepped on to the landing he came to an abrupt halt staring at the small window set into the double doors that marked the start of a corridor signposted spell damage a man was peering out at them all with his nose pressed against the glass he had wavy blond hair bright blue eyes and a broad vacant smile that revealed dazzlingly white teeth 
 
 blimey said ron also staring at the man 
 
 oh my goodness said hermione suddenly sounding breathless professor lockhart 
 
 their against the dark arts teacher pushed open the doors and moved towards them wearing a long lilac dressing gown 
 
 well hello there he said i expect like my autograph would you 
 
 changed much has he harry muttered to ginny who grinned 
 
 erhow are you professor said ron sounding slightly guilty it had been malfunctioning wand that had damaged professor memory so badly that he had landed in st in the first place though as lockhart had been attempting to permanently wipe harry and memories at the time sympathy was limited 
 
 very well indeed thank you said lockhart exuberantly palling a rather battered quill from his pocket now how many autographs would you like i can do writing now you know 
 
 erwe want any at the moment thanks said ron raising his eyebrows at harry who asked professor should you be wandering around the corridors you be in a ward 
 
 the smile faded slowly from face for a few moments he gazed intently at harry then he said we met 
 
 er yeah we have said harry you used to teach us at hogwarts remember 
 
 teach repeated lockhart looking faintly unsettled me did i 
 
 and then the smile reappeared upon his face so suddenly it was rather alarming 
 
 taught you everything you know i expect did i well how about those autographs then shall we say a round dozen you can give them to all your little friends then and nobody will be left out 
 
 but just then a head poked out of a door at the far end of the corridor and a voice called gilderoy you naughty boy where have you wandered off to 
 
 a healer wearing a tinsel wreath in her hair came bustling up the corridor smiling warmly at harry and the others 
 
 oh gilderoy got visitors how lovely and on christmas day too do you know he never gets visitors poor lamb and i think why such a sweetie you 
 
 doing autographs gilderoy told the healer with another glittering smile they want loads of them take no for an answer i just hope got enough photographs 
 
 listen to him said the healer taking arm and beaming fondly at him as though he were a precocious he was rather well known a few years ago we very much hope that this liking for giving autographs is a sign that his memory might be starting to come back will you step this way in a closed ward you know he must have slipped out while i was bringing in the christmas presents the usually kept locked not that dangerous but she lowered her voice to a whisper a bit of a danger to himself bless him know who he is you see wanders off and remember how to get back it is nice of you to have come to see him 
 
 er said ron gesturing uselessly at the floor above actually we were juster 
 
 but the healer was smiling expectantly at them and feeble mutter of going to have a cup of tea trailed away into nothingness they looked at each other helplessly then followed lockhart and his healer along the corridor 
 
 not stay long ron said quietly 
 
 the healer pointed her wand at the door of the janus thickey ward and muttered alohomora the door swung open and she led the way inside keeping a firm grasp on arm until she had settled him into an armchair beside his bed 
 
 this is our residents ward she informed harry ron hermione and ginny in a low voice for permanent spell damage you know of course with intensive remedial potions and charms and a bit of luck we can produce some improvement gilderoy does seem to be getting back some sense of himself and seen a real improvement in mr bode he seems to be regaining the power of speech very well though he speaking any language we recognise yet well i must finish giving out the christmas presents leave you all to chat 
 
 harry looked around the ward bore unmistakeable signs of being a permanent home to its residents they had many more personal effects around their beds than in mr ward the wall around headboard for instance was papered with pictures of himself all beaming toothily and waving at the new arrivals he had autographed many of them to himself in disjointed childish writing the moment he had been deposited in his chair by the healer gilderoy pulled a fresh stack of photographs towards him seized a quill and started signing them all feverishly 
 
 you can put them in envelopes he said to ginny throwing the signed pictures into her lap one by one as he finished them i am not forgotten you know no i still receive a very great deal of fan mail gladys gudgeon writes weekly i just wish i knew why he paused looking faintly puzzled then beamed again and returned to his signing with renewed vigour i suspect it is simply my good looks 
 
 a wizard lay in the bed opposite staring at the ceiling he was mumbling to himself and seemed quite unaware of anything around him two beds along was a woman whose entire head was covered in fur harry remembered something similar happening to hermione during their second year although fortunately the damage in her case had not been permanent at the far end of the ward flowery curtains had been drawn around two beds to give the occupants and their visitors some privacy 
 
 here you are agnes said the healer brightly to the woman handing her a small pile of christmas presents see not forgotten are you and your sent an owl to say visiting tonight so nice it 
 
 agnes gave several loud barks 
 
 and look broderick been sent a pot plant and a lovely calendar with a different fancy hippogriff for each month brighten things up they said the healer bustling along to the mumbling man setting a rather ugly plant with long swaying tentacles on the bedside cabinet and fixing the calendar to the wall with her wand andoh mrs longbottom are you leaving already 
 
 head span round the curtains had been drawn back from the two beds at the end of the ward and two visitors were walking back down the aisle between the beds a old witch wearing a long green dress a fox fur and a pointed hat decorated with what was unmistakeably a stuffed vulture and trailing behind her looking thoroughly depressedneville 
 
 with a sudden rush of understanding harry realised who the people in the end beds must be he cast around wildly for some means of distracting the others so that neville could leave the ward unnoticed and unquestioned but ron had also looked up at the sound of the name longbottom and before harry could stop him had called out neville 
 
 neville jumped and cowered as though a bullet had narrowly missed him 
 
 us neville said ron brightly getting to his feet have you seen here you been visiting 
 
 friends of yours neville dear said grandmother graciously bearing down upon them all 
 
 neville looked as though he would rather be anywhere in the world but here a dull purple flush was creeping up his plump face and he was not making eye contact with any of them 
 
 ah yes said his grandmother looking closely at harry and sticking out a shrivelled clawlike hand for him to shake yes yes i know who you are of course neville speaks most highly of you 
 
 erthanks said harry shaking hands neville did not look at him but surveyed his own feet the colour deepening in his face all the while 
 
 and you two are clearly weasleys mrs longbottom continued proffering her hand regally to ron and ginny in turn yes i know your parentsnot well of coursebut fine people fine people and you must be hermione granger 
 
 hermione looked rather startled that mrs longbottom knew her name but shook hands all the same 
 
 yes told me all about you helped him out of a few sticky spots you a good boy she said casting a sternly appraising look down her rather bony nose at neville but be got his talent afraid to say and she jerked her head in the direction of the two beds at the end of the ward so that the stuffed vulture on her hat trembled alarmingly 
 
 what said ron looking amazed harry wanted to stamp on foot but that sort of thing is much harder to bring off unnoticed when wearing jeans rather than robes is that your dad down the end neville 
 
 this said mrs longbottom sharply you told your friends about your parents neville 
 
 neville took a deep breath looked up at the ceiling and shook his head harry could not remember ever feeling sorrier for anyone but he could not think of any way of helping neville out of the situation 
 
 well nothing to be ashamed of said mrs longbottom angrily you should be proud neville give their health and their sanity so their only son would be ashamed of them you know 
 
 not ashamed said neville very faintly still looking anywhere but at harry and the others ron was now standing on tiptoe to look over at the inhabitants of the two beds 
 
 well got a funny way of showing it said mrs longbottom my son and his wife she said turning haughtily to harry ron hermione and ginny were tortured into insanity by followers 
 
 hermione and ginny both clapped their hands over their mouths ron stopped craning his neck to catch a glimpse of parents and looked mortified 
 
 they were aurors you know and very well respected within the wizarding community mrs longbottom went on highly gifted the pair of them iyes alice dear what is it 
 
 mother had come edging down the ward in her nightdress she no longer had the plump face harry had seen in old photograph of the original order of the phoenix her face was thin and worn now her eyes seemed overlarge and her hair which had turned white was wispy and she did not seem to want to speak or perhaps she was not able to but she made timid motions towards neville holding something in her outstretched hand 
 
 again said mrs longbottom sounding slightly weary very well alice dear very well neville take it whatever it is 
 
 but neville had already stretched out his hand into which his mother dropped an empty best blowing gum wrapper 
 
 very nice dear said grandmother in a falsely cheery voice patting his mother on the shoulder 
 
 but neville said quietly thanks mum 
 
 his mother tottered away back up the ward humming to herself neville looked around at the others his expression defiant as though daring them to laugh but harry did not think ever found anything less funny in his life 
 
 well better get back sighed mrs longbottom drawing on long green gloves very nice to have met you all neville put that wrapper in the bin she must have given you enough of them to paper your bedroom by now 
 
 but as they left harry was sure he saw neville slip the sweet wrapper into his pocket 
 
 the door closed behind them 
 
 i never knew said hermione who looked tearful 
 
 nor did i said ron rather hoarsely 
 
 nor me whispered ginny 
 
 they all looked at harry 
 
 i did he said glumly dumbledore told me but i promised i tell anyone what bellatrix lestrange got sent to azkaban for using the cruciatus curse on parents until they lost their minds 
 
 bellatrix lestrange did that whispered hermione horrified that woman got a photo of in his den 
 
 there was a long silence broken by angry voice 
 
 look i learn writing for nothing you know 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter horcruxescontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry could feel the felix felicis wearing off as he creeped back into the castle the front door had remainedun locked for him but on the third floor he met peeves and only narrowly avoided detection by diving sideways through one of his shortcuts by the time he got up to the portrait of the fat lady and pulled off his invisibility cloak he was not surprised to find her in a most unhelpful mood 
 
 what sort of time do you call this 
 
 really sorryi had to go out for something important 
 
 well the password changed at midnight so just have to sleep in the corridor you 
 
 joking said harry why did it have to change at midnight 
 
 the way it is said the fat lady if angry go and take it up with the headmaster the one tightened security 
 
 fantastic said harry bitterly looking around at the hard floor really brilliant yeah i would go and take it up with dumbledore if he was here because the one who wanted me to 
 
 he is here said a voice behind harry professor dumbledore returned to the school an hour ago 
 
 nearly headless nick was gliding toward harry his head wobbling as usual upon his ruff 
 
 i had it from the bloody baron who saw him arrive said nick he appeared according to the baron to be in good spirits though a little tired of course 
 
 where is he said harry his heart leaping 
 
 oh groaning and clanking up on the astronomy tower a favorite pastime of his 
 
 not the bloody baron dumbledore 
 
 ohin his office said nick i believe from what the baron said that he had business to attend to before turning in 
 
 yeah he has said harry excitement blazing in his chest at the prospect of telling dumbledore he had secured the memory he wheeled about and sprinted off again ignoring the fat lady who was calling after him 
 
 come back all right i lied i was annoyed you woke me up the still tapeworm 
 
 but harry was already hurtling back along the corridor and within minutes he was saying toffee eclairs to gargoyle which leapt aside permitting harry entrance onto the spiral staircase 
 
 enter said dumbledore when harry knocked he sounded exhausted 
 
 harry pushed open the door there was office looking the same as ever but with black skies beyond the windows 
 
 good gracious harry said dumbledore in surprise to what do i owe this very late pleasure 
 
 got it got the memory from slughorn 
 
 harry pulled out the tiny glass bottle and showed it to dumbledore for a moment or two the headmaster looked stunned then his face split in a wide smile 
 
 harry this is spectacular news very well done indeed i knew you could do it 
 
 all thought of the lateness of the hour apparently forgotten he hurried around his desk took the bottle with memory in his uninjured hand and strode over to the cabinet where he kept the pensieve 
 
 and now said dumbledore placing the stone basin upon the desk and emptying the contents of the bottle into it now at last we shall see harry quickly 
 
 harry bowed obediently over the pensieve and felt his feet leave the office floor once again he fell through darkness and landed in horace office many years before 
 
 there was the much younger slughorn with his thick shiny hair and his mustache sitting again in the comfortable winged armchair in his office his feet resting upon a velvet pouffe a small glass of wine in one hand the other rummaging in a box of crystallized pineapple and there were the half dozen teenage boys sitting around slughorn with tom riddle in the midst of them ring gleaming on his finger 
 
 dumbledore landed beside harry just as riddle asked sir is it true that professor merrythought is retiring 
 
 tom tom if i knew i tell you said slughorn wagging his finger reprovingly at riddle though winking at the same time i must say like to know where you get your information boy more knowledgeable than half the staff you are 
 
 riddle smiled the other boys laughed and cast him admiring looks 
 
 what with your uncanny ability to know things you and your careful flattery of the people who matterthank you for the pineapple by the way quite right it is my favorite 
 
 several of the boys tittered again 
 
 i confidently expect you to rise to minister of magic within twenty years fifteen if you keep sending me pineapple i have excellent contacts at the ministry 
 
 tom riddle merely smiled as the others laughed again harry noticed that he was by no means the eldest of the group of boys but that they all seemed to look to him as their leader 
 
 i know that politics would suit me sir he said when the laughter had died away i have the right kind of background for one thing 
 
 a couple of the boys around him smirked at each other harry was sure they were enjoying a private joke undoubtedly about what they knew or suspected regarding their gang famous ancestor 
 
 nonsense said slughorn briskly be plainer you come from decent wizarding stock abilities like yours no go far tom never been wrong about a student yet 
 
 the small golden clock standing upon desk chimed eleven behind him and he looked around 
 
 good gracious is it that time already better get going boys or all be in trouble lestrange i want your essay by in morrow or detention same goes for you avery 
 
 one by one the boys filed out of the room slughorn heaved himself out of his armchair and carried his empty glass over to his desk a movement behind him made him look around riddle was still standing there 
 
 look sharp tom you want to be caught out of bed out of hours and you a prefect 
 
 sir i wanted to ask you something 
 
 ask away then ask away 
 
 sir i wondered what you know about about horcruxes 
 
 slughorn stared at him his thick ringers absentmindedly clawing the stem of his wine glass 
 
 project for defense against the dark arts is it 
 
 but harry could tell that slughorn knew perfectly well that this was not schoolwork 
 
 not exactly sir said riddle i came across the term while reading and i fully understand it 
 
 no well be to find a book at hogwarts give you details on horcruxes tom very dark stuff very dark indeed said slughorn 
 
 but you obviously know all about them sir i mean a wizard like yousorry i mean if you tell me obviouslyi just knew if anyone could tell me you couldso i just thought ask 
 
 it was very well done thought harry the hesitancy the casual tone the careful flattery none of it overdone he harry had had too much experience of trying to wheedle information out of reluctant people not to recognize a master at work he could tell that riddle wanted the information very very much perhaps had been working toward this moment for weeks 
 
 well said slughorn not looking at riddle but fiddling with the ribbon on top of his box of crystallized pineapple well it hurt to give you an overview of course just so that you understand the term a horcrux is the word used for an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul 
 
 i quite understand how that works though sir said riddle 
 
 his voice was carefully controlled but harry could sense his excitement 
 
 well you split your soul you see said slughorn and hide part of it in an object outside the body then even if body is attacked or destroyed one cannot die for part of the soul remains earthbound and undamaged but of course existence in such a form 
 
 face crumpled and harry found himself remembering words he had heard nearly two years before 
 
 i was ripped from my body i was less than spirit less than the meanest ghost but still i was alive 
 
 few would want it tom very few death would be preferable 
 
 but hunger was now apparent his expression was greedy he could no longer hide his longing 
 
 how do you split your soul 
 
 well said slughorn uncomfortably you must understand that the soul is supposed to remain intact and whole splitting it is an act of violation it is against nature 
 
 but how do you do it 
 
 by an act of evilthe supreme act of evil by commiting murder killing rips the soul apart the wizard intent upon creating a horcrux would use the damage to his advantage he would encase the torn portion 
 
 encase but how 
 
 there is a spell do not ask me i know said slughoin shaking his head like an old elephant bothered by mosquitoes do i look as though i have tried itdo i look like a killer 
 
 no sir of course not said riddle quickly sorry i mean to offend 
 
 not at all not at all not offended said slughorn gruffly it is natural to feel some curiosity about these things wizards of a certain caliber have always been drawn to that aspect of magic 
 
 yes sir said riddle what i understand thoughjust out of curiosity i mean would one horcrux be much use can you only split your soul once it be better make you stronger to have your soul in more pieces i mean for instance seven the most powerfully magical number seven 
 
 beard tom yelped slughorn seven it bad enough to think of killing one person and in any case bad enough to divide the soul but to rip it into seven pieces 
 
 slughorn looked deeply troubled now he was gazing at riddle as though he had never seen him plainly before and harry could tell that he was regretting entering into the conversation at all 
 
 of course he muttered this is all hypothetical what discussing it all academic 
 
 yes sir of course said riddle quickly 
 
 but all the same tom keep it quiet what to say what discussed people like to think been chatting about horcruxes a banned subject at hogwarts you know particularly fierce about it 
 
 i say a word sir said riddle and he left but not before harry had glimpsed his face which was full of that same wild happiness it had worn when he had first found out that he was a wizard the sort of happiness that did not enhance his handsome features but made them somehow less human 
 
 thank you harry said dumbledore quietly let us go 
 
 when harry landed back on the office floor dumbledore was already sitting down behind his desk harry sat too and waited for dumbledore to speak 
 
 i have been hoping for this piece of evidence for a very long time said dumbledore at last it confirms the theory on which i have been working it tells me that i am right and also how very far there is still to go 
 
 harry suddenly noticed that every single one of the old headmasters and headmistresses in the portraits around the walls was awake and listening in on their conversation a corpulent red nosed wizard had actually taken out an ear trumpet 
 
 well harry said dumbledore i am sure you understood the significance of what we just heard at the same age as you are now give or take a few months tom riddle was doing all he could to find out how to make himself immortal 
 
 you think he succeeded then sir asked harry he made a horcrux and why he die when he attacked me he had a horcrux hidden somewhere a bit of his soul was safe 
 
 a bit or more said dumbledore you heard voldemort what he particularly wanted from horace was an opinion on what would happen to the wizard who created more than one horcrux what would happen to the wizard so determined to evade death that he would be prepared to murder many times rip his soul repeatedly so as to store it in many separately concealed horcruxes no book would have given him that information as far as i knowas far i am sure as voldemort knewno wizard had ever done more than tear his soul in two 
 
 dumbledore paused for a moment marshaling his thought and then said four years ago i received what i considered certain proof that voldemort had split his soul 
 
 where asked harry how 
 
 you handed it to me harry said dumbledore the diary diary the one giving instructions on how to reopen the chamber of secrets 
 
 i understand sir said harry 
 
 well although i did not see the riddle who came out of the diary what you described to me was a phenomenon i had never witnessed a mere memory starting to act and think for itself a mere memory sapping the life out of the girl into whose hands it had fallen no something much more sinister had lived inside that book a fragment of soul i was almost sure of it the diary had been a horcrux but this raised as many questions as it answered what intrigued and alarmed me most was that that diary had been intended as a weapon as much as a safeguard 
 
 i still understand said harry 
 
 well it worked as a horcrux is supposed to workin other words the fragment of soul concealed inside it was kept safe and had undoubtedly played its part in preventing the death of its owner but there could be no doubt that riddle really wanted that diary read wanted the piece of his soul to inhabit or possess somebody else so that monster would be unleashed again 
 
 well he want his hard work to be wasted said harry he wanted people to know he was heir because he take credit at the time 
 
 quite correct said dumbledore nodding but you see harry that if he intended the diary to be passed to or planted on some future hogwarts student he was being remarkably blas about that precious fragment of his soul concealed within it the point of a horcrux is as professor slughorn explained to keep part of the self hidden and safe not to fling it into somebody path and run the risk that they might destroy itas indeed happened that particular fragment of soul is no more you saw to that 
 
 the careless way in which voldemort regarded this horcrux seemed most ominous to me it suggested that he must have madeor had been planning to makemore horcruxes so that the loss of his first would not be so detrimental i did not wish to believe it but nothing else seemed to make sense then you told me two years later that on the night that voldemort returned to his body he made a most illuminating and alarming statement to his death eaters i who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality that was what you told me he said further than anybody and i thought i knew what that meant though the death eaters did not he was referring to his horcruxes horcruxes in the plural harry which i believe any other wizard has ever had yet it fitted lord voldomort has seemed to grow less human with the passing years and the transformation he had undergone seemed to me to be only explainable if his soul was mutilated beyond the realms of what we might call usual evil 
 
 so made himself impossible to kill by murdering other people said harry why he make a stone or steal one if he was so interested in immortality 
 
 well we know that he tried to do just that five years ago said dumbledore but there are several reasons why i think a stone would appeal less than horcruxes to lord voldemort 
 
 while the elixir of life does indeed extend life it must be drunk regularly for all eternity if the drinker is to maintain the immortality therefore voldemort would be entirely dependant on the elixir and if it ran out or was contaminated or if the stone was stolen he would die just like any other man voldemort likes to operate alone remember i believe that he would have found the thought of being dependent even on the elixir intolerable of course he was prepared to drink it if it would take him out of the horrible to which he was condemned after attacking you but only to regain a body thereafter i am convinced he intended to continue to rely on his horcruxes he would need nothing more if only he could regain a human form he was already immortal you see or as close to immortal as any man can be 
 
 but now harry armed with this information the crucial memory you have succeeded in procuring for us we are closer to the secret of finishing lord voldemort than anyone has ever been before you heard him harry it be better make you stronger to have your soul in more piece seven the most powerfully magical numbe seven the most powerfully magical number yes i think the idea of a soul would greatly appeal to lord voldemort 
 
 he made seven horcruxes said harry while several of the portraits on the walls made similar noises of shock and outrage but they could be anywhere in the worldhiddenburied or invisible 
 
 i am glad to see you appreciate the magnitude of the problem said dumbledore calmly but firstly no harry not seven horcruxes six the seventh part of his soul however maimed resides inside his regenerated body that was the part of him that lived a spectral existence for so many years during his exile without that he has no self at all that seventh piece of soul will be the last that anybody wishing to kill voldemort must attackthe piece that lives in his body 
 
 but the six horcruxes then said harry a little desperately how are we supposed to find them 
 
 you are forgetting you have already destroyed one of them and i have destroyed another 
 
 you have said harry eagerly 
 
 yes indeed said dumbledore and he raised his blackened hand the ring harry ring and a terrible curse there was upon it too had it not beenforgive me the lack of seemly modestyfor my own prodigious skill and for professor timely action when i returned to hogwarts desperately injured i might not have lived to tell the tale however a withered hand does not seem an unreasonable exchange for a seventh of soul the ring is no longer a horcrux 
 
 but how did you find it 
 
 well as you now know for many years i have made it my business to discover as much as i can about past life i have traveled widely visiting those places he once knew i stumbled across the ring hidden in the ruin of the house it seem that once voldemort had succeeded in sealing a piece of his soul in side it he did not want to wear it anymore he hid it protected by many powerful enchantments in the shack where his ancestors had once lived morfin having been carted off to azkaban of course never guessing that i might one day take the trouble to visit the ruin or that i might be keeping an eye open for traces of magical concealment 
 
 however we should not congratulate ourselves too heartily you destroyed the diary and i the ring but if we are right in our theory of a soul four horcruxes remain 
 
 and they could be anything said harry they could be oh in tin cans or i dunno empty potion bottles 
 
 you are thinking of portkeys harry which must be ordinary objects easy to overlook but would lord voldemort use tin cans or old potion bottles to guard his own precious soul you are forgetting what i have showed you lord voldemort liked to collect trophies and he preferred objects with a powerful magical history his pride his belief in his own superiority his determination to carve for himself a startling place in magical history these things suggest to me that voldemort would have chosen his horcruxes with some care favoring objects worthy of the honor 
 
 the diary that special 
 
 the diary as you have said yourself was proof that he was the heir of slytherin i am sure that voldemort considered it of stupendous importance 
 
 so the other horcruxes said harry do you think you know what they are sir 
 
 i can only guess said dumbledore for the reasons i have already given i believe that lord voldemort would prefer objects that in themselves have a certain grandeur i have therefore trawled back through past to see if i can find evidence that such artifacts have disappeared around him 
 
 the locket said harry loudly cup 
 
 yes said dumbledore smiling i would be prepared to betperhaps not my other handbut a couple of fingers that they became horcruxes three and four the remaining two assuming again that he created a total of six are more of a problem but i will hazard a guess that having secured objects from hufflepuff and slytherin he set out to track down objects owned by gryffindor or ravenclaw four objects from the four founders would i am sure have exerted a powerful pull over imagination i cannot answer for whether he ever managed to find anything of i am confident however that the only known relic of gryffindor remains safe 
 
 dumbledore pointed his blackened fingers to the wall behind him where a sword reposed within a glass case 
 
 do you think why he really wanted to come back to hogwarts sir said harry to try and find something from one of the other founders 
 
 my thoughts precisely said dumbledore but unfortunately that does not advance us much further for he was turned away or so i believe without the chance to search the school i am forced to conclude that he never fulfilled his ambition of collecting four founders objects he definitely had twohe may have found threethat is the best we can do for now 
 
 even if he got something of or of that leaves a sixth horcrux said harry counting on his fingers unless got both 
 
 i think so said dumbledore i think i know what the sixth horcrux is i wonder what you will say when i confess that i have been curious for a while about the behavior of the snake nagini 
 
 the snake said harry startled you can use animals as horcruxes 
 
 well it is inadvisable to do so said dumbledore because to confide a part of your soul to something that can think and move for itself is obviously a very risky business however if my calculations are correct voldemort was still at least one horcrux short of his goal of six when he entered your parents house with the intention of killing you 
 
 he seems to have reserved the process of making horcruxes for particularly significant deaths you would certainly have been that he believed that in killing you he was destroying the danger the prophecy had outlined he believed he was making himself invincible i am sure that he was intending to make his final horcrux with your death as we know he failed after an interval of some years however he used nagini to kill an old muggle man and it might then have occurred to him to turn her into his last horcrux she underlines the slytherin connection which enhances lord mystique i think he is perhaps as fond of her as he can be of anything he certainly likes to keep her close and he seems to have an unusual amount of control over her even for a parselmouth 
 
 so said harry the gone the gone the cup the locket and the snake are still intact and you think there might be a horcrux that was once or 
 
 an admirably succinct and accurate summary yes said dumbledore bowing his head 
 
 so are you still looking for them sir is that where been going when been leaving the school 
 
 correct said dumbledore i have been looking for a very long time i think perhaps i may be close to finding another one there are hopeful signs 
 
 and if you do said harry quickly can i come with you and help get rid of it 
 
 dumbledore looked at harry very intently for a moment before saying yes i think so 
 
 i can said harry thoroughly taken aback 
 
 oh yes said dumbledore smiling slightly i think you have earned that right 
 
 harry felt his heart lift it was very good not to hear words of caution and protection for once the headmasters and headmistresses around the walls seemed less impressed by decision harry saw a few of them shaking their heads and phineas nigellus actually snorted 
 
 does voldemort know when a horcrux is destroyed sir can he feel it harry asked ignoring the portraits 
 
 a very interesting question harry i believe not i believe that voldemort is now so immersed in evil and these crucial parts of himself have been detached for so long he does not feel as we do perhaps at the point of death he might be aware of his loss but he was not aware for instance that the diary had been destroyed until he forced the truth out of lucius malfoy when voldemort discovered that the diary had been mutilated and robbed of all its powers i am told that his anger was terrible to behold 
 
 but i thought he meant lucius malfoy to smuggle it into hogwarts 
 
 yes he did years ago when he was sure he would be able to create more horcruxes but still lucius was supposed to wait for voldemorts and he never received it for voldemort vanished shortly after giving him the diary no doubt he thought that lucius would not dare do anything with the horcrux other than guard it carefully but he was counting too much upon fear of a master who had been gone for years and whom lucius believed dead of course lucius did not know what the diary really was i understand that voldemort had told him the diary would cause the chamber of secrets to reopen because it was cleverly enchanted had lucius known he held a portion of his soul in his hands he would undoubtedly have treated it with more reverencebut instead he went ahead and carried out the old plan for his own ends by planting the diary upon arthur daughter he hoped to discredit arthur and get rid of a highly incriminating magical object in one stroke ah poor lucius what with fury about the fact that he threw away the horcrux for his own gain and the fiasco at the ministry last year i would not be surprised if he is not secretly glad to be safe in azkaban at the moment 
 
 harry sat in thought for a moment then asked so if all of his horcruxes are destroyed voldemort could be killed 
 
 yes i think so said dumbledore without his horcruxes voldemort will be a mortal man with a maimed and diminished soul never forget though that while his soul may be damaged beyond repair his brain and his magical powers remain intact it will take uncommon skill and power to kill a wizard like voldemort even without his horcruxes 
 
 but i got uncommon skill and power said harry before he could stop himself 
 
 yes you have said dumbledore firmly you have a power that voldemort has never had you can 
 
 i know said harry impatiently i can love it was only with difficulty that he stopped himself adding big deal 
 
 yes harry you can love said dumbledore who looked as though he knew perfectly well what harry had just refrained from saying which given everything that has happened to you is a great and remarkable thing you are still too young to understand how unusual you are harry 
 
 so when the prophecy says that have power the dark lord knows not it just meanslove asked harry feeling a little let down 
 
 yesjust love said dumbledore but harry never forget that what the prophecy says is only significant because voldemort made it so i told you this at the end of last year voldemort singled you out as the person who would be most dangerous to himand in doing so he made you the person who would be most dangerous to him 
 
 but it comes to the same 
 
 no it said dumbledore sounding impatient now pointing at harry with his black withered hand he said you are setting too much store by the prophecy 
 
 but spluttered harry but you said the prophecy means 
 
 if voldemort had never heard of the prophecy would it have been fulfilled would it have meant anything of course not do you think every prophecy in the hall of prophecy has been fulfilled 
 
 but said harry bewildered but last year you said one of us would have to kill the other 
 
 harry harry only because voldemort made a grave error and acted on professor words if voldemort had never murdered your father would he have imparted in you a furious desire for revenge of course not if he had not forced your mother to die for you would he have given you a magical protection he could not penetrate of course not harry you see voldemort himself created his worst enemy just as tyrants everywhere do have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress all of them realize that one day amongst their many victims there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back voldemort is no different always he was on the lookout for the one who would challenge him he heard the prophecy and he leapt into action with the result that he not only handpicked the man most likely to finish him he handed him uniquely deadly weapons 
 
 but 
 
 it is essential that you understand this said dumbledore standing up and striding about the room his glittering robes swooshing in his wake harry had never seen him so agitated by attempting to kill you voldemort himself singled out the remarkable person who sits here in front of me and gave him the tools for the job it is fault that you were able to see into his thoughts his ambitions that you even understand the snakelike language in which he gives orders and yet harry despite your privileged insight into world which incidentally is a gift any death eater would kill to have you have never been seduced by the dark arts never even for a second shown the slightest desire to become one of followers 
 
 of course i said harry indignantly he killed my mum and dad 
 
 you are protected in short by your ability to love said dumbledore loudly the only protection that can possibly work against the lure of power like in spite of all the temptation you have endured all the suffering you remain pure of heart just as pure as you were at the age of eleven when you stared into a mirror that reflected your desire and it showed you only the way to thwart lord voldemort and not immortality or riches harry have you any idea how few wizards could have seen what you saw in that mirror voldemort should have known then what he was dealing with but he did not 
 
 but he knows it now you have flitted into lord mind without damage to yourself but he cannot possess you without enduring mortal agony as he discovered in the ministry i do not think he understands why harry but then he was in such a hurry to mutilate his own soul he never paused to understand the incomparable power of a soul that is untarnished and whole 
 
 but sir said harry making valiant efforts not to sound argumentative it all comes to the same thing it got to try and kill him or 
 
 got to said dumbledore of course got to but not because of the prophecy because you yourself will never rest until tried we both know it imagine please just for a moment that you had never heard that prophecy how would you feel about voldemort now think 
 
 harry watched dumbledore striding up and down in front ol him and thought he thought of his mother his father and sinus he thought of cedric diggory he thought of all the terrible deeds he knew lord voldemort had done a flame seemed to leap inside his chest searing his throat 
 
 want him finished said harry quietly and want to do it 
 
 of course you would cried dumbledore you see the prophecy does not mean you have to do anything but the prophecy caused lord voldemort to mark you as his equal in other words you are free to choose your way quite free to turn your back on the prophecy but voldemort continues to set store by the prophecy he will continue to hunt you which makes it certain really that 
 
 that one of us is going to end up killing the other said harry 
 
 yes 
 
 but he understood at last what dumbledore had been trying to tell him it was he thought the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high some people perhaps would say that there was little to choose between the two ways but dumbledore knewand so do i thought harry with a rush of fierce pride and so did my parentsthat there was all the difference in the world

lionfish nov chapter malfoy manorcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 harry looked around at the other two now mere outlines in the darkness he saw hermione point her wand set toward the outside but into his face there was a bang a burst of white light and he buckled in agony unable to see he could feel his face swelling rapidly under his hands as heavy footfalls surrounded him 
 
 get up vermin 
 
 unknown hands dragged harry roughly off the ground before he could stop them someone had rummaged through his pockets and removed the blackthorn wand harry clutched at his excruciatingly painful face which felt unrecognizable beneath his fingers tight swollen and puffy as though he had suffered some violent allergic reaction his eyes had been reduced to slits through which he could barely see his glasses fell off as he was bundled out of the tent all he could make out were the blurred shapes of four or five people wrestling ron and hermione outside too 
 
 get c off c her ron shouted there was the unmistakable sound of knuckles hitting flesh ron grunted in pain and hermione screamed no leave him alone leave him alone 
 
 your boyfriends going to have worse than that done to him if hes on my list said the horribly familiar rasping voice delicious girl what a treat i do enjoy the softness of the skin 
 
 harrys stomach turned over he knew who this was fenrit greyback the werewolf who was permitted to wear death eater robes in return for his hired savagery 
 
 search the tent said another voice 
 
 harry was thrown face down onto the ground a thud told him that ron had been cast down beside him they could hear footsteps and crashes the men were pushing over chairs inside the tent as they searched 
 
 now lets see who weve got said greybacks gloating voice from overhead and harry was rolled over onto his back a beam of wand light fell onto his face and greyback laughed 
 
 ill be needing butterbeer to wash this one down what happened to you ugly 
 
 harry did not answer immediately 
 
 i said repeated greyback and harry received a blow to the diaphragm that made him double over in pain what happened to you 
 
 stung harry muttered been stung 
 
 yeah looks like it said a second voice 
 
 whats your name snarled greyback 
 
 dudley said harry 
 
 and your first name 
 
 i c vernon vernon dudley

 stan shunpike said ron 
 
 like ell you are said the man called scabior we know stan shunpike es put a bit of work our way 
 
 there was another thud 
 
 ib bardy said ron and harry could tell that his mouth was full of blood bardy weasley 
 
 a weasley rasped greyback so youre related to blood traitors even if youre not a mudblood and lastly your pretty little friend the relish in his voice made harrys flesh crawl 
 
 easy greyback said scabior over the jeering of the others 
 
 oh im not going to bite just yet well see if shes a bit quicker at remembering her name than barny who are you girly 
 
 penelope clearwater said hermione she sounded terrified but convincing 
 
 whats your blood status 
 
 said hermione 
 
 easy enough to check said scabior but the ole lot of em look like they could still be ogwarts age c 
 
 web lebt said ron 
 
 left ave you ginger said scabior and you decided to go camping and you thought just for a laugh youd use the dark lords name 
 
 nod a laugh said ron aggiden 
 
 accident there was more jeering laughter 
 
 you know who used to like using the dark lords name weasley growled greyback the order of the phoenix mean anything to you 
 
 doh 
 
 well they dont show the dark lord proper respect so the names been tabooed a few order members have been tracked that way well see bind them up with the other two prisoners 
 
 someone yanked harry up by the hair dragged him a short way pushed him down into a sitting position then started binding him with other people harry was still half blind barely able to see anything through his eyes when at last the man tying then had walked away harry whispered to the other prisoners 
 
 anyone still got a wand 
 
 no said ron and hermione from either side of him 
 
 this is all my fault i said the name im sorry c 
 
 harry 
 
 it was a new but familiar voice and it came from directly behind harry from the person tied to hermiones left 
 
 dean 
 
 it is you if they find out who theyve got theyre snatchers theyre only looking for truants to sell for gold c 
 
 not a bad little haul for one night greyback was saying as a pair of hobnailed boots marched close by harry and they heard more crashes from inside the tent a mudblood a runaway goblin and these truants you checked their names on the list yet scabior he roared 
 
 yeah theres no vernon dudley un ere greyback 
 
 interesting said greyback thats interesting 
 
 he crouched down beside harry who saw through the infinitesimal gap left between his swollen eyelids a face covered in matted gray hair and whiskers with pointed brown teeth and sores in the corners of his mouth greyback smelled as he had done at the top of the tower where dumbledore had died of dirt sweat and blood 
 
 so you arent wanted then vernon or are you on that list under a different name what house were you in at hogwarts 
 
 slytherin said harry automatically 
 
 funny ow they all thinks we wants to ear that leered scabior out of the shadows but none of em can tell us where the common room is 
 
 its in the dungeons said harry clearly you enter through the wall its full of skulls and stuff and its under the lake so the lights all green 
 
 there was a short pause 
 
 well well looks like we really ave caught a little slytherin said scabior good for you vernon cause there aint a lot of mudblood slytherins whos your father 
 
 he works at the ministry harry lied he knew that his whole story would collapse with the smallest investigation but on the other hand he only had until his face regained its usual appearance before the game was up in any case department of magical accidents and catastrophes 
 
 you know what greyback said scabior i think there is a dudley in there 
 
 harry could barely breathe could luck sheer luck get them safely out of this 
 
 well well said greyback and harry could hear the tiniest note of trepidation in that callous voice and knew that greyback was wondering whether he had just indeed just attacked and bound the son of a ministry official harrys heart was pounding against the ropes around his ribs he would not have been surprised to know that greyback could see it if youre telling the truth ugly youve got nothing to fear from a trip to the ministry i expect your fatherll reward us just for picking you up 
 
 but said harry his mouth bone dry if you just let us c 
 
 hey came a shout from inside the tent look at this greyback 
 
 a dark figure came bustling toward them and harry saw a glint of silver to the light of their wands they had found gryffindors sword 
 
 nice said greyback appreciatively taking it from his companion oh very nice indeed looks that where did you get something like this 
 
 its my fathers harry lied hoping against hope that it was too dark for greyback to see the name etched just below the hilt we borrowed it to cut firewood c 
 
 ang on a minute greyback look at this in the prophet 
 
 as scabior said it harrys scar which was stretched tight across his distended forehead burned savagely more clearly than he could make out anything around him he saw a towering building a grim fortress and forbidding voldemorts thoughts had suddenly become again he was gliding toward the gigantic building with a sense of calmly euphoric purpose 
 
 so close so close with a huge effort of will harry closed his mind to voldemorts thoughts pulling himself back to where he sat tied to ron hermione dean and griphook in the darkness listening to greyback and scabior 
 
 hermione granger scabior was saying the mudblood who is known to be traveling with arry potter 
 
 harrys scar burned in the silence but he made a supreme effort to keep himself present nor to slip into voldemorts mind he heard the creak of greybacks boots as he crouched down in front of hermione 
 
 you know what little girly this picture looks a hell of a lot like you 
 
 it isnt it isnt me 
 
 hermiones terrified squeak was as good as a confession 
 
 known to be traveling with harry potter repeated greyback quietly 
 
 a stillness had settled over the scene harrys scar was exquisitely painful but he struggled with all his strength against the pull of voldemorts thoughts it had never been so important to remain in his own right mind 
 
 well this changed things doesnt it whispered greyback nobody spoke harry sensed the gang of snatchers watching frozen and felt hermiones arm trembling against his greyback got up and took a couple of steps to where harry sat crouching down again to stare closely at his misshapen features 
 
 whats that on your forehead vernon he asked softly his breath foul in harrys nostrils as he pressed a filthy finger to the taught scar 
 
 dont touch it harry yelled he could not stop himself he thought he might be sick from the pain of it 
 
 i thought you wore glasses potter breathed greyback 
 
 i found glasses yelped one of the snatchers skulking in the background there was glasses in the tent greyback wait c 
 
 and seconds later harrys glasses had been rammed back onto his face the snatchers were closing in now peering at him 
 
 it is rasped greyback weve caught potter 
 
 they all took several steps backward stunned by what they had done harry still fighting to remain present in his own splitting head could think of nothing to say fragmented visions were breaking across the surface of his mind 
 
 che was hiding around the high walls of the black fortressc 
 
 no he was harry tied up and wandless in grave dangerc 
 
 clooking up up to the topmost window the highest towerc 
 
 he was harry and they were discussing his fate in low voicesc 
 
 ctime to fly 
 
 to the ministry 
 
 to hell with the ministry growled greyback theyll take the credit and we wont get a look in i say we take him straight to 
 
 will you summon im ere said scabior sounding awed terrified 
 
 no snarled greyback i havent got c they say hes using the malfoys place as a base well take the boy there 
 
 harry thought he knew why greyback was not calling voldemort the werewolf might be allowed to wear death eater robes when they wanted to use him but only voldemorts inner circle were branded with the dark mark greyback had not been granted this highest honor 
 
 harrys scar seared again c 
 
 c and he rose into the night flying straight up to the windows at the very top of the tower c 
 
 completely sure its him cause if it aint greyback were dead 
 
 whos in charge here roared greyback covering his moment of inadequacy i say thats potter and him plus his wand thats two hundred thousand galleons right there but if youre too gutless to come along any of you its all for me and with any luck ill get the girl thrown in 
 
 c the window was the merest slit in the black rock not big enough for a man to enter a skeletal figure was just visible through it curled beneath a blanket dead or sleeping 
 
 all right said scabior all right were in and what about the rest of em greyback whatll we do with em 
 
 might as well take the lot weve got two mudbloods thats another ten galleons give me the sword as well if theyre rubies thats another small fortune right there 
 
 the prisoners were dragged to their feet harry could hear hermiones breathing fast and terrified 
 
 grab hold and make it tight ill do potter said greyback seizing a fistful of harrys hair harry could feel his long yellow nails scratching his scalp on three one c two c three c 
 
 they disapparated pulling the prisoners with them harry struggled trying to throw off greybacks hand but it was hopeless ron and hermione were squeezed tightly against him on either side he could not separate from the group and as the breath was squeezed out of him his scar seared more painfully still c 
 
 c as he forced himself through the slit of a window like a snake and landed lightly as vapor inside the room c 
 
 the prisoners lurched into one another as they landed in a country lane harrys eyes still puffy took a moment to acclimatize then he saw a pair of gates at the foot of what looked like a long drive he experienced the tiniest trickle of relief the worst had not happened yet voldemort was not here he was harry knew for he was fighting to resist the vision in some strange fortresslike place at the top of a tower how long it would take voldemort to get to this place once he knew that harry was here was another matter 
 
 one of the snatchers strode to the gates and shook them 
 
 how do we get in theyre locked greyback i cant c blimey 
 
 he whipped his hands away in fright the iron was contorting twisting itself out of the abstract furls and coils into a frightening face which spoke in a clanging echoing voice state your purpose 
 
 weve got potter greyback roared triumphantly weve captured harry potter 
 
 the gates swung open 
 
 come on said greyback to his men and the prisoners were shunted through the gates and up the drive between high hedges that muffled their footsteps harry saw a ghostly white shape above him and realized it was an albino peacock he stumbled and was dragged onto his feet by greyback now he was staggering along sideways tied to the four other prisoner closing his puffy eyes he allowed the pain in his scar to overcome him for a moment wanting to know what voldemort was doing whether he knew yet that harry was caught 
 
 the emaciated figure stirred beneath its thin blanket and rolled over toward him eyes opening in a skull of a face the frail man sat up great sunken eyes fixed upon him upon voldemort and then he smiled most of his teeth were gone 
 
 so you have come i thought you would one day but your journey was pointless i never had it 
 
 you lie 
 
 as voldemorts anger throbbed inside him harrys scar threatened to burst with pain and he wrenched his mind back to his own body fighting to remain present as the prisoners were pushed over gravel 
 
 light spilled out over all of them 
 
 what is this said a womans cold voice 
 
 were here to see rasped greyback 
 
 who are you 
 
 you know me there was resentment in the werewolfs voice fenrit greyback weve caught harry potter 
 
 greyback seized harry and dragged him around to face the light forcing the other prisoners to shuffle around too 
 
 i know es swollen maam but its im piped up scabior if you look a bit closer youll see is scar and this ere see the girl the mudblood whos been traveling around with im maam theres no doubt its im and weve got is wand as well ere maam c 
 
 through his puffy eyelids harry saw narcissa malfoy scrutinizing his swollen face scabior thrust the blackthorn wand at her she raised her eyebrows 
 
 bring them in she said 
 
 harry and the others were shoved and kicked up broad stone steps into a hallway lined with portraits 
 
 follow me said narcissa leading the way across the hall my son draco is home for his easter holidays if that is harry potter he will know 
 
 the drawing room dazzled after the darkness outside even with his eyes almost closed harry could make out the wide proportions of the room a crystal chandelier hung from the ceiling more portraits against the dark purple walls two figures rose from chairs in front of an ornate marble fireplace as the prisoners were forced into the room by the snatchers 
 
 what is this 
 
 the dreadfully familiar drawling voice of lucius malfoy fell on harrys ears he was panicking now he could see no way out and it was easier as his fear mounted to block out voldemorts thoughts though his scar was still burning 
 
 they say theyve got potter said narcissas cold voice draco come here 
 
 harry did not dare look directly at draco but saw him obliquely a figure slightly taller than he was rising from an armchair his face a pale and pointed blur beneath hair 
 
 greyback forced the prisoners to turn again so as to place harry directly beneath the chandelier 
 
 well boy rasped the werewolf 
 
 harry was facing a mirror over the fireplace a great gilded thing in an intricately scrolled frame through the slits of his eyes he saw his own reflection for the first time since leaving grimmauld place 
 
 his face was huge shiny and pink every feature distorted by hermiones jinx his black hair reached his shoulders and there was a dark shadow around his jaw had he not known that it was he who stood there he would have wondered who was wearing his glasses he resolved not to speak for his voice was sure to give him away yet he still avoided eye contact with draco as the latter approached 
 
 well draco said lucius malfoy he sounded avid is it is it harry potter 
 
 i cant c i cant be sure said draco he was keeping his distance from greyback and seemed as scared of looking at harry as harry was of looking at him 
 
 but look at him carefully look come closer 
 
 harry had never heard lucius malfoy so excited 
 
 draco if we are the ones who hand potter over to the dark lord everything will be forgiv c 
 
 now we wont be forgetting who actually caught him i hope mr malfoy said greyback menacingly 
 
 of course not of course not said lucius impatiently he approached harry himself came so close that harry could see the usually languid pale face in sharp detail even through his swollen eyes with his face a puffy mask harry felt as though he was peering out from between the bars of a cage 
 
 what did you do to him lucius asked greyback how did he get into this state 
 
 that wasnt us 
 
 looks more like a stinging jinx to me said lucius 
 
 his gray eyes raked harrys forehead 
 
 theres something there he whispered it could be the scar stretched tight 
 
 draco come here look properly what do you think 
 
 harry saw dracos face up close now right beside his fathers they were extraordinarily alike except that while his father looked beside himself with excitement dracos expression was full of reluctance even fear 
 
 i dont know he said and he walked away toward the fireplace where his mother stood watching 
 
 we had better be certain lucius narcissa called to her husband in her cold clear voice completely sure that it is potter before we summon the dark lord they say this is his c she was looking closely at the blackthorn wand c but it does not resemble ollivanders description if we are mistaken if we call the dark lord here for nothing remember what he did to rowle and dolohov 
 
 what about the mudblood then growled greyback harry was nearly thrown off his feet as the snatchers forced the prisoners to swivel around again so that the light fell on hermione instead 
 
 wait said narcissa sharply yes c yes she was in madam malkins with potter i saw her picture in the prophet look draco isnt it the granger girl 
 
 i maybe yeah 
 
 but then thats the weasley boy shouted lucius striding around the bound prisoners to face ron its them potters friends c draco look at him isnt it arthur weasleys son whats his name c 
 
 yeah said draco again his back to the prisoners it could be 
 
 the drawing room door opened behind harry a woman spoke and the sound of the voice wound harrys fear to an even higher pitch 
 
 what is this whats happened cissy 
 
 bellatrix lestrange walked slowly around the prisoners and stopped on harrys right staring at hermione through her heavily lidded eyes but surely she said quietly this is the mudblood girl this is grander 
 
 yes yes its granger cried lucius and beside her we think potter potter and his friends caught at last 
 
 potter shrieked bellatrix and she backed away the better to take in harry 
 
 are you sure well then the dark lord must be informed at once 
 
 she dragged back her left sleeve harry saw the dark mark burned into the flesh of her arm and knew that she was about to touch it to summon her beloved masterc 
 
 i was about to call him said lucius and his hand actually closed upon bellatrixs wrist preventing her from touching the mark i shall summon him bella potter has been brought to my house and it is therefore upon my authority c 
 
 your authority she sneered attempting to wrench her hand from his grasp you lost your authority when you lost your wand lucius how dare you take your hands off me 
 
 this is nothing to do with you you did not capture the boy c 
 
 begging your pardon mr malfoy interjected greyback but its us that caught potter and its us thatll be claiming the gold c 
 
 gold laughed bellatrix still attempting to throw off her her free hand groping in her pocket for her wand take your gold filthy scavenger what do i want with gold i seek only the honor of his c of c 
 
 she stopped struggling her dark eyes fixed upon something harry could not see jubilant at her capitulation lucius threw her hand from him and ripped up his own sleeve c 
 
 stop shrieked bellatrix do not touch it we shall all perish if the dark lord comes now 
 
 lucius froze his index finger hovering over his own mark bellatrix strode out of harrys limited line of vision 
 
 what is that he heard her say 
 
 sword grunted an snatcher 
 
 give it to me 
 
 its not yours missus its mine i reckon i found it 
 
 there was a bang and a flash of red light harry knew that the snatcher had been stunned there was a roar of anger from his fellows scabior drew his wand 
 
 what dyou think youre playing at woman 
 
 stupefy she screamed stupefy 
 
 they were no match for her even thought there were four of them against one of her she was a witch as harry knew with prodigious skill and no conscience they fell where they stood all except greyback who had been forced into a kneeling position his arms outstretched out of the corners of his eyes harry saw bellatrix bearing down upon the werewolf the sword of gryffindor gripped tightly in her hand her face waxen 
 
 where did you get this sword she whispered to greyback as she pulled his wand out of his unresisting grip 
 
 how dare you he snarled his mouth the only thing that could move as he was forced to gaze up at her he bared his pointed teeth release me woman 
 
 where did you find this sword she repeated brandishing it in his face snape sent it to my vault in gringotts 
 
 it was in their tent rasped greyback release me i say 
 
 she waved her wand and the werewolf sprang to his feet but appeared too wary to approach her he prowled behind an armchair his filthy curved nails clutching its back 
 
 draco move this scum outside said bellatrix indicating the unconscious men if you havent got the guts to finish them then leave them in the courtyard for me 
 
 dont you dare speak to draco like c said narcissa furiously but bellatrix screamed 
 
 be quiet the situation is graver than you can possibly imagine cissy we have a very serious problem 
 
 she stood panting slightly looking down at the sword examining its hilt then she turned to look at the silent prisoners 
 
 if it is indeed potter he must not be harmed she muttered more to herself than to the others the dark lord wishes to dispose of potter himself but if he finds out i must i must know 
 
 she turned back to her sister again 
 
 the prisoners must be placed in the cellar while i think what to do 
 
 this is my house bella you dont give orders in my c 
 
 do it you have no idea of the danger were in shrieked bellatrix she looked frightening mad a thin stream of fire issued from her wand and burned a hole in the carpet 
 
 narcissa hesitated for a moment then addressed the werewolf 
 
 take these prisoners down to the cellar greyback 
 
 wait said bellatrix sharply all except except for the mudblood 
 
 greyback gave a grunt of pleasure 
 
 no shouted ron you can have me keep me 
 
 bellatrix hit him across the face the blow echoed around the room 
 
 if she dies under questioning ill take you next she said blood traitor is next to mudblood in my book take them downstairs greyback and make sure they are secure but do nothing more to them c yet 
 
 she threw greybacks wand back to him then took a short silver knife from under her robes she cut hermione free from the other prisoners then dragged her by the hair into the middle of the room while greyback forced the rest of them to shuffle across to another door into a dark passageway his wand held out in front of him projecting an invisible and irresistible force 
 
 reckon shell let me have a bit of the girl when shes finished with her greyback crooned as he forced them along the corridor id say ill get a bite or two wouldnt you ginger 
 
 harry could feel ron shaking they were forced down a steep flight of stairs still tied and in danger of slipping and breaking their necks at any moment at the bottom was a heavy door greyback unlocked it with a tap of his wand then forced them into a dank and musty room and left them in total darkness the echoing bang of the slammed cellar door had not died away before there was a terrible drawn out scream from directly above them 
 
 hermione ron bellowed and he started to writhe and struggle against the ropes tying them together so that harry staggered hermione 
 
 be quiet harry said shut up ron we need to work out a way c 
 
 hermione hermione 
 
 we need a plan stop yelling c we need to get these ropes off c 
 
 harry came a whisper through the darkness ron is that you 
 
 ron stopped shouting there was a sound of movement close by them then harry saw a shadow moving closer 
 
 harry ron 
 
 luna 
 
 yes its me oh no i didnt want you to be caught 
 
 luna can you help us get these ropes off said harry 
 
 oh yes i expect so theres an old nail we use if we need to break anything just a moment 
 
 hermione screamed again from overhead and they could hear bellatrix screaming too but her words were inaudible for ron shouted again hermione hermione 
 
 mr ollivander harry could hear luna saying mr ollivander have you got the nail if you just move over a little bit i think it was beside the water jug 
 
 she was back within seconds 
 
 youll need to stay still she said 
 
 harry could feel her digging at the ropes tough fibers to work the knots free from upstairs they heard bellatrixs voice 
 
 im going to ask you again where did you get this sword where 
 
 we found it c we found it c please hermione screamed again ron struggled harder than ever and the rusty nail slipped onto harrys wrist 
 
 ron please stay still luna whispered i cant see what im doing c 
 
 my pocket said ron in my pocket theres a deluminator and its full of light 
 
 a few seconds later there was a click and the luminescent spheres the deluminator had sucked from the lamps in the tent flew into the cellar unable to rejoin their sources they simply hung there like tiny suns flooding the underground room with light harry saw luna all eyes in her white face and the motionless figure of ollivander the wandmaker curled up on the floor in the corner craning around he caught sight of their fellow prisoners dean and griphook the goblin who seemed barely conscious kept standing by the ropes that bound him to the humans 
 
 oh thats much easier thanks ron said luna and she began hacking at their bindings again hello dean 
 
 from above came bellatrixs voice 
 
 youre lying filthy mudblood and i know it you have been inside my vault at gringotts tell the truth tell the truth 
 
 another terrible screamc 
 
 hermione 
 
 what else did you take what else have you got tell me the truth or i swear i shall run you through with this knife 
 
 there 
 
 harry felt the ropes fall away and turned rubbing his wrists to see ron running around the cellar looking up at the low ceiling searching for a trapdoor dean his face bruised and bloody said thanks to luna and stood there shivering but griphook sank onto the cellar floor looking groggy and disoriented many welts across his swarthy face 
 
 ron was now trying to disapparate without a wand 
 
 theres no way out ron said luna watching his fruitless efforts the cellar is completely i tried at first mr ollivander has been here for a long time hes tried everything 
 
 hermione was screaming again the sound went through harry like physical pain barely conscious of the fierce prickling of his scar he too started to run around the cellar feeling the walls for he hardly knew what knowing in his heart that it was useless 
 
 what else did you take what else answer me crucio 
 
 hermiones screams echoed off the walls upstairs ron was half sobbing as he pounded the walls with his fists and harry in utter desperation seized hagrids pouch from around his neck and groped inside it he pulled out dumbledores snitch and shook it hoping for he did not know what c nothing happened c he waved the broken halves of the phoenix wand but they were lifeless c the mirror fragment fell sparkling to the floor and he saw a gleam of brightest blue c 
 
 dumbledores eye was gazing at him out of the mirror 
 
 help us he yelled at it in mad desperation were in the cellar of malfoy manor help us 
 
 the eye blinked and was gone 
 
 harry was not even sure that it had really been there he tilted the shard of mirror this way and that and saw nothing reflected there but the walls and ceiling of their prison and upstairs hermione was screaming worse than ever and next to him ron was bellowing hermione hermione 
 
 how did you get into my vault they heard bellatrix scream did that dirty little goblin in the cellar help you 
 
 we only met him tonight hermione sobbed weve never been inside your vault it isnt the real sword its a copy just a copy 
 
 a copy screeched bellatrix oh a likely story 
 
 but we can find out easily came luciuss voice draco fetch the goblin he can tell us whether the sword is real or not 
 
 harry dashed across the cellar to where griphook was huddled on the floor 
 
 griphook he whispered into the goblins pointed ear you must tell them that swords a fake they mustnt know its the real one griphook please c 
 
 he could hear someone scuttling own the cellar steps next moment dracos shaking voice spoke from behind the door 
 
 stand back line up against the back wall dont try anything or ill kill you 
 
 they did as they were bidden as the lock turned ron clicked the deluminator and the lights whisked back into his pocket restoring the cellars darkness the door flew open malfoy marched inside wand held out in front of him pale and determined he seized the little goblin by the arm and backed out again dragging griphook with him the door slammed shut and at the same moment a loud crack echoed inside the cellar 
 
 ron clicked the deluminator three balls of light flew back into the air from his pocket revealing dobby the who had just apparated into their midst 
 
 dob c 
 
 harry hit ron on the arm to stop him shouting and ron looked terrified at his mistake footsteps crossed the ceiling overhead draco marching griphook to bellatrix 
 
 dobbys enormous shaped eyes were wide he was trembling from his feet to the tips of his ears he was back in the home of his old masters and it was clear that he was petrified 
 
 harry potter he squeaked in the tiniest quiver of a voice dobby has come to rescue you 
 
 but how did you c 
 
 an awful scream drowned harrys words hermione was being tortured again he cut to the essentials 
 
 you can disapparate out of this cellar he asked dobby who nodded his ears flapping 
 
 and you can take humans with you 
 
 dobby nodded again 
 
 right dobby i want you to grab luna dean and mr ollivander and take them c take them to c 
 
 bill and fleurs said ron shell cottage on the outskirts of tinworth 
 
 the elf nodded for a third time 
 
 and then come back said harry can you do that dobby 
 
 of course harry potter whispered the little elf he hurried over to mr ollivander who appeared to be barely conscious he took one of the wandmakers hands in his own then held out the other to luna and dean neither of whom moved 
 
 harry we want to help you luna whispered 
 
 we cant leave you here said dean 
 
 go both of you well see you at bill and fleurs 
 
 as harry spoke his scar burned worse than ever and for a few seconds he looked down not upon the wandmaker but on another man who was just as old just as thin but laughing scornfully 
 
 kill me then voldemort i welcome death but my death will not bring you what you seek there is so much you do not understand 
 
 he felt voldemorts fury but as hermione screamed again he shut it out returning to the cellar and the horror of his own present 
 
 go harry beseeched to luna and dean go well follow just go 
 
 they caught hold of the elfs outstretched fingers there was another loud crack and dobby luna dean and ollivander vanished 
 
 what was that shouted lucius malfoy from over their heads did you hear that what was that noise in the cellar 
 
 harry and ron stared at each other 
 
 draco c no call wormtail make him go and check 
 
 footsteps crossed the room overhead then there was silence harry knew that the people in the drawing room were listening for more noises from the cellar 
 
 were going to have to try and tackle him he whispered to ron they had no choice the moment anyone entered the room and saw the absence of three prisoners they were lost leave the lights on harry added and as they heard someone descending the steps outside the door they backed against the wall on either side of it 
 
 stand back came wormtails voice stand away from the door im coming in 
 
 the door flew open for a split second wormtail gazed into the apparently empty cellar ablaze with light from the three miniature suns floating in midair then harry and ron launched themselves upon him ron seized wormtails wand arm and forced it upwards harry slapped a hand to his mouth muffling his voice silently they struggled wormtails wand emitted sparks his silver hand closed around harrys throat 
 
 what is it wormtail called lucius malfoy from above 
 
 nothing ron called back in a passable imitation of wormtails wheezy voice all fine 
 
 harry could barely breathe 
 
 youre going to kill me harry choked attempting to prise off the metal fingers after i saved your life you owe me wormtail 
 
 the silver fingers slackened harry had not expected it he wrenched himself free astonished keeping his hand over wormtails mouth he saw the ratlike mans small watery eyes widen with fear and surprise he seemed just as shocked as harry at what his hand had done at the tiny merciful impulse it had betrayed and he continued to struggle more powerfully as though to undo that moment of weakness 
 
 and well have that whispered ron tugging wormtails wand from his other hand 
 
 wandless helpless pettigrews pupils dilated in terror his eyes had slid from harrys face to something else his own silver fingers were moving inexorably toward his own throat 
 
 no c 
 
 without pausing to think harry tried to drag back the hand but there was no stopping it the silver tool that voldemort had given his most cowardly servant had turned upon its disarmed and useless owner pettigrew was reaping his reward for his hesitation his moment of pity he was being strangled before their eyes 
 
 no 
 
 ron had released wormtail too and together he and harry tried to pull the crushing metal fingers from around wormtails throat but it was no use pettigrew was turning blue 
 
 relashio said ron pointing the wand at the silver hand but nothing happened pettigrew dropped to his knees and at the same moment hermione gave a dreadful scream from overhead wormtails eyes rolled upward in his purple face he gave a last twitch and was still 
 
 harry and ron looked at each other then leaving wormtails body on the floor behind them ran up the stairs and back into the shadowy passageway leading to the drawing room cautiously they crept along it until they reached the drawing room door which was ajar now they had a clear view of bellatrix looking down at griphook who was holding gryffindors sword in his hands hermione was lying at bellatrixs feet she was barely stirring 
 
 well bellatrix said to griphook is it the true sword 
 
 harry waited holding his breath fighting against the prickling of his scar 
 
 no said griphook it is a fake 
 
 are you sure panted bellatrix quite sure 
 
 yes said the goblin 
 
 relief broke across her face all tension drained from it 
 
 good she said and with a casual flick of her wand she slashed another deep cut into the goblins face and he dropped with a yell at her feet she kicked him aside and now she said in a voice that burst with triumph we call the dark lord 
 
 and she pushed back her sleeve and touched her forefinger to the dark mark 
 
 at once harrys scar felt as though it had split open again his true surroundings vanished he was voldemort and the skeletal wizard before him was laughing toothlessly at him he was enraged at the summons he felt c he had warned them he had told them to summon him for nothing less than potter if they were mistaken 
 
 kill me then demanded the old man you will not win you cannot win that wand will never ever be yours c 
 
 and voldemorts fury broke a burst of green light filled the prison room and the frail old body was lifted from its hard bed and then fell back lifeless and voldemort returned to the window his wrath barely controllable they would suffer his retribution if they had no good reason for calling him back 
 
 and i think said bellatrixs voice we can dispose of the mudblood greyback take her if you want her 
 
 noooooooooooo 
 
 ron had burst into the drawing room bellatrix looked around shocked she turned her wand to face ron instead c 
 
 expelliarmus he roared pointing wormtails wand at bellatrix and hers flew into the air and was caught by harry who had sprinted after ron lucius narcissa draco and greyback wheeled about harry yelled stupefy and lucius malfoy collapsed onto the hearth jets of light flew from dracos narcissas and greybacks wands harry threw himself to the floor rolling behind a sofa to avoid them 
 
 stop or she dies 
 
 panting harry peered around the edge of the sofa bellatrix was supporting hermione who seemed to be unconscious and was holding her short silver knife to hermiones throat 
 
 drop your wands she whispered drop them or well see exactly how filthy her blood is 
 
 ron stood rigid clutching wormtails wand harry straightened up still holding bellatrixs 
 
 i said drop them she screeched pressing the blade into hermiones throat harry saw beads of blood appear there 
 
 all right he shouted and he dropped bellatrixs wand onto the floor at his feet ron did the same with wormtails both raised their hands to shoulder height 
 
 good she leered draco pick them up the dark lord is coming harry potter your death approaches 
 
 harry knew it his scar was bursting with the pain of it and he could feel voldemort flying through the sky from far away over a dark and stormy sea and soon he would be close enough to apparate to them and harry could see no way out 
 
 now said bellatrix softly as draco hurried back to her with the wands cissy i think we ought to tie these little heroes up again while greyback takes care of miss mudblood i am sure the dark lord will not begrudge you the girl greyback after what you have done tonight 
 
 at the last word there was a peculiar grinding noise from above all of them looked upward in time to see the crystal chandelier tremble then with a creak and an ominous jingling it began to fall bellatrix was directly beneath it dropping hermione she threw herself aside with a scream the chandelier crashed to the floor in an explosion of crystal and chains falling on top of hermione and the goblin who still clutched the sword of gryffindor glittering shards of crystal flew in all directions draco doubled over his hands covering his bloody face 
 
 as ron ran to pull hermione out of the wreckage harry took the chance he leapt over an armchair and wrested the three wands from dracos grip pointed all of them at greyback and yelled stupefy the werewolf was lifted off his feet by the triple spell flew up to the ceiling and then smashed to the ground 
 
 as narcissa dragged draco out of the way of further harm bellatrix sprang to her feet her hair flying as she brandished the silver knife but narcissa had directed her wand at the doorway 
 
 dobby she screamed and even bellatrix froze you you dropped the chandelier c 
 
 the tiny elf trotted into the room his shaking finger pointing at his old mistress 
 
 you must not hurt harry potter he squeaked 
 
 kill him cissy shrieked bellatrix but there was another loud crack and narcissas wand too flew into the air and landed on the other side of the room 
 
 you dirty little monkey bawled bellatrix how dare you take a witchs wand how dare you defy your masters 
 
 dobby has no master squealed the elf dobby is a free elf and dobby has come to save harry potter and his friends 
 
 harrys scar was blinding him with pain dimly he knew that they had moments seconds before voldemort was with them 
 
 ron catch c and go he yelled throwing one of the wands to him then he bent down to tug griphook out from under the chandelier hoisting the groaning goblin who still clung to the sword over one shoulder harry seized dobbys hand and spun on the spot to disapparate 
 
 as he turned into darkness he caught one last view of the drawing room of the pale frozen figures of narcissa and draco of the streak of red that was rons hair and a blue of flying silver as bellatrixs knife flew across the room at the place where he was vanishing c 
 
 bill and fleurs shell cottage bill and fleurs 
 
 he had disappeared into the unknown all he could do was repeat the name of the destination and hope that it would suffice to take him there the pain in his forehead pierced him and the weight of the goblin bore down upon him he could feel the blade of gryffindors sword bumping against his back dobbys hand jerked in his he wondered whether the elf was trying to take charge to pull them in the right direction and tried by squeezing the fingers to indicate that that was fine with them 
 
 and then they hit solid earth and smelled salty air harry fell to his knees relinquished dobbys hand and attempted to lower griphook gently to the ground 
 
 are you all right he said as the goblin stirred but griphook merely whimpered 
 
 harry squinted around through the darkness there seemed to be a cottage a short way away under the wide starry sky and he thought he saw movement outside it 
 
 dobby is this shell cottage he whispered clutching the two wands he had brought from the malfoys ready to fight if he needed to have we come to the right place dobby 
 
 he looked around the little elf stood feet from him 
 
 dobby 
 
 the elf swayed slightly stars reflected in his wide shining eyes together he and harry looked down at the silver hilt of the knife protruding from the elfs heaving chest 
 
 dobby c no c help harry bellowed toward the cottage toward the people moving there help 
 
 he did not know or care whether they were wizards or muggles friends or foes all he cared about was that a dark stain was spreading across dobbys front and that he had stretched out his own arms to harry with a look of supplication harry caught him and laid him sideways on the cool grass 
 
 dobby no dont die dont die c 
 
 the elfs eyes found him and his lips trembled with the effort to form words 
 
 harry potter 
 
 and then with a little shudder the elf became quite still and his eyes were nothing more than great glassy orbs sprinkled with light from the stars they could not see 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the deathly hallows 
 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 little tuk 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 yes they called him little tuk but it was not his real name 
 he had called himself so before he could speak plainly and he meant 
 it for charles it was all very well for those who knew him but not 
 for strangers 
 
 little tuk was left at home to take care of his little sister gustava who was much younger than himself and he had to learn his lessons at the same time and the two things could not very well be performed together the poor boy sat there with his sister on his lap and sung to her all the songs he knew and now and then he looked into 
 his geography lesson that lay open before him by the next morning 
 he had to learn by heart all the towns in zealand and all that could be described of them 
 
 his mother came home at last and took little gustava in her arms 
 then tuk ran to the window and read so eagerly that he nearly read 
 his eyes out for it had become darker and darker every minute and 
 his mother had no money to buy a light 
 
 there goes the old washerwoman up the lane said the mother 
 as she looked out of the window the poor woman can hardly drag 
 herself along and now she had to drag a pail of water from the 
 well be a good boy tuk and run across and help the old woman you 
 
 so tuk ran across quickly and helped her but when he came back 
 into the room it was quite dark and there was not a word said about a 
 light so he was obliged to go to bed on his little truckle bedstead and there he lay and thought of his geography lesson and of zealand and of all the master had told him he ought really to have read it over again but he could not for want of light so he put the geography book under his pillow for he had heard that this was a great help towards learning a lesson but not always to be depended upon he still lay thinking and thinking when all at once it seemed as if some one kissed him on his eyes and mouth he slept and 
 yet he did not sleep and it appeared as if the old washerwoman looked at him with kind eyes and said it would be a great pity if you did not know your lesson morning you helped me and now i will help you and providence will always keep those who help 
 themselves and at the same time the book under pillow began to move about cluck cluck cluck cried a hen as she crept towards him i am a hen from kjoge and then she told him how many inhabitants the town contained and about a battle that had been 
 fought there which really was not worth speaking of crack crack down fell something it was a wooden bird the parrot which is used as a target as prastoe he said there were as many inhabitants in that town as he had nails in his body he was very proud and said thorwalsden lived close to me and here i am now quite comfortable 
 
 but now little tuk was no longer in bed all in a moment he 
 found himself on horseback gallop gallop away he went seated in 
 front of a knight with a waving plume who held him on 
 the saddle and so they rode through the wood by the old town of 
 wordingburg which was very large and busy the castle was 
 surrounded by lofty towers and radiant light streamed from all the 
 windows within there were songs and dancing king waldemar and the young ladies of the court were dancing together morning dawned and as the sun rose the whole city and the castle sank suddenly down together one tower after another fell till at last only one remained standing on the hill where the castle had formerly been 
 
 the town now appeared small and poor and the read 
 in their books which they carried under their arms that it contained 
 two thousand inhabitants but this was a mere boast for it did not 
 contain so many 
 
 and again little tuk lay in his bed scarcely knowing whether he 
 was dreaming or not for some one stood by him 
 
 tuk little tuk said a voice it was a very little person who 
 spoke he was dressed as a sailor and looked small enough to be a 
 middy but he was not one i bring you many greetings from corsor it is a rising town full of life it has steamships and in 
 times past they used to call it ugly but that is no longer true i 
 lie on the said corsor i have and 
 i have given birth to a poet who was witty and 
 entertaining which they are not all i once wanted to fit out a 
 ship to sail round the world but i did not accomplish it though most 
 likely i might have done so but i am fragrant with perfume for close 
 to my gates most lovely roses bloom 
 
 then before the eyes of little tuk appeared a confusion of colors 
 red and green but it cleared off and he could distinguish a cliff 
 close to the bay the slopes of which were quite overgrown with 
 verdure and on its summit stood a fine old church with pointed 
 towers springs of water flowed out of the cliff in thick waterspouts 
 so that there was a continual splashing close by sat an old king with 
 a golden crown on his white head this was king hroar of the springs and near the springs stood the town of roeskilde as it is called 
 
 then all the kings and queens of denmark went up the ascent to the old church hand in hand with golden crowns on their heads while the organ played and the fountains sent forth jets of water 
 
 little tuk saw and heard it all forget the names of these towns said king hroar 
 
 all at once everything vanished but where it seemed to him 
 like turning over the leaves of a book and now there stood before him an old peasant woman who had come from soroe where the grass grows in the she had a green linen apron thrown over her head and shoulders and it was quite wet as if it had been raining heavily 
 
 yes that it has said she and then just as she was going to 
 tell him a great many pretty stories from comedies and 
 about waldemar and absalom she suddenly shrunk up together and 
 wagged her head as if she were a frog about to spring croak she 
 cried it is always wet and as quiet as death in soroe then little 
 tuk saw she was changed into a frog croak and again she was an old woman one must dress according to the weather said she it is wet and my town is just like a bottle by the cork we must go in and by the cork we must come out again in olden times i had beautiful fish and now i have fresh boys in the bottom of the bottle and they learn wisdom hebrew and greek 
 
 croak how it sounded like the cry of the frogs on the moor 
 or like the creaking of great boots when some one is marching always the same tone so monotonous and wearing that little tuk at length fell fast asleep and then the sound could not annoy him but even in this sleep came a dream or something like it his little sister 
 gustava with her blue eyes and fair curly hair had grown up a 
 beautiful maiden all at once and without having wings she could 
 fly and they flew together over zealand over green forests and 
 blue lakes 
 
 hark so you hear the cock crow little tuk 
 the fowls are flying out of kjoge you shall have a large 
 you shall never suffer hunger or want the bird of good omen shall 
 be yours and you shall become a rich and happy man your house 
 shall rise up like king towers and shall be richly adorned 
 with marble statues like those at prastoe understand me well your 
 name shall travel with fame round the world like the ship that was 
 to sail from corsor and at roeskilde forget the names of 
 the towns as king hroar said you shall speak well and clearly 
 little tuk and when at last you lie in your grave you shall sleep 
 peacefully as 
 
 as if i lay in soroe said little tuk awaking it was bright 
 daylight and he could not remember his dream but that was not 
 necessary for we are not to know what will happen to us in the 
 future then he sprang out of bed quickly and read over his lesson in 
 the book and knew it all at once quite correctly the old washerwoman put her head in at the door and nodded to him quite kindly and said many thanks you good child for your help yesterday i hope all your beautiful dreams will come true 
 
 little tuk did not at all know what he had dreamt but one above 
 did

 book house in the rue plumet 
 chapter v 
 
 the rose perceives that it is an engine of war 
 one day cosette chanced to look at herself in her mirror and she said to herself 
 really 
 it seemed to her almost that she was pretty 
 this threw her in a singularly troubled state of mind 
 up to that moment she had never thought of her face she saw herself in her mirror but she did not look at herself and then she had so often been told that she was homely jean valjean alone said gently 
 no indeed no indeed at all events cosette had always thought herself homely and had grown up in that belief with the easy resignation of childhood and here all at once was her mirror saying to her as jean valjean had said 
 no indeed 
 that night she did not sleep 
 what if i were pretty she thought 
 how odd it would be if i were pretty and she recalled those of her companions whose beauty had produced a sensation in the convent and she said to herself 
 what 
 am i to be like mademoiselle 
 the next morning she looked at herself again not by accident this time and she was assailed with doubts 
 where did i get such an idea said she no i am ugly 
 she had not slept well that was all her eyes were sunken and she was pale 
 she had not felt very joyous on the preceding evening in the belief that she was beautiful but it made her very sad not to be able to believe in it any longer she did not look at herself again and for more than a fortnight she tried to dress her hair with her back turned to the mirror 
 in the evening after dinner she generally embroidered in wool or did some convent needlework in the and jean valjean read beside her 
 once she raised her eyes from her work and was rendered quite uneasy by the manner in which her father was gazing at her 
 on another occasion she was passing along the street and it seemed to her that some one behind her whom she did not see said 
 a pretty woman but badly dressed bah she thought he does not mean me 
 i am well dressed and ugly 
 she was then wearing a plush hat and her merino gown 
 at last one day when she was in the garden she heard poor old toussaint saying 
 do you notice how pretty cosette is growing sir cosette did not hear her reply but words caused a sort of commotion within her 
 she fled from the garden ran up to her room flew to the was three months since she had looked at gave vent to a cry she had just dazzled herself 
 she was beautiful and lovely she could not help agreeing with toussaint and her mirror 
 her figure was formed her skin had grown white her hair was lustrous an unaccustomed splendor had been lighted in her blue eyes 
 the consciousness of her beauty burst upon her in an instant like the sudden advent of daylight other people noticed it also toussaint had said so it was evidently she of whom the had spoken there could no longer be any doubt of that she descended to the garden again thinking herself a queen imagining that she heard the birds singing though it was winter seeing the sky gilded the sun among the trees flowers in the thickets distracted wild in inexpressible delight 
 jean valjean on his side experienced a deep and undefinable oppression at heart 
 in fact he had for some time past been contemplating with terror that beauty which seemed to grow more radiant every day on sweet face 
 the dawn that was smiling for all was gloomy for him 
 cosette had been beautiful for a tolerably long time before she became aware of it herself 
 but from the very first day that unexpected light which was rising slowly and enveloping the whole of the young person wounded jean sombre eye he felt that it was a change in a happy life a life so happy that he did not dare to move for fear of disarranging something this man who had passed through all manner of distresses who was still all bleeding from the bruises of fate who had been almost wicked and who had become almost a saint who after having dragged the chain of the galleys was now dragging the invisible but heavy chain of indefinite misery this man whom the law had not released from its grasp and who could be seized at any moment and brought back from the obscurity of his virtue to the broad daylight of public opprobrium this man accepted all excused all pardoned all and merely asked of providence of man of the law of society of nature of the world one thing that cosette might love him 
 that cosette might continue to love him 
 that god would not prevent the heart of the child from coming to him and from remaining with him beloved by cosette he felt that he was healed rested appeased loaded with benefits recompensed crowned 
 beloved by cosette it was well with him 
 he asked nothing more 
 had any one said to him 
 do you want anything better he would have answered no god might have said to him 
 do you desire heaven and he would have replied 
 i should lose by it 
 everything which could affect this situation if only on the surface made him shudder like the beginning of something new 
 he had never known very distinctly himself what the beauty of a woman means but he understood instinctively that it was something terrible 
 he gazed with terror on this beauty which was blossoming out ever more triumphant and superb beside him beneath his very eyes on the innocent and formidable brow of that child from the depths of her homeliness of his old age of his misery of his reprobation 
 he said to himself 
 how beautiful she is 
 what is to become of me 
 there moreover lay the difference between his tenderness and the tenderness of a mother 
 what he beheld with anguish a mother would have gazed upon with joy 
 the first symptoms were not long in making their appearance 
 on the very morrow of the day on which she had said to herself decidedly i am beautiful 
 cosette began to pay attention to her toilet 
 she recalled the remark of that pretty but badly dressed the breath of an oracle which had passed beside her and had vanished after depositing in her heart one of the two germs which are destined later on to fill the whole life of woman coquetry 
 love is the other 
 with faith in her beauty the whole feminine soul expanded within her she conceived a horror for her merinos and shame for her plush hat her father had never refused her anything 
 she at once acquired the whole science of the bonnet the gown the mantle the boot the cuff the stuff which is in fashion the color which is becoming that science which makes of the parisian woman something so charming so deep and so dangerous 
 the words heady woman were invented for the parisienne 
 in less than a month little cosette in that thebaid of the rue de babylone was not only one of the prettiest but one of the best dressed women in paris which means a great deal more 
 she would have liked to encounter her to see what he would say and to teach him a lesson 
 the truth is that she was ravishing in every respect and that she distinguished the difference between a bonnet from gerard and one from herbaut in the most marvellous way 
 jean valjean watched these ravages with anxiety 
 he who felt that he could never do anything but crawl walk at the most beheld wings sprouting on cosette 
 moreover from the mere inspection of toilet a woman would have recognized the fact that she had no mother certain little proprieties certain special conventionalities were not observed by cosette 
 a mother for instance would have told her that a young girl does not dress in damask 
 the first day that cosette went out in her black damask gown and mantle and her white crape bonnet she took jean arm gay radiant rosy proud dazzling 
 father she said how do you like me in this guise 
 jean valjean replied in a voice which resembled the bitter voice of an envious man 
 charming 
 he was the same as usual during their walk 
 on their return home he asked cosette 
 you put on that other gown and bonnet know the ones i mean 
 this took place in chamber 
 cosette turned towards the wardrobe where her clothes were hanging 
 that disguise said she 
 father what do you want me to do with it oh no the idea 
 i shall never put on those horrors again with that machine on my head i have the air of madame 
 jean valjean heaved a deep sigh 
 from that moment forth he noticed that cosette who had always heretofore asked to remain at home saying 
 father i enjoy myself more here with you now was always asking to go out 
 in fact what is the use of having a handsome face and a delicious costume if one does not display them 
 he also noticed that cosette had no longer the same taste for the back garden 
 now she preferred the garden and did not dislike to promenade back and forth in front of the railed fence jean valjean who was shy never set foot in the garden he kept to his back yard like a dog 
 cosette in gaining the knowledge that she was beautiful lost the grace of ignoring it 
 an exquisite grace for beauty enhanced by ingenuousness is ineffable and nothing is so adorable as a dazzling and innocent creature who walks along holding in her hand the key to paradise without being conscious of it 
 but what she had lost in ingenuous grace she gained in pensive and serious charm her whole person permeated with the joy of youth of innocence and of beauty breathed forth a splendid melancholy 
 it was at this epoch that marius after the lapse of six months saw her once more at the luxembourg

 in the middle of this fresh tale pierre was summoned to the commander in chief 
 when he entered the private room count rostopchin puckering his face was rubbing his forehead and eyes with his hand a short man was saying something but when pierre entered he stopped speaking and went out 
 ah how do you do great warrior said rostopchin as soon as the short man had left the room we have heard of your prowess but not the point between ourselves mon cher do you belong to the masons he went on severely as though there were something wrong about it which he nevertheless intended to pardon pierre remained silent i am well informed my friend but i am aware that there are masons and masons and i hope that you are not one of those who on pretense of saving mankind wish to ruin russia 
 yes i am a mason pierre replied 
 there you see mon cher i expect you know that messrs speranski and magnitski have been deported to their proper place mr klyucharev has been treated in the same way and so have others who on the plea of building up the temple of solomon have tried to destroy the temple of their fatherland you can understand that there are reasons for this and that i could not have exiled the postmaster had he not been a harmful person it has now come to my knowledge that you lent him your carriage for his removal from town and that you have even accepted papers from him for safe custody i like you and wish you any harm and as you are only half my age i advise you as a father would to cease all communication with men of that stamp and to leave here as soon as possible 
 but what did klyucharev do wrong count asked pierre 
 that is for me to know but not for you to ask shouted rostopchin 
 if he is accused of circulating proclamation it is not proved that he did so said pierre without looking at rostopchin and vereshchagin 
 there we are rostopchin shouted at pierre louder than before frowning suddenly vereshchagin is a renegade and a traitor who will be punished as he deserves said he with the vindictive heat with which people speak when recalling an insult but i did not summon you to discuss my actions but to give you advice or an order if you prefer it i beg you to leave the town and break off all communication with such men as klyucharev and i will knock the nonsense out of anybody but probably realizing that he was shouting at bezukhov who so far was not guilty of anything he added taking hand in a friendly manner we are on the eve of a public disaster and i time to be polite to everybody who has business with me my head is sometimes in a whirl well mon cher what are you doing personally 
 why nothing answered pierre without raising his eyes or changing the thoughtful expression of his face 
 the count frowned 
 a word of friendly advice mon cher be off as soon as you can all i have to tell you happy he who has ears to hear my dear fellow oh by the by he shouted through the doorway after pierre is it true that the countess has fallen into the clutches of the holy fathers of the society of jesus 
 pierre did not answer and left room more sullen and angry than he had ever before shown himself 
 when he reached home it was already getting dark some eight people had come to see him that evening the secretary of a committee the colonel of his battalion his steward his and various petitioners they all had business with pierre and wanted decisions from him pierre did not understand and was not interested in any of these questions and only answered them in order to get rid of these people when left alone at last he opened and read his letter 
 they the soldiers at the battery prince andrew killed that old man simplicity is submission to god suffering is necessary the meaning of all one must harness my wife is getting married one must forget and understand and going to his bed he threw himself on it without undressing and immediately fell asleep 
 when he awoke next morning the came to inform him that a special messenger a police officer had come from count rostopchin to know whether count bezukhov had left or was leaving the town 
 a dozen persons who had business with pierre were awaiting him in the drawing room pierre dressed hurriedly and instead of going to see them went to the back porch and out through the gate 
 from that time till the end of the destruction of moscow no one of household despite all the search they made saw pierre again or knew where he was

 chapter vi 
 
 the battle begun 
 cosette in her shadow like marius in his was all ready to take fire destiny with its mysterious and fatal patience slowly drew together these two beings all charged and all languishing with the stormy electricity of passion these two souls which were laden with love as two clouds are laden with lightning and which were bound to overflow and mingle in a look like the clouds in a flash of fire 
 the glance has been so much abused in love romances that it has finally fallen into disrepute 
 one hardly dares to say nowadays that two beings fell in love because they looked at each other that is the way people do fall in love nevertheless and the only way 
 the rest is nothing but the rest comes afterwards nothing is more real than these great shocks which two souls convey to each other by the exchange of that spark 
 at that particular hour when cosette unconsciously darted that glance which troubled marius marius had no suspicion that he had also launched a look which disturbed cosette 
 he caused her the same good and the same evil 
 she had been in the habit of seeing him for a long time and she had scrutinized him as girls scrutinize and see while looking elsewhere marius still considered cosette ugly when she had already begun to think marius handsome 
 but as he paid no attention to her the young man was nothing to her 
 still she could not refrain from saying to herself that he had beautiful hair beautiful eyes handsome teeth a charming tone of voice when she heard him conversing with his comrades that he held himself badly when he walked if you like but with a grace that was all his own that he did not appear to be at all stupid that his whole person was noble gentle simple proud and that in short though he seemed to be poor yet his air was fine 
 on the day when their eyes met at last and said to each other those first obscure and ineffable things which the glance lisps cosette did not immediately understand 
 she returned thoughtfully to the house in the rue de where jean valjean according to his custom had come to spend six weeks 
 the next morning on waking she thought of that strange young man so long indifferent and icy who now seemed to pay attention to her and it did not appear to her that this attention was the least in the world agreeable to her she was on the contrary somewhat incensed at this handsome and disdainful individual 
 a substratum of war stirred within her it struck her and the idea caused her a wholly childish joy that she was going to take her revenge at last 
 knowing that she was beautiful she was thoroughly conscious though in an indistinct fashion that she possessed a weapon women play with their beauty as children do with a knife they wound themselves 
 the reader will recall marius hesitations his palpitations his terrors 
 he remained on his bench and did not approach this vexed cosette 
 one day she said to jean valjean father let us stroll about a little in that direction seeing that marius did not come to her she went to him 
 in such cases all women resemble mahomet 
 and then strange to say the first symptom of true love in a young man is timidity in a young girl it is boldness 
 this is surprising and yet nothing is more simple it is the two sexes tending to approach each other and assuming each the qualities 
 that day glance drove marius beside himself and marius glance set cosette to trembling 
 marius went away confident and cosette uneasy 
 from that day forth they adored each other 
 the first thing that cosette felt was a confused and profound melancholy it seemed to her that her soul had become black since the day before she no longer recognized it 
 the whiteness of soul in young girls which is composed of coldness and gayety resembles snow 
 it melts in love which is its sun 
 cosette did not know what love was 
 she had never heard the word uttered in its terrestrial sense 
 on the books of profane music which entered the convent amour love was replaced by tambour drum or pandour 
 this created enigmas which exercised the imaginations of the big girls such as 
 ah how delightful is the drum or pity is not a pandour 
 but cosette had left the convent too early to have occupied herself much with the drum 
 therefore she did not know what name to give to what she now felt 
 is any one the less ill because one does not know the name of malady 
 she loved with all the more passion because she loved ignorantly she did not know whether it was a good thing or a bad thing useful or dangerous eternal or temporary allowable or prohibited she loved 
 she would have been greatly astonished had any one said to her 
 you do not sleep 
 but that is forbidden you do not eat 
 why that is very bad 
 you have oppressions and palpitations of the heart 
 that must not be 
 you blush and turn pale when a certain being clad in black appears at the end of a certain green walk 
 but that is abominable she would not have understood and she would have replied what fault is there of mine in a matter in which i have no power and of which i know nothing 
 it turned out that the love which presented itself was exactly suited to the state of her soul 
 it was a sort of admiration at a distance a mute contemplation the deification of a stranger it was the apparition of youth to youth the dream of nights become a reality yet remaining a dream the phantom realized and made flesh at last but having as yet neither name nor fault nor spot nor exigence nor defect in a word the distant lover who lingered in the ideal a chimaera with a form any nearer and more palpable meeting would have alarmed cosette at this first stage when she was still half immersed in the exaggerated mists of the cloister 
 she had all the fears of children and all the fears of nuns combined 
 the spirit of the convent with which she had been permeated for the space of five years was still in the process of slow evaporation from her person and made everything tremble around her 
 in this situation he was not a lover he was not even an admirer he was a vision she set herself to adoring marius as something charming luminous and impossible 
 as extreme innocence borders on extreme coquetry she smiled at him with all frankness 
 every day she looked forward to the hour for their walk with impatience she found marius there she felt herself unspeakably happy and thought in all sincerity that she was expressing her whole thought when she said to jean valjean 
 what a delicious garden that luxembourg is 
 marius and cosette were in the dark as to one another 
 they did not address each other they did not salute each other they did not know each other they saw each other and like stars of heaven which are separated by millions of leagues they lived by gazing at each other 
 it was thus that cosette gradually became a woman and developed beautiful and loving with a consciousness of her beauty and in ignorance of her love 
 she was a coquette to boot through her ignorance

 chapter xii 
 
 the rostovs remained in moscow till the first of september that is till the eve of the entry into the city 
 after petya had joined regiment of cossacks and left for belaya tserkov where that regiment was forming the countess was seized with terror the thought that both her sons were at the war had both gone from under her wing that today or tomorrow either or both of them might be killed like the three sons of one of her acquaintances struck her that summer for the first time with cruel clearness she tried to get nicholas back and wished to go herself to join petya or to get him an appointment somewhere in petersburg but neither of these proved possible petya could not return unless his regiment did so or unless he was transferred to another regiment on active service nicholas was somewhere with the army and had not sent a word since his last letter in which he had given a detailed account of his meeting with princess mary the countess did not sleep at night or when she did fall asleep dreamed that she saw her sons lying dead after many consultations and conversations the count at last devised means to tranquillize her he got petya transferred from regiment to which was in training near moscow though petya would remain in the service this transfer would give the countess the consolation of seeing at least one of her sons under her wing and she hoped to arrange matters for her petya so as not to let him go again but always get him appointed to places where he could not possibly take part in a battle as long as nicholas alone was in danger the countess imagined that she loved her more than all her other children and even reproached herself for it but when her youngest the scapegrace who had been bad at lessons was always breaking things in the house and making himself a nuisance to everybody that petya with his merry black eyes and fresh rosy cheeks where soft down was just beginning to show when he was thrown amid those big dreadful cruel men who were fighting somewhere about something and apparently finding pleasure in it then his mother thought she loved him more much more than all her other children the nearer the time came for petya to return the more uneasy grew the countess she began to think she would never live to see such happiness the presence of sonya of her beloved natasha or even of her husband irritated her what do i want with them i want no one but petya she thought 
 at the end of august the rostovs received another letter from nicholas he wrote from the province of voronezh where he had been sent to procure remounts but that letter did not set the countess at ease knowing that one son was out of danger she became the more anxious about petya 
 though by the twentieth of august nearly all the rostovs acquaintances had left moscow and though everybody tried to persuade the countess to get away as quickly as possible she would not bear of leaving before her treasure her adored petya returned on the of august he arrived the passionate tenderness with which his mother received him did not please the officer though she concealed from him her intention of keeping him under her wing petya guessed her designs and instinctively fearing that he might give way to emotion when with her might become womanish as he termed it to himself he treated her coldly avoided her and during his stay in moscow attached himself exclusively to natasha for whom he had always had a particularly brotherly tenderness almost 
 owing to the customary carelessness nothing was ready for their departure by the of august and the carts that were to come from their ryazan and moscow estates to remove their household belongings did not arrive till the thirtieth 
 from the till the all moscow was in a bustle and commotion every day thousands of men wounded at borodino were brought in by the dorogomilov gate and taken to various parts of moscow and thousands of carts conveyed the inhabitants and their possessions out by the other gates in spite of broadsheets or because of them or independently of them the strangest and most contradictory rumors were current in the town some said that no one was to be allowed to leave the city others on the contrary said that all the icons had been taken out of the churches and everybody was to be ordered to leave some said there had been another battle after borodino at which the french had been routed while others on the contrary reported that the russian army bad been destroyed some talked about the moscow militia which preceded by the clergy would go to the three hills others whispered that augustin had been forbidden to leave that traitors had been seized that the peasants were rioting and robbing people on their way from moscow and so on but all this was only talk in reality though the council of fili at which it was decided to abandon moscow had not yet been held both those who went away and those who remained behind felt though they did not show it that moscow would certainly be abandoned and that they ought to get away as quickly as possible and save their belongings it was felt that everything would suddenly break up and change but up to the first of september nothing had done so as a criminal who is being led to execution knows that he must die immediately but yet looks about him and straightens the cap that is awry on his head so moscow involuntarily continued its wonted life though it knew that the time of its destruction was near when the conditions of life to which its people were accustomed to submit would be completely upset 
 during the three days preceding the occupation of moscow the whole rostov family was absorbed in various activities the head of the family count ilya rostov continually drove about the city collecting the current rumors from all sides and gave superficial and hasty orders at home about the preparations for their departure 
 the countess watched the things being packed was dissatisfied with everything was constantly in pursuit of petya who was always running away from her and was jealous of natasha with whom he spent all his time sonya alone directed the practical side of matters by getting things packed but of late sonya had been particularly sad and silent nicholas letter in which he mentioned princess mary had elicited in her presence joyous comments from the countess who saw an intervention of providence in this meeting of the princess and nicholas 
 i was never pleased at engagement to natasha said the countess but i always wanted nicholas to marry the princess and had a presentiment that it would happen what a good thing it would be 
 sonya felt that this was true that the only possibility of retrieving the rostovs affairs was by nicholas marrying a rich woman and that the princess was a good match it was very bitter for her but despite her grief or perhaps just because of it she took on herself all the difficult work of directing the storing and packing of their things and was busy for whole days the count and countess turned to her when they had any orders to give petya and natasha on the contrary far from helping their parents were generally a nuisance and a hindrance to everyone almost all day long the house resounded with their running feet their cries and their spontaneous laughter they laughed and were gay not because there was any reason to laugh but because gaiety and mirth were in their hearts and so everything that happened was a cause for gaiety and laughter to them petya was in high spirits because having left home a boy he had returned as everybody told him a fine young man because he was at home because he had left belaya tserkov where there was no hope of soon taking part in a battle and had come to moscow where there was to be fighting in a few days and chiefly because natasha whose lead he always followed was in high spirits natasha was gay because she had been sad too long and now nothing reminded her of the cause of her sadness and because she was feeling well she was also happy because she had someone to adore her the adoration of others was a lubricant the wheels of her machine needed to make them run freely and petya adored her above all they were gay because there was a war near moscow there would be fighting at the town gates arms were being given out everybody was escaping going away somewhere and in general something extraordinary was happening and that is always exciting especially to the young

 chapter vii 
 
 to one sadness oppose a sadness and a half 
 all situations have their instincts 
 old and eternal mother nature warned jean valjean in a dim way of the presence of marius jean valjean shuddered to the very bottom of his soul 
 jean valjean saw nothing knew nothing and yet he scanned with obstinate attention the darkness in which he walked as though he felt on one side of him something in process of construction and on the other something which was crumbling away 
 marius also warned and in accordance with the deep law of god by that same mother nature did all he could to keep out of sight of the father 
 nevertheless it came to pass that jean valjean sometimes espied him 
 marius manners were no longer in the least natural 
 he exhibited ambiguous prudence and awkward daring 
 he no longer came quite close to them as formerly he seated himself at a distance and pretended to be reading why did he pretend that 
 formerly he had come in his old coat now he wore his new one every day jean valjean was not sure that he did not have his hair curled his eyes were very queer he wore gloves in short jean valjean cordially detested this young man 
 cosette allowed nothing to be divined 
 without knowing just what was the matter with her she was convinced that there was something in it and that it must be concealed 
 there was a coincidence between the taste for the toilet which had recently come to cosette and the habit of new clothes developed by that stranger which was very repugnant to jean valjean 
 it might be accidental no doubt certainly but it was a menacing accident 
 he never opened his mouth to cosette about this stranger 
 one day however he could not refrain from so doing and with that vague despair which suddenly casts the lead into the depths of its despair he said to her 
 what a very pedantic air that young man has 
 cosette but a year before only an indifferent little girl would have replied 
 why no he is charming 
 ten years later with the love of marius in her heart she would have answered a pedant and insufferable to the sight 
 you are right at the moment in life and the heart which she had then attained she contented herself with replying with supreme calmness that young man 
 as though she now beheld him for the first time in her life 
 how stupid i am thought jean valjean 
 she had not noticed him it is i who have pointed him out to her 
 oh simplicity of the old oh the depth of children 
 it is one of the laws of those fresh years of suffering and trouble of those vivacious conflicts between a first love and the first obstacles that the young girl does not allow herself to be caught in any trap whatever and that the young man falls into every one jean valjean had instituted an undeclared war against marius which marius with the sublime stupidity of his passion and his age did not divine 
 jean valjean laid a host of ambushes for him he changed his hour he changed his bench he forgot his handkerchief he came alone to the luxembourg marius dashed headlong into all these snares and to all the interrogation marks planted by jean valjean in his pathway he ingenuously answered yes but cosette remained immured in her apparent unconcern and in her imperturbable tranquillity so that jean valjean arrived at the following conclusion 
 that ninny is madly in love with cosette but cosette does not even know that he exists 
 none the less did he bear in his heart a mournful tremor the minute when cosette would love might strike at any moment does not everything begin with indifference 
 only once did cosette make a mistake and alarm him 
 he rose from his seat to depart after a stay of three hours and she said what already 
 jean valjean had not discontinued his trips to the luxembourg as he did not wish to do anything out of the way and as above all things he feared to arouse cosette but during the hours which were so sweet to the lovers while cosette was sending her smile to the intoxicated marius who perceived nothing else now and who now saw nothing in all the world but an adored and radiant face jean valjean was fixing on marius flashing and terrible eyes 
 he who had finally come to believe himself incapable of a malevolent feeling experienced moments when marius was present in which he thought he was becoming savage and ferocious once more and he felt the old depths of his soul which had formerly contained so much wrath opening once more and rising up against that young man 
 it almost seemed to him that unknown craters were forming in his bosom 
 what he was there that creature 
 what was he there for he came creeping about smelling out examining trying he came saying 
 hey 
 why not 
 he came to prowl about his jean life to prowl about his happiness with the purpose of seizing it and bearing it away 
 jean valjean added 
 yes it 
 what is he in search of an adventure 
 what does he want 
 a love affair 
 a love affair and i 
 what 
 i have been first the most wretched of men and then the most unhappy and i have traversed sixty years of life on my knees i have suffered everything that man can suffer i have grown old without having been young i have lived without a family without relatives without friends without life without children i have left my blood on every stone on every bramble on every along every wall i have been gentle though others have been hard to me and kind although others have been malicious i have become an honest man once more in spite of everything i have repented of the evil that i have done and have forgiven the evil that has been done to me and at the moment when i receive my recompense at the moment when it is all over at the moment when i am just touching the goal at the moment when i have what i desire it is well it is good i have paid i have earned it all this is to take flight all this will vanish and i shall lose cosette and i shall lose my life my joy my soul because it has pleased a great booby to come and lounge at the luxembourg 
 then his eyes were filled with a sad and extraordinary gleam 
 it was no longer a man gazing at a man it was no longer an enemy surveying an enemy 
 it was a dog scanning a thief 
 the reader knows the rest 
 marius pursued his senseless course one day he followed cosette to the rue de another day he spoke to the porter 
 the porter on his side spoke and said to jean valjean 
 monsieur who is that curious young man who is asking for you 
 on the morrow jean valjean bestowed on marius that glance which marius at last perceived 
 a week later jean valjean had taken his departure 
 he swore to himself that he would never again set foot either in the luxembourg or in the rue de he returned to the rue plumet 
 cosette did not complain she said nothing she asked no questions she did not seek to learn his reasons she had already reached the point where she was afraid of being divined and of betraying herself jean valjean had no experience of these miseries the only miseries which are charming and the only ones with which he was not acquainted the consequence was that he did not understand the grave significance of silence 
 he merely noticed that she had grown sad and he grew gloomy on his side and on hers inexperience had joined issue 
 once he made a trial 
 he asked cosette 
 would you like to come to the luxembourg 
 a ray illuminated pale face 
 yes said she 
 they went thither 
 three months had elapsed 
 marius no longer went there 
 marius was not there 
 on the following day jean valjean asked cosette again 
 would you like to come to the luxembourg 
 she replied sadly and gently 
 no 
 jean valjean was hurt by this sadness and at this gentleness 
 what was going on in that mind which was so young and yet already so impenetrable 
 what was on its way there within 
 what was taking place in soul 
 sometimes instead of going to bed jean valjean remained seated on his pallet with his head in his hands and he passed whole nights asking himself 
 what has cosette in her mind and in thinking of the things that she might be thinking about 
 oh at such moments what mournful glances did he cast towards that cloister that chaste peak that abode of angels that inaccessible glacier of virtue 
 how he contemplated with despairing ecstasy that convent garden full of ignored flowers and cloistered virgins where all perfumes and all souls mount straight to heaven how he adored that eden forever closed against him whence he had voluntarily and madly emerged 
 how he regretted his abnegation and his folly in having brought cosette back into the world poor hero of sacrifice seized and hurled to the earth by his very how he said to himself what have i done 
 however nothing of all this was perceptible to cosette no no harshness 
 his face was always serene and kind jean manners were more tender and more paternal than ever if anything could have betrayed his lack of joy it was his increased suavity 
 on her side cosette languished 
 she suffered from the absence of marius as she had rejoiced in his presence peculiarly without exactly being conscious of it 
 when jean valjean ceased to take her on their customary strolls a feminine instinct murmured confusedly at the bottom of her heart that she must not seem to set store on the luxembourg garden and that if this proved to be a matter of indifference to her her father would take her thither once more but days weeks months elapsed 
 jean valjean had tacitly accepted tacit consent 
 she regretted it 
 it was too late so marius had disappeared all was over 
 the day on which she returned to the luxembourg marius was no longer there 
 what was to be done should she ever find him again 
 she felt an anguish at her heart which nothing relieved and which augmented every day she no longer knew whether it was winter or summer whether it was raining or shining whether the birds were singing whether it was the season for dahlias or daisies whether the luxembourg was more charming than the tuileries whether the linen which the laundress brought home was starched too much or not enough whether toussaint had 
 done her marketing well or ill and she remained dejected absorbed attentive to but a single thought her eyes vague and staring as when one gazes by night at a black and fathomless spot where an apparition has vanished 
 however she did not allow jean valjean to perceive anything of this except her pallor 
 she still wore her sweet face for him 
 this pallor sufficed but too thoroughly to trouble jean valjean sometimes he asked her 
 what is the matter with you 
 she replied 
 there is nothing the matter with me 
 and after a silence when she divined that he was sad also she would add 
 and you there anything wrong with you 
 with me 
 nothing said he 
 these two beings who had loved each other so exclusively and with so touching an affection and who had lived so long for each other now suffered side by side each on the account without acknowledging it to each other without anger towards each other and with a smile

 chapter xiii 
 
 on saturday the of august everything in the rostovs house seemed all the doors were open all the furniture was being carried out or moved about and the mirrors and pictures had been taken down there were trunks in the rooms and hay wrapping paper and ropes were scattered about the peasants and house serfs carrying out the things were treading heavily on the parquet floors the yard was crowded with peasant carts some loaded high and already corded up others still empty 
 the voices and footsteps of the many servants and of the peasants who had come with the carts resounded as they shouted to one another in the yard and in the house the count bad been out since morning the countess had a headache brought on by all the noise and turmoil and was lying down in the new sitting room with a vinegar compress on her head petya was not at home he had gone to visit a friend with whom he meant to obtain a transfer from the militia to the active army sonya was in the ballroom looking after the packing of the glass and china natasha was sitting on the floor of her dismantled room with dresses ribbons and scarves strewn all about her gazing fixedly at the floor and holding in her hands the old ball dress already out of fashion which she had worn at her first petersburg ball 
 natasha was ashamed of doing nothing when everyone else was so busy and several times that morning had tried to set to work but her heart was not in it and she could not and did not know how to do anything except with all her heart and all her might for a while she had stood beside sonya while the china was being packed and tried to help but soon gave it up and went to her room to pack her own things at first she found it amusing to give away dresses and ribbons to the maids but when that was done and what was left had still to be packed she found it dull 
 dunyasha you pack you will you dear and when dunyasha willingly promised to do it all for her natasha sat down on the floor took her old ball dress and fell into a reverie quite unrelated to what ought to have occupied her thoughts now she was roused from her reverie by the talk of the maids in the next room which was theirs and by the sound of their hurried footsteps going to the back porch natasha got up and looked out of the window an enormously long row of carts full of wounded men had stopped in the street 
 the housekeeper the old nurse the cooks coachmen maids footmen postilions and scullions stood at the gate staring at the wounded 
 natasha throwing a clean pocket handkerchief over her hair and holding an end of it in each hand went out into the street 
 the former housekeeper old mavra kuzminichna had stepped out of the crowd by the gate gone up to a cart with a hood constructed of bast mats and was speaking to a pale young officer who lay inside natasha moved a few steps forward and stopped shyly still holding her handkerchief and listened to what the housekeeper was saying 
 then you have nobody in moscow she was saying you would be more comfortable somewhere in a house in ours for instance the family are leaving 
 i know if it would be allowed replied the officer in a weak voice here is our commanding officer ask him and he pointed to a stout major who was walking back along the street past the row of carts 
 natasha glanced with frightened eyes at the face of the wounded officer and at once went to meet the major 
 may the wounded men stay in our house she asked 
 the major raised his hand to his cap with a smile 
 which one do you want said he screwing up his eyes and smiling 
 natasha quietly repeated her question and her face and whole manner were so serious though she was still holding the ends of her handkerchief that the major ceased smiling and after some reflection as if considering in how far the thing was possible replied in the affirmative 
 oh yes why not they may he said 
 with a slight inclination of her head natasha stepped back quickly to mavra kuzminichna who stood talking compassionately to the officer 
 they may he says they may whispered natasha 
 the cart in which the officer lay was turned into the rostovs yard and dozens of carts with wounded men began at the invitation of the townsfolk to turn into the yards and to draw up at the entrances of the houses in povarskaya street natasha was evidently pleased to be dealing with new people outside the ordinary routine of her life she and mavra kuzminichna tried to get as many of the wounded as possible into their yard 
 your papa must be told though said mavra kuzminichna 
 never mind never mind what does it matter for one day we can move into the drawing room they can have all our half of the house 
 there now young lady you do take things into your head even if we put them into the wing the room or the room we must ask permission 
 well ask 
 natasha ran into the house and went on tiptoe through the door into the sitting room where there was a smell of vinegar and drops 
 are you asleep mamma 
 oh what sleep said the countess waking up just as she was dropping into a doze 
 mamma darling said natasha kneeling by her mother and bringing her face close to her i am sorry forgive me never do it again i woke you up mavra kuzminichna has sent me they have brought some wounded here officers will you let them come they have nowhere to go i knew let them come she said quickly all in one breath 
 what officers whom have they brought i understand anything about it said the countess 
 natasha laughed and the countess too smiled slightly 
 i knew give permission so tell them and having kissed her mother natasha got up and went to the door 
 in the hall she met her father who had returned with bad news 
 stayed too long said the count with involuntary vexation the club is closed and the police are leaving 
 papa is it all right invited some of the wounded into the house said natasha 
 of course it is he answered absently not the point i beg you not to indulge in trifles now but to help to pack and tomorrow we must go go go 
 and the count gave a similar order to the and the servants 
 at dinner petya having returned home told them the news he had heard he said the people had been getting arms in the kremlin and that though broadsheet had said that he would sound a call two or three days in advance the order had certainly already been given for everyone to go armed to the three hills tomorrow and that there would be a big battle there 
 the countess looked with timid horror at her eager excited face as he said this she realized that if she said a word about his not going to the battle she knew he enjoyed the thought of the impending engagement he would say something about men honor and the fatherland something senseless masculine and obstinate which there would be no contradicting and her plans would be spoiled and so hoping to arrange to leave before then and take petya with her as their protector and defender she did not answer him but after dinner called the count aside and implored him with tears to take her away quickly that very night if possible with a involuntary loving cunning she who till then had not shown any alarm said that she would die of fright if they did not leave that very night without any pretense she was now afraid of everything

 book house in the rue plumet 
 chapter viii 
 
 the 
 jean valjean was the more unhappy of the two 
 youth even in its sorrows always possesses its own peculiar radiance 
 at times jean valjean suffered so greatly that he became puerile it is the property of grief to cause the childish side of man to reappear 
 he had an unconquerable conviction that cosette was escaping from him 
 he would have liked to resist to retain her to arouse her enthusiasm by some external and brilliant matter these ideas puerile as we have just said and at the same time senile conveyed to him by their very childishness a tolerably just notion of the influence of gold lace on the imaginations of young girls he once chanced to see a general on horseback in full uniform pass along the street comte coutard the commandant of paris he envied that gilded man what happiness it would be he said to himself if he could put on that suit which was an incontestable thing and if cosette could behold him thus she would be dazzled and when he had cosette on his arm and passed the gates of the tuileries the guard would present arms to him and that would suffice for cosette and would dispel her idea of looking at young men 
 an unforeseen shock was added to these sad reflections 
 in the isolated life which they led and since they had come to dwell in the rue plumet they had contracted one habit they sometimes took a pleasure trip to see the sun rise a mild species of enjoyment which befits those who are entering life and those who are quitting it 
 for those who love solitude a walk in the early morning is equivalent to a stroll by night with the cheerfulness of nature added the streets are deserted and the birds are singing 
 cosette a bird herself liked to rise early 
 these matutinal excursions were planned on the preceding evening 
 he proposed and she agreed it was arranged like a plot they set out before daybreak and these trips were so many small delights for cosette these innocent eccentricities please young people 
 jean inclination led him as we have seen to the least frequented spots to solitary nooks to forgotten places there then existed in the vicinity of the barriers of paris a sort of poor meadows which were almost confounded with the city where grew in summer sickly grain and which in autumn after the harvest had been gathered presented the appearance not of having been reaped but peeled 
 jean valjean loved to haunt these fields 
 cosette was not bored there 
 it meant solitude to him and liberty to her 
 there she became a little girl once more she could run and almost play she took off her hat laid it on jean knees and gathered bunches of flowers she gazed at the butterflies on the flowers but did not catch them gentleness and tenderness are born with love and the young girl who cherishes within her breast a trembling and fragile ideal has mercy on the wing of a butterfly 
 she wove garlands of poppies which she placed on her head and which crossed and penetrated with sunlight glowing until they flamed formed for her rosy face a crown of burning embers 
 even after their life had grown sad they kept up their custom of early strolls 
 one morning in october therefore tempted by the serene perfection of the autumn of they set out and found themselves at break of day near the barriere du maine 
 it was not dawn it was daybreak a delightful and stern moment 
 a few constellations here and there in the deep pale azure the earth all black the heavens all white a quiver amid the blades of grass everywhere the mysterious chill of twilight 
 a lark which seemed mingled with the stars was carolling at a prodigious height and one would have declared that that hymn of pettiness calmed immensity 
 in the east the projected its dark mass on the clear horizon with the sharpness of steel venus dazzlingly brilliant was rising behind that dome and had the air of a soul making its escape from a gloomy edifice 
 all was peace and silence there was no one on the road a few stray laborers of whom they caught barely a glimpse were on their way to their work along the 
 jean valjean was sitting in a on some planks deposited at the gate of a his face was turned towards the highway his back towards the light he had forgotten the sun which was on the point of rising he had sunk into one of those profound absorptions in which the mind becomes concentrated which imprison even the eye and which are equivalent to four walls 
 there are meditations which may be called vertical when one is at the bottom of them time is required to return to earth 
 jean valjean had plunged into one of these reveries 
 he was thinking of cosette of the happiness that was possible if nothing came between him and her of the light with which she filled his life a light which was but the emanation of her soul 
 he was almost happy in his revery 
 cosette who was standing beside him was gazing at the clouds as they turned rosy 
 all at once cosette exclaimed 
 father i should think some one was coming yonder 
 jean valjean raised his eyes 
 cosette was right 
 the causeway which leads to the ancient barriere du maine is a prolongation as the reader knows of the rue de sevres and is cut at right angles by the inner boulevard at the elbow of the causeway and the boulevard at the spot where it branches they heard a noise which it was difficult to account for at that hour and a sort of confused pile made its appearance some shapeless thing which was coming from the boulevard was turning into the road 
 it grew larger it seemed to move in an orderly manner though it was bristling and quivering it seemed to be a vehicle but its load could not be distinctly made out 
 there were horses wheels shouts whips were cracking 
 by degrees the outlines became fixed although bathed in shadows 
 it was a vehicle in fact which had just turned from the boulevard into the highway and which was directing its course towards the barrier near which sat jean valjean a second of the same aspect followed then a third then a fourth seven chariots made their appearance in succession the heads of the horses touching the rear of the wagon in front figures were moving on these vehicles flashes were visible through the dusk as though there were naked swords there a clanking became audible which resembled the rattling of chains and as this something advanced the sound of voices waxed louder and it turned into a terrible thing such as emerges from the cave of dreams 
 as it drew nearer it assumed a form and was outlined behind the trees with the pallid hue of an apparition the mass grew white the day which was slowly dawning cast a wan light on this swarming heap which was at once both sepulchral and living the heads of the figures turned into the faces of corpses and this is what it proved to be 
 seven wagons were driving in a file along the road 
 the first six were singularly constructed 
 they resembled coopers drays they consisted of long ladders placed on two wheels and forming barrows at their rear extremities 
 each dray or rather let us say each ladder was attached to four horses harnessed tandem on these ladders strange clusters of men were being drawn in the faint light these men were to be divined rather than seen on each vehicle twelve on a side back to back facing the their legs dangling in the was the manner in which these men were travelling and behind their backs they had something which clanked and which was a chain and on their necks something which shone and which was an iron collar each man had his collar but the chain was for all so that if these four and twenty men had occasion to alight from the dray and walk they were seized with a sort of inexorable unity and were obliged to wind over the ground with the chain for a backbone somewhat after the fashion of millepeds 
 in the back and front of each vehicle two men armed with muskets stood erect each holding one end of the chain under his foot 
 the iron necklets were square the seventh vehicle a huge baggage wagon without a hood had four wheels and six horses and carried a sonorous pile of iron boilers pots braziers and chains among which were mingled several men who were pinioned and stretched at full length and who seemed to be ill 
 this wagon all was garnished with dilapidated hurdles which appeared to have served for former punishments 
 these vehicles kept to the middle of the road on each side marched a double hedge of guards of infamous aspect wearing hats like the soldiers under the directory shabby covered with spots and holes muffled in uniforms of veterans and the trousers of undertakers men half gray half blue which were almost hanging in rags with red epaulets yellow shoulder belts short sabres muskets and cudgels they were a species of these myrmidons seemed composed of the abjectness of the beggar and the authority of the executioner the one who appeared to be their chief held a whip in his hand 
 all these details blurred by the dimness of dawn became more and more clearly outlined as the light increased at the head and in the rear of the convoy rode mounted gendarmes serious and with sword in fist 
 this procession was so long that when the first vehicle reached the barrier the last was barely debauching from the boulevard a throng sprung it is impossible to say whence and formed in a twinkling as is frequently the case in paris pressed forward from both sides of the road and looked on 
 in the neighboring lanes the shouts of people calling to each other and the wooden shoes of hastening up to gaze were audible 
 the men massed upon the drays allowed themselves to be jolted along in silence 
 they were livid with the chill of morning they all wore linen trousers and their bare feet were thrust into wooden shoes 
 the rest of their costume was a fantasy of wretchedness their accoutrements were horribly incongruous nothing is more funereal than the harlequin in rags 
 battered felt hats tarpaulin caps hideous woollen nightcaps and side by side with a short blouse a black coat broken at the elbow many wore headgear others had baskets on their heads hairy breasts were visible and through the rent in their garments tattooed designs could be descried temples of love flaming hearts cupids eruptions and unhealthy red blotches could also be seen 
 two or three had a straw rope attached to the of the dray and suspended under them like a stirrup which supported their feet 
 one of them held in his hand and raised to his mouth something which had the appearance of a black stone and which he seemed to be gnawing it was bread which he was eating there were no eyes there which were not either dry dulled or flaming with an evil light 
 the escort troop cursed the men in chains did not utter a syllable from time to time the sound of a blow became audible as the cudgels descended on or skulls some of these men were yawning their rags were terrible their feet hung down their shoulders oscillated their heads clashed together their fetters clanked their eyes glared ferociously their fists clenched or fell open inertly like the hands of corpses in the rear of the convoy ran a band of children screaming with laughter 
 this file of vehicles whatever its nature was was mournful it was evident that that an hour hence a pouring rain might descend that it might be followed by another and another and that their dilapidated garments would be drenched that once soaked these men would not get dry again that once chilled they would not again get warm that their linen trousers would be glued to their bones by the downpour that the water would fill their shoes that no lashes from the whips would be able to prevent their jaws from chattering that the chain would continue to bind them by the neck that their legs would continue to dangle and it was impossible not to shudder at the sight of these human beings thus bound and passive beneath the cold clouds of autumn and delivered over to the rain to the blast to all the furies of the air like trees and stones 
 blows from the cudgel were not omitted even in the case of the sick men who lay there knotted with ropes and motionless on the seventh wagon and who appeared to have been tossed there like sacks filled with misery 
 suddenly the sun made its appearance the immense light of the orient burst forth and one would have said that it had set fire to all those ferocious heads 
 their tongues were unloosed a conflagration of grins oaths and songs exploded 
 the broad horizontal sheet of light severed the file in two parts illuminating heads and bodies leaving feet and wheels in the obscurity 
 thoughts made their appearance on these faces it was a terrible moment visible demons with their masks removed fierce souls laid bare 
 though lighted up this wild throng remained in gloom 
 some who were gay had in their mouths quills through which they blew vermin over the crowd picking out the women the dawn accentuated these lamentable profiles with the blackness of its shadows there was not one of these creatures who was not deformed by reason of wretchedness and the whole was so monstrous that one would have said that the brilliancy had been changed into the glare of the lightning the which headed the line had struck up a song and were shouting at the top of their voices with a haggard joviality a potpourri by desaugiers then famous called the vestal the trees shivered mournfully in the countenances of bourgeois listened in an idiotic delight to these coarse strains droned by spectres 
 all sorts of distress met in this procession as in chaos here were to be found the facial angles of every sort of beast old men youths bald heads gray beards cynical monstrosities sour resignation savage grins senseless attitudes snouts surmounted by caps heads like those of young girls with corkscrew curls on the temples infantile visages and by reason of that horrible thin skeleton faces to which death alone was lacking 
 on the first cart was a negro who had been a slave in all probability and who could make a comparison of his chains 
 the frightful leveller from below shame had passed over these brows at that degree of abasement the last transformations were suffered by all in their extremest depths and ignorance converted into dulness was the equal of intelligence converted into despair 
 there was no choice possible between these men who appeared to the eye as the flower of the mud it was evident that the person who had had the ordering of that unclean procession had not classified them 
 these beings had been fettered and coupled in alphabetical disorder probably and loaded on those carts 
 nevertheless horrors when grouped together always end by evolving a result all additions of wretched men give a sum total each chain exhaled a common soul and each had its own physiognomy 
 by the side of the one where they were singing there was one where they were howling a third where they were begging one could be seen in which they were gnashing their teeth another load menaced the spectators another blasphemed god the last was as silent as the tomb dante would have thought that he beheld his seven circles of hell on the march 
 the march of the damned to their tortures performed in sinister wise not on the formidable and flaming chariot of the apocalypse but what was more mournful than that on the gibbet cart 
 one of the guards who had a hook on the end of his cudgel made a pretence from time to time of stirring up this mass of human filth an old woman in the crowd pointed them out to her little boy five years old and said to him 
 rascal let that be a warning to you 
 as the songs and blasphemies increased the man who appeared to be the captain of the escort cracked his whip and at that signal a fearful dull and blind flogging which produced the sound of hail fell upon the seven many roared and foamed at the mouth which redoubled the delight of the street urchins who had hastened up a swarm of flies on these wounds 
 jean eyes had assumed a frightful expression they were no longer eyes they were those deep and glassy objects which replace the glance in the case of certain wretched men which seem unconscious of reality and in which flames the reflection of terrors and of catastrophes 
 he was not looking at a spectacle he was seeing a vision 
 he tried to rise to flee to make his escape he could not move his feet 
 sometimes the things that you see seize upon you and hold you fast 
 he remained nailed to the spot petrified stupid asking himself athwart confused and inexpressible anguish what this sepulchral persecution signified and whence had come that pandemonium which was pursuing him all at once he raised his hand to his brow a gesture habitual to those whose memory suddenly returns he remembered that this was in fact the usual itinerary that it was customary to make this detour in order to avoid all possibility of encountering royalty on the road to fontainebleau and that five and thirty years before he had himself passed through that barrier 
 cosette was no less terrified but in a different way 
 she did not understand what she beheld did not seem to her to be possible at length she cried 
 father 
 what are those men in those carts 
 jean valjean replied 
 convicts 
 whither are they going 
 to the galleys 
 at that moment the cudgelling multiplied by a hundred hands became zealous blows with the flat of the sword were mingled with it it was a perfect storm of whips and clubs the convicts bent before it a hideous obedience was evoked by the torture and all held their peace darting glances like chained wolves 
 cosette trembled in every limb she resumed 
 father are they still men 
 sometimes answered the unhappy man 
 it was the in fact which had set out before daybreak from bicetre and had taken the road to mans in order to avoid fontainebleau where the king then was 
 this caused the horrible journey to last three or four days longer but torture may surely be prolonged with the object of sparing the royal personage a sight of it 
 jean valjean returned home utterly overwhelmed 
 such encounters are shocks and the memory that they leave behind them resembles a thorough shaking up 
 nevertheless jean valjean did not observe that on his way back to the rue de babylone with cosette the latter was plying him with other questions on the subject of what they had just seen perhaps he was too much absorbed in his own dejection to notice her words and reply to them 
 but when cosette was leaving him in the evening to betake herself to bed he heard her say in a low voice and as though talking to herself 
 it seems to me that if i were to find one of those men in my pathway oh my god i should die merely from the sight of him close at hand 
 fortunately chance ordained that on the morrow of that tragic day there was some official solemnity apropos of i know not what fetes in paris a review in the champ de mars jousts on the seine theatrical performances in the fireworks at the arc de illuminations everywhere 
 jean valjean did violence to his habits and took cosette to see these rejoicings for the purpose of diverting her from the memory of the day before and of effacing beneath the smiling tumult of all paris the abominable thing which had passed before her 
 the review with which the festival was spiced made the presence of uniforms perfectly natural jean valjean donned his uniform of a national guard with the vague inward feeling of a man who is betaking himself to shelter 
 however this trip seemed to attain its object cosette who made it her law to please her father and to whom moreover all spectacles were a novelty accepted this diversion with the light and easy good grace of youth and did not pout too disdainfully at that flutter of enjoyment called a public fete so that jean valjean was able to believe that he had succeeded and that no trace of that hideous vision remained 
 some days later one morning when the sun was shining brightly and they were both on the steps leading to the garden another infraction of the rules which jean valjean seemed to have imposed upon himself and to the custom of remaining in her chamber which melancholy had caused cosette to adopt cosette in a wrapper was standing erect in that negligent attire of early morning which envelops young girls in an adorable way and which produces the effect of a cloud drawn over a star and with her head bathed in light rosy after a good sleep submitting to the gentle glances of the tender old man she was picking a daisy to pieces 
 cosette did not know the delightful legend i love a little passionately was there who could have taught her 
 she was handling the flower instinctively innocently without a suspicion that to pluck a daisy apart is to do the same by a heart 
 if there were a fourth and smiling grace called melancholy she would have worn the air of that grace jean valjean was fascinated by the contemplation of those tiny fingers on that flower and forgetful of everything in the radiance emitted by that child 
 a was warbling in the thicket on one side 
 white cloudlets floated across the sky so gayly that one would have said that they had just been set at liberty cosette went on attentively tearing the leaves from her flower she seemed to be thinking about something but whatever it was it must be something charming all at once she turned her head over her shoulder with the delicate languor of a swan and said to jean valjean 
 father what are the galleys like

 chapter xiv 
 
 madame schoss who had been out to visit her daughter increased the countess fears still more by telling what she had seen at a spirit in myasnitski street when returning by that street she had been unable to pass because of a drunken crowd rioting in front of the shop she had taken a cab and driven home by a side street and the cabman had told her that the people were breaking open the barrels at the drink store having received orders to do so 
 after dinner the whole rostov household set to work with enthusiastic haste packing their belongings and preparing for their departure the old count suddenly setting to work kept passing from the yard to the house and back again shouting confused instructions to the hurrying people and flurrying them still more petya directed things in the yard sonya owing to the contradictory orders lost her head and did not know what to do the servants ran noisily about the house and yard shouting and disputing natasha with the ardor characteristic of all she did suddenly set to work too at first her intervention in the business of packing was received skeptically everybody expected some prank from her and did not wish to obey her but she resolutely and passionately demanded obedience grew angry and nearly cried because they did not heed her and at last succeeded in making them believe her her first exploit which cost her immense effort and established her authority was the packing of the carpets the count had valuable gobelin tapestries and persian carpets in the house when natasha set to work two cases were standing open in the ballroom one almost full up with crockery the other with carpets there was also much china standing on the tables and still more was being brought in from the storeroom a third case was needed and servants had gone to fetch it 
 sonya wait a bit pack everything into these said natasha 
 you miss we have tried to said the assistant 
 no wait a minute please 
 and natasha began rapidly taking out of the case dishes and plates wrapped in paper 
 the dishes must go in here among the carpets said she 
 why a mercy if we can get the carpets alone into three cases said the assistant 
 oh wait please and natasha began rapidly and deftly sorting out the things these needed said she putting aside some plates of kiev ware these yes these must go among the carpets she said referring to the saxony china dishes 
 natasha leave it alone get it all packed urged sonya reproachfully 
 what a young lady she is remarked the 
 but natasha would not give in she turned everything out and began quickly repacking deciding that the inferior russian carpets and unnecessary crockery should not be taken at all when everything had been taken out of the cases they recommenced packing and it turned out that when the cheaper things not worth taking had nearly all been rejected the valuable ones really did all go into the two cases only the lid of the case containing the carpets would not shut down a few more things might have been taken out but natasha insisted on having her own way she packed repacked pressed made the assistant and petya whom she had drawn into the business of packing press on the lid and made desperate efforts herself 
 enough natasha said sonya i see you were right but just take out the top one 
 i cried natasha with one hand bolding back the hair that hung over her perspiring face while with the other she pressed down the carpets now press petya press vasilich press hard she cried 
 the carpets yielded and the lid closed natasha clapping her hands screamed with delight and tears fell from her eyes but this only lasted a moment she at once set to work afresh and they now trusted her completely the count was not angry even when they told him that natasha had countermanded an order of his and the servants now came to her to ask whether a cart was sufficiently loaded and whether it might be corded up thanks to directions the work now went on expeditiously unnecessary things were left and the most valuable packed as compactly as possible 
 but hard as they all worked till quite late that night they could not get everything packed the countess had fallen asleep and the count having put off their departure till next morning went to bed 
 sonya and natasha slept in the sitting room without undressing 
 that night another wounded man was driven down the povarskaya and mavra kuzminichna who was standing at the gate had him brought into the rostovs yard mavra kuzminichna concluded that he was a very important man he was being conveyed in a caleche with a raised hood and was quite covered by an apron on the box beside the driver sat a venerable old attendant a doctor and two soldiers followed the carriage in a cart 
 please come in here the masters are going away and the whole house will be empty said the old woman to the old attendant 
 well perhaps said he with a sigh we expect to get him home alive we have a house of our own in moscow but a long way from here and nobody living in it 
 do us the honor to come in plenty of everything in the house come in said mavra kuzminichna is he very ill she asked 
 the attendant made a hopeless gesture 
 we expect to get him home we must ask the doctor 
 and the old servant got down from the box and went up to the cart 
 all right said the doctor 
 the old servant returned to the caleche looked into it shook his head disconsolately told the driver to turn into the yard and stopped beside mavra kuzminichna 
 o lord jesus christ she murmured 
 she invited them to take the wounded man into the house 
 the masters object she said 
 but they had to avoid carrying the man upstairs and so they took him into the wing and put him in the room that had been madame schoss 
 this wounded man was prince andrew bolkonski

 chapter i 
 
 a wound without healing within 
 thus their life clouded over by degrees 
 but one diversion which had formerly been a happiness remained to them which was to carry bread to those who were hungry and clothing to those who were cold 
 cosette often accompanied jean valjean on these visits to the poor on which they recovered some remnants of their former free intercourse and sometimes when the day had been a good one and they had assisted many in distress and cheered and warmed many little children cosette was rather merry in the evening it was at this epoch that they paid their visit to the jondrette den 
 on the day following that visit jean valjean made his appearance in the pavilion in the morning calm as was his wont but with a large wound on his left arm which was much inflamed and very angry which resembled a burn and which he explained in some way or other this wound resulted in his being detained in the house for a month with fever 
 he would not call in a doctor 
 when cosette urged him call the said he 
 cosette dressed the wound morning and evening with so divine an air and such angelic happiness at being of use to him that jean valjean felt all his former joy returning his fears and anxieties dissipating and he gazed at cosette saying 
 oh what a kindly wound oh what a good misfortune 
 cosette on perceiving that her father was ill had deserted the pavilion and again taken a fancy to the little lodging and the back courtyard she passed nearly all her days beside jean valjean and read to him the books which he desired 
 generally they were books of travel jean valjean was undergoing a new birth his happiness was reviving in these ineffable rays the luxembourg the prowling young stranger these clouds upon his soul were growing dim he had reached the point where he said to himself 
 i imagined all that i am an old fool 
 his happiness was so great that the horrible discovery of the thenardiers made in the jondrette hovel unexpected as it was had after a fashion glided over him unnoticed 
 he had succeeded in making his escape all trace of him was more did he care for he only thought of those wretched beings to pity them 
 here they are in prison and henceforth they will be incapacitated for doing any harm he thought but what a lamentable family in distress 
 as for the hideous vision of the barriere du maine cosette had not referred to it again 
 sister had taught cosette music in the convent cosette had the voice of a linnet with a soul and sometimes in the evening in the wounded humble abode she warbled melancholy songs which delighted jean valjean 
 spring came the garden was so delightful at that season of the year that jean valjean said to cosette 
 you never go there i want you to stroll in it 
 as you like father said cosette 
 and for the sake of obeying her father she resumed her walks in the garden generally alone for as we have mentioned jean valjean who was probably afraid of being seen through the fence hardly ever went there 
 jean wound had created a diversion 
 when cosette saw that her father was suffering less that he was convalescing and that he appeared to be happy she experienced a contentment which she did not even perceive so gently and naturally had it come 
 then it was in the month of march the days were growing longer the winter was departing the winter always bears away with it a portion of our sadness then came april that daybreak of summer fresh as dawn always is gay like every childhood a little inclined to weep at times like the being that it is in that month nature has charming gleams which pass from the sky from the trees from the meadows and the flowers into the heart of man 
 cosette was still too young to escape the penetrating influence of that april joy which bore so strong a resemblance to herself insensibly and without her suspecting the fact the blackness departed from her spirit 
 in spring sad souls grow light as light falls into cellars at midday 
 cosette was no longer sad however though this was so she did not account for it to herself in the morning about ten after breakfast when she had succeeded in enticing her father into the garden for a quarter of an hour and when she was pacing up and down in the sunlight in front of the steps supporting his left arm for him she did not perceive that she laughed every moment and that she was happy 
 jean valjean intoxicated beheld her growing fresh and rosy once more 
 oh 
 what a good wound he repeated in a whisper 
 and he felt grateful to the thenardiers 
 his wound once healed he resumed his solitary twilight strolls 
 it is a mistake to suppose that a person can stroll alone in that fashion in the uninhabited regions of paris without meeting with some adventure

 chapter xv 
 
 last day had come it was a clear bright autumn day a sunday the church bells everywhere were ringing for service just as usual on sundays nobody seemed yet to realize what awaited the city 
 only two things indicated the social condition of moscow the rabble that is the poor people and the price of commodities an enormous crowd of factory hands house serfs and peasants with whom some officials seminarists and gentry were mingled had gone early that morning to the three hills having waited there for rostopchin who did not turn up they became convinced that moscow would be surrendered and then dispersed all about the town to the public houses and cookshops prices too that day indicated the state of affairs the price of weapons of gold of carts and horses kept rising but the value of paper money and city articles kept falling so that by midday there were instances of carters removing valuable goods such as cloth and receiving in payment a half of what they carted while peasant horses were fetching five hundred rubles each and furniture mirrors and bronzes were being given away for nothing 
 in the rostovs staid house the dissolution of former conditions of life was but little noticeable as to the serfs the only indication was that three out of their huge retinue disappeared during the night but nothing was stolen and as to the value of their possessions the thirty peasant carts that had come in from their estates and which many people envied proved to be extremely valuable and they were offered enormous sums of money for them not only were huge sums offered for the horses and carts but on the previous evening and early in the morning of the first of september orderlies and servants sent by wounded officers came to the rostovs and wounded men dragged themselves there from the rostovs and from neighboring houses where they were accommodated entreating the servants to try to get them a lift out of moscow the to whom these entreaties were addressed though he was sorry for the wounded resolutely refused saying that he dare not even mention the matter to the count pity these wounded men as one might it was evident that if they were given one cart there would be no reason to refuse another or all the carts and own carriages as well thirty carts could not save all the wounded and in the general catastrophe one could not disregard oneself and own family so thought the on his behalf 
 on waking up that morning count ilya rostov left his bedroom softly so as not to wake the countess who had fallen asleep only toward morning and came out to the porch in his lilac silk dressing gown in the yard stood the carts ready corded the carriages were at the front porch the stood at the porch talking to an elderly orderly and to a pale young officer with a bandaged arm on seeing the count the made a significant and stern gesture to them both to go away 
 well vasilich is everything ready asked the count and stroking his bald head he looked at the officer and the orderly and nodded to them he liked to see new faces 
 we can harness at once your excellency 
 well right as soon as the countess wakes be off god willing what is it gentlemen he added turning to the officer are you staying in my house 
 the officer came nearer and suddenly his face flushed crimson 
 count be so good as to allow me for sake to get into some corner of one of your carts i have nothing here with me i shall be all right on a loaded cart 
 before the officer had finished speaking the orderly made the same request on behalf of his master 
 oh yes said the count hastily i shall be very pleased very pleased vasilich see to it just unload one or two carts well what of it do necessary said the count muttering some indefinite order 
 but at the same moment an expression of warm gratitude on the face had already sealed the order the count looked around him in the yard at the gates at the window of the wings wounded officers and their orderlies were to be seen they were all looking at the count and moving toward the porch 
 please step into the gallery your excellency said the what are your orders about the pictures 
 the count went into the house with him repeating his order not to refuse the wounded who asked for a lift 
 well never mind some of the things can be unloaded he added in a soft confidential voice as though afraid of being overheard 
 at nine the countess woke up and matrena timofeevna who had been her maid before her marriage and now performed a sort of chief duty for her came to say that madame schoss was much offended and the young ladies summer dresses could not be left behind on inquiry the countess learned that madame schoss was offended because her trunk had been taken down from its cart and all the loads were being uncorded and the luggage taken out of the carts to make room for wounded men whom the count in the simplicity of his heart had ordered that they should take with them the countess sent for her husband 
 what is this my dear i hear that the luggage is being unloaded 
 you know love i wanted to tell you countess dear an officer came to me to ask for a few carts for the wounded after all ours are things that can be bought but think what being left behind means to them really now in our own yard we asked them in ourselves and there are officers among them you know i think my dear let them be taken the hurry 
 the count spoke timidly as he always did when talking of money matters the countess was accustomed to this tone as a precursor of news of something detrimental to the interests such as the building of a new gallery or conservatory the inauguration of a private theater or an orchestra she was accustomed always to oppose anything announced in that timid tone and considered it her duty to do so 
 she assumed her dolefully submissive manner and said to her husband listen to me count you have managed matters so that we are getting nothing for the house and now you wish to throw away all our all the property you said yourself that we have a hundred thousand rubles worth of things in the house i consent my dear i do as you please the business to look after the wounded they know that look at the lopukhins opposite they cleared out everything two days ago what other people do only we who are such fools if you have no pity on me have some for the children 
 flourishing his arms in despair the count left the room without replying 
 papa what are you doing that for asked natasha who had followed him into her room 
 nothing what business is it of yours muttered the count angrily 
 but i heard said natasha why does mamma object 
 what business is it of yours cried the count 
 natasha stepped up to the window and pondered 
 papa berg coming to see us said she looking out of the window

 book from below may turn out to be succor from on high 
 chapter ii 
 
 mother plutarque finds no difficulty in explaining a phenomenon 
 one evening little gavroche had had nothing to eat he remembered that he had not dined on the preceding day either this was becoming tiresome 
 he resolved to make an effort to secure some supper he strolled out beyond the salpetriere into deserted regions that is where windfalls are to be found where there is no one one always finds something 
 he reached a settlement which appeared to him to be the village of austerlitz 
 in one of his preceding lounges he had noticed there an old garden haunted by an old man and an old woman and in that garden a passable beside the stood a sort of which was not securely fastened and where one might contrive to get an apple 
 one apple is a supper one apple is life 
 that which was ruin might prove salvation 
 the garden abutted on a solitary unpaved lane bordered with brushwood while awaiting the arrival of houses the garden was separated from it by a hedge 
 gavroche directed his steps towards this garden he found the lane he recognized the he verified the he examined the hedge a hedge means merely one stride 
 the day was declining there was not even a cat in the lane the hour was propitious gavroche began the operation of scaling the hedge then suddenly paused some one was talking in the garden 
 gavroche peeped through one of the breaks in the hedge 
 a couple of paces distant at the foot of the hedge on the other side exactly at the point where the gap which he was meditating would have been made there was a sort of recumbent stone which formed a bench and on this bench was seated the old man of the garden while the old woman was standing in front of him 
 the old woman was grumbling 
 gavroche who was not very discreet listened 
 monsieur mabeuf said the old woman 
 mabeuf thought gavroche that name is a perfect farce 
 the old man who was thus addressed did not stir 
 the old woman repeated 
 monsieur mabeuf 
 the old man without raising his eyes from the ground made up his mind to answer 
 what is it mother plutarque 
 mother plutarque thought gavroche another farcical name 
 mother plutarque began again and the old man was forced to accept the conversation 
 the landlord is not pleased 
 why 
 we owe three quarters rent 
 in three months we shall owe him for four quarters 
 he says that he will turn you out to sleep 
 i will go 
 the insists on being paid 
 she will no longer leave her fagots 
 what will you warm yourself with this winter we shall have no wood 
 there is the sun 
 the butcher refuses to give credit he will not let us have any more meat 
 that is quite right 
 i do not digest meat well 
 it is too heavy 
 what shall we have for dinner 
 bread 
 the baker demands a settlement and says no money no bread 
 that is well 
 what will you eat 
 we have apples in the 
 but monsieur we live like that without money 
 i have none 
 the old woman went away the old man remained alone 
 he fell into thought 
 gavroche became thoughtful also 
 it was almost dark 
 the first result of meditation was that instead of scaling the hedge he crouched down under it 
 the branches stood apart a little at the foot of the thicket 
 come exclaimed gavroche mentally a nook and he curled up in it 
 his back was almost in contact with father bench he could hear the octogenarian breathe 
 then by way of dinner he tried to sleep 
 it was a with one eye open 
 while he dozed gavroche kept on the watch 
 the twilight pallor of the sky blanched the earth and the lane formed a livid line between two rows of dark bushes 
 all at once in this whitish band two figures made their appearance one was in front the other some distance in the rear 
 there come two creatures muttered gavroche 
 the first form seemed to be some elderly bourgeois who was bent and thoughtful dressed more than plainly and who was walking slowly because of his age and strolling about in the open evening air 
 the second was straight firm slender 
 it regulated its pace by that of the first but in the voluntary slowness of its gait suppleness and agility were discernible 
 this figure had also something fierce and disquieting about it the whole shape was that of what was then called an elegant the hat was of good shape the coat black well cut probably of fine cloth and well fitted in at the waist 
 the head was held erect with a sort of robust grace and beneath the hat the pale profile of a young man could be made out in the dim light 
 the profile had a rose in its mouth this second form was well known to gavroche it was montparnasse 
 he could have told nothing about the other except that he was a respectable old man 
 gavroche immediately began to take observations 
 one of these two pedestrians evidently had a project connected with the other 
 gavroche was well placed to watch the course of events the bedroom had turned into a at a very opportune moment 
 montparnasse on the hunt at such an hour in such a place betokened something threatening 
 gavroche felt his heart moved with compassion for the old man 
 what was he to do 
 interfere 
 one weakness coming to the aid of another 
 it would be merely a laughing matter for montparnasse gavroche did not shut his eyes to the fact that the old man in the first place and the child in the second would make but two mouthfuls for that redoubtable ruffian eighteen years of age 
 while gavroche was deliberating the attack took place abruptly and hideously 
 the attack of the tiger on the wild ass the attack of the spider on the fly 
 montparnasse suddenly tossed away his rose bounded upon the old man seized him by the collar grasped and clung to him and gavroche with difficulty restrained a scream 
 a moment later one of these men was underneath the other groaning struggling with a knee of marble upon his breast 
 only it was not just what gavroche had expected the one who lay on the earth was montparnasse the one who was on top was the old man 
 all this took place a few paces distant from gavroche 
 the old man had received the shock had returned it and that in such a terrible fashion that in a twinkling the assailant and the assailed had exchanged roles 
 a hearty veteran thought gavroche 
 he could not refrain from clapping his hands 
 but it was applause wasted 
 it did not reach the combatants absorbed and deafened as they were each by the other as their breath mingled in the struggle 
 silence ensued 
 montparnasse ceased his struggles 
 gavroche indulged in this aside 
 can he be dead 
 the goodman had not uttered a word nor given vent to a cry he rose to his feet and gavroche heard him say to montparnasse 
 get up 
 montparnasse rose but the goodman held him fast attitude was the humiliated and furious attitude of the wolf who has been caught by a sheep 
 gavroche looked on and listened making an effort to reinforce his eyes with his ears 
 he was enjoying himself immensely 
 he was repaid for his conscientious anxiety in the character of a spectator 
 he was able to catch on the wing a dialogue which borrowed from the darkness an indescribably tragic accent the goodman questioned montparnasse replied 
 how old are you 
 nineteen 
 you are strong and healthy 
 why do you not work 
 it bores me 
 what is your trade 
 an idler 
 speak seriously 
 can anything be done for you 
 what would you like to be 
 a thief 
 a pause ensued 
 the old man seemed absorbed in profound thought he stood motionless and did not relax his hold on montparnasse 
 every moment the vigorous and agile young ruffian indulged in the twitchings of a wild beast caught in a snare 
 he gave a jerk tried a crook of the knee twisted his limbs desperately and made efforts to escape 
 the old man did not appear to notice it and held both his arms with one hand with the sovereign indifference of absolute force 
 the old revery lasted for some time then looking steadily at montparnasse he addressed to him in a gentle voice in the midst of the darkness where they stood a solemn harangue of which gavroche did not lose a single syllable 
 my child you are entering through indolence on one of the most laborious of lives 
 ah 
 you declare yourself to be an idler prepare to toil 
 there is a certain formidable machine have you seen it it is the you must be on your guard against it it is crafty and ferocious if it catches hold of the skirt of your coat you will be drawn in bodily 
 that machine is laziness stop while there is yet time and save yourself 
 otherwise it is all over with you in a short time you will be among the gearing once entangled hope for nothing more 
 toil lazybones there is no more repose for you 
 the iron hand of implacable toil has seized you you do not wish to earn your living to have a task to fulfil a duty it bores you to be like other men 
 well 
 you will be different labor is the law he who rejects it will find ennui his torment you do not wish to be a workingman you will be a slave toil lets go of you on one side only to grasp you again on the other 
 you do not desire to be its friend you shall be its negro slave 
 ah 
 you would have none of the honest weariness of men you shall have the sweat of the damned 
 where others sing you will rattle in your throat 
 you will see afar off from below other men at work it will seem to you that they are resting the laborer the harvester the sailor the blacksmith will appear to you in glory like the blessed spirits in paradise 
 what radiance surrounds the forge 
 to guide the plough to bind the sheaves is joy 
 the bark at liberty in the wind what delight 
 do you lazy idler delve drag on roll march 
 drag your halter you are a beast of burden in the team of hell 
 ah 
 to do nothing is your object 
 well not a week not a day not an hour shall you have free from oppression 
 you will be able to lift nothing without anguish 
 every minute that passes will make your muscles crack what is a feather to others will be a rock to you 
 the simplest things will become steep acclivities 
 life will become monstrous all about you 
 to go to come to breathe will be just so many terrible labors 
 your lungs will produce on you the effect of weighing a hundred pounds 
 whether you shall walk here rather than there will become a problem that must be solved 
 any one who wants to go out simply gives his door a push and there he is in the open air if you wish to go out you will be obliged to pierce your wall what does every one who wants to step into the street do 
 he goes down stairs you will tear up your sheets little by little you will make of them a rope then you will climb out of your window and you will suspend yourself by that thread over an abyss and it will be night amid storm rain and the hurricane and if the rope is too short but one way of descending will remain to you to fall 
 to drop into the gulf from an unknown height on what 
 on what is beneath on the unknown 
 or you will crawl up a at the risk of burning or you will creep through a at the risk of drowning i do not speak of the holes that you will be obliged to mask of the stones which you will have to take up and replace twenty times a day of the plaster that you will have to hide in your straw pallet 
 a lock presents itself the bourgeois has in his pocket a key made by a locksmith 
 if you wish to pass out you will be condemned to execute a terrible work of art you will take a large sou you will cut it in two plates with what tools 
 you will have to invent them 
 that is your business then you will hollow out the interior of these plates taking great care of the outside and you will make on the edges a thread so that they can be adjusted one upon the other like a box and its cover the top and bottom thus screwed together nothing will be suspected to the overseers it will be only a sou to you it will be a box what will you put in this box 
 a small bit of steel 
 a in which you will have cut teeth and which will form a saw with this saw as long as a pin and concealed in a sou you will cut the bolt of the lock you will sever bolts the padlock of your chain and the bar at your window and the fetter on your leg this masterpiece finished this prodigy accomplished all these miracles of art address skill and patience executed what will be your recompense if it becomes known that you are the author 
 the dungeon there is your future 
 what precipices are idleness and pleasure do you know that to do nothing is a melancholy resolution to live in idleness on the property of society to be useless that is to say pernicious 
 this leads straight to the depth of wretchedness 
 woe to the man who desires to be a parasite he will become vermin 
 ah 
 so it does not please you to work ah 
 you have but one thought to drink well to eat well to sleep well 
 you will drink water you will eat black bread you will sleep on a plank with a fetter whose cold touch you will feel on your flesh all night long riveted to your limbs you will break those fetters you will flee 
 that is well you will crawl on your belly through the brushwood and you will eat grass like the beasts of the forest 
 and you will be recaptured and then you will pass years in a dungeon riveted to a wall groping for your jug that you may drink gnawing at a horrible loaf of darkness which dogs would not touch eating beans that the worms have eaten before you 
 you will be a in a cellar 
 ah 
 have pity on yourself you miserable young child who were sucking at nurse less than twenty years ago and who have no doubt a mother still alive 
 i conjure you listen to me i entreat you 
 you desire fine black cloth varnished shoes to have your hair curled and oils on your locks to please low women to be handsome 
 you will be shaven clean and you will wear a red blouse and wooden shoes 
 you want rings on your fingers you will have an iron necklet on your neck if you glance at a woman you will receive a blow 
 and you will enter there at the age of twenty 
 and you will come out at fifty you will enter young rosy fresh with brilliant eyes and all your white teeth and your handsome youthful hair you will come out broken bent wrinkled toothless horrible with white locks ah my poor child you are on the wrong road idleness is counselling you badly the hardest of all work is thieving believe me do not undertake that painful profession of an idle man it is not comfortable to become a rascal 
 it is less disagreeable to be an honest man 
 now go and ponder on what i have said to you 
 by the way what did you want of me 
 my purse 
 here it is 
 and the old man releasing montparnasse put his purse in the hand montparnasse weighed it for a moment after which he allowed it to slide gently into the back pocket of his coat with the same mechanical precaution as though he had stolen it 
 all this having been said and done the goodman turned his back and tranquilly resumed his stroll 
 the blockhead muttered montparnasse 
 who was this goodman 
 the reader has no doubt already divined 
 montparnasse watched him with amazement as he disappeared in the dusk this contemplation was fatal to him 
 while the old man was walking away gavroche drew near 
 gavroche had assured himself with a sidelong glance that father mabeuf was still sitting on his bench probably sound asleep then the gamin emerged from his thicket and began to crawl after montparnasse in the dark as the latter stood there motionless in this manner he came up to montparnasse without being seen or heard gently insinuated his hand into the back pocket of that of fine black cloth seized the purse withdrew his hand and having recourse once more to his crawling he slipped away like an adder through the shadows 
 montparnasse who had no reason to be on his guard and who was engaged in thought for the first time in his life perceived nothing 
 when gavroche had once more attained the point where father mabeuf was he flung the purse over the hedge and fled as fast as his legs would carry him 
 the purse fell on father foot 
 this commotion roused him 
 he bent over and picked up the purse 
 he did not understand in the least and opened it 
 the purse had two compartments in one of them there was some small change in the other lay six napoleons 
 m mabeuf in great alarm referred the matter to his housekeeper 
 that has fallen from heaven said mother plutarque

 book eleven 
 chapter xvi 
 
 berg the rostovs was already a colonel wearing the orders of vladimir and anna and he still filled the quiet and agreeable post of assistant to the head of the staff of the assistant commander of the first division of the second army 
 on the first of september he had come to moscow from the army 
 he had nothing to do in moscow but he had noticed that everyone in the army was asking for leave to visit moscow and had something to do there so he considered it necessary to ask for leave of absence for family and domestic reasons 
 berg drove up to his house in his spruce little trap with a pair of sleek roans exactly like those of a certain prince he looked attentively at the carts in the yard and while going up to the porch took out a clean pocket handkerchief and tied a knot in it 
 from the anteroom berg ran with smooth though impatient steps into the drawing room where he embraced the count kissed the hands of natasha and sonya and hastened to inquire after health 
 health at a time like this said the count come tell us the news is the army retreating or will there be another battle 
 god almighty alone can decide the fate of our fatherland papa said berg the army is burning with a spirit of heroism and the leaders so to say have now assembled in council no one knows what is coming but in general i can tell you papa that such a heroic spirit the truly antique valor of the russian army which they which it he corrected himself has shown or displayed in the battle of the there are no words worthy to do it justice i tell you papa he smote himself on the breast as a general he had heard speaking had done but berg did it a trifle late for he should have struck his breast at the words russian army i tell you frankly that we the commanders far from having to urge the men on or anything of that kind could hardly restrain those those yes those exploits of antique valor he went on rapidly general barclay de tolly risked his life everywhere at the head of the troops i can assure you our corps was stationed on a hillside you can imagine 
 and berg related all that he remembered of the various tales he had heard those days natasha watched him with an intent gaze that confused him as if she were trying to find in his face the answer to some question 
 altogether such heroism as was displayed by the russian warriors cannot be imagined or adequately praised said berg glancing round at natasha and as if anxious to conciliate her replying to her intent look with a smile russia is not in moscow she lives in the hearts of her sons it so papa said he 
 just then the countess came in from the sitting room with a weary and dissatisfied expression berg hurriedly jumped up kissed her hand asked about her health and swaying his head from side to side to express sympathy remained standing beside her 
 yes mamma i tell you sincerely that these are hard and sad times for every russian but why are you so anxious you have still time to get away 
 i think what the servants are about said the countess turning to her husband i have just been told that nothing is ready yet somebody after all must see to things one misses mitenka at such times there be any end to it 
 the count was about to say something but evidently restrained himself he got up from his chair and went to the door 
 at that moment berg drew out his handkerchief as if to blow his nose and seeing the knot in it pondered shaking his head sadly and significantly 
 and i have a great favor to ask of you papa said he 
 hm said the count and stopped 
 i was driving past house just now said berg with a laugh when the steward a man i know ran out and asked me whether i buy something i went in out of curiosity you know and there is a small chiffonier and a dressing table you know how dear vera wanted a chiffonier like that and how we had a dispute about it at the mention of the chiffonier and dressing table berg involuntarily changed his tone to one of pleasure at his admirable domestic arrangements and such a beauty it pulls out and has a secret english drawer you know and dear vera has long wanted one i wish to give her a surprise you see i saw so many of those peasant carts in your yard please let me have one i will pay the man well and 
 the count frowned and coughed 
 ask the countess i give orders 
 if inconvenient please said berg only i so wanted it for dear sake 
 oh go to the devil all of you to the devil the devil the devil cried the old count my in a whirl 
 and he left the room the countess began to cry 
 yes mamma yes these are very hard times said berg 
 natasha left the room with her father and as if finding it difficult to reach some decision first followed him and then ran downstairs 
 petya was in the porch engaged in giving out weapons to the servants who were to leave moscow the loaded carts were still standing in the yard two of them had been uncorded and a wounded officer was climbing into one of them helped by an orderly 
 do you know what about petya asked natasha 
 she understood that he meant what were their parents quarreling about she did not answer 
 because papa wanted to give up all the carts to the wounded said petya vasilich told me i consider 
 i consider natasha suddenly almost shouted turning her angry face to petya i consider it so horrid so abominable so i know what are we despicable germans 
 her throat quivered with convulsive sobs and afraid of weakening and letting the force of her anger run to waste she turned and rushed headlong up the stairs 
 berg was sitting beside the countess consoling her with the respectful attention of a relative the count pipe in hand was pacing up and down the room when natasha her face distorted by anger burst in like a tempest and approached her mother with rapid steps 
 horrid abominable she screamed you possibly have ordered it 
 berg and the countess looked at her perplexed and frightened the count stood still at the window and listened 
 mamma impossible see what is going on in the yard she cried they will be left 
 the matter with you who are they what do you want 
 why the wounded impossible mamma monstrous no mamma darling not the thing please forgive me darling mamma what does it matter what we take away only look what is going on in the yard mamma impossible 
 the count stood by the window and listened without turning round suddenly he sniffed and put his face closer to the window 
 the countess glanced at her daughter saw her face full of shame for her mother saw her agitation and understood why her husband did not turn to look at her now and she glanced round quite disconcerted 
 oh do as you like am i hindering anyone she said not surrendering at once 
 mamma darling forgive me 
 but the countess pushed her daughter away and went up to her husband 
 my dear you order what is right you know i understand about it said she dropping her eyes shamefacedly 
 the eggs the eggs are teaching the hen muttered the count through tears of joy and he embraced his wife who was glad to hide her look of shame on his breast 
 papa mamma may i see to it may i asked natasha we will still take all the most necessary things 
 the count nodded affirmatively and natasha at the rapid pace at which she used to run when playing at tag ran through the ballroom to the anteroom and downstairs into the yard 
 the servants gathered round natasha but could not believe the strange order she brought them until the count himself in his name confirmed the order to give up all the carts to the wounded and take the trunks to the storerooms when they understood that order the servants set to work at this new task with pleasure and zeal it no longer seemed strange to them but on the contrary it seemed the only thing that could be done just as a quarter of an hour before it had not seemed strange to anyone that the wounded should be left behind and the goods carted away but that had seemed the only thing to do 
 the whole household as if to atone for not having done it sooner set eagerly to work at the new task of placing the wounded in the carts the wounded dragged themselves out of their rooms and stood with pale but happy faces round the carts the news that carts were to be had spread to the neighboring houses from which wounded men began to come into the rostovs yard many of the wounded asked them not to unload the carts but only to let them sit on the top of the things but the work of unloading once started could not be arrested it seemed not to matter whether all or only half the things were left behind cases full of china bronzes pictures and mirrors that had been so carefully packed the night before now lay about the yard and still they went on searching for and finding possibilities of unloading this or that and letting the wounded have another and yet another cart 
 we can take four more men said the steward they can have my 
 trap or else what is to become of them 
 let them have my wardrobe cart said the countess dunyasha can go with me in the carriage 
 they unloaded the wardrobe cart and sent it to take wounded men from a house two doors off the whole household servants included was bright and animated natasha was in a state of rapturous excitement such as she had not known for a long time 
 what could we fasten this onto asked the servants trying to fix a trunk on the narrow footboard behind a carriage we must keep at least one cart 
 in it asked natasha 
 the books 
 leave it vasilich will put it away not wanted 
 the phaeton was full of people and there was a doubt as to where count peter could sit 
 on the box sit on the box you petya cried natasha 
 sonya too was busy all this time but the aim of her efforts was quite different from she was putting away the things that had to be left behind and making a list of them as the countess wished and she tried to get as much taken away with them as possible

 book end of which does not resemble the beginning 
 chapter i 
 
 solitude and the barracks combined 
 grief which had been so poignant and lively four or five months previously had without her being conscious of the fact entered upon its convalescence 
 nature spring youth love for her father the gayety of the birds and flowers caused something almost resembling forgetfulness to filter gradually drop by drop into that soul which was so virgin and so young 
 was the fire wholly extinct there 
 or was it merely that layers of ashes had formed the truth is that she hardly felt the painful and burning spot any longer 
 one day she suddenly thought of marius 
 why said she i no longer think of him 
 that same week she noticed a very handsome officer of lancers with a waist a delicious uniform the cheeks of a young girl a sword under his arm waxed mustaches and a glazed schapka passing the gate 
 moreover he had light hair prominent blue eyes a round face was vain insolent and quite the reverse of marius 
 he had a cigar in his mouth 
 cosette thought that this officer doubtless belonged to the regiment in barracks in the rue de babylone 
 on the following day she saw him pass again 
 she took note of the hour 
 from that time forth was it chance she saw him pass nearly every day 
 the comrades perceived that there was in that badly kept garden behind that malicious rococo fence a very pretty creature who was almost always there when the handsome is not unknown to the reader and whose name was theodule gillenormand passed by 
 see here they said to him a little creature there who is making eyes at you look 
 have i the time replied the lancer to look at all the girls who look at me 
 this was at the precise moment when marius was descending heavily towards agony and was saying 
 if i could but see her before i die had his wish been realized had he beheld cosette at that moment gazing at the lancer he would not have been able to utter a word and he would have expired with grief 
 whose fault was it 
 no 
 marius possessed one of those temperaments which bury themselves in sorrow and there abide cosette was one of those persons who plunge into sorrow and emerge from it again 
 cosette was moreover passing through that dangerous period the fatal phase of feminine revery abandoned to itself in which the isolated heart of a young girl resembles the tendrils of the vine which cling as chance directs to the capital of a marble column or to the post of a a rapid and decisive moment critical for every orphan be she rich or poor for wealth does not prevent a bad choice misalliances are made in very high circles real misalliance is that of souls and as many an unknown young man without name without birth without fortune is a marble column which bears up a temple of grand sentiments and grand ideas so such and such a man of the world satisfied and opulent who has polished boots and varnished words if looked at not outside but inside a thing which is reserved for his wife is nothing more than a block obscurely haunted by violent unclean and vinous passions the post of a 
 what did soul contain 
 passion calmed or lulled to sleep something limpid brilliant troubled to a certain depth and gloomy lower down 
 the image of the handsome officer was reflected in the surface 
 did a souvenir linger in the depths quite at the 
 cosette did not know 
 a singular incident supervened

 chapter xvii 
 
 before two in the afternoon the rostovs four carriages packed full and with the horses harnessed stood at the front door one by one the carts with the wounded had moved out of the yard 
 the caleche in which prince andrew was being taken attracted attention as it passed the front porch with the help of a maid she was arranging a seat for the countess in the huge high coach that stood at the entrance 
 whose caleche is that she inquired leaning out of the carriage window 
 why you know miss replied the maid the wounded prince he spent the night in our house and is going with us 
 but who is it his name 
 our intended that was prince bolkonski himself they say he is dying replied the maid with a sigh 
 sonya jumped out of the coach and ran to the countess the countess tired out and already dressed in shawl and bonnet for her journey was pacing up and down the drawing room waiting for the household to assemble for the usual silent prayer with closed doors before starting natasha was not in the room 
 mamma said sonya prince andrew is here mortally wounded he is going with us 
 the countess opened her eyes in dismay and seizing arm glanced around 
 natasha she murmured 
 at that moment this news had only one significance for both of them they knew their natasha and alarm as to what would happen if she heard this news stifled all sympathy for the man they both liked 
 natasha does not know yet but he is going with us said sonya 
 you say he is dying 
 sonya nodded 
 the countess put her arms around sonya and began to cry 
 the ways of god are past finding out she thought feeling that the almighty hand hitherto unseen was becoming manifest in all that was now taking place 
 well mamma everything is ready the matter asked natasha as with animated face she ran into the room 
 nothing answered the countess if everything is ready let us start 
 and the countess bent over her reticule to hide her agitated face sonya embraced natasha and kissed her 
 natasha looked at her inquiringly 
 what is it what has happened 
 nothing no 
 is it something very bad for me what is it persisted natasha with her quick intuition 
 sonya sighed and made no reply the count petya madame schoss mavra kuzminichna and vasilich came into the drawing room and having closed the doors they all sat down and remained for some moments silently seated without looking at one another 
 the count was the first to rise and with a loud sigh crossed himself before the icon all the others did the same then the count embraced mavra kuzminichna and vasilich who were to remain in moscow and while they caught at his hand and kissed his shoulder he patted their backs lightly with some vaguely affectionate and comforting words the countess went into the oratory and there sonya found her on her knees before the icons that had been left here and there hanging on the wall the most precious ones with which some family tradition was connected were being taken with them 
 in the porch and in the yard the men whom petya had armed with swords and daggers with trousers tucked inside their high boots and with belts and girdles tightened were taking leave of those remaining behind 
 as is always the case at a departure much had been forgotten or put in the wrong place and for a long time two menservants stood one on each side of the open door and the carriage steps waiting to help the countess in while maids rushed with cushions and bundles from the house to the carriages the caleche the phaeton and back again 
 they always will forget everything said the countess you know i sit like that 
 and dunyasha with clenched teeth without replying but with an aggrieved look on her face hastily got into the coach to rearrange the seat 
 oh those servants said the count swaying his head 
 efim the old coachman who was the only one the countess trusted to drive her sat perched up high on the box and did not so much as glance round at what was going on behind him from thirty years experience he knew it would be some time yet before the order be off in name would be given him and he knew that even when it was said he would be stopped once or twice more while they sent back to fetch something that had been forgotten and even after that he would again be stopped and the countess herself would lean out of the window and beg him for the love of heaven to drive carefully down the hill he knew all this and therefore waited calmly for what would happen with more patience than the horses especially the near one the chestnut falcon who was pawing the ground and champing his bit at last all were seated the carriage steps were folded and pulled up the door was shut somebody was sent for a traveling case and the countess leaned out and said what she had to say then efim deliberately doffed his hat and began crossing himself the postilion and all the other servants did the same off in name said efim putting on his hat start the postilion started the horses the off pole horse tugged at his collar the high springs creaked and the body of the coach swayed the footman sprang onto the box of the moving coach which jolted as it passed out of the yard onto the uneven roadway the other vehicles jolted in their turn and the procession of carriages moved up the street in the carriages the caleche and the phaeton all crossed themselves as they passed the church opposite the house those who were to remain in moscow walked on either side of the vehicles seeing the travelers off 
 rarely had natasha experienced so joyful a feeling as now sitting in the carriage beside the countess and gazing at the slowly receding walls of forsaken agitated moscow occasionally she leaned out of the carriage window and looked back and then forward at the long train of wounded in front of them almost at the head of the line she could see the raised hood of prince caleche she did not know who was in it but each time she looked at the procession her eyes sought that caleche she knew it was right in front 
 in kudrino from the nikitski presnya and podnovinsk streets came several other trains of vehicles similar to the rostovs and as they passed along the sadovaya street the carriages and carts formed two rows abreast 
 as they were going round the sukharev water tower natasha who was inquisitively and alertly scrutinizing the people driving or walking past suddenly cried out in joyful surprise 
 dear me mamma sonya look he 
 who who 
 look yes on my word bezukhov said natasha putting her head out of the carriage and staring at a tall stout man in a long coat who from his manner of walking and moving was evidently a gentleman in disguise and who was passing under the arch of the sukharev tower accompanied by a small beardless old man in a frieze coat 
 yes it really is bezukhov in a coat with a old boy really said natasha look look 
 no not he how can you talk such nonsense 
 mamma screamed natasha stake my head he i assure you stop stop she cried to the coachman 
 but the coachman could not stop for from the meshchanski street came more carts and carriages and the rostovs were being shouted at to move on and not block the way 
 in fact however though now much farther off than before the rostovs all saw pierre or someone extraordinarily like him in a coat going down the street with head bent and a serious face beside a small beardless old man who looked like a footman that old man noticed a face thrust out of the carriage window gazing at them and respectfully touching elbow said something to him and pointed to the carriage pierre evidently engrossed in thought could not at first understand him at length when he had understood and looked in the direction the old man indicated he recognized natasha and following his first impulse stepped instantly and rapidly toward the coach but having taken a dozen steps he seemed to remember something and stopped 
 face leaning out of the window beamed with quizzical kindliness 
 peter kirilovich come here we have recognized you this is wonderful she cried holding out her hand to him what are you doing why are you like this 
 pierre took her outstretched hand and kissed it awkwardly as he walked along beside her while the coach still moved on 
 what is the matter count asked the countess in a surprised and commiserating tone 
 what what why ask me said pierre and looked round at natasha whose radiant happy expression of which he was conscious without looking at her filled him with enchantment 
 are you remaining in moscow then 
 pierre hesitated 
 in moscow he said in a questioning tone yes in moscow goodby 
 ah if only i were a man certainly stay with you how splendid said natasha mamma if let me stay 
 pierre glanced absently at natasha and was about to say something but the countess interrupted him 
 you were at the battle we heard 
 yes i was pierre answered there will be another battle tomorrow he began but natasha interrupted him 
 but what is the matter with you count you are not like yourself 
 oh ask me ask me i know myself tomorrow but no he muttered an awful time and dropping behind the carriage he stepped onto the pavement 
 natasha continued to lean out of the window for a long time beaming at him with her kindly slightly quizzical happy smile

 apprehensions 
 during the first fortnight in april jean valjean took a journey this as the reader knows happened from time to time at very long intervals 
 he remained absent a day or two days at the utmost where did he go 
 no one knew not even cosette 
 once only on the occasion of one of these departures she had accompanied him in a as far as a little at the corner of which she read 
 impasse de la planchette 
 there he alighted and the coach took cosette back to the rue de babylone 
 it was usually when money was lacking in the house that jean valjean took these little trips 
 so jean valjean was absent 
 he had said 
 i shall return in three days 
 that evening cosette was alone in the in order to get rid of her ennui she had opened her and had begun to sing accompanying herself the while the chorus from euryanthe hunters astray in the wood which is probably the most beautiful thing in all the sphere of music 
 when she had finished she remained wrapped in thought 
 all at once it seemed to her that she heard the sound of footsteps in the garden 
 it could not be her father he was absent it could not be toussaint she was in bed and it was ten at night 
 she stepped to the shutter of the which was closed and laid her ear against it 
 it seemed to her that it was the tread of a man and that he was walking very softly 
 she mounted rapidly to the first floor to her own chamber opened a small wicket in her shutter and peeped into the garden the moon was at the full 
 everything could be seen as plainly as by day 
 there was no one there 
 she opened the window 
 the garden was absolutely calm and all that was visible was that the street was deserted as usual 
 cosette thought that she had been mistaken 
 she thought that she had heard a noise 
 it was a hallucination produced by the melancholy and magnificent chorus of weber which lays open before the mind terrified depths which trembles before the gaze like a dizzy forest and in which one hears the crackling of dead branches beneath the uneasy tread of the huntsmen of whom one catches a glimpse through the twilight 
 she thought no more about it 
 moreover cosette was not very timid by nature 
 there flowed in her veins some of the blood of the bohemian and the adventuress who runs barefoot 
 it will be remembered that she was more of a lark than a dove 
 there was a foundation of wildness and bravery in her 
 on the following day at an earlier hour towards nightfall she was strolling in the garden 
 in the midst of the confused thoughts which occupied her she fancied that she caught for an instant a sound similar to that of the preceding evening as though some one were walking beneath the trees in the dusk and not very far from her but she told herself that nothing so closely resembles a step on the grass as the friction of two branches which have moved from side to side and she paid no heed to it 
 besides she could see nothing 
 she emerged from the thicket she had still to cross a small lawn to regain the steps 
 the moon which had just risen behind her cast shadow in front of her upon this lawn as she came out from the shrubbery 
 cosette halted in alarm 
 beside her shadow the moon outlined distinctly upon the turf another shadow which was particularly startling and terrible a shadow which had a round hat 
 it was the shadow of a man who must have been standing on the border of the clump of shrubbery a few paces in the rear of cosette 
 she stood for a moment without the power to speak or cry or call or stir or turn her head 
 then she summoned up all her courage and turned round resolutely 
 there was no one there 
 she glanced on the ground 
 the figure had disappeared 
 she the thicket searched the corners boldly went as far as the gate and found nothing 
 she felt herself absolutely chilled with terror 
 was this another hallucination 
 what 
 two days in succession one hallucination might pass but two hallucinations the disquieting point about it was that the shadow had assuredly not been a phantom 
 phantoms do not wear round hats 
 on the following day jean valjean returned 
 cosette told him what she thought she had heard and seen 
 she wanted to be reassured and to see her father shrug his shoulders and say to her you are a little goose 
 jean valjean grew anxious 
 it cannot be anything said he 
 he left her under some pretext and went into the garden and she saw him examining the gate with great attention 
 during the night she woke up this time she was sure and she distinctly heard some one walking close to the flight of steps beneath her window she ran to her little wicket and opened it 
 in point of fact there was a man in the garden with a large club in his hand just as she was about to scream the moon lighted up the profile it was her father 
 she returned to her bed saying to herself he is very uneasy 
 jean valjean passed that night and the two succeeding nights in the garden 
 cosette saw him through the hole in her shutter 
 on the third night the moon was on the wane and had begun to rise later at one in the morning possibly she heard a loud burst of laughter and her voice calling her 
 cosette 
 she jumped out of bed threw on her and opened her window 
 her father was standing on the below 
 i have waked you for the purpose of reassuring you said he look there is your shadow with the round hat 
 and he pointed out to her on the turf a shadow cast by the moon and which did indeed bear considerable resemblance to the spectre of a man wearing a round hat 
 it was the shadow produced by a of sheet iron with a hood which rose above a neighboring roof 
 cosette joined in his laughter all her lugubrious suppositions were allayed and the next morning as she was at breakfast with her father she made merry over the sinister garden haunted by the shadows of iron 
 jean valjean became quite tranquil once more as for cosette she did not pay much attention to the question whether the was really in the direction of the shadow which she had seen or thought she had seen and whether the moon had been in the same spot in the sky 
 she did not question herself as to the peculiarity of a which is afraid of being caught in the act and which retires when some one looks at its shadow for the shadow had taken the alarm when cosette had turned round and cosette had thought herself very sure of this 
 serenity was fully restored the proof appeared to her to be complete and it quite vanished from her mind whether there could possibly be any one walking in the garden during the evening or at night 
 a few days later however a fresh incident occurred

 chapter xviii 
 
 for the last two days ever since leaving home pierre had been living in the empty house of his deceased benefactor bazdeev this is how it happened 
 when he woke up on the morning after his return to moscow and his interview with count rostopchin he could not for some time make out where he was and what was expected of him when he was informed that among others awaiting him in his reception room there was a frenchman who had brought a letter from his wife the countess helene he felt suddenly overcome by that sense of confusion and hopelessness to which he was apt to succumb he felt that everything was now at an end all was in confusion and crumbling to pieces that nobody was right or wrong the future held nothing and there was no escape from this position smiling unnaturally and muttering to himself he first sat down on the sofa in an attitude of despair then rose went to the door of the reception room and peeped through the crack returned flourishing his arms and took up a book his came in a second time to say that the frenchman who had brought the letter from the countess was very anxious to see him if only for a minute and that someone from widow had called to ask pierre to take charge of her books as she herself was leaving for the country 
 oh yes in a minute wait or no no of course go and say i will come directly pierre replied to the 
 but as soon as the man had left the room pierre took up his hat which was lying on the table and went out of his study by the other door there was no one in the passage he went along the whole length of this passage to the stairs and frowning and rubbing his forehead with both hands went down as far as the first landing the hall porter was standing at the front door from the landing where pierre stood there was a second staircase leading to the back entrance he went down that staircase and out into the yard no one had seen him but there were some carriages waiting and as soon as pierre stepped out of the gate the coachmen and the yard porter noticed him and raised their caps to him when he felt he was being looked at he behaved like an ostrich which hides its head in a bush in order not to be seen he hung his head and quickening his pace went down the street 
 of all the affairs awaiting pierre that day the sorting of joseph books and papers appeared to him the most necessary 
 he hired the first cab he met and told the driver to go to the ponds where the widow house was 
 continually turning round to look at the rows of loaded carts that were making their way from all sides out of moscow and balancing his bulky body so as not to slip out of the ramshackle old vehicle pierre experiencing the joyful feeling of a boy escaping from school began to talk to his driver 
 the man told him that arms were being distributed today at the kremlin and that tomorrow everyone would be sent out beyond the three hills gates and a great battle would be fought there 
 having reached the ponds pierre found the bazdeevs house where he had not been for a long time past he went up to the gate gerasim that sallow beardless old man pierre had seen at torzhok five years before with joseph bazdeev came out in answer to his knock 
 at home asked pierre 
 owing to the present state of things sophia danilovna has gone to the torzhok estate with the children your excellency 
 i will come in all the same i have to look through the books said pierre 
 be so good as to step in makar alexeevich the brother of my late master may the kingdom of heaven be his has remained here but he is in a weak state as you know said the old servant 
 pierre knew that makar alexeevich was joseph brother and a hard drinker 
 yes yes i know let us go in said pierre and entered the house 
 a tall old man with a red nose wearing a dressing gown and with galoshes on his bare feet stood in the anteroom on seeing pierre he muttered something angrily and went away along the passage 
 he was a very clever man but has now grown quite feeble as your honor sees said gerasim will you step into the study pierre nodded as it was sealed up so it has remained but sophia danilovna gave orders that if anyone should come from you they were to have the books 
 pierre went into that gloomy study which he had entered with such trepidation in his lifetime the room dusty and untouched since the death of joseph bazdeev was now even gloomier 
 gerasim opened one of the shutters and left the room on tiptoe pierre went round the study approached the cupboard in which the manuscripts were kept and took out what had once been one of the most important the holy of holies of the order this was the authentic scotch acts with notes and explanations he sat down at the dusty writing table and having laid the manuscripts before him opened them out closed them finally pushed them away and resting his head on his hand sank into meditation 
 gerasim looked cautiously into the study several times and saw pierre always sitting in the same attitude 
 more than two hours passed and gerasim took the liberty of making a slight noise at the door to attract his attention but pierre did not hear him 
 is the cabman to be discharged your honor 
 oh yes said pierre rousing himself and rising hurriedly look here he added taking gerasim by a button of his coat and looking down at the old man with moist shining and ecstatic eyes i say do you know that there is going to be a battle tomorrow 
 we heard so replied the man 
 i beg you not to tell anyone who i am and to do what i ask you 
 yes your excellency replied gerasim will you have something to eat 
 no but i want something else i want peasant clothes and a pistol said pierre unexpectedly blushing 
 yes your excellency said gerasim after thinking for a moment 
 all the rest of that day pierre spent alone in his study and gerasim heard him pacing restlessly from one corner to another and talking to himself and he spent the night on a bed made up for him there 
 gerasim being a servant who in his time had seen many strange things accepted taking up his residence in the house without surprise and seemed pleased to have someone to wait on that same evening without even asking himself what they were wanted for he procured a coat and cap for pierre and promised to get him the pistol next day makar alexeevich came twice that evening shuffling along in his galoshes as far as the door and stopped and looked ingratiatingly at pierre but as soon as pierre turned toward him he wrapped his dressing gown around him with a shamefaced and angry look and hurried away it was when pierre wearing the coat which gerasim had procured for him and had disinfected by steam was on his way with the old man to buy the pistol at the sukharev market that he met the rostovs

 enriched with commentaries by toussaint 
 in the garden near the railing on the street there was a stone bench screened from the eyes of the curious by a plantation of but which could in case of necessity be reached by an arm from the outside past the trees and the gate 
 one evening during that same month of april jean valjean had gone out cosette had seated herself on this bench after sundown the breeze was blowing briskly in the trees cosette was meditating an objectless sadness was taking possession of her little by little that invincible sadness evoked by the evening and which arises perhaps who knows from the mystery of the tomb which is ajar at that hour 
 perhaps fantine was within that shadow 
 cosette rose slowly made the tour of the garden walking on the grass drenched in dew and saying to herself through the species of melancholy somnambulism in which she was plunged really one needs wooden shoes for the garden at this hour one takes cold 
 she returned to the bench 
 as she was about to resume her seat there she observed on the spot which she had quitted a tolerably large stone which had evidently not been there a moment before 
 cosette gazed at the stone asking herself what it meant 
 all at once the idea occurred to her that the stone had not reached the bench all by itself that some one had placed it there that an arm had been thrust through the railing and this idea appeared to alarm her this time the fear was genuine the stone was there 
 no doubt was possible she did not touch it fled without glancing behind her took refuge in the house and immediately closed with shutter bolt and bar the window opening on the flight of steps she inquired of toussaint 
 has my father returned yet 
 not yet mademoiselle 
 we have already noted once for all the fact that toussaint stuttered may we be permitted to dispense with it for the future 
 the musical notation of an infirmity is repugnant to us 
 jean valjean a thoughtful man and given to nocturnal strolls often returned quite late at night 
 toussaint went on cosette are you careful to thoroughly barricade the shutters opening on the garden at least with bars in the evening and to put the little iron things in the little rings that close them 
 oh be easy on that score miss 
 toussaint did not fail in her duty and cosette was well aware of the fact but she could not refrain from adding 
 it is so solitary here 
 so far as that is concerned said toussaint it is true we might be assassinated before we had time to say ouf and monsieur does not sleep in the house to boot but fear nothing miss i fasten the shutters up like prisons lone women 
 that is enough to make one shudder i believe you just imagine what if you were to see men enter your chamber at night and say 
 hold your tongue and begin to cut your throat not the dying so much you die for one must die and all right the abomination of feeling those people touch you and then their knives they be able to cut well with them ah good gracious 
 be quiet said cosette 
 fasten everything thoroughly 
 cosette terrified by the melodrama improvised by toussaint and possibly also by the recollection of the apparitions of the past week which recurred to her memory dared not even say to her go and look at the stone which has been placed on the bench for fear of opening the garden gate and allowing the men to enter she saw that all the doors and windows were carefully fastened made toussaint go all over the house from garret to cellar locked herself up in her own chamber bolted her door looked under her couch went to bed and slept badly 
 all night long she saw that big stone as large as a mountain and full of caverns 
 at property of the rising sun is to make us laugh at all our terrors of the past night and our laughter is in direct proportion to our terror which they have sunrise cosette when she woke viewed her fright as a nightmare and said to herself what have i been thinking of 
 it is like the footsteps that i thought i heard a week or two ago in the garden at night it is like the shadow of the am i becoming a coward the sun which was glowing through the crevices in her shutters and turning the damask curtains crimson reassured her to such an extent that everything vanished from her thoughts even the stone 
 there was no more a stone on the bench than there was a man in a round hat in the garden i dreamed about the stone as i did all the rest 
 she dressed herself descended to the garden ran to the bench and broke out in a cold perspiration 
 the stone was there 
 but this lasted only for a moment 
 that which is terror by night is curiosity by day 
 bah said she come let us see what it is 
 she lifted the stone which was tolerably large 
 beneath it was something which resembled a letter 
 it was a white envelope cosette seized it 
 there was no address on one side no seal on the other 
 yet the envelope though unsealed was not empty papers could be seen inside 
 cosette examined it 
 it was no longer alarm it was no longer curiosity it was a beginning of anxiety 
 cosette drew from the envelope its contents a little notebook of paper each page of which was numbered and bore a few lines in a very fine and rather pretty handwriting as cosette thought 
 cosette looked for a name there was none 
 to whom was this addressed to her probably since a hand had deposited the packet on her bench from whom did it come 
 an irresistible fascination took possession of her she tried to turn away her eyes from the leaflets which were trembling in her hand she gazed at the sky the street the acacias all bathed in light the pigeons fluttering over a neighboring roof and then her glance suddenly fell upon the manuscript and she said to herself that she must know what it contained 
 this is what she read

 chapter xix 
 
 order to retreat through moscow to the ryazan road was issued at night on the first of september 
 the first troops started at once and during the night they marched slowly and steadily without hurry at daybreak however those nearing the town at the dorogomilov bridge saw ahead of them masses of soldiers crowding and hurrying across the bridge ascending on the opposite side and blocking the streets and alleys while endless masses of troops were bearing down on them from behind and an unreasoning hurry and alarm overcame them they all rushed forward to the bridge onto it and to the fords and the boats kutuzov himself had driven round by side streets to the other side of moscow 
 by ten in the morning of the second of september only the rear guard remained in the dorogomilov suburb where they had ample room the main army was on the other side of moscow or beyond it 
 at that very time at ten in the morning of the second of september napoleon was standing among his troops on the poklonny hill looking at the panorama spread out before him from the of august to the second of september that is from the battle of borodino to the entry of the french into moscow during the whole of that agitating memorable week there had been the extraordinary autumn weather that always comes as a surprise when the sun hangs low and gives more heat than in spring when everything shines so brightly in the rare clear atmosphere that the eyes smart when the lungs are strengthened and refreshed by inhaling the aromatic autumn air when even the nights are warm and when in those dark warm nights golden stars startle and delight us continually by falling from the sky 
 at ten in the morning of the second of september this weather still held 
 the brightness of the morning was magical moscow seen from the poklonny hill lay spaciously spread out with her river her gardens and her churches and she seemed to be living her usual life her cupolas glittering like stars in the sunlight 
 the view of the strange city with its peculiar architecture such as he had never seen before filled napoleon with the rather envious and uneasy curiosity men feel when they see an alien form of life that has no knowledge of them this city was evidently living with the full force of its own life by the indefinite signs which even at a distance distinguish a living body from a dead one napoleon from the poklonny hill perceived the throb of life in the town and felt as it were the breathing of that great and beautiful body 
 every russian looking at moscow feels her to be a mother every foreigner who sees her even if ignorant of her significance as the mother city must feel her feminine character and napoleon felt it 
 cette ville asiatique aux innombrables eglises moscou la sainte la voila done enfin cette fameuse ville il etait temps said he and dismounting he ordered a plan of moscow to be spread out before him and summoned lelorgne the interpreter 
 that asiatic city of the innumerable churches holy moscow here it is then at last that famous city it was high time 
 a town captured by the enemy is like a maid who has lost her honor thought he he had said so to tuchkov at smolensk from that point of view he gazed at the oriental beauty he had not seen before it seemed strange to him that his wish which had seemed unattainable had at last been realized in the clear morning light he gazed now at the city and now at the plan considering its details and the assurance of possessing it agitated and awed him 
 but could it be otherwise he thought here is this capital at my feet where is alexander now and of what is he thinking a strange beautiful and majestic city and a strange and majestic moment in what light must i appear to them thought he thinking of his troops here she is the reward for all those fainthearted men he reflected glancing at those near him and at the troops who were approaching and forming up one word from me one movement of my hand and that ancient capital of the tsars would perish but my clemency is always ready to descend upon the vanquished i must be magnanimous and truly great but no it be true that i am in moscow he suddenly thought yet here she is lying at my feet with her golden domes and crosses scintillating and twinkling in the sunshine but i shall spare her on the ancient monuments of barbarism and despotism i will inscribe great words of justice and mercy it is just this which alexander will feel most painfully i know him it seemed to napoleon that the chief import of what was taking place lay in the personal struggle between himself and alexander from the height of the kremlin yes there is the kremlin yes i will give them just laws i will teach them the meaning of true civilization i will make generations of boyars remember their conqueror with love i will tell the deputation that i did not and do not desire war that i have waged war only against the false policy of their court that i love and respect alexander and that in moscow i will accept terms of peace worthy of myself and of my people i do not wish to utilize the fortunes of war to humiliate an honored monarch boyars i will say to them i do not desire war i desire the peace and welfare of all my subjects however i know their presence will inspire me and i shall speak to them as i always do clearly impressively and majestically but can it be true that i am in moscow yes there she lies 
 les boyars said he to his suite 
 bring the boyars to me 
 a general with a brilliant suite galloped off at once to fetch the boyars 
 two hours passed napoleon had lunched and was again standing in the same place on the poklonny hill awaiting the deputation his speech to the boyars had already taken definite shape in his imagination that speech was full of dignity and greatness as napoleon understood it 
 he was himself carried away by the tone of magnanimity he intended to adopt toward moscow in his imagination he appointed days for assemblies at the palace of the tsars at which russian notables and his own would mingle he mentally appointed a governor one who would win the hearts of the people having learned that there were many charitable institutions in moscow he mentally decided that he would shower favors on them all he thought that as in africa he had to put on a burnoose and sit in a mosque so in moscow he must be beneficent like the tsars and in order finally to touch the hearts of the russians and being like all frenchmen unable to imagine anything sentimental without a reference to ma chere ma tendre ma pauvre mere he decided that he would place an inscription on all these establishments in large letters this establishment is dedicated to my dear mother or no it should be simply maison de ma mere he concluded but am i really in moscow yes here it lies before me but why is the deputation from the city so long in appearing he wondered 
 my dear my tender my poor mother 
 house of my mother 
 meanwhile an agitated consultation was being carried on in whispers among his generals and marshals at the rear of his suite those sent to fetch the deputation had returned with the news that moscow was empty that everyone had left it the faces of those who were not conferring together were pale and perturbed they were not alarmed by the fact that moscow had been abandoned by its inhabitants grave as that fact seemed but by the question how to tell the emperor without putting him in the terrible position of appearing ridiculous that he had been awaiting the boyars so long in vain that there were drunken mobs left in moscow but no one else some said that a deputation of some sort must be scraped together others disputed that opinion and maintained that the emperor should first be carefully and skillfully prepared and then told the truth 
 he will have to be told all the same said some gentlemen of the suite but gentlemen 
 the position was the more awkward because the emperor meditating upon his magnanimous plans was pacing patiently up and down before the outspread map occasionally glancing along the road to moscow from under his lifted hand with a bright and proud smile 
 but impossible declared the gentlemen of the suite shrugging their shoulders but not venturing to utter the implied word le ridicule 
 at last the emperor tired of futile expectation his instinct suggesting to him that the sublime moment having been too long drawn out was beginning to lose its sublimity gave a sign with his hand a single report of a signaling gun followed and the troops who were already spread out on different sides of moscow moved into the city through tver kaluga and dorogomilov gates faster and faster vying with one another they moved at the double or at a trot vanishing amid the clouds of dust they raised and making the air ring with a deafening roar of mingling shouts 
 drawn on by the movement of his troops napoleon rode with them as far as the dorogomilov gate but there again stopped and dismounting from his horse paced for a long time by the rampart awaiting the deputation

 book end of which does not resemble the beginning 
 chapter iv 
 
 a heart beneath a stone 
 the reduction of the universe to a single being the expansion of a single being even to god that is love 
 love is the salutation of the angels to the stars 
 how sad is the soul when it is sad through love 
 what a void in the absence of the being who by herself alone fills the world 
 oh how true it is that the beloved being becomes god one could comprehend that god might be jealous of this had not god the father of all evidently made creation for the soul and the soul for love 
 the glimpse of a smile beneath a white crape bonnet with a lilac curtain is sufficient to cause the soul to enter into the palace of dreams 
 god is behind everything but everything hides god 
 things are black creatures are opaque 
 to love a being is to render that being transparent 
 certain thoughts are prayers 
 there are moments when whatever the attitude of the body may be the soul is on its knees 
 parted lovers beguile absence by a thousand chimerical devices which possess however a reality of their own 
 they are prevented from seeing each other they cannot write to each other they discover a multitude of mysterious means to correspond they send each other the song of the birds the perfume of the flowers the smiles of children the light of the sun the sighings of the breeze the rays of stars all creation 
 and why not all the works of god are made to serve love 
 love is sufficiently potent to charge all nature with its messages 
 oh spring 
 thou art a letter that i write to her 
 the future belongs to hearts even more than it does to minds love that is the only thing that can occupy and fill eternity in the infinite the inexhaustible is requisite 
 love participates of the soul itself 
 it is of the same nature like it it is the divine spark like it it is incorruptible indivisible imperishable 
 it is a point of fire that exists within us which is immortal and infinite which nothing can confine and which nothing can extinguish 
 we feel it burning even to the very marrow of our bones and we see it beaming in the very depths of heaven 
 oh love 
 adorations voluptuousness of two minds which understand each other of two hearts which exchange with each other of two glances which penetrate each other 
 you will come to me will you not bliss strolls by twos in the solitudes 
 blessed and radiant days 
 i have sometimes dreamed that from time to time hours detached themselves from the lives of the angels and came here below to traverse the destinies of men 
 god can add nothing to the happiness of those who love except to give them endless duration 
 after a life of love an eternity of love is in fact an augmentation but to increase in intensity even the ineffable felicity which love bestows on the soul even in this world is impossible even to god 
 god is the plenitude of heaven love is the plenitude of man 
 you look at a star for two reasons because it is luminous and because it is impenetrable 
 you have beside you a sweeter radiance and a greater mystery woman 
 all of us whoever we may be have our respirable beings 
 we lack air and we stifle 
 then we die 
 to die for lack of love is horrible suffocation of the soul 
 when love has fused and mingled two beings in a sacred and angelic unity the secret of life has been discovered so far as they are concerned they are no longer anything more than the two boundaries of the same destiny they are no longer anything but the two wings of the same spirit 
 love soar 
 on the day when a woman as she passes before you emits light as she walks you are lost you love 
 but one thing remains for you to do to think of her so intently that she is constrained to think of you 
 what love commences can be finished by god alone 
 true love is in despair and is enchanted over a glove lost or a handkerchief found and eternity is required for its devotion and its hopes 
 it is composed both of the infinitely great and the infinitely little 
 if you are a stone be adamant if you are a plant be the sensitive plant if you are a man be love 
 nothing suffices for love 
 we have happiness we desire paradise we possess paradise we desire heaven 
 oh ye who love each other all this is contained in love understand how to find it there 
 love has contemplation as well as heaven and more than heaven it has voluptuousness 
 does she still come to the luxembourg 
 no sir 
 this is the church where she attends mass is it not 
 she no longer comes here does she still live in this house 
 she has moved away where has she gone to dwell 
 she did not say 
 what a melancholy thing not to know the address of soul 
 love has its childishness other passions have their pettinesses shame on the passions which belittle man 
 honor to the one which makes a child of him 
 there is one strange thing do you know it 
 i dwell in the night there is a being who carried off my sky when she went away 
 oh would that we were lying side by side in the same grave hand in hand and from time to time in the darkness gently caressing a would suffice for my eternity 
 ye who suffer because ye love love yet more 
 to die of love is to live in it 
 love 
 a sombre and starry transfiguration is mingled with this torture there is ecstasy in agony 
 oh joy of the birds 
 it is because they have nests that they sing 
 love is a celestial respiration of the air of paradise 
 deep hearts sage minds take life as god has made it it is a long trial an incomprehensible preparation for an unknown destiny this destiny the true one begins for a man with the first step inside the tomb 
 then something appears to him and he begins to distinguish the definitive 
 the definitive meditate upon that word the living perceive the infinite the definitive permits itself to be seen only by the dead 
 in the meanwhile love and suffer hope and contemplate 
 woe alas to him who shall have loved only bodies forms appearances 
 death will deprive him of all try to love souls you will find them again 
 i encountered in the street a very poor young man who was in love his hat was old his coat was worn his elbows were in holes water trickled through his shoes and the stars through his soul 
 what a grand thing it is to be loved 
 what a far grander thing it is to love 
 the heart becomes heroic by dint of passion it is no longer composed of anything but what is pure it no longer rests on anything that is not elevated and great 
 an unworthy thought can no more germinate in it than a nettle on a glacier the serene and lofty soul inaccessible to vulgar passions and emotions dominating the clouds and the shades of this world its follies its lies its hatreds its vanities its miseries inhabits the blue of heaven and no longer feels anything but profound and subterranean shocks of destiny as the crests of mountains feel the shocks of earthquake 
 if there did not exist some one who loved the sun would become extinct

 book eleven 
 chapter xx 
 
 meanwhile moscow was empty there were still people in it perhaps a fiftieth part of its former inhabitants had remained but it was empty it was empty in the sense that a dying queenless hive is empty 
 in a queenless hive no life is left though to a superficial glance it seems as much alive as other hives 
 the bees circle round a queenless hive in the hot beams of the midday sun as gaily as around the living hives from a distance it smells of honey like the others and bees fly in and out in the same way but one has only to observe that hive to realize that there is no longer any life in it the bees do not fly in the same way the smell and the sound that meet the beekeeper are not the same to the tap on the wall of the sick hive instead of the former instant unanimous humming of tens of thousands of bees with their abdomens threateningly compressed and producing by the rapid vibration of their wings an aerial living sound the only reply is a disconnected buzzing from different parts of the deserted hive from the alighting board instead of the former spirituous fragrant smell of honey and venom and the warm whiffs of crowded life comes an odor of emptiness and decay mingling with the smell of honey there are no longer sentinels sounding the alarm with their abdomens raised and ready to die in defense of the hive there is no longer the measured quiet sound of throbbing activity like the sound of boiling water but diverse discordant sounds of disorder in and out of the hive long black robber bees smeared with honey fly timidly and shiftily they do not sting but crawl away from danger formerly only bees laden with honey flew into the hive and they flew out empty now they fly out laden the beekeeper opens the lower part of the hive and peers in instead of black glossy bees tamed by toil clinging to one legs and drawing out the wax with a ceaseless hum of labor that used to hang in long clusters down to the floor of the hive drowsy shriveled bees crawl about separately in various directions on the floor and walls of the hive instead of a neatly glued floor swept by the bees with the fanning of their wings there is a floor littered with bits of wax excrement dying bees scarcely moving their legs and dead ones that have not been cleared away 
 the beekeeper opens the upper part of the hive and examines the super instead of serried rows of bees sealing up every gap in the combs and keeping the brood warm he sees the skillful complex structures of the combs but no longer in their former state of purity all is neglected and foul black robber bees are swiftly and stealthily prowling about the combs and the short home bees shriveled and listless as if they were old creep slowly about without trying to hinder the robbers having lost all motive and all sense of life drones bumblebees wasps and butterflies knock awkwardly against the walls of the hive in their flight here and there among the cells containing dead brood and honey an angry buzzing can sometimes be heard here and there a couple of bees by force of habit and custom cleaning out the brood cells with efforts beyond their strength laboriously drag away a dead bee or bumblebee without knowing why they do it in another corner two old bees are languidly fighting or cleaning themselves or feeding one another without themselves knowing whether they do it with friendly or hostile intent in a third place a crowd of bees crushing one another attack some victim and fight and smother it and the victim enfeebled or killed drops from above slowly and lightly as a feather among the heap of corpses the keeper opens the two center partitions to examine the brood cells in place of the former close dark circles formed by thousands of bees sitting back to back and guarding the high mystery of generation he sees hundreds of dull listless and sleepy shells of bees they have almost all died unawares sitting in the sanctuary they had guarded and which is now no more they reek of decay and death only a few of them still move rise and feebly fly to settle on the hand lacking the spirit to die stinging him the rest are dead and fall as lightly as fish scales the beekeeper closes the hive chalks a mark on it and when he has time tears out its contents and burns it clean 
 so in the same way moscow was empty when napoleon weary uneasy and morose paced up and down in front of the rampart awaiting what to his mind was a necessary if but formal observance of the proprieties a deputation 
 in various corners of moscow there still remained a few people aimlessly moving about following their old habits and hardly aware of what they were doing 
 when with due circumspection napoleon was informed that moscow was empty he looked angrily at his informant turned away and silently continued to walk to and fro 
 my carriage he said 
 he took his seat beside the on duty and drove into the suburb moscow deserted he said to himself what an incredible event 
 he did not drive into the town but put up at an inn in the dorogomilov suburb 
 the coup de theatre had not come off

 of innovations 
 as the births of living creatures at first are ill shapen so are all innovations 
 which are the births of time yet notwithstanding as those that first bring honour 
 into their family are commonly more worthy than most that succeed so the first 
 precedent if it be good is seldom attained by mutation 
 for ill to nature as it stands perverted hath a natural motion strongest in continuance but good as a forced motion strongest at first surely every medicine is an innovation and he that will not apply new remedies must expect new evils for time is the greatest innovator and if time of course alter things to the worse and wisdom and counsel shall not alter them to the better what shall be the end it is true that what is settled by custom though it be not good yet at least it is fit and those things which have long gone together are as it were confederate within themselves whereas new things piece not so well but though they help by their utility yet they trouble by their inconformity besides they are like strangers more admired and less favoured 
 all this is true if time stood still which contrariwise moveth so round 
 that a froward retention of custom is as turbulent a thing as an innovation 
 and they that reverence too much old times are but a scorn to the new it were good therefore that men in their innovations would follow the example of time itself which indeed innovated greatly but quietly and by degrees scarce to be perceived for otherwise whatsoever is new is unlocked for and ever it mends some and pairs other and he that is holpen takes it for a fortune and thanks the time and he that is hurt for a wrong and imputeth it to the author it is good also not to try experiments in states except me necessity be urgent or the utility evident and well to beware that it be the reformation that draweth on the change and not the desire of change that pretendeth the reformation and lastly that the novelty though it be not rejected yet be held for a suspect and as the scripture saith that we make a stand upon the ancient way and then look about us and discover what is the straight and right way and so to walk in it

 new troubles 
 when the hour came for him to take his departure from the galleys when jean valjean heard in his ear the strange words thou art free the moment seemed improbable and unprecedented a ray of vivid light a ray of the true light of the living suddenly penetrated within him but it was not long before this ray paled 
 jean valjean had been dazzled by the idea of liberty 
 he had believed in a new life he very speedily perceived what sort of liberty it is to which a yellow passport is provided 
 and this was encompassed with much bitterness 
 he had calculated that his earnings during his sojourn in the galleys ought to amount to a hundred and francs 
 it is but just to add that he had forgotten to include in his calculations the forced repose of sundays and festival days during nineteen years which entailed a diminution of about eighty francs 
 at all events his hoard had been reduced by various local levies to the sum of one hundred and nine francs fifteen sous which had been counted out to him on his departure he had understood nothing of this and had thought himself wronged let us say the 
 on the day following his liberation he saw at grasse in front of an distillery some men engaged in unloading bales he offered his services 
 business was pressing they were accepted he set to work 
 he was intelligent robust adroit he did his best the master seemed pleased 
 while he was at work a gendarme passed observed him and demanded his papers 
 it was necessary to show him the yellow passport 
 that done jean valjean resumed his labor a little while before he had questioned one of the workmen as to the amount which they earned each day at this occupation he had been told thirty sous 
 when evening arrived as he was forced to set out again on the following day he presented himself to the owner of the distillery and requested to be paid 
 the owner did not utter a word but handed him fifteen sous 
 he objected he was told that is enough for thee 
 he persisted 
 the master looked him straight between the eyes and said to him beware of the prison 
 there again he considered that he had been robbed 
 society the state by diminishing his hoard had robbed him wholesale now it was the individual who was robbing him at retail 
 liberation is not deliverance 
 one gets free from the galleys but not from the sentence 
 that is what happened to him at grasse 
 we have seen in what manner he was received at d

 the empire strikes back 
 x 
 
 the avenger had spotted the millennium falcon the moment the freighter shot out ofthe enormous asteroid 
 from that moment the imperial ship renewed its pursuit of the freighter with ablinding barrage of fire undaunted by the steady rain of asteroids on its massivehull the star destroyer relentlessly followed the smaller ship 
 the millennium falcon far more maneuverable than the other ship dartedaround the larger asteroids as they came rocketing toward it the falcon wassucceeding in holding its lead in front of the avenger but it was clear that the steadilypursuing ship was not about to abandon the chase 
 suddenly a gigantic asteroid appeared in the millennium path rushingtoward the freighter at incredible speed the ship quickly banked out of the the asteroid hurtled past it only to explode harmlessly against the hull 
 han solo glimpsed the flare through the front window of his the craft that followed them seemed absolutely invulnerable but he had notime to reflect on the differences between the ships it took everything in his powerto maintain control of the falcon as it was pelted by imperial cannon fire 
 princess leia tensely watched the asteroids and cannon fire flaring in theblackness of space outside the cockpit windows her fingers had tightened on thearms of her chair silently she hoped against hope that they would emerge from thischase alive 
 carefully following the bleeping images on a tracking scope to han i can see the edge of the asteroid field sir he reported 
 good han replied soon as clear kick this baby intohyperdrive he was confident that within moments the pursuing star destroyerwould be left behind the repairs in the systemhad been completed and there was nothing left to do now but get the ship free of theasteroid field and into space where it could blast away to safety 
 there was an excited wookiee bark as chewbacca looking out a cockpit that the asteroid density was already decreasing but their escape could not yetbe completed for the avenger was closing in and the bolts from its laser cannonsbombarded the falcon making it lurch and carom to one side 
 han rapidly adjusted the controls and brought his ship back on an even in the next instant the falcon zoomed out of the asteroid field and entered thepeaceful silence of deep space chewbacca whined joyful that theywere at last out of the deadly eager to leave the star destroyer far behind 
 with you chewie han responded vacate the area stand by this time they get the surprise hang on 
 everyone braced himself as han pulled back on the throttle but itwas the crew of the millennium falcon and mostly the captain himself that got thesurprise as once again 
 nothing happened 
 nothing 
 han frantically pulled back the throttle again 
 the ship maintained its sublight speed 
 this fair he exclaimed beginning to panic 
 chewbacca was furious it was rare that he lost his temper with his friend andcaptain but now he was exasperated and roared his fury in angry wookiee growlsand barks 
 be han replied defensively as he looked at his computer screens andquickly noted their readings i checked the transfer circuits 
 chewbacca barked again 
 i tell you this time not my fault sure i checked it 
 leia sighed deeply no in a tone that indicated she had expectedthis catastrophe too 
 sir interjected lost the rear deflector shield one moredirect hit on the back quarter and done for 
 well leia said as she glared at the captain of the millennium falcon whatnow 
 han realized he had only one choice there was no time to plan or to checkcomputer readouts not with the avenger already out of the asteroid field and rapidlygaining on them he had to make a decision based on instinct and hope theyreally had no alternative sharp bank chewie he ordered and pulled back a lever as he looked at his turn this bucket around 
 not even chewbacca could fathom what han had in mind he barked he heard the order quite right 
 you heard me han yelled turn around full power front shield thistime there was no mistaking his command and though chewbacca the suicidal maneuver he obeyed 
 the princess was flabbergasted going to attack them she stammeredin disbelief there a chance of survival now she thought was it possiblethat han really was crazy 
 threepio after running some calculation through his computer brain turned tohan solo sir if i might point out the odds of surviving a direct assault on animperial star destroyer are 
 chewbacca snarled at the golden droid and the immediately shut up no oneon board really wanted to hear the statistics especially since the falcon was alreadybanking into a steep turn to begin its course into the erupting storm of imperialcannon fire 
 solo concentrated intently on his flying it was all he could do to avoid thebarrage of flak bursts rocketing toward the falcon from the imperial ship thefreighter bobbed and weaved as han still heading directly for the star to avoid the bolts 
 no one on his tiny ship had the slightest idea what his plan might be 
 coming in too low the imperial deck officer shouted though he scarcelybelieved what he was seeing 
 captain needa and the star destroyer crew rushed the to bridge towatch the suicidal approach of the millennium falcon while alarms blared all overthe vast imperial ship a small freighter could not do much damage if it collidedagainst a star hull but if it smashed through the bridge windows thecontrol deck would be littered with corpses 
 the panicked tracking officer reported his sighting going to collide 
 shields up captain needa asked he must be insane 
 look out the deck officer yelled 
 the falcon was headed straight for the bridge window and the avenger crew andofficers fell to the floor in terror but at the last instant the freighter veered upsharply then 
 captain needa and his men slowly lifted their head all they saw outside thebridge windows was a peaceful ocean of stars 
 track them captain needa ordered they may come around for anotherpass 
 the tracking officer attempted to find the freighter on his scopes but there wasnothing to find 
 strange he muttered 
 what is it needa asked walking over to look at the tracking monitors forhimself 
 the ship appear on any of our scopes 
 the captain was perplexed it have disappeared could a ship thatsmall have a cloaking device 
 no sir the deck officer answered maybe they went into at thelast minute 
 captain needa felt his anger mounting at about the same rate as hisbefuddlement then why did they attack they could have gone into hyperspacewhen they cleared the asteroid field 
 well no trace of them sir no matter how they did it the trackingofficer replied still unable to locate the millennium falcon on his viewers theonly logical explanation is that they went into 
 the captain was staggered how had that crate of a ship eluded him 
 an aide approached sir lord vader demands an update on the pursuit hereported what should he be told 
 needa braced himself letting the millennium falcon get away when it was soclose was an unforgivable error and he knew he had to face vader and report hisfailure he felt resigned to whatever punishment waited in store for him 
 i am responsible for this he said get the shuttle ready when werendezvous with lord vader i will apologize to him myself turn around and scanthe area one more time 
 then like a living behemoth the great avenger slowly began to turn but therewas still no sign of the millennium falcon 
 the two glowing balls hovered like alien fireflies above body lyingmotionless in the mud standing protectively next to his fallen master a droid periodically extended a mechanical appendage to swat at thedancing objects as if they were mosquitoes but the hovering balls of light leapedjust out of the reach 
 leaned over inert body and whistled in an effort to revivehim but luke stunned unconscious by the charges of these energy balls did notrespond the robot turned to yoda who was sitting calmly on a tree stump andangrily began to beep and scold the little jedi master 
 getting no sympathy from him artoo turned back to luke his electroniccircuits told him there was no use trying to wake luke with his little noises anemergency rescue system was activated within his metal hull and artoo extended asmall metal electrode and rested it on chest uttering a quiet beep of generated a mild electrical charge just strong enough to jolt luke back toconsciousness the chest heaved and he awoke with a start 
 looking dazed the young jedi student shook his head clear he looked aroundhim rubbing his shoulders to ease the ache from seeker balls the seekers still suspended over him luke scowled then he heard yodachucking merrily nearby and turned his glare on him 
 concentration heh yoda laughed his lined face creased with 
 luke was in no mood to return his smile i though those seekers were set forstun he exclaimed angrily 
 that they are the amused yoda answered 
 a lot stronger than used to shoulder ached painfully 
 that would not matter were the force flowing through you yoda jump faster move he exclaimed open yourself to theforce you must 
 the youth was beginning to feel exasperated with his arduous training althoughhe had only been at it a short time he had felt very close to knowing so many times he had failed and had realized how very far away it wasfrom him still but now goading words made him spring to his feet hewas tired of waiting so long for this power weary at his lack of success andincreasingly infuriated by cryptic teachings 
 luke grabbed his laser sword from the mud and quickly ignited it 
 terrified scurried away to safety 
 open to it now luke shouted i feel it come on you little flyingblaster with fire in his eyes luke poised his weapon and moved toward theseekers immediately they zipped away and retreated to hover over yoda 
 no no the jedi master scolded shaking his hoary head this will not is what you feel 
 but i feel the force luke protested vehemently 
 anger anger fear aggression yoda warned the dark side of the force arethey easily they flowquick to join in a fight beware beware beware of heavy price is paid for the power they bring 
 luke lowered his sword and stared at yoda in confusion price he do you mean 
 the dark side beckons yoda said dramatically but if once start you downthe dark path forever will it dominate your destiny consume you it willas it apprentice 
 luke nodded he knew who yoda meant lord vader he said after hethought for a moment luke asked is the dark side stronger 
 no no easier quicker more seductive 
 but how am i to know the good side from the bad he asked puzzled 
 you will know yoda answered when you are at peacecalm passive ajedi uses the force for knowledge never for attack 
 but tell me why luke began 
 no there is no why nothing more will i tell you clear your mind ofquestions quiet now peace voice trailed off but his words had ahypnotic effect on luke the young student stopped protesting and began to feelpeaceful his body and mind relaxing 
 yes yoda murmured calm 
 slowly eyes closed as he let his mind clear of distracting thoughts 
 passive 
 luke heard soothing voice as it entered the receptive darkness of hismind he willed himself to travel along with the words to wherever theymight lead 
 let yourself go 
 when yoda perceived that luke was as relaxed as the young student could be atthis stage he made the tiniest of gestures as he did the two seeker balls above hishead shot toward luke firing stun bolts as they moved 
 in that instant luke sprang to life and ignited his laser sword he leaped to hisfeet and with pure concentration began deflecting the bolts as they spun toward he faced the attack and moved and dodged with extreme grace his leapsinto the air as he jumped to meet the bolts were higher than any he had achievedbefore luke wasted not a single motion as he concentrated only on every bolt as itsped his way 
 then as suddenly as it had begun the seeker attack was over the glowingballs returned to hover on either side of their head 
 the observer let out an electronic sigh and shook hismetal 
 grinning proudly luke looked toward yoda 
 much progress do you make young one the jedi master do you grow but the little instructor would not compliment him morethan that 
 luke was full of pride at his marvelous achievement he watched waiting for further praise from him but yoda did not move or sat then two more seeker balls floated up behind him and moved intoformation with the first two 
 luke grin began to melt away 
 a pair of stormtroopers lifted captain lifeless form fromthe floor of darth imperial star destroyer 
 needa had known that death was the likely consequence of his failure to capturethe millennium falcon he had known too that he had to report the situation tovader and make his formal apology but there was no mercy for failure among theimperial military and vader in disgust had signaled for the death 
 the dark lord turned and admiral piett and two of his captains came to reporttheir findings lord vader piett said our ships have completed their scan of thearea and found nothing the millennium falcon definitely went into probably somewhere on the other side of the galaxy by now 
 vader hissed through his breath mask alert all commands he every possible destination along their last known trajectory and disbursethe fleet to search for them fail me again admiral had quite enough 
 admiral piett thought of the captain whom he had just seen carriedout of the room like a sack of grin and he remembered the excruciating demise ofadmiral ozzel yes my lord he answered trying to hide his fear findthem 
 then the admiral turned to an aide deploy the fleet he instructed as theaide moved to carry out his orders a shadow of worry crossed the was not at all certain that his luck would be any better than that of ozzel or needa 
 lord imperial star destroyer regally moved off into space itsprotecting fleet of smaller craft hovered nearby as the imperial armada left the stardestroyer avenger behind 
 no one on the avenger or in entire fleet had any idea how near they wereto their prey as the avenger glided off into space to continue its search it carriedwith it clinging unnoticed to one side of the huge bridge tower a millennium falcon 
 inside the cockpit all was quiet han solo had stopped his ship andshut down all systems so quickly that even the customarily talkative silent the stood not moving a rivet a look of wonder frozen on his goldenface 
 you could have warned him before you shut him off princess leia at the droid that stood motionless like a bronzed statue 
 oh so sorry han said in mock concern mean to offend your think braking and shutting everything down in that amount of time is easy 
 leia was dubious about entire strategy still not sure what 
 he shrugged off her doubt find out soon enough he thought there any other choice he turned to his copilot chewie check the manualrelease on the landing claws 
 the wookiee barked then pulled himself out of his chair and moved toward therear of the ship 
 leia watched as chewbacca proceeded to disengage the landing claws so that theship could take off without mechanical delay 
 shaking her head incredulously she turned to han what do you have in mindfor your next move 
 the fleet is finally breaking up he answered as he pointed out a port hoping they follow standard imperial procedure and dump their garbage beforethey go into 
 the princess reflected on this strategy for a moment and then began to crazy man might know what he was doing after all impressed she patted himon the head not bad hot shot not bad then what then han said we have to find a safe port around here got any ideas 
 that depends where are we 
 here han said pointing to a configuration of small light points near theanoat system 
 slipping out of her chair leia moved next to him for a better look at the screen 
 funny han said after thinking for a moment i have the feeling been inthis area before let me check my logs 
 you keep logs leia was more impressed by the minute my howorganized she teased 
 well sometimes he answered as he hunted through the computer i knew it this should be interesting 
 i never heard of that system said leia 
 not a system a man lando calrissian a gambler con scoundrel he paused long enough for the last word to sink in and gavethe princess a wink your kind of guy the bespin system a fair distancebut reachable 
 leia looked at one of the computer monitor screens and read the data amining colony she noted 
 a tibanna gas mine han added lando won it in a sabacc match or so heclaims lando and i go way back 
 can you trust him leia asked 
 no but he has no love for the empire that much i know 
 the wookiee barked over the intercom 
 quickly responding han flicked some switches to bring new information to thecomputer screens and then stretched to look out the cockpit window i see i see it he said prepare the manual release then turning to theprincess han said here goes nothing sweetheart he leaned back in his chair andsmiled invitingly at her 
 leia shook her head then grinned shyly and gave him a quick kiss you dohave your moments she reluctantly admitted not many but you have them 
 han was getting used to the compliments and he that he really minded them more and more he was enjoying the fact that sheshared his own sarcastic sense of humor and he was fairly sure that she wasenjoying it too 
 let er go chewie he shouted gleefully 
 the hatch on the underbelly of the avenger yawned open and as the imperialgalactic cruiser zoomed into hyperspace it spewed out its own belt of and sections of irreparable machinery that scattered out into theblack void of space hidden among that trail of refuse the millennium falcontumbled undetected off the side of the larger ship and was left far behind as theavenger streaked away 
 safe at last han solo thought 
 the millennium falcon ignited its ion engines and raced off through the train ofdrifting space junk toward another system 
 but concealed among that scattered debris was another ship 
 and as the falcon roared off to seek the bespin system this other ship ignited itsown engines boba fett the most notorious and dreaded bounty hunter in the his small craft slave to begin its pursuit for bobafett had no intention of losing sight of the millennium falcon its pilot had too higha price on his head and this was one reward that the fearsome bounty hunter wasquite determined to collect 
 luke felt that he was definitely progressing 
 he ran through the yoda perched on his leaped withgazellelike grace over the profusion of foliage and tree roots growing throughout thebog 
 luke had at last begun to detach himself from the emotion of pride he feltunburdened and was finally open to experience fully the flow of the force 
 when his diminutive threw a sliver bar above head the young jedistudent reacted instantly in a flash he turned to slice the bar into four shinysegments before it fell to the ground 
 yoda was pleased and smiled at accomplishment four this force you feel 
 but luke was suddenly distracted he sensed something dangerous somethingevil not right he said to yoda i feel dangerdeath 
 he looked around him trying to see what it was that emitted so powerful an he turned he saw a huge tangled tree it blackened bark dry and crumbling thebase of the tree was surrounded by a small pond of water where the gigantic roots hadgrown to form the opening to a darkly sinister cave 
 luke gently lifted yoda from his neck and set him on the ground jedi student stared at the dark monstrosity breathing hard he found himselfunable to speak 
 you brought me here purposely luke said at last 
 yoda sat on a tangled root and put his gimer stick in his mouth calmlylooking at luke he said nothing 
 luke shivered i feel cold he said still gazing at the tree 
 this tree is strong with the dark side of the force a servant of evil it it you must go 
 luke felt a tremor of apprehension in there 
 only what you take with you yoda said cryptically 
 luke looked warily at yoda and then at the tree he silently resolved to takehis courage his willingness to learn and step within that darkness to face whatever itwas that awaited him he would take nothing more than 
 no he would also bring his lightsaber 
 lighting his weapon luke stepped through the shallow waters of the pond andtoward the dark opening between those great and foreboding roots 
 but the jedi voice stopped him 
 your weapon yoda reproved you need it 
 luke paused and looked again at the tree go into that evil cave completelyunarmed as skilled as luke was becoming he did not feel quite equal to that gripped his saber tighter and shook his head 
 yoda shrugged and placidly gnawed his gimer stick 
 taking a deep breath luke cautiously stepped into the grotesque tree cave 
 the dark inside the cave was so thick that luke could feel it against his skin soblack that the light thrown by his laser sword was quickly absorbed and illuminatedscarcely more than a meter in front of him as he slowly moved forward things brushed against his face and the moisture from the soggy cave floorbegan to seep into his boots 
 as he pushed through the blackness his eyes began to grow accustomed to thedark he saw a corridor before him but as he moved toward it he was surprised bya thick sticky membrane that completely enveloped him like the web of somegigantic spider the mass clung tightly to body thrashing at it with hislightsaber luke finally managed to disentangle himself and clear a path ahead 
 he held his glowing sword in front of him and noticed an object on the cave his lightsaber downward luke illuminated a black shiny beetle the size ofhis hand in an instant the thing scurried up the slimy wall to join a cluster of itsmate 
 luke caught his breath and stepped back at that moment he consideredhunting for the he braced himself and ventured still deeper into the darkchamber 
 he felt the space about him widen as he moved forward using his lightsaber as adim beacon he strained to see in the darkness trying his best to hear but therewas no sound at all nothing 
 then a very loud hiss 
 the sound was familiar he froze where he stood he had heard that hisseven in his nightmares it was the labored breath of a thing that had once been a man 
 out of the darkness a light blue flame of a laser its illumination luke saw the looming figure of darth vader raised his lightedweapon to attack and then lunge 
 prepared by his disciplined jedi training luke was ready he raised his ownlightsaber and perfectly sidestepped attack in the same movement luketurned to vader and with his mind and body completely focused the youthsummoned the force feeling its power within him luke raised his laser weaponand brought it crashing down on head 
 with one powerful stroke the dark head was severed from his and helmet crashed to the ground and rolled about the cave floor with a loudmetallic bang as luke watched in astonishment body was completelyswallowed up by the darkness then luke looked down at the helmet that had cometo rest directly in front of him for a moment it was completely still then thehelmet cracked in half and split open 
 as luke watched in shocked disbelief the broken helmet fell aside to reveal notthe unknown imagined face of darth vader but own face looking up at him 
 he gasped horrified at the sight and then as suddenly as it had appeared thedecapitated head faded away as if in a ghostly vision 
 luke stared at the dark space where the head and pieces of helmet had lain hismind reeled the emotions that raged inside of him were almost too much to bear 
 the tree he told himself it was all some trick of this ugly cave somecharade of arranged because he had come into the tree carrying a weapon 
 he wondered if he were really fighting himself or if he had fallen prey to thetemptations of the dark side of the force he might himself become a figure as evilas darth vader and he wondered if there might be some even darker meaningbehind the unsettling vision

 book one 
 chapter xxiv 
 
 there was now no one in the reception room except prince vasili and the eldest princess who were sitting under the portrait of catherine the great and talking eagerly as soon as they saw pierre and his companion they became silent and pierre thought he saw the princess hide something as she whispered 
 i bear the sight of that woman 
 catiche has had tea served in the small drawing room said prince vasili to anna mikhaylovna go and take something my poor anna mikhaylovna or you will not hold out 
 to pierre he said nothing merely giving his arm a sympathetic squeeze below the shoulder pierre went with anna mikhaylovna into the small drawing room 
 there is nothing so refreshing after a sleepless night as a cup of this delicious russian tea lorrain was saying with an air of restrained animation as he stood sipping tea from a delicate chinese handleless cup before a table on which tea and a cold supper were laid in the small circular room around the table all who were at count house that night had gathered to fortify themselves pierre well remembered this small circular drawing room with its mirrors and little tables during balls given at the house pierre who did not know how to dance had liked sitting in this room to watch the ladies who as they passed through in their ball dresses with diamonds and pearls on their bare shoulders looked at themselves in the brilliantly lighted mirrors which repeated their reflections several times now this same room was dimly lighted by two candles on one small table tea things and supper dishes stood in disorder and in the middle of the night a motley throng of people sat there not merrymaking but somberly whispering and betraying by every word and movement that they none of them forgot what was happening and what was about to happen in the bedroom pierre did not eat anything though he would very much have liked to he looked inquiringly at his monitress and saw that she was again going on tiptoe to the reception room where they had left prince vasili and the eldest princess pierre concluded that this also was essential and after a short interval followed her anna mikhaylovna was standing beside the princess and they were both speaking in excited whispers 
 permit me princess to know what is necessary and what is not necessary said the younger of the two speakers evidently in the same state of excitement as when she had slammed the door of her room 
 but my dear princess answered anna mikhaylovna blandly but impressively blocking the way to the bedroom and preventing the other from passing this be too much for poor uncle at a moment when he needs repose worldly conversation at a moment when his soul is already prepared 
 prince vasili was seated in an easy chair in his familiar attitude with one leg crossed high above the other his cheeks which were so flabby that they looked heavier below were twitching violently but he wore the air of a man little concerned in what the two ladies were saying 
 come my dear anna mikhaylovna let catiche do as she pleases you know how fond the count is of her 
 i even know what is in this paper said the younger of the two ladies addressing prince vasili and pointing to an inlaid portfolio she held in her hand all i know is that his real will is in his writing table and this is a paper he has forgotten 
 she tried to pass anna mikhaylovna but the latter sprang so as to bar her path 
 i know my dear kind princess said anna mikhaylovna seizing the portfolio so firmly that it was plain she would not let go easily dear princess i beg and implore you have some pity on him je vous en conjure 
 the princess did not reply their efforts in the struggle for the portfolio were the only sounds audible but it was evident that if the princess did speak her words would not be flattering to anna mikhaylovna though the latter held on tenaciously her voice lost none of its honeyed firmness and softness 
 pierre my dear come here i think he will not be out of place in a family consultation is it not so prince 
 why you speak cousin suddenly shrieked the princess so loud that those in the drawing room heard her and were startled why do you remain silent when heaven knows who permits herself to interfere making a scene on the very threshold of a dying room intriguer she hissed viciously and tugged with all her might at the portfolio 
 but anna mikhaylovna went forward a step or two to keep her hold on the portfolio and changed her grip 
 prince vasili rose oh said he with reproach and surprise this is absurd come let go i tell you 
 the princess let go 
 and you too 
 but anna mikhaylovna did not obey him 
 let go i tell you i will take the responsibility i myself will go and ask him i does that satisfy you 
 but prince said anna mikhaylovna after such a solemn sacrament allow him a peace here pierre tell them your opinion said she turning to the young man who having come quite close was gazing with astonishment at the angry face of the princess which had lost all dignity and at the twitching cheeks of prince vasili 
 remember that you will answer for the consequences said prince vasili severely you know what you are doing 
 vile woman shouted the princess darting unexpectedly at anna mikhaylovna and snatching the portfolio from her 
 prince vasili bent his head and spread out his hands 
 at this moment that terrible door which pierre had watched so long and which had always opened so quietly burst noisily open and banged against the wall and the second of the three sisters rushed out wringing her hands 
 what are you doing she cried vehemently he is dying and you leave me alone with him 
 her sister dropped the portfolio anna mikhaylovna stooping quickly caught up the object of contention and ran into the bedroom the eldest princess and prince vasili recovering themselves followed her a few minutes later the eldest sister came out with a pale hard face again biting her underlip at sight of pierre her expression showed an irrepressible hatred 
 yes now you may be glad said she this is what you have been waiting for and bursting into tears she hid her face in her handkerchief and rushed from the room 
 prince vasili came next he staggered to the sofa on which pierre was sitting and dropped onto it covering his face with his hand pierre noticed that he was pale and that his jaw quivered and shook as if in an ague 
 ah my friend said he taking pierre by the elbow and there was in his voice a sincerity and weakness pierre had never observed in it before how often we sin how much we deceive and all for what i am near sixty dear friend i too all will end in death all death is awful and he burst into tears 
 anna mikhaylovna came out last she approached pierre with slow quiet steps 
 pierre she said 
 pierre gave her an inquiring look she kissed the young man on his forehead wetting him with her tears then after a pause she said 
 he is no more 
 pierre looked at her over his spectacles 
 come i will go with you try to weep nothing gives such relief as tears 
 she led him into the dark drawing room and pierre was glad no one could see his face anna mikhaylovna left him and when she returned he was fast asleep with his head on his arm 
 in the morning anna mikhaylovna said to pierre 
 yes my dear this is a great loss for us all not to speak of you but god will support you you are young and are now i hope in command of an immense fortune the will has not yet been opened i know you well enough to be sure that this will not turn your head but it imposes duties on you and you must be a man 
 pierre was silent 
 perhaps later on i may tell you my dear boy that if i had not been there god only knows what would have happened you know uncle promised me only the day before yesterday not to forget boris but he had no time i hope my dear friend you will carry out your wish 
 pierre understood nothing of all this and coloring shyly looked in silence at princess anna mikhaylovna after her talk with pierre anna mikhaylovna returned to the rostovs and went to bed on waking in the morning she told the rostovs and all her acquaintances the details of count death she said the count had died as she would herself wish to die that his end was not only touching but edifying as to the last meeting between father and son it was so touching that she could not think of it without tears and did not know which had behaved better during those awful moments the father who so remembered everything and everybody at last and last and had spoken such pathetic words to the son or pierre whom it had been pitiful to see so stricken was he with grief though he tried hard to hide it in order not to sadden his dying father it is painful but it does one good it uplifts the soul to see such men as the old count and his worthy son said she of the behavior of the eldest princess and prince vasili she spoke disapprovingly but in whispers and as a great secret

 chapter 
 
 at the close of three weeks i was able to quit my chamber and move about the house and on the first occasion of my sitting up in the evening i asked catherine to read to me because my eyes were weak we were in the library the master having gone to bed she consented rather unwillingly i fancied and imagining my sort of books did not suit her i bid her place herself in the choice of what she perused she selected one of her own favourites and got forward steadily about an hour then came frequent questions 
 ellen are not you tired you better lie down now be sick keeping up so long ellen 
 no no dear not tired i returned continually 
 perceiving me immovable she essayed another method of showing her disrelish for her occupation it changed to yawning and stretching and 
 ellen tired 
 give over then and talk i answered 
 that was worse she fretted and sighed and liked at her watch till eight and finally went to her room completely overdone with sleep judging by her peevish heavy look and the constant rubbing she inflicted on her eyes the following night she seemed more impatient still and on the third from recovering my company she complained of a headache and left me i thought her conduct odd and having remained alone a long while i resolved on going and inquiring whether she were better and asking her to come and lie on the sofa instead of upstairs in the dark no catherine could i discover upstairs and none below the servants affirmed they had not seen her i listened at mr door all was silence i returned to her apartment extinguished my candle and seated myself in the window 
 the moon shone bright a sprinkling of snow covered the ground and i reflected that she might possibly have taken it into her head to walk about the garden for refreshment i did detect a figure creeping along the inner fence of the park but it was not my young mistress on its emerging into the light i recognized one of the grooms he stood a considerable period viewing the through the grounds then started off at a brisk pace as if he had detected something and reappeared presently leading pony and there she was just dismounted and walking by its side the man took his charge stealthily across the grass towards the stable cathy entered by the casement window of the and glided noiselessly up to where i awaited her she put the door gently to slipped off her snowy shoes untied her hat and was proceeding unconscious of my espionage to lay aside her mantle when i suddenly rose and revealed myself the surprise petrified her an instant she uttered an inarticulate exclamation and stood fixed 
 my dear miss catherine i began too vividly impressed by her recent kindness to break into a scold where have you been riding out at this hour and why should you try to deceive me by telling a tale where have you been speak 
 to the bottom of the park she stammered i tell a tale 
 and nowhere else i demanded 
 no was the muttered reply 
 oh catherine i cried sorrowfully you know you have been doing wrong or you be driven to uttering an untruth to me that does grieve me rather be three months ill than hear you frame a deliberate lie 
 she sprang forward and bursting into tears threw her arms round my neck 
 well ellen so afraid of you being angry she said promise not to be angry and you shall know the very truth i hate to hide it 
 we sat down in the i assured her i would not scold whatever her secret might be and i guessed it of course so she commenced 
 been to wuthering heights ellen and never missed going a day since you fell ill except thrice before and twice after you left your room i gave michael books and pictures to prepare minny every evening and to put her back in the stable you scold him either mind i was at the heights by six and generally stayed till half past eight and then galloped home it was not to amuse myself that i went i was often wretched all the time now and then i was happy once in a week perhaps at first i expected there would be sad work persuading you to let me keep my word to linton for i had engaged to call again next day when we quitted him but as you stayed upstairs on the morrow i escaped that trouble and while michael was refastening the lock of the park door in the afternoon i got possession of the key and told him how my cousin wished me to visit him because he was sick and come to the grange and how papa would object to my going and then i negotiated with him about the pony he is fond of reading and he thinks of leaving soon to get married so he offered if i would lend him books out of the library to do what i wished but i preferred giving him my own and that satisfied him better 
 on my second visit linton seemed in lively spirits and zillah that is their housekeeper made us a clean room and a good fire and told us that as joseph was out at a prayer meeting and hareton earnshaw was off with his our woods of pheasants as i heard might do what we liked she brought me some warm wine and gingerbread and appeared exceedingly and linton sat in the armchair and i in the little on the hearthstone and we laughed and talked so merrily and found so much to say we planned where we would go and what we would do in summer i repeat that because you would call it silly 
 one time however we were near quarrelling he said the pleasantest manner of spending a hot july day was lying from morning till evening on a bank of heath in the middle of the moors with the bees humming dreamily about among the bloom and the larks singing high up overhead and the blue sky and bright sun shining steadily and cloudlessly that was his most perfect idea of happiness mine was rocking in a rustling green tree with a west wind blowing and bright white clouds flitting rapidly above and not only larks but throstles and blackbirds and linnets and cuckoos pouring out music on every side and the moors seen at a distance broken into cool dusky dells but close by great swells of long grass undulating in waves to the breeze and woods and sounding water and the whole world awake and wild with joy he wanted all to lie in an ecstasy of peace i wanted all to sparkle and dance in a glorious jubilee i said his heaven would be only half alive and he said mine would be drunk i said i should fall asleep in his and he said he could not breathe in mine and began to grow very snappish at last we agreed to try both as soon as the right weather came and then we kissed each other and were friends 
 after sitting still an hour i looked at the great room with its smooth uncarpeted floor and thought how nice it would be to play in if we removed the table and i asked linton to call zillah in to help us and have a game at buff she should try to catch us you used to you know ellen he there was no pleasure in it he said but he consented to play at ball with me we found two in a cupboard among a heap of old toys tops and hoops and battledores and shuttlecocks one was marked c and the other h i wished to have the c because that stood for catherine and the h might be for heathcliff his name but the bran came out of h and linton like it i beat him constantly and he got cross again and coughed and returned to his chair that night though he easily recovered his good humour he was charmed with two or three pretty songs ellen and when i was obliged to go he begged and entreated me to come the following evening and i promised minny and i went flying home as light as air and i dreamt of wuthering heights and my sweet darling cousin till morning 
 on the morrow i was sad partly because you were poorly and partly that i wished my father knew and approved of my excursions but it was beautiful moonlight after tea and as i rode on the gloom cleared i shall have another happy evening i thought to myself and what delights me more my pretty linton will i trotted up their garden and was turning round to the back when that fellow earnshaw met me took my bridle and bid me go in by the front entrance he patted neck and said she was a bonny beast and appeared as if he wanted me to speak to him i only told him to leave my horse alone or else it would kick him he answered in his vulgar accent it do much hurt if it did and surveyed its legs with a smile i was half inclined to make it try however he moved off to open the door and as he raised the latch he looked up to the inscription above and said with a stupid mixture of awkwardness and elation 
 miss catherine i can read yon nah 
 wonderful i exclaimed pray let us hear are grown clever 
 he spelt and drawled over by syllables the earnshaw 
 and the figures i cried encouragingly perceiving that he came to a dead halt 
 i cannot tell them yet he answered 
 oh you dunce i said laughing heartily at his failure 
 the fool stared with a grin hovering about his lips and a scowl gathering over his eyes as if uncertain whether he might not join in my mirth whether it were not pleasant familiarity or what it really was contempt i settled his doubts by suddenly retrieving my gravity and desiring him to walk away for i came to see linton not him he saw that by the his hand from the latch and skulked off a picture of mortified vanity he imagined himself to be as accomplished as linton i suppose because he could spell his own name and was marvellously discomfited that i think the same 
 stop miss catherine dear i interrupted i shall not scold but i like your conduct there if you had remembered that hareton was your cousin as much as master heathcliff you would have felt how improper it was to behave in that way at least it was praiseworthy ambition for him to desire to be as accomplished as linton and probably he did not learn merely to show off you had made him ashamed of his ignorance before i have no doubt and he wished to remedy it and please you to sneer at his imperfect attempt was very bad breeding had you been brought up in his circumstances would you be less rude he was as quick and as intelligent a child as ever you were and hurt that he should be despised now because that base heathcliff has treated him so unjustly 
 well ellen you cry about it will you she exclaimed surprised at my earnestness but wait and you shall hear if he conned his a b c to please me and if it were worth while being civil to the brute i entered linton was lying on the settle and half got up to welcome me 
 ill tonight catherine love he said and you must have all the talk and let me listen come and sit by me i was sure you break your word and make you promise again before you go 
 i knew now that i tease him as he was ill and i spoke softly and put no questions and avoided irritating him in any way i had brought some of my nicest books for him he asked me to read a little of one and i was about to comply when earnshaw burst the door open having gathered venom with reflection he advanced direct to us seized linton by the arm and swung him off the seat 
 get to thy own room he said in a voice almost inarticulate with passion and his face looked swelled and furious take her there if she comes to see thee thou keep me out of this begone wi ye both 
 he swore at us and left linton no time to answer nearly throwing him into the kitchen and he clenched his fist as i followed seemingly longing to knock me down i was afraid for a moment and i let one volume fall he kicked it after me and shut us out i heard a malignant crackly laugh by the fire and turning beheld that odious joseph standing rubbing his bony hands and quivering 
 aw wer sure sarve ye eht a grand lad getten t raight sperrit in him he he knaws as weel as aw do who sud be ech ech he mad ye skift properly ech ech ech 
 where must we go i said to my cousin disregarding the old mockery 
 linton was white and trembling he was not pretty then ellen oh no he looked frightful for his thin face and large eyes were wrought into an expression of frantic powerless fury he grasped the handle of the door and shook it it was fastened inside 
 if you let me in kill you let me in kill you he rather shrieked than said devil kill kill you 
 joseph uttered his croaking laugh again 
 thear t father he cried father alias summut uh orther side in us niver heed hareton be cannot get at thee 
 i took hold of hands and tried to pull him away but he shrieked so shockingly that i dared not proceed at last his cries were choked by a dreadful fit of coughing blood gushed from his mouth and he fell on the ground i ran into the yard sick with terror and called for zillah as loud as i could she soon heard me she was milking the cows in a shed behind the barn and hurrying from her work she inquired what there was to do i breath to explain dragging her in i looked about for linton earnshaw had come out to examine the mischief he had caused and he was then conveying the poor thing upstairs zillah and i ascended after him but he stopped me at the top of the steps and said i go in i must go home i exclaimed that he had killed linton and i would enter joseph locked the door and declared i should do no sich stuff and asked me whether i were bahn to be as mad as him i stood crying till the housekeeper reappeared she affirmed he would be better in a bit but he do with that shrieking and din and she took me and nearly carried me into the house 
 ellen i was ready to tear my hair off my head i sobbed and wept so that my eyes were almost blind and the ruffian you have such sympathy with stood opposite presuming every now and then to bid me wisht and denying that it was his fault and finally frightened by my assertions that i would tell papa and that he should be put in prison and hanged he commenced blubbering himself and hurried out to hide his cowardly agitation still i was not rid of him when at length they compelled me to depart and i had got some hundred yards off the premises he suddenly issued from the shadow of the roadside and checked minny and took hold of me 
 miss catherine ill grieved he began but rayther too bad 
 i gave him a cut with my whip thinking perhaps he would murder me he let go thundering one of his horrid curses and i galloped home more than half out of my senses 
 i bid you good night that evening and i go to wuthering heights the next i wished to exceedingly but i was strangely excited and dreaded to hear that linton was dead sometimes and sometimes shuddered at the thought of encountering hareton on the third day i took courage at least i bear longer suspense and stole off once more i went at five and walked fancying i might manage to creep into the house and up to room unobserved however the dogs gave notice of my approach zillah received me and saying the lad was mending nicely showed me into a small tidy carpeted apartment where to my inexpressible joy i beheld linton laid on a little sofa reading one of my books but he would neither speak to me nor look at me through a whole hour ellen he has such an unhappy temper and what quite confounded me when he did open his mouth it was to utter the falsehood that i had occasioned the uproar and hareton was not to blame unable to reply except passionately i got up and walked from the room he sent after me a faint catherine he did not reckon on being answered so but i turn back and the morrow was the second day on which i stayed at home nearly determined to visit him no more but it was so miserable going to bed and getting up and never hearing anything about him that my resolution melted into air before it was properly formed it had appeared wrong to take the journey once now it seemed wrong to refrain michael came to ask if he must saddle minny i said yes and considered myself doing a duty as she bore me over the hills i was forced to pass the front windows to get to the court it was no use trying to conceal my presence 
 young master is in the house said zillah as she saw me making for the parlour i went in earnshaw was there also but he quitted the room directly linton sat in the great armchair half asleep walking up to the fire i began in a serious tone partly meaning it to be true 
 as you like me linton and as you think i come on purpose to hurt you and pretend that i do so every time this is our last meeting let us say goodbye and tell mr heathcliff that you have no wish to see me and that he invent any more falsehoods on the subject 
 sit down and take your hat off catherine he answered you are so much happier than i am you ought to be better papa talks enough of my defects and shows enough scorn of me to make it natural i should doubt myself i doubt whether i am not altogether as worthless as he calls me frequently and then i feel so cross and bitter i hate everybody i am worthless and bad in temper and bad in spirit almost always and if you choose you may say goodbye get rid of an annoyance only catherine do me this justice believe that if i might be as sweet and as kind and as good as you are i would be as willingly and more so than as happy and as healthy and believe that your kindness has made me love you deeper than if i deserved your love and though i and cannot help showing my nature to you i regret it and repent it and shall regret and repent it till i die 
 i felt he spoke the truth and i felt i must forgive him and though he should quarrel the next moment i must forgive him again we were reconciled but we cried both of us the whole time i stayed not entirely for sorrow yet i was sorry linton had that distorted nature never let his friends be at ease and never be at ease himself i have always gone to his little parlour since that night because his father returned the day after 
 about three times i think we have been merry and hopeful as we were the first evening the rest of my visits were dreary and troubled now with his selfishness and spite and now with his sufferings but learned to endure the former with nearly as little resentment as the latter mr heathcliff purposely avoids me 
 i have hardly seen him at all last sunday indeed coming earlier than usual i heard him abusing poor linton cruelly for his conduct of the night before i tell how he knew of it unless he listened linton had certainly behaved provokingly however it was the business of nobody but me and i interrupted mr lecture by entering and telling him so he burst into a laugh and went away saying he was glad i took that view of the matter since then told linton he must whisper his bitter things now ellen you have heard all and i be prevented from going to wuthering heights except by inflicting misery on two people whereas if only not tell papa my going need disturb the tranquillity of none not tell will you it will be very heartless if you do 
 make up my mind on that point by tomorrow miss catherine i replied it requires some study and so leave you to your rest and go think it over 
 i thought it over aloud in my presence walking straight from her room to his and relating the whole story with the exception of her conversations with her cousin and any mention of hareton mr linton was alarmed and distressed more than he would acknowledge to me in the morning catherine learnt my betrayal of her confidence and she learnt also that her secret visits were to end in vain she wept and writhed against the interdict and implored her father to have pity on linton all she got to comfort her was a promise that he would write and give him leave to come to the grange when he pleased but explaining that he must no longer expect to see catherine at wuthering heights perhaps had he been aware of his disposition and state of health he would have seen fit to withhold even that slight consolation

 chapter 
 
 in order that we may start afresh and go to wedding with free minds it will be well to begin with a little gossip about the marches and here let me premise that if any of the elders think there is too much lovering in the story as i fear they may not afraid the young folks will make that objection i can only say with mrs march what can you expect when i have four gay girls in the house and a dashing young neighbor over the way 
 the three years that have passed have brought but few changes to the quiet family the war is over and mr march safely at home busy with his books and the small parish which found in him a minister by nature as by grace a quiet studious man rich in the wisdom that is better than learning the charity which calls all mankind brother the piety that blossoms into character making it august and lovely 
 these attributes in spite of poverty and the strict integrity which shut him out from the more worldly successes attracted to him many admirable persons as naturally as sweet herbs draw bees and as naturally he gave them the honey into which fifty years of hard experience had distilled no bitter drop earnest young men found the scholar as young at heart as they thoughtful or troubled women instinctively brought their doubts to him sure of finding the gentlest sympathy the wisest counsel sinners told their sins to the old man and were both rebuked and saved gifted men found a companion in him ambitious men caught glimpses of nobler ambitions than their own and even worldlings confessed that his beliefs were beautiful and true although they pay 
 to outsiders the five energetic women seemed to rule the house and so they did in many things but the quiet scholar sitting among his books was still the head of the family the household conscience anchor and comforter for to him the busy anxious women always turned in troublous times finding him in the truest sense of those sacred words husband and father 
 the girls gave their hearts into their keeping their souls into their and to both parents who lived and labored so faithfully for them they gave a love that grew with their growth and bound them tenderly together by the sweetest tie which blesses life and outlives death 
 mrs march is as brisk and cheery though rather grayer than when we saw her last and just now so absorbed in affairs that the hospitals and homes still full of wounded boys and soldiers widows decidedly miss the motherly visits 
 john brooke did his duty manfully for a year got wounded was sent home and not allowed to return he received no stars or bars but he deserved them for he cheerfully risked all he had and life and love are very precious when both are in full bloom perfectly resigned to his discharge he devoted himself to getting well preparing for business and earning a home for meg with the good sense and sturdy independence that characterized him he refused mr more generous offers and accepted the place of bookkeeper feeling better satisfied to begin with an honestly earned salary than by running any risks with borrowed money 
 meg had spent the time in working as well as waiting growing womanly in character wise in housewifely arts and prettier than ever for love is a great beautifier she had her girlish ambitions and hopes and felt some disappointment at the humble way in which the new life must begin ned moffat had just married sallie gardiner and meg help contrasting their fine house and carriage many gifts and splendid outfit with her own and secretly wishing she could have the same but somehow envy and discontent soon vanished when she thought of all the patient love and labor john had put into the little home awaiting her and when they sat together in the twilight talking over their small plans the future always grew so beautiful and bright that she forgot splendor and felt herself the richest happiest girl in christendom 
 jo never went back to aunt march for the old lady took such a fancy to amy that she bribed her with the offer of drawing lessons from one of the best teachers going and for the sake of this advantage amy would have served a far harder mistress so she gave her mornings to duty her afternoons to pleasure and prospered finely jo meantime devoted herself to literature and beth who remained delicate long after the fever was a thing of the past not an invalid exactly but never again the rosy healthy creature she had been yet always hopeful happy and serene and busy with the quiet duties she loved friend and an angel in the house long before those who loved her most had learned to know it 
 as long as the spread eagle paid her a dollar a column for her rubbish as she called it jo felt herself a woman of means and spun her little romances diligently but great plans fermented in her busy brain and ambitious mind and the old tin kitchen in the garret held a slowly increasing pile of blotted manuscript which was one day to place the name of march upon the roll of fame 
 laurie having dutifully gone to college to please his grandfather was now getting through it in the easiest possible manner to please himself a universal favorite thanks to money manners much talent and the kindest heart that ever got its owner into scrapes by trying to get other people out of them he stood in great danger of being spoiled and probably would have been like many another promising boy if he had not possessed a talisman against evil in the memory of the kind old man who was bound up in his success the motherly friend who watched over him as if he were her son and last but not least by any means the knowledge that four innocent girls loved admired and believed in him with all their hearts 
 being only a glorious human boy of course he frolicked and flirted grew dandified aquatic sentimental or gymnastic as college fashions ordained hazed and was hazed talked slang and more than once came perilously near suspension and expulsion but as high spirits and the love of fun were the causes of these pranks he always managed to save himself by frank confession honorable atonement or the irresistible power of persuasion which he possessed in perfection in fact he rather prided himself on his narrow escapes and liked to thrill the girls with graphic accounts of his triumphs over wrathful tutors dignified professors and vanquished enemies the men of my class were heroes in the eyes of the girls who never wearied of the exploits of our fellows and were frequently allowed to bask in the smiles of these great creatures when laurie brought them home with him 
 amy especially enjoyed this high honor and became quite a belle among them for her ladyship early felt and learned to use the gift of fascination with which she was endowed meg was too much absorbed in her private and particular john to care for any other lords of creation and beth too shy to do more than peep at them and wonder how amy dared to order them about so but jo felt quite in her own element and found it very difficult to refrain from imitating the gentlemanly attitudes phrases and feats which seemed more natural to her than the decorums prescribed for young ladies they all liked jo immensely but never fell in love with her though very few escaped without paying the tribute of a sentimental sigh or two at shrine and speaking of sentiment brings us very naturally to the dovecote 
 that was the name of the little brown house mr brooke had prepared for first home laurie had christened it saying it was highly appropriate to the gentle lovers who went on together like a pair of turtledoves with first a bill and then a coo it was a tiny house with a little garden behind and a lawn about as big as a pocket handkerchief in the front here meg meant to have a fountain shrubbery and a profusion of lovely flowers though just at present the fountain was represented by a urn very like a dilapidated slopbowl the shrubbery consisted of several young larches undecided whether to live or die and the profusion of flowers was merely hinted by regiments of sticks to show where seeds were planted but inside it was altogether charming and the happy bride saw no fault from garret to cellar to be sure the hall was so narrow it was fortunate that they had no piano for one never could have been got in whole the dining room was so small that six people were a tight fit and the kitchen stairs seemed built for the express purpose of precipitating both servants and china into the coalbin but once get used to these slight blemishes and nothing could be more complete for good sense and good taste had presided over the furnishing and the result was highly satisfactory there were no tables long mirrors or lace curtains in the little parlor but simple furniture plenty of books a fine picture or two a stand of flowers in the bay window and scattered all about the pretty gifts which came from friendly hands and were the fairer for the loving messages they brought 
 i think the parian psyche laurie gave lost any of its beauty because john put up the bracket it stood upon that any upholsterer could have draped the plain muslin curtains more gracefully than artistic hand or that any was ever better provided with good wishes merry words and happy hopes than that in which jo and her mother put away few boxes barrels and bundles and i am morally certain that the spandy new kitchen never could have looked so cozy and neat if hannah had not arranged every pot and pan a dozen times over and laid the fire all ready for lighting the minute mis brooke came home i also doubt if any young matron ever began life with so rich a supply of dusters holders and piece bags for beth made enough to last till the silver wedding came round and invented three different kinds of dishcloths for the express service of the bridal china 
 people who hire all these things done for them never know what they lose for the homeliest tasks get beautified if loving hands do them and meg found so many proofs of this that everything in her small nest from the kitchen roller to the silver vase on her parlor table was eloquent of home love and tender forethought 
 what happy times they had planning together what solemn shopping excursions what funny mistakes they made and what shouts of laughter arose over ridiculous bargains in his love of jokes this young gentleman though nearly through college was a much of a boy as ever his last whim had been to bring with him on his weekly visits some new useful and ingenious article for the young housekeeper now a bag of remarkable clothespins next a wonderful nutmeg grater which fell to pieces at the first trial a knife cleaner that spoiled all the knives or a sweeper that picked the nap neatly off the carpet and left the dirt soap that took the skin off hands infallible cements which stuck firmly to nothing but the fingers of the deluded buyer and every kind of tinware from a toy savings bank for odd pennies to a wonderful boiler which would wash articles in its own steam with every prospect of exploding in the process 
 in vain meg begged him to stop john laughed at him and jo called him mr toodles he was possessed with a mania for patronizing yankee ingenuity and seeing his friends fitly furnished forth so each week beheld some fresh absurdity 
 everything was done at last even to arranging different colored soaps to match the different colored rooms and setting the table for the first meal 
 are you satisfied does it seem like home and do you feel as if you should be happy here asked mrs march as she and her daughter went through the new kingdom arm in arm for just then they seemed to cling together more tenderly than ever 
 yes mother perfectly satisfied thanks to you all and so happy that i talk about it with a look that was far better than words 
 if she only had a servant or two it would be all right said amy coming out of the parlor where she had been trying to decide whether the bronze mercury looked best on the whatnot or the mantlepiece 
 mother and i have talked that over and i have made up my mind to try her way first there will be so little to do that with lotty to run my errands and help me here and there i shall only have enough work to keep me from getting lazy or homesick answered meg tranquilly 
 sallie moffat has four began amy 
 if meg had four the house hold them and master and missis would have to camp in the garden broke in jo who enveloped in a big blue pinafore was giving the last polish to the door handles 
 sallie a poor wife and many maids are in keeping with her fine establishment meg and john begin humbly but i have a feeling that there will be quite as much happiness in the little house as in the big one a great mistake for young girls like meg to leave themselves nothing to do but dress give orders and gossip when i was first married i used to long for my new clothes to wear out or get torn so that i might have the pleasure of mending them for i got heartily sick of doing fancywork and tending my pocket handkerchief 
 why you go into the kitchen and make messes as sallie says she does to amuse herself though they never turn out well and the servants laugh at her said meg 
 i did after a while not to mess but to learn of hannah how things should be done that my servants need not laugh at me it was play then but there came a time when i was truly grateful that i not only possessed the will but the power to cook wholesome food for my little girls and help myself when i could no longer afford to hire help you begin at the other end meg dear but the lessons you learn now will be of use to you when john is a richer man for the mistress of a house however splendid should know how work ought to be done if she wishes to be well and honestly served 
 yes mother sure of that said meg listening respectfully to the little lecture for the best of women will hold forth upon the all absorbing subject of house keeping do you know i like this room most of all in my baby house added meg a minute after as they went upstairs and she looked into her linen closet 
 beth was there laying the snowy piles smoothly on the shelves and exulting over the goodly array all three laughed as meg spoke for that linen closet was a joke you see having said that if meg married that brooke she have a cent of her money aunt march was rather in a quandary when time had appeased her wrath and made her repent her vow she never broke her word and was much exercised in her mind how to get round it and at last devised a plan whereby she could satisfy herself mrs carrol mamma was ordered to buy have made and marked a generous supply of house and table linen and send it as her present all of which was faithfully done but the secret leaked out and was greatly enjoyed by the family for aunt march tried to look utterly unconscious and insisted that she could give nothing but the pearls long promised to the first bride 
 a housewifely taste which i am glad to see i had a young friend who set up housekeeping with six sheets but she had finger bowls for company and that satisfied her said mrs march patting the damask tablecloths with a truly feminine appreciation of their fineness 
 i a single finger bowl but this is a setout that will last me all my days hannah says and meg looked quite contented as well she might 
 a tall young fellow with a cropped head a felt basin of a hat and a flyaway coat came tramping down the road at a great pace walked over the low fence without stopping to open the gate straight up to mrs march with both hands out and a hearty 
 here i am mother yes all right 
 the last words were in answer to the look the elder lady gave him a kindly questioning look which the handsome eyes met so frankly that the little ceremony closed as usual with a motherly kiss 
 for mrs john brooke with the congratulations and compliments bless you beth what a refreshing spectacle you are jo amy you are getting altogether too handsome for a single lady 
 as laurie spoke he delivered a brown paper parcel to meg pilled hair ribbon stared at bib pinafore and fell into an attitude of mock rapture before amy then shook hands all round and everyone began to talk 
 where is john asked meg anxiously 
 stopped to get the license for tomorrow 
 which side won the last match teddy inquired jo who persisted in feeling an interest in manly sports despite her nineteen years 
 ours of course wish been there to see 
 how is the lovely miss randal asked amy with a significant smile 
 more cruel than ever you see how pining away and laurie gave his broad chest a sounding slap and heaved a melodramatic sigh 
 the last joke undo the bundle and see meg said beth eying the knobby parcel with curiosity 
 a useful thing to have in the house in case of fire or thieves observed laurie as a rattle appeared amid the laughter of the girls 
 any time when john is away and you get frightened mrs meg just swing that out of the front window and it will rouse the neighborhood in a jiffy nice thing it and laurie gave them a sample of its powers that made them cover up their ears 
 gratitude for you and speaking of gratitude reminds me to mention that you may thank hannah for saving your wedding cake from destruction i saw it going into your house as i came by and if she defended it manfully have had a pick at it for it looked like a remarkably plummy one 
 i wonder if you will ever grow up laurie said meg in a matronly tone 
 doing my best but get much higher afraid as six feet is about all men can do in these degenerate days responded the young gentleman whose head was about level with the little chandelier 
 i suppose it would be profanation to eat anything in this bower so as tremendously hungry i propose an adjournment he added presently 
 mother and i are going to wait for john there are some last things to settle said meg bustling away 
 beth and i are going over to kitty to get more flowers for tomorrow added amy tying a picturesque hat over her picturesque curls and enjoying the effect as much as anybody 
 come jo desert a fellow in such a state of exhaustion i get home without help take off your apron whatever you do peculiarly becoming said laurie as jo bestowed his especial aversion in her capacious pocket and offered her arm to support his feeble steps 
 now teddy i want to talk seriously to you about tomorrow began jo as they strolled away together you must promise to behave well and not cut up any pranks and spoil our plans 
 not a prank 
 and say funny things when we ought to be sober 
 i never do you are the one for that 
 and i implore you not to look at me during the ceremony i shall certainly laugh if you do 
 you see me be crying so hard that the thick fog round you will obscure the prospect 
 i never cry unless for some great affliction 
 such as fellows going to college hey cut in laurie with suggestive laugh 
 be a peacock i only moaned a trifle to keep the girls company 
 exactly i say jo how is grandpa this week pretty amiable 
 very why have you got into a scrape and want to know how take it asked jo rather sharply 
 now jo do you think look your mother in the face and say all right if it and laurie stopped short with an injured air 
 no i 
 then go and be suspicious i only want some money said laurie walking on again appeased by her hearty tone 
 you spend a great deal teddy 
 bless you i spend it it spends itself somehow and is gone before i know it 
 you are so generous and that you let people borrow and say no to anyone we heard about henshaw and all you did for him if you always spent money in that way no one would blame you said jo warmly 
 oh he made a mountain out of a molehill you have me let that fine fellow work himself to death just for want of a little help when he is worth a dozen of us lazy chaps would you 
 of course not but i see the use of your having seventeen waistcoats endless neckties and a new hat every time you come home i thought got over the dandy period but every now and then it breaks out in a new spot just now the fashion to be hideous to make your head look like a scrubbing brush wear a strait jacket orange gloves and clumping boots if it was cheap ugliness say nothing but it costs as much as the other and i get any satisfaction out of it 
 laurie threw back his head and laughed so heartily at this attack that the felt hat fell off and jo walked on it which insult only afforded him an opportunity for expatiating on the advantages of a costume as he folded up the maltreated hat and stuffed it into his pocket 
 lecture any more a good soul i have enough all through the week and like to enjoy myself when i come home get myself up regardless of expense tomorrow and be a satisfaction to my friends 
 leave you in peace if only let your hair grow not aristocratic but i do object to being seen with a person who looks like a young prize fighter observed jo severely 
 this unassuming style promotes study why we adopt it returned laurie who certainly could not be accused of vanity having voluntarily sacrificed a handsome curly crop to the demand for stubble 
 by the way jo i think that little parker is really getting desperate about amy he talks of her constantly writes poetry and moons about in a most suspicious manner better nip his little passion in the bud he added laurie in a confidential elder brotherly tone after a silence 
 of course he had we want any more marrying in this family for years to come mercy on us what are the children thinking of and jo looked as much scandalized as if amy and little parker were not yet in their teens 
 a fast age and i know what we are coming to you are a mere infant but go next jo and be left lamenting said laurie shaking his head over the degeneracy of the times 
 be alarmed not one of the agreeable sort nobody will want me and a mercy for there should always be one old maid in a family 
 you give anyone a chance said laurie with a sidelong glance and a little more color than before in his sunburned face you show the soft side of your character and if a fellow gets a peep at it by accident and help showing that he likes it you treat him as mrs gummidge did her sweetheart throw cold water over him and get so thorny no one dares touch or look at you 
 i like that sort of thing too busy to be worried with nonsense and i think dreadful to break up families so now say any more about it wedding has turned all our heads and we talk of nothing but lovers and such absurdities i wish to get cross so change the subject and jo looked quite ready to fling cold water on the slightest provocation 
 whatever his feelings might have been laurie found a vent for them in a long low whistle and the fearful prediction as they parted at the gate mark my words jo go next

lionfish nov chapter rita scoopcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 everybody got up late on boxing day the gryffindor common room was much quieter than it had been lately many yawns punctuating the lazy conversations hair was bushy again she confessed to harry that she had used liberal amounts of hair potion on it for the ball but way too much bother to do every day she said scratching a purring crookshanks behind the ears 
 
 ron and hermione seemed to have reached an unspoken agreement not to discuss their argument they were being quite friendly to each other though oddly formal ron and harry wasted no time in telling hermione about the conversation they had overheard between madame maxime and hagrid but hermione seem to find the news that hagrid was a nearly as shocking as ron did 
 
 well i thought he must be she said shrugging i knew he be pure giant because about twenty feet tall but honestly all this hysteria about giants they all be the same sort of prejudice that people have toward just bigotry it 
 
 ron looked as though he would have liked to reply scathingly but perhaps he want another row because he contented himself with shaking his head disbelievingly while hermione looking 
 
 it was time now to think of the homework they had neglected during the first week of the holidays everybody seemed to be feeling rather flat now that christmas was over everybody except harry that is who was starting once again to feel slightly nervous 
 
 the trouble was that february the looked a lot closer from this side of christmas and he still done anything about working out the clue inside the golden egg he therefore started taking the egg out of his trunk every time he went up to the dormitory opening it and listening intently hoping that this time it would make some sense he strained to think what the sound reminded him of apart from thirty musical saws but he had never heard anything else like it he closed the egg shook it vigorously and opened it again to see if the sound had changed but it he tried asking the egg questions shouting over all the wailing but nothing happened he even threw the egg across the room though he really expected that to help 
 
 harry had not forgotten the hint that cedric had given him but his feelings toward cedric just now meant that he was keen not to take his help if he could avoid it in any case it seemed to him that if cedric had really wanted to give harry a hand he would have been a lot more explicit he harry had told cedric exactly what was coming in the first task and idea of a fair exchange had been to tell harry to take a bath well he need that sort of rubbishy help not from someone who kept walking down corridors hand in hand with cho anyway and so the first day of the new term arrived and harry set off to lessons weighed down with books parchment and quills as usual but also with the lurking worry of the egg heavy in his stomach as though he were carrying that around with him too 
 
 snow was still thick upon the grounds and the greenhouse windows were covered in condensation so thick that they see out of them in herbology nobody was looking forward to care of magical creatures much in this weather though as ron said the skrewts would probably warm them up nicely either by chasing them or blasting off so forcefully that cabin would catch fire 
 
 when they arrived at hagrid s cabin however they found an elderly witch with closely cropped gray hair and a very prominent chin standing before his front door 
 
 hurry up now the bell rang five minutes ago she barked at them as they struggled toward her through the snow 
 
 you said ron staring at her hagrid 
 
 my name is professor she said briskly i am your temporary care of magical creatures teacher 
 
 hagrid harry repeated loudly 
 
 he is indisposed said professor shortly 
 
 soft and unpleasant laughter reached ears he turned draco malfoy and the rest of the slytherins were joining the class all of them looked gleeful and none of them looked surprised to see professor 
 
 this way please said professor and she strode off around the paddock where the beauxbatons horses were shivering harry ron and hermione followed her looking back over their shoulders at cabin all the curtains were closed was hagrid in there alone and ill 
 
 wrong with hagrid harry said hurrying to catch up with professor 
 
 never you mind she said as though she thought he was being nosy 
 
 i do mind though said harry hotly up with him 
 
 professor acted as though she hear him she led them past the paddock where the huge beauxbatons horses were standing huddled against the cold and toward a tree on the edge of the forest where a large and beautiful unicorn was tethered 
 
 many of the girls ooooohed at the sight of the unicorn 
 
 oh so beautiful whispered lavender brown how did she get it supposed to be really hard to catch 
 
 the unicorn was so brightly white it made the snow all around look gray it was pawing the ground nervously with its golden hooves and throwing back its horned head 
 
 boys keep back barked professor throwing out an arm and catching harry hard in the chest they prefer the touch unicorns girls to the front and approach with care come on easy does it 
 
 she and the girls walked slowly forward toward the unicorn leaving the boys standing near the paddock fence watching the moment professor was out of earshot harry turned to ron 
 
 what reckons wrong with him you think a skrewt 
 
 oh he been attacked potter if what thinking said malfoy softly no just too ashamed to show his big ugly face 
 
 what mean said harry sharply 
 
 malfoy put his hand inside the pocket of his robes and pulled out a folded page of newsprint 
 
 there you go he said hate to break it to you potter 
 
 he smirked as harry snatched the page unfolded it and read it with ron seamus dean and neville looking over his shoulder it was an article topped with a picture of hagrid looking extremely shifty 
 
 giant mistake 
 albus dumbledore eccentric headmaster of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry has never been afraid to make controversial staff appointments writes rita skeeter special correspondent in september of this year he hired alastor moody the notoriously to teach defense against the dark arts a decision that caused many raised eyebrows at the ministry of magic given habit of attacking anybody who makes a sudden movement in his presence moody however looks responsible and kindly when set beside the dumbledore employs to teach care of magical creatures 
 rubeus hagrid who admits to being expelled from hogwarts in his third year has enjoyed the position of gamekeeper at the school ever since a job secured for him by dumbledore last year however hagrid used his mysterious influence over the headmaster to secure the additional post of care of magical creatures teacher over the heads of many candidates 
 an alarmingly large and man hagrid has been using his newfound authority to terrify the students in his care with a succession of horrific creatures while dumbledore turns a blind eye hagrid has maimed several pupils during a series of lessons that many admit to being very frightening 
 i was attacked by a hippogriff and my friend vincent crabbe got a bad bite off a flobberworm says draco malfoy a student we all hate hagrid but just too scared to say anything 
 hagrid has no intention of ceasing his campaign of intimidation however in conversation with a daily prophet reporter last month he admitted breeding creatures he has dubbed skrewts highly dangerous crosses between and the creation of new breeds of magical creature is of course an activity usually closely observed by the department for the regulation and control of magical creatures hagrid however considers himself to be above such petty restrictions 
 i was just having some fun he says before hastily changing the subject 
 as if this were not enough the daily prophet has now unearthed evidence that hagrid is not as he has always pretended a wizard he is not in fact even pure human his mother we can exclusively reveal is none other than the giantess fridwulfa whose whereabouts are currently unknown 
 bloodthirsty and brutal the giants brought themselves to the point of extinction by warring amongst themselves during the last century the handful that remained joined the ranks of and were responsible for some of the worst mass muggle killings of his reign of terror 
 while many of the giants who served were killed by aurors working against the dark side fridwulfa was not among them it is possible she escaped to one of the giant communities still existing in foreign mountain ranges if his antics during care of magical creatures lessons are any guide however son appears to have inherited her brutal nature 
 in a bizarre twist hagrid is reputed to have developed a close friendship with the boy who brought around fall from power thereby driving own mother like the rest of supporters into hiding perhaps harry potter is unaware of the unpleasant truth about his large friend but albus dumbledore surely has a duty to ensure that harry potter along with his fellow students is warned about the dangers of associating with 
 harry finished reading and looked up at ron whose mouth was hanging open 
 
 how did she find out he whispered 
 
 but that what was bothering harry 
 
 what mean we all hate hagrid harry spat at malfoy this rubbish about him he pointed at crabbe getting a bad bite off a flobberworm they even got teeth 
 
 crabbe was sniggering apparently very pleased with himself 
 
 well i think this should put an end to the teaching career said malfoy his eyes glinting there was me thinking just swallowed a bottle of when he was of the mummies and daddies are going to like this at be worried eat their kids ha ha 
 
 you 
 
 are you paying attention over there 
 
 professor voice carried over to the boys the girls were all clustered around the unicorn now stroking it harry was so angry that the daily prophet article shook in his hands as he turned to stare unseeingly at the unicorn whose many magical properties professor was now enumerating in a loud voice so that the boys could hear too 
 
 i hope she stays that woman said parvati patil when the lesson had ended and they were all heading back to the castle for lunch more what i thought care of magical creatures would be likeproper creatures like unicorns not monsters 
 
 what about hagrid harry said angrily as they went up the steps 
 
 what about him said parvati in a hard voice he can still be gamekeeper he 
 
 parvati had been very cool toward harry since the ball he supposed that he ought to have paid her a bit more attention but she seemed to have had a good time all the same she was certainly telling anybody who would listen that she had made arrangements to meet the boy from beauxbatons in hogsmeade on the next weekend trip 
 
 that was a really good lesson said hermione as they entered the great hall i know half the things professor told us about uni 
 
 look at this harry snarled and he shoved the daily prophet article under nose 
 
 mouth fell open as she read her reaction was exactly the same as 
 
 how did that horrible skeeter woman find out you think hagrid told her 
 
 no said harry leading the way over to the gryffindor table and throwing himself into a chair furious he never even told us did he i reckon she was so mad he give her loads of horrible stuff about me she went ferreting around to get him back 
 
 maybe she heard him telling madame maxime at the ball said hermione quietly 
 
 have seen her in the garden said ron anyway not supposed to come into school anymore hagrid said dumbledore banned her 
 
 maybe got an invisibility cloak said harry ladling chicken casserole onto his plate and splashing it everywhere in his anger sort of thing do it hide in bushes listening to people 
 
 like you and ron did you mean said hermione 
 
 we trying to hear him said ron indignantly we have any choice the stupid prat talking about his giantess mother where anyone could have heard him 
 
 got to go and see him said harry this evening after divination tell him we want him backyou do want him back he shot at hermione 
 
 i well not going to pretend it make a nice change having a proper care of magical creatures lesson for once but i do want hagrid back of course i do hermione added hastily quailing under furious stare 
 
 so that evening after dinner the three of them left the castle once more and went down through the frozen grounds to cabin they knocked and booming barks answered 
 
 hagrid us harry shouted pounding on the door open up 
 
 hagrid answer they could hear fang scratching at the door whining but it open they hammered on it for ten more minutes ron even went and banged on one of the windows but there was no response 
 
 he avoiding us for hermione said when they had finally given up and were walking back to the school he surely think care about him being 
 
 but it seemed that hagrid did care they see a sign of him all week he appear at the staff table at mealtimes they see him going about his gamekeeper duties on the grounds and professor continued to take the care of magical creatures classes malfoy was gloating at every possible opportunity 
 
 missing your pal he kept whispering to harry whenever there was a teacher around so that he was safe from retaliation missing the 
 
 there was a hogsmeade visit halfway through january hermione was very surprised that harry was going to go 
 
 i just thought want to take advantage of the common room being quiet she said really get to work on that egg 
 
 oh i i reckon got a pretty good idea what about now harry lied 
 
 have you really said hermione looking impressed well done 
 
 insides gave a guilty squirm but he ignored them he still had five weeks to work out that egg clue after all and that was ageswhereas if he went into hogsmeade he might run into hagrid and get a chance to persuade him to come back 
 
 he ron and hermione left the castle together on saturday and set off through the cold wet grounds toward the gates as they passed the durmstrang ship moored in the lake they saw viktor krum emerge onto the deck dressed in nothing but swimming trunks he was very skinny indeed but apparently a lot tougher than he looked because he climbed up onto the side of the ship stretched out his arms and dived right into the lake 
 
 mad said harry staring at dark head as it bobbed out into the middle of the lake it must be freezing january 
 
 a lot colder where he comes from said hermione i suppose it feels quite warm to him 
 
 yeah but still the giant squid said ron he sound anxious if anything he sounded hopeful hermione noticed his tone of voice and frowned 
 
 really nice you know she said not at all like think coming from durmstrang he likes it much better here he told me 
 
 ron said nothing he mentioned viktor krum since the ball but harry had found a miniature arm under his bed on boxing day which had looked very much as though it had been snapped off a small model figure wearing bulgarian quidditch robes 
 
 harry kept his eyes skinned for a sign of hagrid all the way down the slushy high street and suggested a visit to the three broomsticks once he had ascertained that hagrid was not in any of the shops 
 
 the pub was as crowded as ever but one quick look around at all the tables told harry that hagrid there heart sinking he went up to the bar with ron and hermione ordered three butterbeers from madam rosmerta and thought gloomily that he might just as well have stayed behind and listened to the egg wailing after all 
 
 he ever go into the office hermione whispered suddenly look 
 
 she pointed into the mirror behind the bar and harry saw ludo bagman reflected there sitting in a shadowy corner with a bunch of goblins bagman was talking very fast in a low voice to the goblins all of whom had their arms crossed and were looking rather menacing 
 
 it was indeed odd harry thought that bagman was here at the three broomsticks on a weekend when there was no triwizard event and therefore no judging to be done he watched bagman in the mirror he was looking strained again quite as strained as he had that night in the forest before the dark mark had appeared but just then bagman glanced over at the bar saw harry and stood up 
 
 in a moment in a moment harry heard him say brusquely to the goblins and bagman hurried through the pub toward harry his boyish grin back in place 
 
 harry he said how are you been hoping to run into you everything going all right 
 
 fine thanks said harry 
 
 wonder if i could have a quick private word harry said bagman eagerly you give us a moment you two could you 
 
 er okay said ron and he and hermione went off to find a table 
 
 bagman led harry along the bar to the end furthest from madam rosmerta 
 
 well i just thought congratulate you again on your splendid performance against that horntail harry said bagman really superb 
 
 thanks said harry but he knew this be all that bagman wanted to say because he could have congratulated harry in front of ron and hermione bagman seem in any particular rush to spill the beans though harry saw him glance into the mirror over the bar at the goblins who were all watching him and harry in silence through their dark slanting eyes 
 
 absolute nightmare said bagman to harry in an undertone noticing harry watching the goblins too their english too like being back with all the bulgarians at the quidditch world cupbut at least they used sign language another human could recognize this lot keep gabbling in i only know one word of gobbledegook bladvak it means pickax i like to use it in case they think threatening them 
 
 he gave a short booming laugh 
 
 what do they want harry said noticing how the goblins were still watching bagman very closely 
 
 er well said bagman looking suddenly nervous looking for barty crouch 
 
 why are they looking for him here said harry at the ministry in london he 
 
 eras a matter of fact no idea where he is said bagman sort ofstopped coming to work been absent for a couple of weeks now young percy his assistant says ill apparently just been sending instructions in by owl but would you mind not mentioning that to anyone harry because rita still poking around everywhere she can and willing to bet work up bartys illness into something sinister probably say gone missing like bertha jorkins 
 
 have you heard anything about bertha jorkins harry asked 
 
 no said bagman looking strained again got people looking of course about time thought harry and all very strange she definitely arrived in albania because she met her second cousin there and then she left the house to go south and see an auntand she seems to have vanished without trace en route blowed if i can see where got toshe seem the type to elope for instancebut are we doing talking about goblins and bertha jorkins i really wanted to ask you he lowered his voice how are you getting on with your golden egg 
 
 ernot bad harry said untruthfully 
 
 bagman seemed to know he being honest 
 
 listen harry he said still in a very low voice i feel very bad about all thisyou were thrown into this tournament you volunteer for itand if his voice was so quiet now harry had to lean closer to listen if i can help at alla prod in the right taken a liking to youthe way you got past that just say the word 
 
 harry stared up into round rosy face and his wide eyes 
 
 supposed to work out the clues alone we he said careful to keep his voice casual and not sound as though he was accusing the head of the department of magical games and sports of breaking the rules 
 
 wellwell yes said bagman impatiently but come on harry we all want a hogwarts victory we 
 
 have you offered cedric help harry said 
 
 the smallest of frowns creased smooth face no i he said i well like i say taken a liking to you just thought offer 
 
 well thanks said harry but i think nearly there with the eggcouple more days should crack it 
 
 he entirely sure why he was refusing help except that bagman was almost a stranger to him and accepting his assistance would feel somehow much more like cheating than asking advice from ron hermione or sirius 
 
 bagman looked almost affronted but say much more as fred and george turned up at that point 
 
 hello mr bagman said fred brightly can we buy you a drink 
 
 erno said bagman with a last disappointed glance at harry no thank you boys 
 
 fred and george looked quite as disappointed as bagman who was surveying harry as though he had let him down badly 
 
 well i must dash he said nice seeing you all good luck harry 
 
 he hurried out of the pub the goblins all slid off their chairs and exited after him harry went to rejoin ron and hermione 
 
 what did he want ron said the moment harry had sat down 
 
 he offered to help me with the golden egg said harry 
 
 he be doing that said hermione looking very shocked one of the judges and anyway already worked it out you 
 
 ernearly said harry 
 
 well i think dumbledore would like it if he knew bagman was trying to persuade you to cheat said hermione still looking deeply disapproving i hope trying to help cedric as much 
 
 not i asked said harry 
 
 who cares if getting help said ron harry privately agreed 
 
 those goblins look very friendly said hermione sipping her butterbeer what were they doing here 
 
 looking for crouch according to bagman said harry still ill been into work 
 
 maybe poisoning him said ron probably thinks if crouch snuffs it be made head of the department of international magical cooperation 
 
 hermione gave ron a look and said funny goblins looking for mr normally deal with the department for the regulation and control of magical creatures 
 
 crouch can speak loads of different languages though said harry maybe they need an interpreter 
 
 worrying about poor ickle goblins now are you ron asked hermione thinking of starting up or something society for the protection of ugly goblins 
 
 ha ha ha said hermione sarcastically goblins need protection you been listening to what professor binns has been telling us about goblin rebellions 
 
 no said harry and ron together 
 
 well quite capable of dealing with wizards said hermione taking another sip of butterbeer very clever not like who never stick up for themselves 
 
 said ron staring at the door 
 
 rita skeeter had just entered she was wearing robes today her long nails were painted shocking pink and she was accompanied by her paunchy photographer she bought drinks and she and the photographer made their way through the crowds to a table nearby harry ron and hermione glaring at her as she approached she was talking fast and looking very satisfied about something 
 
 seem very keen to talk to us did he bozo now why would that be do you think and he doing with a pack of goblins in tow anyway showing them the sightswhat nonsensehe was always a bad liar reckon up think we should do a bit of digging disgraced of magical games and sports ludo bagman snappy start to a sentence bozo we just need to find a story to fit it 
 
 trying to ruin someone life said harry loudly 
 
 a few people looked around rita eyes widened behind her jeweled spectacles as she saw who had spoken 
 
 harry she said beaming how lovely why you come and join 
 
 i come near you with a broomstick said harry furiously what did you do that to hagrid for eh 
 
 rita skeeter raised her heavily penciled eyebrows 
 
 our readers have a right to the truth harry i am merely doing my 
 
 who cares if harry shouted nothing wrong with him 
 
 the whole pub had gone very quiet madam rosmerta was staring over from behind the bar apparently oblivious to the fact that the flagon she was filling with mead was overflowing 
 
 rita smile flickered very slightly but she hitched it back almost at once she snapped open her handbag pulled out her quill and said how about giving me an interview about the hagrid you know harry the man behind the muscles your unlikely friendship and the reasons behind it would you call him a father substitute 
 
 hermione stood up very abruptly her butterbeer clutched in her hand as though it were a grenade 
 
 you horrible woman she said through gritted teeth you care do you anything for a story and anyone will do wont they even ludo bagman 
 
 sit down you silly little girl and talk about things you understand said rita skeeter coldly her eyes hardening as they fell on hermione i know things about ludo bagman that would make your hair curlnot that it needs it she added eyeing bushy hair 
 
 go said hermione harry ron 
 
 they left many people were staring at them as they went harry glanced back as they reached the door rita quill was out it was zooming backward and forward over a piece of parchment on the table 
 
 be after you next hermione said ron in a low and worried voice as they walked quickly back up the street 
 
 let her try said hermione defiantly she was shaking with rage show her silly little girl am i oh get her back for this first harry then hagrid 
 
 you want to go upsetting rita skeeter said ron nervously serious hermione dig up something on you 
 
 my parents read the daily prophet she scare me into hiding said hermione now striding along so fast that it was all harry and ron could do to keep up with her the last time harry had seen hermione in a rage like this she had hit draco malfoy around the face and hagrid hiding anymore he should never have let that excuse for a human being upset him come on 
 
 breaking into a run she led them all the way back up the road through the gates flanked by winged boars and up through the grounds to cabin 
 
 the curtains were still drawn and they could hear fang barking as they approached 
 
 hagrid hermione shouted pounding on his front door hagrid enough we know in there nobody cares if your mum was a giantess hagrid you let that foul skeeter woman do this to you hagrid get out here just being 
 
 the door opened hermione said about it and then stopped very suddenly because she had found herself not with hagrid but with albus dumbledore 
 
 good afternoon he said pleasantly smiling down at them 
 
 we er we wanted to see hagrid said hermione in a rather small voice 
 
 yes i surmised as much said dumbledore his eyes twinkling why you come in 
 
 ohumokay said hermione 
 
 she ron and harry went into the cabin fang launched himself upon harry the moment he entered barking madly and trying to lick his ears harry fended off fang and looked around 
 
 hagrid was sitting at his table where there were two large mugs of tea he looked a real mess his face was blotchy his eyes swollen and he had gone to the other extreme where his hair was concerned far from trying to make it behave it now looked like a wig of tangled wire 
 
 hi hagrid said harry 
 
 hagrid looked up 
 
 lo he said in a very hoarse voice 
 
 more tea i think said dumbledore closing the door behind harry ron and hermione drawing out his wand and twiddling it a revolving tea tray appeared in midair along with a plate of cakes dumbledore magicked the tray onto the table and everybody sat down there was a slight pause and then dumbledore said did you by any chance hear what miss granger was shouting hagrid 
 
 hermione went slightly pink but dumbledore smiled at her and continued hermione harry and ron still seem to want to know you judging by the way they were attempting to break down the door 
 
 of course we still want to know you harry said staring at hagrid you think anything that skeeter cow sorry professor he added quickly looking at dumbledore 
 
 i have gone temporarily deaf and any idea what you said harry said dumbledore twiddling his thumbs and staring at the ceiling 
 
 said harry sheepishly i just how could you think care what about you 
 
 two fat tears leaked out of eyes and fell slowly into his tangled beard 
 
 living proof of what been telling you hagrid said dumbledore still looking carefully up at the ceiling i have shown you the letters from the countless parents who remember you from their own days here telling me in no uncertain terms that if i sacked you they would have something to say about it 
 
 not all of em said hagrid hoarsely not all of em wan me ter stay 
 
 really hagrid if you are holding out for universal popularity afraid you will be in this cabin for a very long time said dumbledore now peering sternly over his spectacles not a week has passed since i became headmaster of this school when i had at least one owl complaining about the way i run it but what should i do barricade myself in my study and refuse to talk to anybody 
 
 yeh not said hagrid croakily 
 
 hagrid look what got for relatives harry said furiously look at the dursleys 
 
 an excellent point said professor dumbledore my own brother aberforth was prosecuted for practicing inappropriate charms on a goat it was all over the papers but did aberforth hide no he did not he held his head high and went about his business as usual of course not entirely sure he can read so that may not have been bravery 
 
 come back and teach hagrid said hermione quietly please come back we really miss you 
 
 hagrid gulped more tears leaked out down his cheeks and into his tangled beard 
 
 dumbledore stood up i refuse to accept your resignation hagrid and i expect you back at work on monday he said you will join me for breakfast at in the great hall no excuses good afternoon to you all 
 
 dumbledore left the cabin pausing only to scratch fangs ears when the door had shut behind him hagrid began to sob into his hands hermione kept patting his arm and at last hagrid looked up his eyes very red indeed and said great man dumbledoregreat man 
 
 yeah he is said ron can i have one of these cakes hagrid 
 
 help yerself said hagrid wiping his eyes on the back of his hand ar righ o course all bin stupidmy ol dad woulda bin ashamed o the way bin behavin more tears leaked out but he wiped them away more forcefully and said never shown you a picture of my old dad have i here 
 
 hagrid got up went over to his dresser opened a drawer and pulled out a picture of a short wizard with crinkled black eyes beaming as he sat on top of shoulder hagrid was a good seven or eight feet tall judging by the apple tree beside him but his face was beardless young round and smooth he looked hardly older than eleven 
 
 tha was taken jus after i got inter hogwarts hagrid croaked dad was dead chuffedthought i migh not be a wizard see cos me mumwell anyway course i never was great shakes at magic reallybut at least he never saw me expelled died see in me second year 
 
 dumbledore was the one who stuck up for me after dad went got me the gamekeeper jobtrusts people he does gives em second what sets him apar from other heads see accept anyone at hogwarts as got the talent knows people can turn out okay even if their families tha respectable but some don understand that some always hold it against some even pretend they just had big bones rather than stand up an say i am what i am an not ashamed never be ashamed my ol dad used ter say some hold it against you but not worth botherin with an he was right bin an idiot not botherin with her no more i promise yeh that big give her big bones 
 
 harry ron and hermione looked at one another nervously harry would rather have taken fifty skrewts for a walk than admit to hagrid that he had overheard him talking to madame maxime but hagrid was still talking apparently unaware that he had said anything odd 
 
 yeh know wha harry he said looking up from the photograph of his father his eyes very bright when i firs met you you reminded me o me a bit mum an dad gone an you was feelin like yeh wouldn fit in at hogwarts remember not sure yeh were really up to itan now look at yeh harry school champion 
 
 he looked at harry for a moment and then said very seriously yeh know what love harry love yeh ter win i really would show em allyeh don have ter be pureblood ter do it yeh don have ter be ashamed of what yeh are show em the one got it righ lettin anyone in as long as they can do magic how you doin with that egg harry 
 
 great said harry really great 
 
 miserable face broke into a wide watery smile 
 
 my boyyou show em harry you show em beat em all 
 
 lying to hagrid quite like lying to anyone else harry went back to the castle later that afternoon with ron and hermione unable to banish the image of the happy expression on whiskery face as he had imagined harry winning the tournament the incomprehensible egg weighed more heavily than ever on conscience that evening and by the time he had got into bed he had made up his mind it was time to shelve his pride and see if hint was worth anything 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire 
 

lionfish nov chapter occlumencycontents prev chapter next chapter 
 kreacher it transpired had been lurking in the attic sirius said he had found him up there covered in dust no doubt looking for more relics of the black family to hide in his cupboard though sirius seemed satisfied with this story it made harry uneasy kreacher seemed to be in a better mood on his reappearance his bitter muttering had subsided somewhat and he submitted to orders more docilely than usual though once or twice harry caught the staring at him avidly but always looking quickly away whenever he saw that harry had noticed 
 
 harry did not mention his vague suspicions to sirius whose cheerfulness was evaporating fast now that christmas was over as the date of their departure back to hogwarts drew nearer he became more and more prone to what mrs weasley called fits of the sullens in which he would become taciturn and grumpy often withdrawing to room for hours at a time his gloom seeped through the house oozing under doorways like some noxious gas so that all of them became infected by it 
 
 harry want to leave sirius again with only kreacher for company in fact for the first time in his life he was not looking forward to returning to hogwarts going back to school would mean placing himself once again under the tyranny of dolores umbridge who had no doubt managed to force through another dozen decrees in their absence there was no quidditch to look forward to now that he had been banned there was every likelihood that their burden of homework would increase as the exams drew even nearer and dumbledore remained as remote as ever in fact if it been for the da harry thought he might have begged sirius to let him leave hogwarts and remain in grimmauld place 
 
 then on the very last day of the holidays something happened that made harry positively dread his return to school 
 
 harry dear said mrs weasley poking her head into his and bedroom where the pair of them were playing wizard chess watched by hermione ginny and crookshanks could you come down to the kitchen professor snape would like a word with you 
 
 harry did not immediately register what she had said one of his castles was engaged in a violent tussle with a pawn of and he was egging it on enthusiastically 
 
 squash him squash him only a pawn you idiot sorry mrs weasley what did you say 
 
 professor snape dear in the kitchen like a word 
 
 mouth fell open in horror he looked around at ron hermione and ginny all of whom were gaping back at him crookshanks whom hermione had been restraining with difficulty for the past quarter of an hour leapt gleefully on to the board and set the pieces running for cover squealing at the top of their voices 
 
 snape said harry blankly 
 
 professor snape dear said mrs weasley reprovingly now come on quickly he says he stay long 
 
 he want with you said ron looking unnerved as mrs weasley withdrew from the room you done anything have you 
 
 no said harry indignantly racking his brains to think what he could have done that would make snape pursue him to grimmauld place had his last piece of homework perhaps earned a t 
 
 a minute or two later he pushed open the kitchen door to find sirius and snape both seated at the long kitchen table glaring in opposite directions the silence between them was heavy with mutual dislike a letter lay open on the table in front of sirius 
 
 er said harry to announce his presence 
 
 snape looked around at him his face framed between curtains of greasy black hair 
 
 sit down potter 
 
 you know said sirius loudly leaning back on his rear chair legs and speaking to the ceiling i think prefer it if you give orders here snape my house you see 
 
 an ugly flush suffused pallid face harry sat down in a chair beside sirius facing snape across the table 
 
 i was supposed to see you alone potter said snape the familiar sneer curling his mouth but black 
 
 his godfather said sirius louder than ever 
 
 i am here on orders said snape whose voice by contrast was becoming more and more quietly waspish but by all means stay black i know you like to feel involved 
 
 that supposed to mean said sirius letting his chair fall back on to all four legs with a loud bang 
 
 merely that i am sure you must feelahfrustrated by the fact that you can do nothing useful snape laid a delicate stress on the word for the order 
 
 it was turn to flush lip curled in triumph as he turned to harry 
 
 the headmaster has sent me to tell you potter that it is his wish for you to study occlumency this term 
 
 study what said harry blankly 
 
 sneer became more pronounced 
 
 occlumency potter the magical defence of the mind against external penetration an obscure branch of magic but a highly useful one 
 
 heart began to pump very fast indeed defence against external penetration but he was not being possessed they had all agreed on that 
 
 why do i have to study occluthing he blurted out 
 
 because the headmaster thinks it a good idea said snape smoothly you will receive private lessons once a week but you will not tell anybody what you are doing least of all dolores umbridge you understand 
 
 yes said harry going to be teaching me 
 
 snape raised an eyebrow 
 
 i am he said 
 
 harry had the horrible sensation that his insides were melting 
 
 extra lessons with snapewhat on earth had he done to deserve this he looked quickly round at sirius for support 
 
 why dumbledore teach harry asked sirius aggressively why you 
 
 i suppose because it is a privilege to delegate less enjoyable tasks said snape silkily i assure you i did not beg for the job he got to his feet i will expect you at six on monday evening potter my office if anybody asks you are taking remedial potions nobody who has seen you in my classes could deny you need them 
 
 he turned to leave his black travelling cloak billowing behind him 
 
 wait a moment said sirius sitting up straighter in his chair 
 
 snape turned back to face them sneering 
 
 i am in rather a hurry black unlike you i do not have unlimited leisure time 
 
 get to the point then said sirius standing up he was rather taller than snape who harry noticed balled his fist in the pocket of his cloak over what harry was sure was the handle of his wand if i hear using these occlumency lessons to give harry a hard time have me to answer to 
 
 how touching snape sneered but surely you have noticed that potter is very like his father 
 
 yes i have said sirius proudly 
 
 well then know so arrogant that criticism simply bounces off him snape said sleekly 
 
 sirius pushed his chair roughly aside and strode around the table towards snape pulling out his wand as he went snape whipped out his own they were squaring up to each other sirius looking livid snape calculating his eyes darting from to his face 
 
 sirius said harry loudly but sirius appeared not to hear him 
 
 warned you snivelus said sirius his face barely a foot from i care if dumbledore thinks reformed i know better 
 
 oh but why you tell him so whispered snape or are you afraid he might not take very seriously the advice of a man who has been hiding inside his house for six months 
 
 tell me how is lucius malfoy these days i expect delighted his working at hogwarts he 
 
 speaking of dogs said snape softly did you know that lucius malfoy recognised you last time you risked a little jaunt outside clever idea black getting yourself seen on a safe station platform gave you a excuse not to leave your in future it 
 
 sirius raised his wand 
 
 no harry yelled vaulting over the table and trying to get in between them sirius 
 
 are you calling me a coward roared sirius trying to push harry out of the way but harry would not budge 
 
 why yes i suppose i am said snape 
 
 harryget outofit snarled sirius pushing him aside with his free hand 
 
 the kitchen door opened and the entire weasley family plus hermione came inside all looking very happy with mr weasley walking proudly in their midst dressed in a pair of striped pyjamas covered by a mackintosh 
 
 cured he announced brightly to the kitchen at large completely cured 
 
 he and all the other weasleys froze on the threshold gazing at the scene in front of them which was also suspended in both sirius and snape looking towards the door with their wands pointing into each faces and harry immobile between them a hand stretched out to each trying to force them apart 
 
 beard said mr weasley the smile sliding off his face going on here 
 
 both sirius and snape lowered their wands harry looked from one to the other each wore an expression of utmost contempt yet the unexpected entrance of so many witnesses seemed to have brought them to their senses snape pocketed his wand turned on his heel and swept back across the kitchen passing the weasleys without comment at the door he looked back 
 
 six monday evening potter 
 
 and he was gone sirius glared after him his wand at his side 
 
 been going on asked mr weasley again 
 
 nothing arthur said sirius who was breathing heavily as though he had just run a long distance just a friendly little chat between two old school friends with what looked like an enormous effort he smiled so cured great news really great 
 
 yes it said mrs weasley leading her husband forward to a chair healer smethwyck worked his magic in the end found an antidote to whatever that got in its fangs and learned his lesson about dabbling in muggle medicine you dear she added rather menacingly 
 
 yes molly dear said mr weasley meekly 
 
 that meal should have been a cheerful one with mr weasley back amongst them harry could tell sirius was trying to make it so yet when his godfather was not forcing himself to laugh loudly at fred and jokes or offering everyone more food his face fell back into a moody brooding expression harry was separated from him by mundungus and who had dropped in to offer mr weasley their congratulations he wanted to talk to sirius to tell him he listen to a word snape said that snape was goading him deliberately and that the rest of them think sirius was a coward for doing as dumbledore told him and remaining in grimmauld place but he had no opportunity to do so and eyeing the ugly look on face harry wondered occasionally whether he would have dared to mention it even if he had the chance instead he told ron and hermione under his voice about having to take occlumency lessons with snape 
 
 dumbledore wants to stop you having those dreams about voldemort said hermione at once well you be sorry not to have them any more will you 
 
 extra lessons with snape said ron sounding aghast rather have the nightmares 
 
 they were to return to hogwarts on the knight bus the following day escorted once again by tonks and lupin both of whom were eating breakfast in the kitchen when harry ron and hermione came down next morning the adults seemed to have been through a whispered conversation as harry opened the door all of them looked round hastily and fell silent 
 
 after a hurried breakfast they all pulled on jackets and scarves against the chilly grey january morning harry had an unpleasant constricted sensation in his chest he did not want to say goodbye to sirius he had a bad feeling about this parting he know when they would next see each other and he felt it was incumbent upon him to say something to sirius to stop him doing anything stupidharry was worried that accusation of cowardice had stung sirius so badly he might even now be planning some foolhardy trip beyond grimmauld place before he could think of what to say however sirius had beckoned him to his side 
 
 i want you to take this he said quietly thrusting a badly wrapped package roughly the size of a paperback book into hands 
 
 what is it harry asked 
 
 a way of letting me know if giving you a hard time no open it in here said sirius with a wary look at mrs weasley who was trying to persuade the twins to wear mittens i doubt molly would approvebut i want you to use it if you need me all right 
 
 ok said harry stowing the package away in the inside pocket of his jacket but he knew he would never use whatever it was it would not be he harry who lured sirius from his place of safety no matter how foully snape treated him in their forthcoming occlumency classes 
 
 go then said sirius clapping harry on the shoulder and smiling grimly and before harry could say anything else they were heading upstairs stopping before the heavily chained and bolted front door surrounded by weasleys 
 
 goodbye harry take care said mrs weasley hugging him 
 
 see you harry and keep an eye out for snakes for me said mr weasley genially shaking his hand 
 
 rightyeah said harry distractedly it was his last chance to tell sirius to be careful he turned looked into his face and opened his mouth to speak but before he could do so sirius was giving him a brief hug and saying gruffly look after yourself harry next moment harry found himself being shunted out into the icy winter air with tonks today heavily disguised as a tall tweedy woman with hair chivvying him down the steps 
 
 the door of number twelve slammed shut behind them they followed lupin down the front steps as he reached the pavement harry looked round number twelve was shrinking rapidly as those on either side of it stretched sideways squeezing it out of sight one blink later it had gone 
 
 come on the quicker we get on the bus the better said tonks and harry thought there was nervousness in the glance she threw around the square lupin flung out his right arm 
 
 bang 
 
 a violently purple bus had appeared out of thin air in front of them narrowly avoiding the nearest lamppost which jumped backwards out of its way 
 
 a thin pimply youth in a purple uniform leapt down on to the pavement and said welcome to the 
 
 yes yes we know thank you said tonks swiftly on on get on 
 
 and she shoved harry forwards towards the steps past the conductor who goggled at harry as he passed 
 
 arry 
 
 if you shout his name i will curse you into oblivion muttered tonks menacingly now shunting ginny and hermione forwards 
 
 always wanted to go on this thing said ron happily joining harry on board and looking around 
 
 it had been evening the last time harry had travelled by knight bus and its three decks had been full of brass bedsteads now in the early morning it was crammed with an assortment of mismatched chairs grouped haphazardly around windows some of these appeared to have fallen over when the bus stopped abruptly in grimmauld place a few witches and wizards were still getting to their feet grumbling and shopping bag had slid the length of the bus an unpleasant mixture of frogspawn cockroaches and custard creams was scattered all over the floor 
 
 looks like have to split up said tonks briskly looking for empty chairs fred george and ginny if you just take those seats at the back remus can stay with you 
 
 she harry ron and hermione proceeded up to the very top deck where there were two unoccupied chairs at the very front of the bus and two at the back stan shunpike the conductor followed harry and ron eagerly to the back heads turned as harry passed and when he sat down he saw all the faces flick back to the front again 
 
 as harry and ron handed stan eleven sickles each the bus set off again swaying ominously it rumbled around grimmauld place weaving on and off the pavement then with another tremendous bang they were all flung backwards chair toppled right over and pigwidgeon who had been on his lap burst out of his cage and flew twittering wildly up to the front of the bus where he fluttered down on to shoulder instead harry who had narrowly avoided falling by seizing a candle bracket looked out of the window they were now speeding down what appeared to be a motorway 
 
 just outside birmingham said stan happily answering unasked question as ron struggled up from the floor you keepin well then arry i seen your name in the paper loads over the summer but it never nuffink very nice i said to ern i said e seem like a nutter when we met im just goes to show dunnit 
 
 he handed over their tickets and continued to gaze enthralled at harry apparently stan did not care how nutty somebody was if they were famous enough to be in the paper the knight bus swayed alarmingly overtaking a line of cars on the inside looking towards the front of the bus harry saw hermione cover her eyes with her hands pigwidgeon swaying happily on her shoulder 
 
 bang 
 
 chairs slid backwards again as the knight bus jumped from the birmingham motorway to a quiet country lane full of hairpin bends hedgerows on either side of the road were leaping out of their way as they mounted the verges from here they moved to a main street in the middle of a busy town then to a viaduct surrounded by tall hills then to a windswept road between flats each time with a loud bang 
 
 changed my mind muttered ron picking himself up from the floor for the sixth time i never want to ride on this thing again 
 
 listen ogwarts stop after this said stan brightly swaying towards them that bossy woman up front oo got on with you given us a little tip to move you up the queue just gonna let madam marsh off first thoughthere was a retching sound from downstairs followed by a horrible spattering noise not feeling er best 
 
 a few minutes later the knight bus screeched to a halt outside a small pub which squeezed itself out of the way to avoid a collision they could hear stan ushering the unfortunate madam marsh out of the bus and the relieved murmurings of her fellow passengers on the second deck the bus moved on again gathering speed until 
 
 bang 
 
 they were rolling through a snowy hogsmeade harry caught a glimpse of the head down its side street the severed head sign creaking in the wintry wind flecks of snow hit the large window at the front of the bus at last they rolled to a halt outside the gates to hogwarts 
 
 lupin and tonks helped them off the bus with their luggage then got off to say goodbye harry glanced up at the three decks of the knight bus and saw all the passengers staring down at them noses flat against the windows 
 
 be safe once in the grounds said tonks casting a careful eye around at the deserted road have a good term ok 
 
 look after yourselves said lupin shaking hands all round and reaching harry last and listen he lowered his voice while the rest of them exchanged goodbyes with tonks harry i know you like snape but he is a superb occlumens and we allsirius includedwant you to learn to protect yourself so work hard all right 
 
 yeah all right said harry heavily looking up into prematurely lined face see you then 
 
 the six of them struggled up the slippery drive towards the castle dragging their trunks hermione was already talking about knitting a few elf hats before bedtime harry glanced back when they reached the oaken front doors the knight bus had already gone and he given what was coming the following evening that he was still on board 
 
 harry spent most of the next day dreading the evening his morning lesson did nothing to dispel his trepidation as snape was as unpleasant as ever his mood was further lowered by the da members constantly approaching him in the corridors between classes asking hopefully if there would be a meeting that night 
 
 let you know in the usual way when the next one is harry said over and over again but i do it tonight got to go toerremedial potions 
 
 you take remedial potions asked zacharias smith superciliously having cornered harry in the entrance hall after lunch good lord you must be terrible snape usually give extra lessons does he 
 
 as smith strode away in an annoyingly buoyant fashion ron glared after him 
 
 shall i jinx him i can still get him from here he said raising his wand and taking aim between shoulder blades 
 
 forget it said harry dismally what going to think it that really stup 
 
 hi harry said a voice behind him he turned round and found cho standing there 
 
 oh said harry as his stomach leapt uncomfortably hi 
 
 be in the library harry said hermione firmly as she seized ron above the elbow and dragged him off towards the marble staircase 
 
 had a good christmas asked cho 
 
 yeah not bad said harry 
 
 mine was pretty quiet said cho for some reason she was looking rather embarrassed erm another hogsmeade trip next month did you see the notice 
 
 what oh no i checked the noticeboard since i got back 
 
 yes on valentines day 
 
 right said harry wondering why she was telling him this well i suppose you want to 
 
 only if you do she said eagerly 
 
 harry stared he had been about to say i suppose you want to know when the next da meeting is but her response did not seem to fit 
 
 ier he said 
 
 oh ok if you she said looking mortified worry see you around 
 
 she walked away harry stood staring after her his brain working frantically then something clunked into place 
 
 cho heycho 
 
 he ran after her catching her halfway up the marble staircase 
 
 want to come into hogsmeade with me on day 
 
 oooh yes she said blushing crimson and beaming at him 
 
 right well settled then said harry and feeling that the day was not going to be a complete loss after all he virtually bounced off to the library to pick up ron and hermione before their afternoon lessons 
 
 by six that evening however even the glow of having successfully asked out cho chang could not lighten the ominous feelings that intensified with every step harry took towards office 
 
 he paused outside the door when he reached it wishing he were almost anywhere else then taking a deep breath he knocked and entered 
 
 the shadowy room was lined with shelves bearing hundreds of glass jars in which slimy bits of animals and plants were suspended in variously coloured potions in one corner stood the cupboard full of ingredients that snape had once accused harrynot without reasonof robbing attention was drawn towards the desk however where a shallow stone basin engraved with runes and symbols lay in a pool of candlelight harry recognised it at onceit was pensieve wondering what on earth it was doing there he jumped when cold voice came out of the shadows 
 
 shut the door behind you potter 
 
 harry did as he was told with the horrible feeling that he was imprisoning himself when he turned back into the room snape had moved into the light and was pointing silently at the chair opposite his desk harry sat down and so did snape his cold black eyes fixed unblinkingly upon harry dislike etched in every line of his face 
 
 well potter you know why you are here he said the headmaster has asked me to teach you occlumency i can only hope that you prove more adept at it than at potions 
 
 right said harry tersely 
 
 this may not be an ordinary class potter said snape his eyes narrowed malevolently but i am still your teacher and you will therefore call me sir or professor at all times 
 
 yes sir said harry 
 
 snape continued to survey him through narrowed eyes for a moment then said now occlumency as i told you back in your dear kitchen this branch of magic seals the mind against magical intrusion and influence 
 
 and why does professor dumbledore think i need it sir said harry looking directly into eyes and wondering whether snape would answer 
 
 snape looked back at him for a moment and then said contemptuously surely even you could have worked that out by now potter the dark lord is highly skilled at legilimency 
 
 that sir 
 
 it is the ability to extract feelings and memories from another mind 
 
 he can read minds said harry quickly his worst fears confirmed 
 
 you have no subtlety potter said snape his dark eyes glittering you do not understand fine distinctions it is one of the shortcomings that makes you such a lamentable 
 
 snape paused for a moment apparently to savour the pleasure of insulting harry before continuing 
 
 only muggles talk of the mind is not a book to be opened at will and examined at leisure thoughts are not etched on the inside of skulls to be perused by any invader the mind is a complex and thing potter or at least most minds are he smirked it is true however that those who have mastered legilimency are able under certain conditions to delve into the minds of their victims and to interpret their findings correctly the dark lord for instance almost always knows when somebody is lying to him only those skilled at occlumency are able to shut down those feelings and memories that contradict the lie and so can utter falsehoods in his presence without detection 
 
 whatever snape said legilimency sounded like to harry and he like the sound of it at all 
 
 so he could know what thinking right now sir 
 
 the dark lord is at a considerable distance and the walls and grounds of hogwarts are guarded by many ancient spells and charms to ensure the bodily and mental safety of those who dwell within them said snape time and space matter in magic potter eye contact is often essential to legilimency 
 
 well then why do i have to learn occlumency 
 
 snape eyed harry tracing his mouth with one long thin finger as he did so 
 
 the usual rules do not seem to apply with you potter the curse that failed to kill you seems to have forged some kind of connection between you and the dark lord the evidence suggests that at times when your mind is most relaxed and vulnerable when you are asleep for instanceyou are sharing the dark thoughts and emotions the headmaster thinks it inadvisable for this to continue he wishes me to teach you how to close your mind to the dark lord 
 
 heart was pumping fast again none of this added up 
 
 but why does professor dumbledore want to stop it he asked abruptly i like it much but been useful it i mean i saw that snake attack mr weasley and if i professor dumbledore have been able to save him would he sir 
 
 snape stared at harry for a few moments still tracing his mouth with his finger when he spoke again it was slowly and deliberately as though he weighed every word 
 
 it appears that the dark lord has been unaware of the connection between you and himself until very recently up till now it seems that you have been experiencing his emotions and sharing his thoughts without his being any the wiser however the vision you had shortly before christmas 
 
 the one with the snake and mr weasley 
 
 do not interrupt me potter said snape in a dangerous voice as i was saying the vision you had shortly before christmas represented such a powerful incursion upon the dark thoughts 
 
 i saw inside the head not his 
 
 i thought i just told you not to interrupt me potter 
 
 but harry did not care if snape was angry at last he seemed to be getting to the bottom of this business he had moved forwards in his chair so that without realising it he was perched on the very edge tense as though poised for flight 
 
 how come i saw through the eyes if thoughts sharing 
 
 do not say the dark name spat snape 
 
 there was a nasty silence they glared at each other across the pensieve 
 
 professor dumbledore says his name said harry quietly 
 
 dumbledore is an extremely powerful wizard snape muttered while he may feel secure enough to use the name the rest of us he rubbed his left forearm apparently unconsciously on the spot where harry knew the dark mark was burned into his skin 
 
 i just wanted to know harry began again forcing his voice back to politeness why 
 
 you seem to have visited the mind because that was where the dark lord was at that particular moment snarled snape he was possessing the snake at the time and so you dreamed you were inside it too 
 
 and volhe realised i was there 
 
 it seems so said snape coolly 
 
 how do you know said harry urgently is this just professor dumbledore guessing or 
 
 i told you said snape rigid in his chair his eyes slits to call me sir 
 
 yes sir said harry impatiently but how do you know 
 
 it is enough that we know said snape repressively the important point is that the dark lord is now aware that you are gaining access to his thoughts and feelings he has also deduced that the process is likely to work in reverse that is to say he has realised that he might be able to access your thoughts and feelings in return 
 
 and he might try and make me do things asked harry sir he added hurriedly 
 
 he might said snape sounding cold and unconcerned which brings us back to occlumency 
 
 snape pulled out his wand from an inside pocket of his robes and harry tensed in his chair but snape merely raised the wand to his temple and placed its tip into the greasy roots of his hair when he withdrew it some silvery substance came away stretching from temple to wand like a thick gossamer strand which broke as he pulled the wand away from it and fell gracefully into the pensieve where it swirled neither gas nor liquid twice more snape raised the wand to his temple and deposited the silvery substance into the stone basin then without offering any explanation of his behaviour he picked up the pensieve carefully removed it to a shelf out of their way and returned to face harry with his wand held at the ready 
 
 stand up and take out your wand potter 
 
 harry got to his feet feeling nervous they faced each other with the desk between them 
 
 you may use your wand to attempt to disarm me or defend yourself in any other way you can think of said snape 
 
 and what are you going to do harry asked eyeing wand apprehensively 
 
 i am about to attempt to break into your mind said snape softly we are going to see how well you resist i have been told that you have already shown aptitude at resisting the imperius curse you will find that similar powers are needed for this brace yourself now legilimens 
 
 snape had struck before harry was ready before he had even begun to summon any force of resistance the office swam in front of his eyes and vanished image after image was racing through his mind like a flickering film so vivid it blinded him to his surroundings 
 
 he was five watching dudley riding a new red bicycle and his heart was bursting with jealousy he was nine and ripper the bulldog was chasing him up a tree and the dursleys were laughing below on the lawn he was sitting under the sorting hat and it was telling him he would do well in slytherin hermione was lying in the hospital wing her face covered with thick black hair a hundred dementors were closing in on him beside the dark lake cho chang was drawing nearer to him under the mistletoe 
 
 no said a voice inside head as the memory of cho drew nearer not watching that not watching it private 
 
 he felt a sharp pain in his knee office had come back into view and he realised that he had fallen to the floor one of his knees had collided painfully with the leg of desk he looked up at snape who had lowered his wand and was rubbing his wrist there was an angry weal there like a scorch mark 
 
 did you mean to produce a stinging hex asked snape coolly 
 
 no said harry bitterly getting up from the floor 
 
 i thought not said snape watching him closely you let me get in too far you lost control 
 
 did you see everything i saw harry asked unsure whether he wanted to hear the answer 
 
 flashes of it said snape his lip curling to whom did the dog belong 
 
 my aunt marge harry muttered hating snape 
 
 well for a first attempt that was not as poor as it might have been said snape raising his wand once more you managed to stop me eventually though you wasted time and energy shouting you must remain focused repel me with your brain and you will not need to resort to your wand 
 
 trying said harry angrily but not telling me how 
 
 manners potter said snape dangerously now i want you to close your eyes 
 
 harry threw him a filthy look before doing as he was told he did not like the idea of standing there with his eyes shut while snape faced him carrying a wand 
 
 clear your mind potter said cold voice let go of all emotion 
 
 but anger at snape continued to pound through his veins like venom let go of his anger he could as easily detach his legs 
 
 not doing it potter you will need more discipline than this focus now 
 
 harry tried to empty his mind tried not to think or remember or feel 
 
 go again on the count of three onetwothreelegilimens 
 
 a great black dragon was rearing in front of him his father and mother were waving at him out of an enchanted mirror cedric diggory was lying on the ground with blank eyes staring at him 
 
 nooooooo 
 
 harry was on his knees again his face buried in his hands his brain aching as though someone had been trying to pull it from his skull 
 
 get up said snape sharply get up you are not trying you are making no effort you are allowing me access to memories you fear handing me weapons 
 
 harry stood up again his heart thumping wildly as though he had really just seen cedric dead in the graveyard snape looked paler than usual and angrier though not nearly as angry as harry was 
 
 iammaking aneffort he said through clenched teeth 
 
 i told you to empty yourself of emotion 
 
 yeah well finding that hard at the moment harry snarled 
 
 then you will find yourself easy prey for the dark lord said snape savagely fools who wear their hearts proudly on their sleeves who cannot control their emotions who wallow in sad memories and allow themselves to be provoked so easilyweak people in other wordsthey stand no chance against his powers he will penetrate your mind with absurd ease potter 
 
 i am not weak said harry in a low voice fury now pumping through him so that he thought he might attack snape in a moment 
 
 then prove it master yourself spat snape control your anger discipline your mind we shall try again get ready now legilimens 
 
 he was watching uncle vernon hammering the letterbox shut a hundred dementors were drifting across the lake in the grounds towards him he was running along a windowless passage with mr weasley they were drawing nearer to the plain black door at the end of the corridor harry expected to go through it but mr weasley led him off to the left down a flight of stone steps 
 
 i know i know 
 
 he was on all fours again on office floor his scar was prickling unpleasantly but the voice that had just issued from his mouth was triumphant he pushed himself up again to find snape storing at him his wand raised it looked as though this time snape had lifted the spell before harry had even tried to fight back 
 
 what happened then potter he asked eyeing harry intently 
 
 i sawi remembered harry panted just realised 
 
 realised what asked snape sharply 
 
 harry did not answer at once he was still savouring the moment of blinding realisation as he rubbed his forehead 
 
 he had been dreaming about a windowless corridor ending in a locked door for months without once realising that it was a real place now seeing the memory again he knew that all along he had been dreaming about the corridor down which he had run with mr weasley on the twelfth of august as they hurried to the courtrooms in the ministry it was the corridor leading to the department of mysteries and mr weasley had been there the night that he had been attacked by snake 
 
 he looked up at snape 
 
 in the department of mysteries 
 
 what did you say snape asked quietly and harry saw with deep satisfaction that snape was unnerved 
 
 i said in the department of mysteries sir harry said 
 
 and why said snape slowly would you ask such a thing 
 
 because said harry watching face closely that corridor just been dreaming about it for just recognised itit leads to the department of mysteries and i think voldemort wants something from 
 
 i have told you not to say the dark name 
 
 they glared at each other scar seared again but he did not care snape looked agitated but when he spoke again he sounded as though he was trying to appear cool and unconcerned 
 
 there are many things in the department of mysteries potter few of which you would understand and none of which concern you do i make myself plain 
 
 yes harry said still rubbing his prickling scar which was becoming more painful 
 
 i want you back here same time on wednesday we will continue work then 
 
 fine said harry he was desperate to get out of office and find ron and hermione 
 
 you are to rid your mind of all emotion every night before sleep empty it make it blank and calm you understand 
 
 yes said harry who was barely listening 
 
 and be warned potter i shall know if you have not practised 
 
 right harry mumbled he picked up his schoolbag swung it over his shoulder and hurried towards the office door as he opened it he glanced back at snape who had his back to harry and was scooping his own thoughts out of the pensieve with the tip of his wand and replacing them carefully inside his own head harry left without another word closing the door carefully behind him his scar still throbbing painfully 
 
 harry found ron and hermione in the library where they were working on most recent ream of homework other students nearly all of them sat at tables nearby noses close to books quills scratching feverishly while the sky outside the mullioned windows grew steadily blacker the only other sound was the slight squeaking of one of madam shoes as the librarian prowled the aisles menacingly breathing down the necks of those touching her precious books 
 
 harry felt shivery his scar was still aching he felt almost feverish 
 
 when he sat down opposite ron and hermione he caught sight of himself in the window opposite he was very white and his scar seemed to be showing up more clearly than usual 
 
 how did it go hermione whispered and then looking concerned are you all right harry 
 
 yeah fine i dunno said harry impatiently wincing as pain shot through his scar again listen just realised something 
 
 and he told them what he had just seen and deduced 
 
 so so are you saying whispered ron as madam pince swept past squeaking slightly that the weaponthe thing afteris in the ministry of magic 
 
 in the department of mysteries got to be harry whispered i saw that door when your dad took me down to the courtrooms for my hearing and definitely the same one he was guarding when the snake bit him 
 
 hermione let out a long slow sigh 
 
 of course she breathed 
 
 of course what said ron rather impatiently 
 
 ron think about it sturgis podmore was trying to get through a door at the ministry of magic it must have been that one too much of a coincidence 
 
 how come sturgis was trying to break in when on our side said ron 
 
 well i know hermione admitted that is a bit odd 
 
 so in the department of mysteries harry asked ron has your dad ever mentioned anything about it 
 
 i know they call the people who work in there unspeakables said ron frowning because no one really seems to know what they doweird place to have a weapon 
 
 not weird at all it makes perfect sense said hermione it will be something top secret that the ministry has been developing i expect harry are you sure all right 
 
 for harry had just run both his hands hard over his forehead as though trying to iron it 
 
 yeah fine he said lowering his hands which were trembling i just feel a bit i like occlumency much 
 
 i expect anyone would feel snaky if had their mind attacked over and over again said hermione sympathetically look get back to the common room be a bit more comfortable there 
 
 but the common room was packed and full of shrieks of laughter and excitement fred and george were demonstrating their latest bit of joke shop merchandise 
 
 headless hats shouted george as fred waved a pointed hat decorated with a fluffy pink feather at the watching students two galleons each watch fred now 
 
 fred swept the hat on to his head beaming for a second he merely looked rather stupid then both hat and head vanished 
 
 several girls screamed but everyone else was roaring with laughter 
 
 and off again shouted george and hand groped for a moment in what seemed to be thin air over his shoulder then his head reappeared as he swept the hat from it 
 
 how do those hats work then said hermione distracted from her homework and watching fred and george closely i mean obviously some kind of invisibility spell but rather clever to have extended the field of invisibility beyond the boundaries of the charmed object imagine the charm have a very long life though 
 
 harry did not answer he was feeling ill 
 
 going to have to do this tomorrow he muttered pushing the books he had just taken out of his bag back inside it 
 
 well write it in your homework planner then said hermione encouragingly so you forget 
 
 harry and ron exchanged looks as he reached into his bag withdrew the planner and opened it tentatively 
 
 leave it till later you big chided the book as harry scribbled down homework hermione beamed at it 
 
 i think go to bed said harry stuffing the homework planner back into his bag and making a mental note to drop it in the fire the first opportunity he got 
 
 he walked across the common room dodging george who tried to put a headless hat on him and reached the peace and cool of the stone staircase to the boys dormitories he was feeling sick again just as he had the night he had had the vision of the snake but thought that if he could just lie down for a while he would be all right 
 
 he opened the door of his dormitory and was one step inside it when he experienced pain so severe he thought that someone must have sliced into the top of his head he did not know where be was whether he was standing or lying down he did not even know his own name 
 
 maniacal laughter was ringing in his ears he was happier than he had been in a very long time jubilant ecstatic triumphant a wonderful wonderful thing had happened 
 
 harry harry 
 
 someone had hit him around the face the insane laughter was punctuated with a cry of pain the happiness was draining out of him but the laughter continued 
 
 he opened his eyes and as he did so he became aware that the wild laughter was coming out of his own mouth the moment he realised this it died away harry lay panting on the floor staring up at the ceiling the scar on his forehead throbbing horribly ron was bending over him looking very worried 
 
 what happened he said 
 
 i dunno harry gasped sitting up again really happy really happy 
 
 is 
 
 something happened mumbled harry he was shaking as badly as he had done after seeing the snake attack mr weasley and felt very sick something been hoping for 
 
 the words came just as they had back in the gryffindor changing room as though a stranger was speaking them through mouth yet he knew they were true he took deep breaths willing himself not to vomit all over ron he was very glad that dean and seamus were not here to watch this time 
 
 hermione told me to come and check on you said ron in a low voice helping harry to his feet she says your defences will be low at the moment after been fiddling around with your mind still i suppose help in the long run it he looked doubtfully at harry as he helped him towards his bed harry nodded without any conviction and slumped back on his pillows aching all over from having fallen to the floor so often that evening his scar still prickling painfully he could not help feeling that his first foray into occlumency had weakened his resistance rather than strengthening it and he wondered with a feeling of great trepidation what had happened to make lord voldemort the happiest he had been in fourteen years 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter sectumsempracontents prev chapter next chapter 
 exhausted but delighted with his work harry told ron and hermione everything that had happened during next charms lesson having first cast the muffliato spell upon those nearest them they were both satisfyingly impressed by the way he had wheedled the memory out of slughorn and positively awed when he told them about horcruxes and promise to take harry along should he find another one 
 
 wow said ron when harry had finally finished telling them everything ron was waving his wand very vaguely in the direction of the ceiling without paying the slightest bit of attention to what he was doing wow actually going to go with dumbledore and try and destroy wow 
 
 ron making it snow said hermione patiently grabbing his wrist and redirecting his wand away from the ceiling from which sure enough large white flakes had started to fall lavender brown harry noticed glared at hermione from a neighboring table through very red eyes and hermione immediately let go of arm 
 
 oh yeah said ron looking down at his shoulders in vague surprise sorry looks like all got horrible dandruff now 
 
 he brushed some of the fake snow off shoulder lavender burst into tears ron looked immensely guilty and turned his back on her 
 
 we split up he told harry out of the corner of his mouth last night when she saw me coming out of the dormitory with hermione obviously she see you so she thought it had just been the two of us 
 
 ah said harry wellyou mind over do you 
 
 no ron admitted it was pretty bad while she was yelling but at least i have to finish it 
 
 coward said hermione though she looked amused well it was a bad night for romance all around ginny and dean split up too harry 
 
 harry thought there was a rather knowing look in her eye as she told him that but she could not possibly know that his insides were suddenly dancing the conga keeping his face as immobile and his voice as indifferent as he could he asked how come 
 
 oh something really silly she said he was always trying to help her through the portrait hole like she climb in herself but been a bit rocky for ages 
 
 harry glanced over at dean on the other side of the classroom he certainly looked unhappy 
 
 of course this puts you in a bit of a dilemma it said hermione 
 
 what mean said harry quickly 
 
 the quidditch team said hermione if ginny and dean speaking 
 
 ohoh yeah said harry 
 
 flitwick said ron in a warning tone the tiny little charms master was bobbing his way toward them and hermione was the only one who had managed to turn vinegar into wine her glass flask was full of deep crimson liquid whereas the contents of and were still murky brown 
 
 now now boys squeaked professor flitwick reproachfully a little less talk a little more action let me see you try 
 
 together they raised their wands concentrating with all their might and pointed them at their flasks vinegar turned to ice flask exploded 
 
 yes for homework said professor flitwick reemerging from under the table and pulling shards of glass out of the top of his hat practice 
 
 they had one of their rare joint free periods after charms and walked back to the common room together ron seemed to be positively lighthearted about the end of his relationship with lavender and hermione seemed cheery too though when asked what she was grinning about she simply said a nice day neither of them seemed to have noticed that a fierce battle was raging inside brain 
 
 sister 
 
 but ditched dean 
 
 still sister 
 
 his best mate 
 
 make it worse 
 
 if i talked to him first 
 
 hit you 
 
 what if i care 
 
 your best mate 
 
 harry barely noticed that they were climbing through the portrait hole into the sunny common room and only vaguely registered the small group of clustered together there until hermione cried katie back are you okay 
 
 harry stared it was indeed katie bell looking completely healthy and surrounded by her jubilant friends 
 
 really well she said happily they let me out of st on monday i had a couple of days at home with mum and dad and then came back here this morning leanne was just telling me about mclaggen and the last match harry 
 
 yeah said harry well now back and fit have a decent chance of thrashing ravenclaw which means we could still be in the running for the cup listen katie 
 
 he had to put the question to her at once his curiosity even drove ginny temporarily from his brain he dropped his voice as friends started gathering up their things apparently they were late for transfiguration 
 
 that necklace can you remember who gave it to you now 
 
 no said katie shaking her head ruefully been asking me but i got a clue the last thing i remember was walking into the ladies in the three broomsticks 
 
 you definitely went into the bathroom then said hermione 
 
 well i know i pushed open the door said katie so i suppose whoever imperiused me was standing just behind it after that my a blank until about two weeks ago in st listen better go i put it past mcgonagall to give me lines even if it is my first day back 
 
 she caught up her bag and books and hurried after her friends leaving harry ron and hermione to sit down at a window table and ponder what she had told them 
 
 so it must have been a girl or a woman who gave katie the necklace said hermione to be in the ladies bathroom 
 
 or someone who looked like a girl or a woman said harry forget there was a cauldron full of polyjuice potion at hogwarts we know some of it got stolen 
 
 in his eye he watched a parade of crabbes and goyles prance past all transformed into girls 
 
 i think going to take another swig of felix said harry and have a go at the room of requirement again 
 
 that would be a complete waste of potion said hermione flatly putting down the copy of syllabary she had just taken out of her bag luck can only get you so far harry the situation with slughorn was different you always had the ability to persuade him you just needed to tweak the circumstances a bit luck enough to get you through a powerful enchantment though go wasting the rest of that potion need all the luck you can get if dumbledore takes you along with him she dropped her voice to a whisper 
 
 we make some more ron asked harry ignoring hermione be great to have a stock of it have a look in the book 
 
 harry pulled his copy of advanced out of his bap and looked up felix felicis 
 
 blimey seriously complicated he said running an eye down the list of ingredients and it takes six months got to let it stew 
 
 typical said ron 
 
 harry was about to put his book away again when he noticed the corner of a page folded down turning to it he saw the sectumsempra spell captioned for enemies that he had marked a few weeks previously he had still not found out what it did mainly because he did not want to test it around hermione but he was considering trying it out on mclaggen next time he came up behind him unawares 
 
 the only person who was not particularly pleased to see katie bell back at school was dean thomas because he would no longer be required to fill her place as chaser he took the blow stoically enough when harry told him merely grunting and shrugging but harry had the distinct feeling as he walked away that dean and seamus were muttering mutinously behind his back 
 
 the following fortnight saw the best quidditch practices harry had known as captain his team was so pleased to be rid of mclaggen so glad to have katie back at last that they were flying extremely well 
 
 ginny did not seem at all upset about the breakup with dean on the contrary she was the life and soul of the team her imitations of ron anxiously bobbing up and down in front of the goal posts as the quaffle sped toward him or of harry bellowing orders at mclaggen before being knocked out cold kept them all highly amused harry laughing with the others was glad to have an innocent reason to look at ginny he had received several more bludger injuries during practice because he had not been keeping his eyes on the snitch 
 
 the battle still raged inside his head ginny or ron sometimes he thought that the ron might not mind too much if he asked ginny out but then he remembered expression when he had seen her kissing dean and was sure that ron would consider it base treachery if harry so much as held her hand 
 
 yet harry could not help himself talking to ginny laughing with her walking back from practice with her however much his conscience ached he found himself wondering how best to get her on her own it would have been ideal if slughorn had given another of his little parties for ron would not be aroundbut unfortunately slughorn seemed to have given them up once or twice harry considered asking for help but he did not think he could stand seeing the smug look on her face he thought he caught it sometimes when hermione spotted him staring at ginny or laughing at her jokes and to complicate matters he had the nagging worry that if he do it somebody else was sure to ask ginny out soon he and ron were at least agreed on the fact that she was too popular for her own good 
 
 all in all the temptation to take another gulp of felix felicis was becoming stronger by the day for surely this was a case for as hermione put it tweaking the circumstances the balmy days slid gently through may and ron seemed to be there at shoulder every time he saw ginny harry found himself longing for a stroke of luck that would somehow cause ron to realize that nothing would make him happier than his best friend and his sister falling for each other and to leave them alone together for longer than a few seconds there seemed no chance of either while the final quidditch game of the season was looming ron wanted to talk tactics with harry all the time and had little thought for anything else 
 
 ron was not unique in this respect interest in the game was running extremely high throughout the school for the match would decide the championship which was still wide open if gryffindor beat ravenclaw by a margin of three hundred points a tall order and yet harry had never known his team to fly better then they would win the championship if they won by less than three hundred points they would come second to ravenclaw if they lost by a hundred points they would be third behind hufflepuff and if they lost by more than a hundred they would be in fourth place and nobody harry thought would ever ever let him forget that it had been he who had captained gryffindor to their first defeat in two centuries 
 
 the to this crucial match had all the usual features members of rival houses attempting to intimidate opposing teams in the corridors unpleasant chants about individual players being rehearsed loudly as they passed the team members themselves either swaggering around enjoying all the attention or else dashing into bathrooms between classes to throw up somehow the game had become inextricably linked in mind with success or failure in his plans for ginny he could not help feeling that if they won by more than three hundred points the scenes of euphoria and a nice loud party might be just as good as a hearty swig of felix felicis 
 
 in the midst of all his preoccupations harry had not forgotten his other ambition finding out what malfoy was up to in the room of requirement he was still checking the map and as he was unable to locate malfoy on it deduced that malfoy was still spending plenty of time within the room although harry was losing hope that he would ever succeed in getting inside the room of requirement he attempted it whenever he was in the vicinity but no matter how he reworded his request the wall remained firmly doorless 
 
 a few days before the match against ravenclaw harry found himself walking down to dinner alone from the common room ron having rushed off into a nearby bathroom to throw up yet again and hermione having dashed off to see professor vector about a mistake she thought she might have made in her last arithmancy essay more out of habit than anything harry made his usual detour along the corridor checking the map as he went for a moment he could not find malfoy anywhere and assumed he must indeed be inside the room of requirement again but then he saw tiny labeled dot standing in a boys bathroom on the floor below accompanied not by crabbe or goyle but by moaning myrtle 
 
 harry only stopped staring at this unlikely coupling when he walked right into a suit of armor the loud crash brought him out of his reverie hurrying from the scene lest filch turn up he dashed down the marble staircase and along the passageway below outside the bathroom he pressed his ear against the door he could not hear anything he very quietly pushed the door open 
 
 draco malfoy was standing with his back to the door his hands clutching either side of the sink his head bowed 
 
 crooned moaning voice from one of the cubicles tell me wrong i can help you 
 
 no one can help me said malfoy his whole body was shaking i do it i it work and unless i do it soon he says kill me 
 
 and harry realized with a shock so huge it seemed to root him to the spot that malfoy was cryingactually cryingtears streaming down his pale face into the grimy basin malfoy gasped and gulped and then with a great shudder looked up into mirror and saw harry staring at him over his shoulder 
 
 malfoy wheeled around drawing his wand instinctively harry pulled out his own hex missed harry by inches shattering the lamp on the wall beside him harry threw himself sideways thought levicorpus and flicked his wand but malfoy blocked the jinx and raised his wand for another 
 
 no no stop it squealed moaning myrtle her voice echoing loudly around the tiled room stop stop 
 
 there was a loud bang and the bin behind harry exploded harry attempted a curse that backfired off the wall behind ear and smashed the cistern beneath moaning myrtle who screamed loudly water poured everywhere and harry slipped as malfoy his face contorted cried cruci 
 
 sectumsempra bellowed harry from the floor waving his wand wildly 
 
 blood spurted from face and chest as though he had been slashed with an invisible sword he staggered backward and collapsed onto the waterlogged floor with a great splash his wand falling from his limp right hand 
 
 no gasped harry 
 
 slipping and staggering harry got to his feet and plunged toward malfoy whose face was now shining scarlet his white hands scrabbling at his chest 
 
 noi 
 
 harry did not know what he was saying he fell to his knees beside malfoy who was shaking uncontrollably in a pool of his own blood moaning myrtle let out a deafening scream 
 
 murder murder in the bathroom murder 
 
 the door banged open behind harry and he looked up terrified snape had burst into the room his face livid pushing harry roughly aside he knelt over malfoy drew his wand and traced it over the deep wounds curse had made muttering an incantation that sounded almost like song the flow of blood seemed to ease snape wiped the residue from face and repeated his spell now the wounds seemed to be knitting 
 
 harry was still watching horrified by what he had done barely aware that he too was soaked in blood and water moaning myrtle was still sobbing and wailing overhead when snape had performed his for the third time he malfoy into a standing position 
 
 you need the hospital wing there may be a certain amount of scarring but if you take dittany immediately we might avoid even that come 
 
 he supported malfoy across the bathroom turning at the door to say in a voice of cold fury and you potter you wait here for me 
 
 it did not occur to harry for a second to disobey he stood up slowly shaking and looked down at the wet floor there were bloodstains floating like crimson flowers across its surface he could not even find it in himself to tell moaning myrtle to be quiet as she continued to wail and sob with increasingly evident enjoyment 
 
 snape returned ten minutes later he stepped into the bathroom and closed the door behind him 
 
 go he said to myrtle and she swooped back into her toilet at once leaving a ringing silence behind her 
 
 i mean it to happen said harry at once his voice echoed in the cold watery space i know what that spell did 
 
 but snape ignored this apparently i underestimated you potter he said quietly who would have thought you knew such dark magic who taught you that spell 
 
 iread about it somewhere 
 
 where 
 
 it wasa library book harry invented wildly i remember what it was call 
 
 liar said snape throat went dry he knew what snape was going to do and he had never been able to prevent it 
 
 the bathroom seemed to shimmer before his eyes he struggled to block out all thought but try as he might the copy of advanced swam hazily to the forefront of his mind 
 
 and then he was staring at snape again in the midst of this wrecked soaked bathroom he stared into black eyes hoping against hope that snape had not seen what he feared but 
 
 bring me your schoolbag said snape softly and all of your schoolbooks all of them bring them to me here now 
 
 there was no point arguing harry turned at once and splashed out of the bathroom once in the corridor he broke into a run toward gryffindor tower most people were walking the other way they gaped at him drenched in water and blood but he answered none of the questions fired at him as he ran past 
 
 he felt stunned it was as though a beloved pet had turned suddenly savage what had the prince been thinking to copy such a spell into his book and what would happen when snape saw it would he tell stomach churnedhow harry had been achieving such good results in potions all year would he confiscate or destroy the book that had taught harry so much the book that had become a kind of guide and friend harry could not let it happen he could not 
 
 you why are you soaking is that blood 
 
 ron was standing at the top of the stairs looking bewildered at the sight of harry 
 
 i need your book harry panted your potions book quick give it to me 
 
 but what about the 
 
 explain later 
 
 ron pulled his copy of advanced out of his bag and handed it over harry sprinted off past him and back to the common room here he seized his schoolbag ignoring the amazed looks of several people who had already finished their dinner threw himself back out of the portrait hole and hurtled off along the corridor 
 
 he skidded to a halt beside the tapestry of dancing trolls closed his eyes and began to walk 
 
 i need a place to hide my book i need a place to hide my book i need a place to hide my book 
 
 three times he walked up and down in front of the stretch of blank wall when he opened his eyes there it was at last the door to the room of requirement harry wrenched it open flung himself inside and slammed it shut 
 
 he gasped despite his haste his panic his fear of what awaited him back in the bathroom he could not help but be overawed by what he was looking at he was standing in a room the size of a large cathedral whose high windows were sending shafts of light down upon what looked like a city with towering walls built of what harry knew must be objects hidden by generations of hogwarts inhabitants there were alleyways and roads bordered by tetering piles of broken and damaged furniture stowed away perhaps to hide the evidence of mishandled magic or else hidden by there were thousands and thousands of books no doubt banned or graffitied or stolen there were winged catapults and fanged frisbees some still with enough life in them to hover over the mountains of other forbidden items there were chipped bottles of congealed potions hats jewels cloaks there were what looked like dragon eggshells corked bottles whose contents still shimmered evilly several rusting swords and a heavy bloodstained axe 
 
 harry hurried forward into one of the many alleyways between all this hidden treasure he turned right past an enormous stuffed troll ran on a short way took a left at the broken vanishing cabinet in which montague had got lost the previous year finally pausing beside a large cupboard that seemed to have had acid thrown at its blistered surface he opened one of the creaking doors it had already been used as a hiding place for something in a cage that had long since died its skeleton had five legs he stuffed the book behind the cage and slammed the door he paused for a moment his heart thumping horribly gazing around at all the clutter would he be able to find this spot again amidst all this junk seizing the chipped bust of an ugly old warlock from on top of a nearby crate he stood it on top of the cupboard where the book was now hidden perched a dusty old wig and a tarnished tiara on the statues head to make it more distinctive then sprinted back through the alleyways of hidden junk as fast as he could go back to the door back out onto the corridor where he slammed the door behind him and it turned at once back into stone 
 
 harry ran toward the bathroom on the floor below cramming copy of advanced into his bag as he did so a minute later he was back in front of snape who held out his hand wordlessly for schoolbag harry handed it over panting a searing pain in his chest and waited 
 
 one by one snape extracted books and examined them finally the only book left was the potions book which he looked at very carefully before speaking 
 
 this is your copy of advanced is it potter 
 
 yes said harry still breathing hard 
 
 quite sure of that are you potter 
 
 yes said harry with a touch more defiance 
 
 this is the copy of advanced that you purchased from flourish and blotts 
 
 yes said harry firmly 
 
 then why asked snape does it have the name roonil wazlib written inside the front cover 
 
 heart missed a beat my nickname he said 
 
 your nickname repeated snape 
 
 yeah what my friends call me said harry 
 
 i understand what a nickname is said snape the cold black eyes were boring once more into he tried not to look into them close your mind close your mind but he had never learned how to do it properly 
 
 do you know what i think potter said snape very quietly i think that you are a liar and a cheat and that you deserve detention with me every saturday until the end of term what do you think potter 
 
 ii agree sir said harry still refusing to look into eyes 
 
 well we shall see how you feel after your detentions said snape ten saturday morning potter my office 
 
 but sir said harry looking up desperately quidditch the last match of the 
 
 ten whispered snape with a smile that showed his yellow teeth poor gryffindor fourth place this year i fear 
 
 and he left the bathroom without another word leaving harry to stare into the cracked mirror feeling sicker he was sure than ron had ever felt in his life 
 
 i say i told you so said hermione an hour later in the common room 
 
 leave it hermione said ron angrily 
 
 harry had never made it to dinner he had no appetite at all he had just finished telling ron hermione and ginny what had happened not that there seemed to have been much need the news had traveled very fast apparently moaning myrtle had taken it upon herself to pop up in every bathroom in the castle to tell the story malfoy had already been visited in the hospital wing by pansy parkinson who had lost no time in vilifying harry far and wide and snape had told the staff precisely what had happened harry had already been called out of the common room to endure fifteen highly unpleasant minutes in the company of professor mcgonagall who had told him he was lucky not to have been expelled and that she supported wholeheartedly punishment of detention every saturday until the end of term 
 
 i told you there was something wrong with that prince person hermione said evidently unable to stop herself and i was right i 
 
 no i think you were said harry stubbornly 
 
 he was having a bad enough time without hermione lecturing him the looks on the gryffindor faces when he had told them he would not be able to play on saturday had been the worst punishment of all he could feel eyes on him now but did not meet them he did not want to see disappointment or anger there he had just told her that she would be playing seeker on saturday and that dean would be rejoining the team as chaser in her place perhaps if they won ginny and dean would make up during the euphoria the thought went through harry like an icy knife 
 
 harry said hermione how can you still stick up for that book when that spell 
 
 will you stop harping on about the book snapped harry the prince only copied it out not like he was advising anyone to use it for all we know he was making a note of something that had been used against him 
 
 i believe this said hermione actually defending 
 
 not defending what i did said harry quickly i wish i done it and not just because got about a dozen detentions you know i used a spell like that not even on malfoy but you blame the prince he written try this out really was just making notes for himself he not for anyone else 
 
 are you telling me said hermione that going to go back 
 
 and get the book yeah i am said harry forcefully listen without the prince never have won the felix felicis never have known how to save ron from poisoning never have 
 
 got a reputation for potions brilliance you deserve said hermione nastily 
 
 give it a rest hermione said ginny and harry was so amazed so grateful he looked up by the sound of it malfoy was trying to use an unforgivable curse you should be glad harry had something good up his sleeve 
 
 well of course glad harry cursed said hermione clearly stung but you call that sectumsempra spell good ginny look where landed him and have thought seeing what this has done to your chances in the match 
 
 oh start acting as though you understand quidditch snapped ginny only embarrass yourself 
 
 harry and ron stared hermione and ginny who had always got on together very well were now sitting with their arms folded glaring in opposite directions ron looked nervously at harry then snatched up a book at random and hid behind it harry however little though he knew he deserved it felt unbelievably cheerful all of a sudden even though none of them spoke again for the rest of the evening 
 
 his lightheartedness was there were slytherin taunts to be endured next day not to mention much anger from fellow gryffindors who were most unhappy that their captain had got himself banned from the final match of the season by saturday morning whatever he might have told hermione harry would have gladly exchanged all the felix felicis in the world to be walking down to the quidditch pitch with ron ginny and the others it was almost unbearable to turn away from the mass of students streaming out into the sunshine all of them wearing rosettes and hats and brandishing banners and scarves to descend the stone steps into the dungeons and walk until the distant sounds of the crowd were quite obliterated knowing that he would not be able to hear a word of commentary or a cheer or groan 
 
 ah potter said snape when harry had knocked on his door and entered the unpleasantly familiar office that snape despite teaching floors above now had not vacated it was as dimly lit as ever and the same slimy dead objects were suspended in colored potions all around the walls ominously there were many boxes piled on a table where harry was clearly supposed to sit they had an aura of tedious hard and pointless work about them 
 
 mr filch has been looking for someone to clear out these old files said snape softly they are the records of other hogwarts wrongdoers and their punishments where the ink has grown faint or the cards have suffered damage from mice we would like you to copy out the crimes and punishments afresh and making sure that they are in alphabetical order replace them in the boxes you will not use magic 
 
 right professor said harry with as much contempt as he could put into the last three syllables 
 
 i thought you could start said snape a malicious smile on his lips with boxes one thousand and twelve to one thousand and you will find some familiar names in there which should add interest to the task here you see 
 
 he pulled out a card from one of the topmost boxes with a flourish and read james potter and sirius black apprehended using an illegal hex upon bertram aubrey head twice normal size double detention snape sneered it must be such a comforting thing that though they are gone a record of their great achievements remains 
 
 harry felt the familiar boiling sensation in the pit of his stomach biting his tongue to prevent himself retaliating he sat down in front of the boxes and pulled one toward him 
 
 it was as harry had anticipated useless boring work punctuated as snape had clearly planned with the regular jolt in the stomach that meant he had just read his father or names usually coupled together in various petty misdeeds occasionally accompanied by those of remus lupin and peter pettigrew and while he copied out all their various offenses and punishments he wondered what was going on outside where the match would have just started ginny playing seeker against cho 
 
 harry glanced again and again at the large clock ticking on the wall it seemed to be moving half as fast as a regular clock perhaps snape had bewitched it to go extra slowly he could not have been here for only half an hour an hour an hour and a half 
 
 stomach started rumbling when the clock showed half past twelve snape who had not spoken at all since setting harry his task finally looked up at ten past one 
 
 i think that will do he said coldly mark the place you have reached you will continue at ten next saturday 
 
 yes sir 
 
 harry stuffed a bent card into the box at random and hurried out of the door before snape could change his mind racing back up the stone steps straining his ears to hear a sound from the pitch but all was quiet it was over then 
 
 he hesitated outside the crowded great hall then ran up the marble staircase whether gryffindor had won or lost the team usually celebrated or commiserated in their own common room 
 
 quid agis he said tentatively to the fat lady wondering what he would find inside 
 
 her expression was unreadable as she replied see 
 
 and she swung forward 
 
 a roar of celebration erupted from the hole behind her harry gaped as people began to scream at the sight of him several hands pulled him into the room 
 
 we won yelled ron bounding into sight and brandishing the silver cup at harry we won four hundred and fifty to a hundred and forty we won 
 
 harry looked around there was ginny running toward him she had a hard blazing look in her face as she threw her arms around him and without thinking without planning it without worrying about the fact that fifty people were watching harry kissed her 
 
 after several long momentsor it might have been half an houror possibly several sunlit daysthey broke apart the room had gone very quiet then several people and there was an outbreak of nervous giggling harry looked over the top of head to see dean thomas holding a shattered glass in his hand and romilda vane looking as though she might throw something hermione was beaming but eyes sought ron at last he found him still clutching the cup and wearing an expression appropriate to having been clubbed over the head for a fraction of a second they looked at each other then ron gave a tiny jerk of the head that harry understood to mean wellif you must 
 
 the creature in his chest roaring in triumph he grinned down at ginny and gestured wordlessly out of the portrait hole a long walk in the grounds seemed indicated during whichif they had timethey might discuss the match 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the half blood prince
