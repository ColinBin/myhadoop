 harry grunted in his sleep and his face slid down the window an inch or so making his glasses still more lopsided but he did not wake up an alarm clock repaired by harry several years ago ticked loudly on the sill showing one minute to eleven beside it held in place by relaxed hand was a piece of parchment covered in thin slanting writing harry had read this letter so often since its arrival three days ago that although it had been delivered in a tightly furled scroll it now lay quite flat 
 
 dear harry 
 
 if it is convenient to you i shall call at number four privet drive this coming friday at eleven to escort you to the burrow where you have been invited to spend the remainder of your school holidays 
 
 if you are agreeable i should also be glad of your assistance in a matter to which i hope to attend on the way to the burrow i shall explain this more fully when i see you 
 
 kindly send your answer by return of this owl hoping to see you this friday 
 
 i am yours most sincerely 
 
 albus dumbledore 
 
 though he already knew it by heart harry had been stealing glances at this missive every few minutes since seven that evening when he had first taken up his position beside his bedroom window which had a reasonable view of both ends of privet drive he knew it was pointless to keep rereading words harry had sent back his yes with the delivering owl as requested and all he could do now was wait either dumbledore was going to come or he was not 
 
 but harry had not packed it just seemed too good to be true that he was going to be rescued from the dursleys after a mere fortnight of their company he could not shrug off the feeling that something was going to go wronghis reply to letter might have gone astray dumbledore could be prevented from collecting him the letter might turn out not to be from dumbledore at all but a trick or joke or trap harry had not been able to face packing and then being let down and having to unpack again the only gesture he had made to the possibility of a journey was to shut his snowy owl hedwig safely in her cage 
 
 the minute hand on the alarm clock reached the number twelve and at that precise moment the outside the window went out 
 
 harry awoke as though the sudden darkness were an alarm hastily straightening his glasses and unsticking his cheek from the glass he pressed his nose against the window instead and squinted down at the pavement a tall figure in a long billowing cloak was walking up the garden path 
 
 harry jumped up as though he had received an electric shock knocked over his chair and started snatching anything and everything within reach from the floor and throwing it into the trunk then as he lobbed a set of robes two spellbooks and a packet of clasps across the room the doorbell rang downstairs in the living room his uncle vernon shouted who the blazes is calling at this lime of night 
 
 harry froze with a brass telescope in one hand and a pair of trainers in the other he had completely forgotten to warn the dursleys that dumbledore might be coming feeling both panicky mid close to laughter he clambered over the trunk and wrenched open his bedroom door in time to hear a deep voice say good evening you must be mr dursley i daresay harry has told you i would be coming for him 
 
 harry ran down the stairs two at a time coming to an abrupt halt several steps from the bottom as long experience had taught him to remain out of reach of his uncle whenever possible there in the doorway stood a tall thin man with silver hair and beard spectacles were perched on his crooked nose and he was wearing a long black traveling cloak and pointed hat vernon dursley whose mustache was quite as bushy as though black and who was wearing a puce dressing gown was staring at the visitor as though he could not believe his tiny eyes 
 
 judging by your look of stunned disbelief harry did not warn you that i was coming said dumbledore pleasantly however let us assume that you have invited me warmly into your house it is unwise to linger overlong on doorsteps in these troubled times 
 
 he stepped smartly over the threshold and closed the front door behind him 
 
 it is a long time since my last visit said dumbledore peering down his crooked nose at uncle vernon i must say your agapanthus are flourishing 
 
 vernon dursley said nothing at all harry did not doubt that speech would return to him and soonthe vein pulsing in his temple was reaching danger pointbut something about dumbledore seemed to have robbed him temporarily of breath it might have been the blatant wizardishness of his appearance but it might too have been that even uncle vernon could sense that here was a man whom it would be very difficult to bully 
 
 ah good evening harry said dumbledore looking up at him through his glasses with a most satisfied expression excellent excellent 
 
 these words seemed to rouse uncle vernon it was clear that as far as he was concerned any man who could look at harry and say excellent was a man with whom he could never see eye to eye 
 
 i mean to be rude he began in a tone that threatened rudeness in every syllable 
 
 yet sadly accidental rudeness occurs alarmingly often dumbledore finished the sentence gravely best to say nothing at all my dear man ah and this must be petunia 
 
 the kitchen door had opened and there stood aunt wearing rubber gloves and a housecoat over her nightdress clearly halfway through her usual of all the kitchen surfaces her rather horsey face registered nothing but shock 
 
 albus dumbledore said dumbledore when uncle vernon failed to effect an introduction we have corresponded of course harry thought this an odd way of reminding aunt petunia that he had once sent her an exploding letter but aunt petunia did not challenge the term and this must be your son dudley 
 
 dudley had that moment peered round the living room door his large blond head rising out of the stripy collar of his pajamas looked oddly disembodied his mouth gaping in astonishment and fear dumbledore waited a moment or two apparently to see whether any of the dursleys were going to say anything but as the silence stretched on he smiled 
 
 shall we assume that you have invited me into your sitting room 
 
 dudley scrambled out of the way as dumbledore passed him harry still clutching the telescope and trainers jumped the last few stairs and followed dumbledore who had settled himself in the armchair nearest the fire and was taking in the surroundings wilh an expression of benign interest he looked quite extraordinarily out of place 
 
 we leaving sir harry asked anxiously 
 
 yes indeed we are but there are a few matters we need to discuss first said dumbledore and i would prefer not to do so in the open we shall trespass upon your aunt and hospitality only a little longer 
 
 you will will you 
 
 vernon dursley had entered the room petunia at his shoulder and dudley skulking behind them both 
 
 yes said dumbledore simply i shall 
 
 he drew his wand so rapidly that harry barely saw it with a casual flick the sofa zoomed forward and knocked the knees out from under all three of the dursleys so that they collapsed upon it in a heap another flick of the wand and the sofa zoomed back to its original position 
 
 we may as well be comfortable said dumbledore pleasantly 
 
 as he replaced his wand in his pocket harry saw that his hand was blackened and shriveled it looked as though his flesh had been burned away 
 
 sirwhat happened to your 
 
 later harry said dumbledore please sit down 
 
 harry took the remaining armchair choosing not to look at the dursleys who seemed stunned into silence 
 
 i would assume that you were going to offer me refreshment dumbledore said to uncle vernon but the evidence so far suggests that that would be optimistic to the point of foolishness 
 
 a third twitch of the wand and a dusty bottle and five glasses appeared in midair the bottle tipped and poured a generous measure of liquid into each of the glasses which then floated to each person in the room 
 
 madam finest mead said dumbledore raising his glass to harry who caught hold of his own and sipped he had never tasted anything like it before but enjoyed it immensely the dursleys after quick scared looks at one another tried to ignore their glasses completely a difficult feat as they were nudging them gently on the sides of their heads harry could not suppress a suspicion that dumbledore was rather enjoying himself 
 
 well harry said dumbledore turning toward him a difficulty has arisen which i hope you will be able to solve for us by us i mean the order of the phoenix but first of all i must tell you that will was discovered a week ago and that he left you everything he owned 
 
 over on the sofa uncle vernons head turned but harry did not look at him nor could he think of anything to say except oh right 
 
 this is in the main fairly straightforward dumbledore went on you add a reasonable amount of gold to your account at gringotts and you inherit all of personal possessions the slightly problematic part of the legacy 
 
 his dead said uncle vernon loudly from the sofa dumbledore and harry both turned to look at him the glass of mead was now knocking quite insistently on the side of head he attempted to beat it away dead his godfather 
 
 yes said dumbledore he did not ask harry why he had not confided in the dursleys our problem he continued to harry as if there had been no interruption is that sirius also left you number twelve grimmauld place 
 
 been left a house said uncle vernon greedily his small eyes narrowing but nobody answered him 
 
 you can keep using it as headquarters said harry i care you can have it i really want it harry never wanted to set foot in number twelve grimmauld place again if he could help it he thought he would be haunted forever by the memory of sirius prowling its dark musty rooms alone imprisoned within the place he had wanted so desperately to leave 
 
 that is generous said dumbledore we have however vacated the building temporarily 
 
 why 
 
 well said dumbledore ignoring the mutterings of uncle vernon who was now being rapped smartly over the head by the persistent glass of mead black family tradition decreed that the house was handed down the direct line to the next male with the name of black sirius was the very last of the line as his younger brother regulus predeceased him and both were childless while his will makes it perfectly plain that he wants you to have the house it is nevertheless possible that some spell or enchantment has been set upon the place to ensure that it cannot be owned by anyone other than a 
 
 a vivid image of the shrieking spitting portrait of mother that hung in the hall of number twelve grimmauld place flashed into mind i bet there has he said 
 
 quite said dumbledore and if such an enchantment exists then the ownership of the house is most likely to pass to the eldest of living relatives which would mean his cousin bellatrix lestrange 
 
 without realizing what he was doing harry sprang to his feet the telescope and trainers in his lap rolled across the floor bellatrix lestrange killer inherit his house 
 
 no he said 
 
 well obviously we would prefer that she get it either said dumbledore calmly the situation is fraught with complications we do not know whether the enchantments we ourselves have placed upon it for example making it unplottable will hold now that ownership has passed from hands it might be that bellatrix will arrive on the doorstep at any moment naturally we had to move out until such time as we have clarified the position 
 
 but how are you going to find out if allowed to own it 
 
 fortunately said dumbledore there is a simple test 
 
 he placed his empty glass on a small table beside his chair but before he could do anything else uncle vernon shouted will you get these ruddy things off us 
 
 harry looked around all three of the dursleys were cowering with their arms over their heads as their glasses bounced up and down on their skulls their contents flying everywhere 
 
 oh so sorry said dumbledore politely and he raised his wand again all three glasses vanished but it would have been better manners to drink it you know 
 
 it looked as though uncle vernon was bursting with any number of unpleasant retorts but he merely shrank back into the cushions with aunt petunia and dudley and said nothing keeping his small piggy eyes on wand 
 
 you see dumbledore said turning back to harry and again speaking as though uncle vernon had not uttered if you have indeed inherited the house you have also inherited 
 
 he flicked his wand for a fifth time there was a loud crack and a appeared with a snout for a nose giant ears and enormous bloodshot eyes crouching on the dursleys shag carpet and covered in grimy rags aunt petunia let out a shriek nothing this filthy had entered her house in living memory dudley drew his large bare pink feet off the floor and sat with them raised almost above his head as though he thought the creature might run up his pajama trousers and uncle vernon bellowed what the hell is that 
 
 kreacher finished dumbledore 
 
 kreacher kreacher kreacher croaked the quite as loudly as uncle vernon stamping his long gnarled feet and pulling his ears kreacher belongs to miss bellatrix oh yes kreacher belongs to the blacks kreacher wants his new mistress kreacher go to the potter brat kreacher 
 
 as you can see harry said dumbledore loudly over continued croaks of wont kreacher is showing a certain reluctance to pass into your ownership 
 
 i care said harry again looking with disgust at the writhing stamping i want him 
 
 
 
 you would prefer him to pass into the ownership of bellatrix lestrange bearing in mind that he has lived at the headquarters of the order of the phoenix for the past year 
 
 
 
 harry stared at dumbledore he knew that kreacher could not be permitted to go and live with bellatrix lestrange but the idea of owning him of having responsibility for the creature that had betrayed sirius was repugnant 
 
 give him an order said dumbledore if he has passed into your ownership he will have to obey if not then we shall have to think of some other means of keeping him from his rightful mistress 
 
 
 
 voice had risen to a scream harry could think of nothing to say except kreacher shut up 
 
 it looked for a moment as though kreacher was going to choke he grabbed his throat his mouth still working furiously his eyes bulging after a few seconds of frantic gulping he threw himself face forward onto the carpet aunt petunia whimpered and beat the floor with his hands and feet giving himself over to a violent but entirely silent tantrum 
 
 well that simplifies matters said dumbledore cheerfully it means that sirius knew what he was doing you are the rightful owner of number twelve grimmauld place and of kreacher 
 
 do ido i have to keep him with me harry asked aghast as kreacher thrashed around at his feet 
 
 not if you want to said dumbledore if i might make a suggestion you could send him to hogwarts to work in the kitchen there in that way the other could keep an eye on him 
 
 yeah said harry in relief yeah do that erkreacheri want you to go to hogwarts and work in the kitchens there with the other 
 
 kreacher who was now lying flat on his back with his arms and legs in the air gave harry one look of deepest loathing and with another loud crack vanished 
 
 good said dumbledore there is also the matter of the hippogriff buckbeak hagrid has been looking after him since sirius died but buckbeak is yours now so if you would prefer to make different arrangements 
 
 no said harry at once he can stay with hagrid i think buckbeak would prefer that 
 
 hagrid will be delighted said dumbledore smiling he was thrilled to see buckbeak again incidentally we have decided in the interests of safety to rechristen him witherwings for the time being though i doubt that the ministry would ever guess he is the hippogriff they once sentenced to death now harry is your trunk packed 
 
 erm 
 
 doubtful that i would turn up dumbledore suggested shrewdly 
 
 just go anderfinish off said harry hastily hurrying to pick up his fallen telescope and trainers 
 
 it took him a little over ten minutes to track down everything he needed at last he had managed to extract his invisibility cloak from under the bed screwed the top back on his jar of ink and forced the lid of his trunk shut on his cauldron then heaving his trunk in one hand and holding cage in the other he made his way back downstairs 
 
 he was disappointed to discover that dumbledore was not waiting in the hall which meant that he had to return to the living room 
 
 nobody was talking dumbledore was humming quietly apparently quite at his ease but the atmosphere was thicker than cold custard and harry did not dare look at the dursleys as he said ready now 
 
 good said dumbledore just one last thing then and he turned to speak to the dursleys once more 
 
 as you will no doubt be aware harry comes of age in a time 
 
 no said aunt petunia speaking for the first time since arrival 
 
 sorry said dumbledore politely 
 
 no he a month younger than dudley and dudders turn eighteen until the year after next 
 
 ah said dumbledore pleasantly but in the wizarding world we come of age at seventeen 
 
 uncle vernon muttered preposterous but dumbledore ignored him 
 
 now as you already know the wizard called lord voldemort has returned to this country the wizarding community is currently in a state of open warfare harry whom lord voldemort has already attempted to kill on a number of occasions is in even greater danger now than the day when i left him upon your doorstep fifteen years ago with a letter explaining about his parents murder and expressing the hope that you would care for him as though he were your own 
 
 dumbledore paused and although his voice remained light and calm and he gave no obvious sign of anger harry felt a kind of chill emanating from him and noticed that the dursleys drew very slightly closer together 
 
 you did not do as i asked you have never treated harry as a son he has known nothing but neglect and often cruelty at your hands the best that can be said is that he has at least escaped the appalling damage you have inflicted upon the unfortunate boy sitting between you 
 
 both aunt petunia and uncle vernon looked around instinctively as though expecting to see someone other than dudley squeezed between them 
 
 usmistreat dudders what began uncle vernon furiously but dumbledore raised his ringer for silence a silence which fell as though he had struck uncle vernon dumb 
 
 the magic i evoked fifteen years ago means that harry has powerful protection while he can still call this house home however miserable he has been here however unwelcome however badly treated you have at least grudgingly allowed him houseroom this magic will cease to operate the moment that harry turns seventeen in other words at the moment he becomes a man i ask only this that you allow harry to return once more to this house before his seventeenth birthday which will ensure that the protection continues until that time 
 
 none of the dursleys said anything dudley was frowning slightly as though he was still trying to work out when he had ever been mistreated uncle vernon looked as though he had something stuck in his throat aunt petunia however was oddly flushed 
 
 well harry time for us to be off said dumbledore at last standing up and straightening his long black cloak until we meet again he said to the dursleys who looked as though that moment could wait forever as far as they were concerned and after doffing his hat he swept from the room 
 
 bye said harry hastily to the dursleys and followed dumbledore who paused beside trunk upon which cage was perched 
 
 we do not want to be encumbered by these just now he said pulling out his wand again i shall send them to the burrow to await us there however i would like you to bring your invisibility cloak just in case 
 
 harry extracted his cloak from his trunk with some difficulty trying not to show dumbledore the mess within when he had stuffed it into an inside pocket of his jacket dumbiedore waved his wand and the trunk cage and hedwig vanished dumbledore then waved his wand again and the front door opened onto cool misty darkness 
 
 and now harry let us step out into the night and pursue that flighty temptress adventure 
 
 rowling

 shall we assume that you have invited me into your sitting room 
 
 dudley scrambled out of the way as dumbledore passed him harry still clutching the telescope and trainers jumped the last few stairs and followed dumbledore who had settled himself in the armchair nearest the fire and was taking in the surroundings wilh an expression of benign interest he looked quite extraordinarily out of place 
 
 we leaving sir harry asked anxiously 
 
 yes indeed we are but there are a few matters we need to discuss first said dumbledore and i would prefer not to do so in the open we shall trespass upon your aunt and hospitality only a little longer 
 
 you will will you 
 
 vernon dursley had entered the room petunia at his shoulder and dudley skulking behind them both 
 
 yes said dumbledore simply i shall 
 
 he drew his wand so rapidly that harry barely saw it with a casual flick the sofa zoomed forward and knocked the knees out from under all three of the dursleys so that they collapsed upon it in a heap another flick of the wand and the sofa zoomed back to its original position 
 
 we may as well be comfortable said dumbledore pleasantly 
 
 as he replaced his wand in his pocket harry saw that his hand was blackened and shriveled it looked as though his flesh had been burned away 
 
 sirwhat happened to your 
 
 later harry said dumbledore please sit down 
 
 harry took the remaining armchair choosing not to look at the dursleys who seemed stunned into silence 
 
 i would assume that you were going to offer me refreshment dumbledore said to uncle vernon but the evidence so far suggests that that would be optimistic to the point of foolishness 
 
 a third twitch of the wand and a dusty bottle and five glasses appeared in midair the bottle tipped and poured a generous measure of liquid into each of the glasses which then floated to each person in the room 
 
 madam finest mead said dumbledore raising his glass to harry who caught hold of his own and sipped he had never tasted anything like it before but enjoyed it immensely the dursleys after quick scared looks at one another tried to ignore their glasses completely a difficult feat as they were nudging them gently on the sides of their heads harry could not suppress a suspicion that dumbledore was rather enjoying himself 
 
 well harry said dumbledore turning toward him a difficulty has arisen which i hope you will be able to solve for us by us i mean the order of the phoenix but first of all i must tell you that will was discovered a week ago and that he left you everything he owned 
 
 over on the sofa uncle vernons head turned but harry did not look at him nor could he think of anything to say except oh right 
 
 this is in the main fairly straightforward dumbledore went on you add a reasonable amount of gold to your account at gringotts and you inherit all of personal possessions the slightly problematic part of the legacy 
 
 his dead said uncle vernon loudly from the sofa dumbledore and harry both turned to look at him the glass of mead was now knocking quite insistently on the side of head he attempted to beat it away dead his godfather 
 
 yes said dumbledore he did not ask harry why he had not confided in the dursleys our problem he continued to harry as if there had been no interruption is that sirius also left you number twelve grimmauld place 
 
 been left a house said uncle vernon greedily his small eyes narrowing but nobody answered him 
 
 you can keep using it as headquarters said harry i care you can have it i really want it harry never wanted to set foot in number twelve grimmauld place again if he could help it he thought he would be haunted forever by the memory of sirius prowling its dark musty rooms alone imprisoned within the place he had wanted so desperately to leave 
 
 that is generous said dumbledore we have however vacated the building temporarily 
 
 why 
 
 well said dumbledore ignoring the mutterings of uncle vernon who was now being rapped smartly over the head by the persistent glass of mead black family tradition decreed that the house was handed down the direct line to the next male with the name of black sirius was the very last of the line as his younger brother regulus predeceased him and both were childless while his will makes it perfectly plain that he wants you to have the house it is nevertheless possible that some spell or enchantment has been set upon the place to ensure that it cannot be owned by anyone other than a 
 
 a vivid image of the shrieking spitting portrait of mother that hung in the hall of number twelve grimmauld place flashed into mind i bet there has he said 
 
 quite said dumbledore and if such an enchantment exists then the ownership of the house is most likely to pass to the eldest of living relatives which would mean his cousin bellatrix lestrange 
 
 without realizing what he was doing harry sprang to his feet the telescope and trainers in his lap rolled across the floor bellatrix lestrange killer inherit his house 
 
 no he said 
 
 well obviously we would prefer that she get it either said dumbledore calmly the situation is fraught with complications we do not know whether the enchantments we ourselves have placed upon it for example making it unplottable will hold now that ownership has passed from hands it might be that bellatrix will arrive on the doorstep at any moment naturally we had to move out until such time as we have clarified the position 
 
 but how are you going to find out if allowed to own it 
 
 fortunately said dumbledore there is a simple test 
 
 he placed his empty glass on a small table beside his chair but before he could do anything else uncle vernon shouted will you get these ruddy things off us 
 
 harry looked around all three of the dursleys were cowering with their arms over their heads as their glasses bounced up and down on their skulls their contents flying everywhere 
 
 oh so sorry said dumbledore politely and he raised his wand again all three glasses vanished but it would have been better manners to drink it you know 
 
 it looked as though uncle vernon was bursting with any number of unpleasant retorts but he merely shrank back into the cushions with aunt petunia and dudley and said nothing keeping his small piggy eyes on wand 
 
 you see dumbledore said turning back to harry and again speaking as though uncle vernon had not uttered if you have indeed inherited the house you have also inherited 
 
 he flicked his wand for a fifth time there was a loud crack and a appeared with a snout for a nose giant ears and enormous bloodshot eyes crouching on the dursleys shag carpet and covered in grimy rags aunt petunia let out a shriek nothing this filthy had entered her house in living memory dudley drew his large bare pink feet off the floor and sat with them raised almost above his head as though he thought the creature might run up his pajama trousers and uncle vernon bellowed what the hell is that 
 
 kreacher finished dumbledore 
 
 kreacher kreacher kreacher croaked the quite as loudly as uncle vernon stamping his long gnarled feet and pulling his ears kreacher belongs to miss bellatrix oh yes kreacher belongs to the blacks kreacher wants his new mistress kreacher go to the potter brat kreacher 
 
 as you can see harry said dumbledore loudly over continued croaks of wont kreacher is showing a certain reluctance to pass into your ownership 
 
 i care said harry again looking with disgust at the writhing stamping i want him 
 
 
 
 you would prefer him to pass into the ownership of bellatrix lestrange bearing in mind that he has lived at the headquarters of the order of the phoenix for the past year 
 
 
 
 harry stared at dumbledore he knew that kreacher could not be permitted to go and live with bellatrix lestrange but the idea of owning him of having responsibility for the creature that had betrayed sirius was repugnant 
 
 give him an order said dumbledore if he has passed into your ownership he will have to obey if not then we shall have to think of some other means of keeping him from his rightful mistress 
 
 
 
 voice had risen to a scream harry could think of nothing to say except kreacher shut up 
 
 it looked for a moment as though kreacher was going to choke he grabbed his throat his mouth still working furiously his eyes bulging after a few seconds of frantic gulping he threw himself face forward onto the carpet aunt petunia whimpered and beat the floor with his hands and feet giving himself over to a violent but entirely silent tantrum 
 
 well that simplifies matters said dumbledore cheerfully it means that sirius knew what he was doing you are the rightful owner of number twelve grimmauld place and of kreacher 
 
 do ido i have to keep him with me harry asked aghast as kreacher thrashed around at his feet 
 
 not if you want to said dumbledore if i might make a suggestion you could send him to hogwarts to work in the kitchen there in that way the other could keep an eye on him 
 
 yeah said harry in relief yeah do that erkreacheri want you to go to hogwarts and work in the kitchens there with the other 
 
 kreacher who was now lying flat on his back with his arms and legs in the air gave harry one look of deepest loathing and with another loud crack vanished 
 
 good said dumbledore there is also the matter of the hippogriff buckbeak hagrid has been looking after him since sirius died but buckbeak is yours now so if you would prefer to make different arrangements 
 
 no said harry at once he can stay with hagrid i think buckbeak would prefer that 
 
 hagrid will be delighted said dumbledore smiling he was thrilled to see buckbeak again incidentally we have decided in the interests of safety to rechristen him witherwings for the time being though i doubt that the ministry would ever guess he is the hippogriff they once sentenced to death now harry is your trunk packed 
 
 erm 
 
 doubtful that i would turn up dumbledore suggested shrewdly 
 
 just go anderfinish off said harry hastily hurrying to pick up his fallen telescope and trainers 
 
 it took him a little over ten minutes to track down everything he needed at last he had managed to extract his invisibility cloak from under the bed screwed the top back on his jar of ink and forced the lid of his trunk shut on his cauldron then heaving his trunk in one hand and holding cage in the other he made his way back downstairs 
 
 he was disappointed to discover that dumbledore was not waiting in the hall which meant that he had to return to the living room 
 
 nobody was talking dumbledore was humming quietly apparently quite at his ease but the atmosphere was thicker than cold custard and harry did not dare look at the dursleys as he said ready now 
 
 good said dumbledore just one last thing then and he turned to speak to the dursleys once more 
 
 as you will no doubt be aware harry comes of age in a time 
 
 no said aunt petunia speaking for the first time since arrival 
 
 sorry said dumbledore politely 
 
 no he a month younger than dudley and dudders turn eighteen until the year after next 
 
 ah said dumbledore pleasantly but in the wizarding world we come of age at seventeen 
 
 uncle vernon muttered preposterous but dumbledore ignored him 
 
 now as you already know the wizard called lord voldemort has returned to this country the wizarding community is currently in a state of open warfare harry whom lord voldemort has already attempted to kill on a number of occasions is in even greater danger now than the day when i left him upon your doorstep fifteen years ago with a letter explaining about his parents murder and expressing the hope that you would care for him as though he were your own 
 
 dumbledore paused and although his voice remained light and calm and he gave no obvious sign of anger harry felt a kind of chill emanating from him and noticed that the dursleys drew very slightly closer together 
 
 you did not do as i asked you have never treated harry as a son he has known nothing but neglect and often cruelty at your hands the best that can be said is that he has at least escaped the appalling damage you have inflicted upon the unfortunate boy sitting between you 
 
 both aunt petunia and uncle vernon looked around instinctively as though expecting to see someone other than dudley squeezed between them 
 
 usmistreat dudders what began uncle vernon furiously but dumbledore raised his ringer for silence a silence which fell as though he had struck uncle vernon dumb 
 
 the magic i evoked fifteen years ago means that harry has powerful protection while he can still call this house home however miserable he has been here however unwelcome however badly treated you have at least grudgingly allowed him houseroom this magic will cease to operate the moment that harry turns seventeen in other words at the moment he becomes a man i ask only this that you allow harry to return once more to this house before his seventeenth birthday which will ensure that the protection continues until that time 
 
 none of the dursleys said anything dudley was frowning slightly as though he was still trying to work out when he had ever been mistreated uncle vernon looked as though he had something stuck in his throat aunt petunia however was oddly flushed 
 
 well harry time for us to be off said dumbledore at last standing up and straightening his long black cloak until we meet again he said to the dursleys who looked as though that moment could wait forever as far as they were concerned and after doffing his hat he swept from the room 
 
 bye said harry hastily to the dursleys and followed dumbledore who paused beside trunk upon which cage was perched 
 
 we do not want to be encumbered by these just now he said pulling out his wand again i shall send them to the burrow to await us there however i would like you to bring your invisibility cloak just in case 
 
 harry extracted his cloak from his trunk with some difficulty trying not to show dumbledore the mess within when he had stuffed it into an inside pocket of his jacket dumbiedore waved his wand and the trunk cage and hedwig vanished dumbledore then waved his wand again and the front door opened onto cool misty darkness 
 
 and now harry let us step out into the night and pursue that flighty temptress adventure

 the sound of the front door slamming echoed up the stairs and a voice roared oh you 
 
 sixteen years of being addressed thus left harry in no doubt when his uncle was calling nevertheless he did not immediately respond he was still at the narrow fragment in which for a split second he had thought he saw dumbledores eye it was not until his uncle bellowed boy that harry got slowly out of bed and headed for the bedroom door pausing to add the piece of broken mirror to the rucksack filled with things he would be taking with him 
 
 you took you time roared vernon dursley when harry appeared at the top of the stairs get down here i want a word 
 
 harry strolled downstairs his hands deep in his pants pockets when he searched the living room he found all three dursleys they were dressed for packing uncle vernon in an old jacket and dudley harrys large blond muscular cousin in his leather jacket 
 
 yes asked harry 
 
 sit down said uncle vernon harry raised his eyebrows please added uncle vernon wincing slightly as though the word was sharp in his throat harry sat he thought he knew what was coming his uncle began to pace up and down aunt petunia and dudley following his movement with anxious expressions finally his large purple face crumpled with concentration uncle vernon stopped in front of harry and spoke 
 
 ive changed my mind he said 
 
 what a surprise said harry 
 
 dont you take that tone c began aunt petunia in a shrill voice but vernon dursley waved her down its all a lot of claptrap said uncle vernon glaring at harry with piggy little eyes ive decided i dont believe a word of it were staying put were not going anywhere 
 
 harry looked up at his uncle and felt a mixture of exasperation and amusement vernon dursley had been changing his mind every twenty four hours for the past four weeks packing and unpacking and repacking the car with every change of heart harrys favorite moment had been the one when uncle vernon unaware that dudley had added his dumbbells to his case since the last time it been repacked had attempted to hoist it back into the boot and collapsed with a yelp of pain and much swearing 
 
 according to you vernon dursley said now resuming his pacing up and down the living room we c petunia dudley and i c are in danger from c from c 
 
 some of my lot right said harry 
 
 well i dont believe it repeated uncle vernon coming to a halt in front of harry again i was awake half the night thinking it all over and i believe its a plot to get the house 
 
 the house repeated harry what house 
 
 this house shrieked uncle vernon the vein his forehead starting to pulse our house house prices are skyrocketing around here you want us out of the way and then youre going to do a bit of hocus pocus and before we know it the deeds will be in your name and c 
 
 are you out of your mind demanded harry a plot to get this house are you actually as stupid as you look 
 
 dont you dare c squealed aunt petunia but again vernon waved her down slights on his personal appearance were it seemed as nothing to the danger he had spotted 
 
 just in case youve forgotten said harry ive already got a house my godfather left me one so why would i want this one all the happy memories 
 
 there was silence harry thought he had rather impressed his uncle with this argument 
 
 you claim said uncle vernon starting to pace yet again that this lord thing c 
 
 c voldemort said harry impatiently and weve been through this about a hundred times already this isnt a claim its fact dumbledore told you last year and kingsley and mr weasley c 
 
 vernon dursley hunched his shoulders angrily and harry guessed that his uncle was attempting to ward off recollections of the unannounced visit a few days into harrys summer holidays of two fully grown wizards the arrival on the doorstep of kingsley shacklebolt and arthur weasley had come as a most unpleasant shock to the dursleys harry had to admit however that as mr weasley had once demolished half of the living room his reappearance could not have been expected to delight uncle vernon 
 
 c kingsley and mr weasley explained it all as well harry pressed on remorselessly once im seventeen the protective charm that keeps me safe will break and that exposes you as well as me the order is sure voldemort will target you whether to torture you to try and find out where i am or because he thinks by holding you hostage id come and try to rescue you 
 
 uncle vernons and harrys eyes met harry was sure that in that instant they were both wondering the same thing then uncle vernon walked on and harry resumed youve got to go into hiding and the order wants to help youre being offered serious protection the best there is 
 
 uncle vernon said nothing but continued to pace up and down outside the sun hung low over the privet hedges the next door neighbors lawn mower stalled again 
 
 i thought there was a ministry of magic asked vernon dursley abruptly 
 
 there is said harry surprised 
 
 well then why cant they protect us it seems to me that as innocent victims guilty of nothing more than harboring a marked man we ought to qualify for government protection 
 
 harry laughed he could not help himself it was so very typical of his uncle to put his hopes in the establishment even within this world that he despised and mistrusted you heard what mr weasley and kingsley said harry replied we think the ministry has been infiltrated 
 
 uncle vernon strode back to the fireplace and back breathing so strongly that his great black mustache rippled his face still purple with concentration 
 
 all right he said stopping in front of harry get again all right lets say for the sake of argument we accept this protection i still dont see why we cant have that kingsley bloke 
 
 harry managed not to roll his eyes but with difficulty this question had also been addressed half a dozen times 
 
 as ive told you he said through gritted teeth kingsley is protecting the mug c i mean your prime minister 
 
 exactly c hes the best said uncle vernon pointing at the blank television screen the dursleys had spotted kingsley on the news walking along the muggle prime minister as he visited a hospital this and the fact that kingsley had mastered the knack of dressing like a muggle not to mention a certain reassuring something in his slow deep voice had caused the dursleys to take to kingsley in a way that they had certainly not done with any other wizard although it was true that they had never seen him with earring in 
 
 well hes taken said harry but hestia jones and dedalus diggle are more than up to the job c 
 
 if wed even seen cvs began uncle vernon but harry lost patience getting to his feet he advanced on his uncle not pointing at the tv set himself 
 
 these accidents arent accidents c the crashed and explosions and derailments and whatever else has happened since we last watched the news people are disappearing and dying and hes behind it c voldemort ive told you this over and over again he kills muggles for fun even the fogs c theyre caused by dementors and if you cant remember what they are ask your son 
 
 dudleys hands jerked upward to tower his mouth with his parents and harrys eyes upon him he slowly lowered them again and asked there are more of them 
 
 more laughed harry more than the two that attacked us you mean of course there are hundreds maybe thousands by this time seeing as they feed off fear and despair c 
 
 all right all right blustered blustered vernon dursley youve made your point c 
 
 i hope so said harry because once im seventeen all of them c death eaters elementors maybe even inferi c which means dead bodies enchanted by a dark wizard c will be able to find you and will certainly attack you and if you remember the last time you tried to outrun wizards i think youll agree you need help 
 
 there was a brief silence in which the distant echo of hagrid smashing down a wooden front door seemed to reverberate through the intervening years aunt petunia was looking at uncle vernon dudley was staring at harry finally uncle vernon blurted out but what about my work what about dudleys school i dont suppose those things matter to a bunch of layabout wizards c 
 
 dont you understand shouted harry they will torture and kill you like they did my parents 
 
 dad said dudley in a loud voice dad c im going with these order people 
 
 dudley said harry for the first time in your life youre talking sense he knew the battle was won if dudley was frightened enough to accept the orders help his parents would accompany him there could be no question of being separated from their duddykins harry glanced at the carriage clock on the mantelpiece 
 
 theyll be here in about five minutes he said and when one of the dursleys replied he left the room the prospect of parting c probably forever c from his aunt uncle and cousin was one that he was able to contemplate quite cheerfully but there was nevertheless a certain awkwardness in the air what did you say to one another at the end of sixteen years solid dislike 
 
 back in his bedroom harry fiddled aimlessly with his rucksack then poked a couple of owl nuts through the bats of hedwigs cage they fell with dull thuds to the bottom where she ignored them 
 
 were leaving soon really soon harry told her and then youll be able to fly again 
 
 the doorbell rang harry hesitated then headed back out of his room and downstairs it was too much to expect hestia and dedalus to cope with the dursleys on their own 
 
 harry potter squeaked an excited voice the moment harry had opened the door a small man in a mauve top hat that was sweeping him a deep bow an honor as ever 
 
 thanks dedalus said harry bestowing a small and embarrassed smile upon the dark haired hestia its really good of you to do this theyre through here my aunt and uncle and cousin 
 
 good day to you harry potters relatives said dedalus happily striding into the living room the dursleys did not look at all happy to be addressed thus harry half expected another change of mind dudley shrank neared to his mother at the sight of the witch and wizard 
 
 i see you are packed and ready excellent the plan as harry has told you is a simple one said dedalus pulling an immense pocket watch out of his waistcoat and examining it we shall be leaving before harry does due to the danger of using magic in your house charry being still underage it could provide the ministry with an excuse to arrest him c we shall be driving say ten miles or so before disapparating to the safe location we have picked out for you you know how to drive i take it he asked uncle vernon politely 
 
 know how to c of course i ruddy well know how to drive spluttered uncle vernon 
 
 very clever of you sir very clever i personally would be utterly bamboozled by all those buttons and knobs said dedalus he was clearly under the impression that he was flattering vernon dursley who was visibly losing confidence in the plan with every word dedalus spoke 
 
 cant even drive he muttered under his breath his mustache rippling indignantly but fortunately neither dedalus nor hestia seemed to hear him 
 
 you harry dedalus continued will wait here for your guard there has been a little change in the arrangements c 
 
 what dyou mean said harry at once i thought was going to come and take me by side 
 
 cant do it said hestia tersely will explain 
 
 the dursleys who had listened to all of this with looks of utter incomprehension on their faces jumped as a loud voice screeched hurry up harry looked all around the room before realizing the voice had issued from dedaluss pocket watch 
 
 quite right were operating to a very tight schedule said dedalus nodding at his watch and tucking it back into his waist coat we are attempting to time your departure from the house with your familys disapparition harry thus the charm breaks the moment you all head for safety he turned to the dursleys well are we all packed and ready to go 
 
 none of them answered him uncle vernon was still staring appalled at the bulge in dedaluss waistcoat pocket 
 
 perhaps we should wait outside in the hall dedalus murmured hestia she clearly felt that it would be tactless for them to remain the room while harry and the dursleys exchanged loving possibly tearful farewells 
 
 theres no need harry muttered but uncle vernon made any further explanation unnecessary by saying loudly well this is then boy 
 
 he swung his right arm upward to shake harrys hand but at the last moment seemed unable to face it and merely closed his fist and began swinging it backward and forward like a metronome 
 
 ready duddy asked petunia fussily checking the clasp of her handbag so as to avoid looking at harry altogether 
 
 dudley did not answer but stood there with his mouth slightly ajar reminding harry a little of the giant grawp 
 
 come along then said uncle vernon 
 
 he had already reached the living room door when dudley mumbled i dont understand 
 
 what dont you understand popkin asked petunia looking up at her son 
 
 dudley raised a large hamlike hand to point at harry 
 
 why isnt he coming with us 
 
 uncle vernon and aunt petunia froze when they stood staring at dudley as though he had just expressed a desire to become a ballerina 
 
 what said uncle vernon loudly 
 
 why isnt he coming too asked dudley 
 
 well he c doesnt want to said uncle vernon turning to glare at harry and adding you dont want to do you 
 
 not in the slightest said harry 
 
 there you are uncle vernon told dudley now come on were off 
 
 he marched out of the room they heard the front door open but dudley did not move and after a few faltering steps aunt petunia stopped too 
 
 what now barked uncle vernon reappearing in the doorway 
 
 it seemed that dudley was struggling with concepts too difficult to put into words after several moments of apparently painful internal struggle he said but wheres he going to go 
 
 aunt petunia and uncle vernon looked at each other it was clear that dudley was frightening them hestia jones broke the silence 
 
 but surely you know where your nephew is going she asked looking bewildered 
 
 certainly we know said vernon dursley hes off with some of your lot isnt he right dudley lets get in the car you heard the man were in a hurry 
 
 again vernon dursley marched as far as the front door but dudley did not follow 
 
 off with some of our lot 
 
 hestia looked outraged harry had met this attitude before witches and wizards seemed stunned that his closed living relatives took so little interest in the famous harry potter 
 
 its fine harry assured her it doesnt matter honestly 
 
 doesnt matter repeated hestia her voice rising considerably 
 
 dont these people realize what youve been through what danger you are in the unique position you hold in the hearts of the anti voldemort movement 
 
 er c no they dont said harry they think im a waste of space actually but im used to c 
 
 i dont think youre a waste of space 
 
 if harry had not seen dudleys lips move he might not have believed it as it was he stared at dudley for several seconds before accepting that it must have been his cousin who had spoken for one thing dudley had turned red harry was embarrassed and astonished himself 
 
 well er thanks dudley 
 
 again dudley appeared to grapple with thoughts too unwieldy for expression before mumbling you saved my life 
 
 not really said harry it was your soul the dementor would have taken 
 
 he looked curiously at his cousin they had had virtually no contact during this summer or last as harry had come back to privet drive so briefly and kept to his room so much it now dawned on harry however that the cup of cold tea on which he had trodden that morning might not have been a booby trap at all although rather touched he was nevertheless quite relieved that dudley appeared to have exhausted his ability to express his feelings after opening his mouth once or twice more dudley subsided into silence 
 
 aunt petunia burst into tears hestia jones gave her an approving look that changed to outrage as aunt petunia ran forward and embraced dudley rather than harry sweet dudders she sobbed into his massive chest a lovely thank you 
 
 but he hasnt said thank you at all said hestia indignantly he only said he didnt think harry was a waste of space 
 
 yea but coming from dudley thats like i love you said harry torn between annoyance and a desire to laugh as aunt petunia continued to clutch at dudley as if he had just saved harry from a burning building 
 
 are we going or not roared uncle vernon reappearing yet again at the living room door i thought we were on a tight schedule 
 
 yes cyes we are said dedalus diggle who had been watching these exchanged with an air of bemusement and now seemed to pull himself together we really must be off harry c 
 
 he tripped forward and wrung harrys hand with both of his own 
 
 c good luck i hope we meet again the hopes of the wizarding world rest upon your shoulders 
 
 oh said harry right thanks 
 
 farwell harry said hestia also clasping his hand our thoughts go with you 
 
 i hope everythings okay said harry with a glance toward aunt petunia and dudley 
 
 oh im sure we shall end up the best of chums said diggle slightly waving his hat as he left the room hestia followed him 
 
 dudley gently released himself from his mothers clutches and walked toward harry who had to repress an urge to threaten him with magic then dudley held out his large pink hand 
 
 blimey dudley said harry over aunt petunias renewed sobs did the dementors blow a different personality into you 
 
 dunno muttered dudley see you harry 
 
 yea said harry raking dudleys hand and shaking it maybe take care big d 
 
 dudley nearly smiled they lumbered from the room harry heard his heavy footfalls on the graveled drive and then a car door slammed 
 
 aunt petunia whose face had been buried in her handkerchief looked around at the sound she did not seem to have expected to find herself alone with harry hastily stowing her wet handkerchief into her pocket she said well c and marched towards the door without looking at him 
 
 said harry 
 
 she stopped and looked back for a moment harry had the strangest feeling that she wanted to say something to him she gave him an odd tremulous look and seemed to teeter on the edge of speech but then with a little of her head she hustled out of the room after he husband and son

 this house shrieked uncle vernon the vein his forehead starting to pulse our house house prices are skyrocketing around here you want us out of the way and then youre going to do a bit of hocus pocus and before we know it the deeds will be in your name and c 
 
 are you out of your mind demanded harry a plot to get this house are you actually as stupid as you look 
 
 dont you dare c squealed aunt petunia but again vernon waved her down slights on his personal appearance were it seemed as nothing to the danger he had spotted 
 
 just in case youve forgotten said harry ive already got a house my godfather left me one so why would i want this one all the happy memories 
 
 there was silence harry thought he had rather impressed his uncle with this argument 
 
 you claim said uncle vernon starting to pace yet again that this lord thing c 
 
 c voldemort said harry impatiently and weve been through this about a hundred times already this isnt a claim its fact dumbledore told you last year and kingsley and mr weasley c 
 
 vernon dursley hunched his shoulders angrily and harry guessed that his uncle was attempting to ward off recollections of the unannounced visit a few days into harrys summer holidays of two fully grown wizards the arrival on the doorstep of kingsley shacklebolt and arthur weasley had come as a most unpleasant shock to the dursleys harry had to admit however that as mr weasley had once demolished half of the living room his reappearance could not have been expected to delight uncle vernon 
 
 c kingsley and mr weasley explained it all as well harry pressed on remorselessly once im seventeen the protective charm that keeps me safe will break and that exposes you as well as me the order is sure voldemort will target you whether to torture you to try and find out where i am or because he thinks by holding you hostage id come and try to rescue you 
 
 uncle vernons and harrys eyes met harry was sure that in that instant they were both wondering the same thing then uncle vernon walked on and harry resumed youve got to go into hiding and the order wants to help youre being offered serious protection the best there is 
 
 uncle vernon said nothing but continued to pace up and down outside the sun hung low over the privet hedges the next door neighbors lawn mower stalled again 
 
 i thought there was a ministry of magic asked vernon dursley abruptly 
 
 there is said harry surprised 
 
 well then why cant they protect us it seems to me that as innocent victims guilty of nothing more than harboring a marked man we ought to qualify for government protection 
 
 harry laughed he could not help himself it was so very typical of his uncle to put his hopes in the establishment even within this world that he despised and mistrusted you heard what mr weasley and kingsley said harry replied we think the ministry has been infiltrated 
 
 uncle vernon strode back to the fireplace and back breathing so strongly that his great black mustache rippled his face still purple with concentration 
 
 all right he said stopping in front of harry get again all right lets say for the sake of argument we accept this protection i still dont see why we cant have that kingsley bloke 
 
 harry managed not to roll his eyes but with difficulty this question had also been addressed half a dozen times 
 
 as ive told you he said through gritted teeth kingsley is protecting the mug c i mean your prime minister 
 
 exactly c hes the best said uncle vernon pointing at the blank television screen the dursleys had spotted kingsley on the news walking along the muggle prime minister as he visited a hospital this and the fact that kingsley had mastered the knack of dressing like a muggle not to mention a certain reassuring something in his slow deep voice had caused the dursleys to take to kingsley in a way that they had certainly not done with any other wizard although it was true that they had never seen him with earring in 
 
 well hes taken said harry but hestia jones and dedalus diggle are more than up to the job c 
 
 if wed even seen cvs began uncle vernon but harry lost patience getting to his feet he advanced on his uncle not pointing at the tv set himself 
 
 these accidents arent accidents c the crashed and explosions and derailments and whatever else has happened since we last watched the news people are disappearing and dying and hes behind it c voldemort ive told you this over and over again he kills muggles for fun even the fogs c theyre caused by dementors and if you cant remember what they are ask your son 
 
 dudleys hands jerked upward to tower his mouth with his parents and harrys eyes upon him he slowly lowered them again and asked there are more of them 
 
 more laughed harry more than the two that attacked us you mean of course there are hundreds maybe thousands by this time seeing as they feed off fear and despair c 
 
 all right all right blustered blustered vernon dursley youve made your point c 
 
 i hope so said harry because once im seventeen all of them c death eaters elementors maybe even inferi c which means dead bodies enchanted by a dark wizard c will be able to find you and will certainly attack you and if you remember the last time you tried to outrun wizards i think youll agree you need help 
 
 there was a brief silence in which the distant echo of hagrid smashing down a wooden front door seemed to reverberate through the intervening years aunt petunia was looking at uncle vernon dudley was staring at harry finally uncle vernon blurted out but what about my work what about dudleys school i dont suppose those things matter to a bunch of layabout wizards c 
 
 dont you understand shouted harry they will torture and kill you like they did my parents 
 
 dad said dudley in a loud voice dad c im going with these order people 
 
 dudley said harry for the first time in your life youre talking sense he knew the battle was won if dudley was frightened enough to accept the orders help his parents would accompany him there could be no question of being separated from their duddykins harry glanced at the carriage clock on the mantelpiece 
 
 theyll be here in about five minutes he said and when one of the dursleys replied he left the room the prospect of parting c probably forever c from his aunt uncle and cousin was one that he was able to contemplate quite cheerfully but there was nevertheless a certain awkwardness in the air what did you say to one another at the end of sixteen years solid dislike 
 
 back in his bedroom harry fiddled aimlessly with his rucksack then poked a couple of owl nuts through the bats of hedwigs cage they fell with dull thuds to the bottom where she ignored them 
 
 were leaving soon really soon harry told her and then youll be able to fly again 
 
 the doorbell rang harry hesitated then headed back out of his room and downstairs it was too much to expect hestia and dedalus to cope with the dursleys on their own 
 
 harry potter squeaked an excited voice the moment harry had opened the door a small man in a mauve top hat that was sweeping him a deep bow an honor as ever 
 
 thanks dedalus said harry bestowing a small and embarrassed smile upon the dark haired hestia its really good of you to do this theyre through here my aunt and uncle and cousin 
 
 good day to you harry potters relatives said dedalus happily striding into the living room the dursleys did not look at all happy to be addressed thus harry half expected another change of mind dudley shrank neared to his mother at the sight of the witch and wizard 
 
 i see you are packed and ready excellent the plan as harry has told you is a simple one said dedalus pulling an immense pocket watch out of his waistcoat and examining it we shall be leaving before harry does due to the danger of using magic in your house charry being still underage it could provide the ministry with an excuse to arrest him c we shall be driving say ten miles or so before disapparating to the safe location we have picked out for you you know how to drive i take it he asked uncle vernon politely 
 
 know how to c of course i ruddy well know how to drive spluttered uncle vernon 
 
 very clever of you sir very clever i personally would be utterly bamboozled by all those buttons and knobs said dedalus he was clearly under the impression that he was flattering vernon dursley who was visibly losing confidence in the plan with every word dedalus spoke 
 
 cant even drive he muttered under his breath his mustache rippling indignantly but fortunately neither dedalus nor hestia seemed to hear him 
 
 you harry dedalus continued will wait here for your guard there has been a little change in the arrangements c 
 
 what dyou mean said harry at once i thought was going to come and take me by side 
 
 cant do it said hestia tersely will explain 
 
 the dursleys who had listened to all of this with looks of utter incomprehension on their faces jumped as a loud voice screeched hurry up harry looked all around the room before realizing the voice had issued from dedaluss pocket watch 
 
 quite right were operating to a very tight schedule said dedalus nodding at his watch and tucking it back into his waist coat we are attempting to time your departure from the house with your familys disapparition harry thus the charm breaks the moment you all head for safety he turned to the dursleys well are we all packed and ready to go 
 
 none of them answered him uncle vernon was still staring appalled at the bulge in dedaluss waistcoat pocket 
 
 perhaps we should wait outside in the hall dedalus murmured hestia she clearly felt that it would be tactless for them to remain the room while harry and the dursleys exchanged loving possibly tearful farewells 
 
 theres no need harry muttered but uncle vernon made any further explanation unnecessary by saying loudly well this is then boy 
 
 he swung his right arm upward to shake harrys hand but at the last moment seemed unable to face it and merely closed his fist and began swinging it backward and forward like a metronome 
 
 ready duddy asked petunia fussily checking the clasp of her handbag so as to avoid looking at harry altogether 
 
 dudley did not answer but stood there with his mouth slightly ajar reminding harry a little of the giant grawp 
 
 come along then said uncle vernon 
 
 he had already reached the living room door when dudley mumbled i dont understand 
 
 what dont you understand popkin asked petunia looking up at her son 
 
 dudley raised a large hamlike hand to point at harry 
 
 why isnt he coming with us 
 
 uncle vernon and aunt petunia froze when they stood staring at dudley as though he had just expressed a desire to become a ballerina 
 
 what said uncle vernon loudly 
 
 why isnt he coming too asked dudley 
 
 well he c doesnt want to said uncle vernon turning to glare at harry and adding you dont want to do you 
 
 not in the slightest said harry 
 
 there you are uncle vernon told dudley now come on were off 
 
 he marched out of the room they heard the front door open but dudley did not move and after a few faltering steps aunt petunia stopped too 
 
 what now barked uncle vernon reappearing in the doorway 
 
 it seemed that dudley was struggling with concepts too difficult to put into words after several moments of apparently painful internal struggle he said but wheres he going to go 
 
 aunt petunia and uncle vernon looked at each other it was clear that dudley was frightening them hestia jones broke the silence 
 
 but surely you know where your nephew is going she asked looking bewildered 
 
 certainly we know said vernon dursley hes off with some of your lot isnt he right dudley lets get in the car you heard the man were in a hurry 
 
 again vernon dursley marched as far as the front door but dudley did not follow 
 
 off with some of our lot 
 
 hestia looked outraged harry had met this attitude before witches and wizards seemed stunned that his closed living relatives took so little interest in the famous harry potter 
 
 its fine harry assured her it doesnt matter honestly 
 
 doesnt matter repeated hestia her voice rising considerably 
 
 dont these people realize what youve been through what danger you are in the unique position you hold in the hearts of the anti voldemort movement 
 
 er c no they dont said harry they think im a waste of space actually but im used to c 
 
 i dont think youre a waste of space 
 
 if harry had not seen dudleys lips move he might not have believed it as it was he stared at dudley for several seconds before accepting that it must have been his cousin who had spoken for one thing dudley had turned red harry was embarrassed and astonished himself 
 
 well er thanks dudley 
 
 again dudley appeared to grapple with thoughts too unwieldy for expression before mumbling you saved my life 
 
 not really said harry it was your soul the dementor would have taken 
 
 he looked curiously at his cousin they had had virtually no contact during this summer or last as harry had come back to privet drive so briefly and kept to his room so much it now dawned on harry however that the cup of cold tea on which he had trodden that morning might not have been a booby trap at all although rather touched he was nevertheless quite relieved that dudley appeared to have exhausted his ability to express his feelings after opening his mouth once or twice more dudley subsided into silence 
 
 aunt petunia burst into tears hestia jones gave her an approving look that changed to outrage as aunt petunia ran forward and embraced dudley rather than harry sweet dudders she sobbed into his massive chest a lovely thank you 
 
 but he hasnt said thank you at all said hestia indignantly he only said he didnt think harry was a waste of space 
 
 yea but coming from dudley thats like i love you said harry torn between annoyance and a desire to laugh as aunt petunia continued to clutch at dudley as if he had just saved harry from a burning building 
 
 are we going or not roared uncle vernon reappearing yet again at the living room door i thought we were on a tight schedule 
 
 yes cyes we are said dedalus diggle who had been watching these exchanged with an air of bemusement and now seemed to pull himself together we really must be off harry c 
 
 he tripped forward and wrung harrys hand with both of his own 
 
 c good luck i hope we meet again the hopes of the wizarding world rest upon your shoulders 
 
 oh said harry right thanks 
 
 farwell harry said hestia also clasping his hand our thoughts go with you 
 
 i hope everythings okay said harry with a glance toward aunt petunia and dudley 
 
 oh im sure we shall end up the best of chums said diggle slightly waving his hat as he left the room hestia followed him 
 
 dudley gently released himself from his mothers clutches and walked toward harry who had to repress an urge to threaten him with magic then dudley held out his large pink hand 
 
 blimey dudley said harry over aunt petunias renewed sobs did the dementors blow a different personality into you 
 
 dunno muttered dudley see you harry 
 
 yea said harry raking dudleys hand and shaking it maybe take care big d 
 
 dudley nearly smiled they lumbered from the room harry heard his heavy footfalls on the graveled drive and then a car door slammed 
 
 aunt petunia whose face had been buried in her handkerchief looked around at the sound she did not seem to have expected to find herself alone with harry hastily stowing her wet handkerchief into her pocket she said well c and marched towards the door without looking at him 
 
 said harry 
 
 she stopped and looked back for a moment harry had the strangest feeling that she wanted to say something to him she gave him an odd tremulous look and seemed to teeter on the edge of speech but then with a little of her head she hustled out of the room after he husband and son

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 a leaf from heaven 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 high up in the clear pure air flew an angel with a flower 
 plucked from the garden of heaven as he was kissing the flower a very little leaf fell from it and sunk down into the soft earth in the 
 middle of a wood it immediately took root sprouted and sent out 
 shoots among the other plants what a ridiculous little shoot said one no one will recognize it not even the thistle nor the it must be a kind of garden plant said another and so they 
 sneered and despised the plant as a thing from a garden where are you coming said the tall thistles whose leaves were all armed with thorns it is stupid nonsense to allow yourself to shoot out in this way we are not here to support you 
 
 winter came and the plant was covered with snow but the snow 
 glittered over it as if it had sunshine beneath as well as above 
 when spring came the plant appeared in full bloom a more 
 beautiful object than any other plant in the forest and now the 
 professor of botany presented himself one who could explain his 
 knowledge in black and white he examined and tested the plant but it did not belong to his system of botany nor could he possibly find out to what class it did belong it must be some degenerate species 
 said he i do not know it and it is not mentioned in any system 
 not known in any system repeated the thistles and the nettles 
 
 the large trees which grew round it saw the plant and heard the 
 remarks but they said not a word either good or bad which is the 
 wisest plan for those who are ignorant 
 
 there passed through the forest a poor innocent girl her heart 
 was pure and her understanding increased by her faith her chief 
 inheritance had been an old bible which she read and valued from its pages she heard the voice of god speaking to her and telling her to remember what was said of brethren when persons wished to injure her they imagined evil in their hearts but god turned it to good if we suffer wrongfully if we are misunderstood or despised we must think of him who was pure and holy and who prayed for those who nailed him to the cross father forgive them for they know not what they do 
 
 the girl stood still before the wonderful plant for the green 
 leaves exhaled a sweet and refreshing fragrance and the flowers 
 glittered and sparkled in the sunshine like colored flames and the 
 harmony of sweet sounds lingered round them as if each concealed 
 within itself a deep fount of melody which thousands of years could 
 not exhaust with pious gratitude the girl looked upon this glorious 
 work of god and bent down over one of the branches that she might examine the flower and inhale the sweet perfume then a light broke in on her mind and her heart expanded gladly would she have plucked a flower but she could not overcome her reluctance to break one off 
 
 she knew it would so soon fade so she took only a single green 
 leaf carried it home and laid it in her bible where it remained 
 ever green fresh and unfading between the pages of the bible it 
 still lay when a few weeks afterwards that bible was laid under 
 the young head in her coffin a holy calm rested on her face 
 as if the earthly remains bore the impress of the truth that she now 
 stood in the presence of god 
 
 in the forest the wonderful plant still continued to bloom till it 
 grew and became almost a tree and all the birds of passage bowed 
 themselves before it 
 
 that plant is a foreigner no doubt said the thistles and the 
 burdocks we can never conduct ourselves like that in this 
 country and the black forest snails actually spat at the flower 
 then came the swineherd he was collecting thistles and shrubs 
 to burn them for the ashes he pulled up the wonderful plant roots 
 and all and placed it in his bundle this will be as useful as any 
 he said so the plant was carried away 
 
 not long after the king of the country suffered from the 
 deepest melancholy he was diligent and industrious but employment 
 did him no good they read deep and learned books to him and then the lightest and most trifling that could be found but all to no purpose 
 
 then they applied for advice to one of the wise men of the world 
 and he sent them a message to say that there was one remedy which 
 would relieve and cure him and that it was a plant of heavenly origin 
 which grew in the forest in the own dominions the messenger 
 described the flower so that is appearance could not be mistaken 
 then said the swineherd i am afraid i carried this plant away 
 from the forest in my bundle and it has been burnt to ashes long ago 
 but i did not know any better 
 
 you did not know any better ignorance upon ignorance indeed 
 the poor swineherd took these words to heart for they were 
 addressed to him he knew not that there were others who were 
 equally ignorant not even a leaf of the plant could be found there 
 was one but it lay in the coffin of the dead no one knew anything 
 about it 
 
 then the king in his melancholy wandered out to the spot in 
 the wood here is where the plant stood he said it is a sacred 
 place then he ordered that the place should be surrounded with a 
 golden railing and a sentry stationed near it 
 
 the botanical professor wrote a long treatise about the heavenly 
 plant and for this he was loaded with gold which improved the 
 position of himself and his family 
 
 and this part is really the most pleasant part of the story for 
 the plant had disappeared and the king remained as melancholy and sad as ever but the sentry said he had always been so

 part 
 
 int cellblock five night 
 three tiers to a side concrete and steel gray and imposing 
 andy and the others are marched in still naked carrying their clothes and bibles the cons in their cells greet them with taunts jeers and laughter one by one the new men are shown to their cells and locked in with a clang of steel 
 red 
 the first the toughest no doubt about it they march you in 
 naked as the day born fresh from a bible reading skin burning 
 and from that delousing shit they throw on you 
 red watches from his cell arms slung over the crossbars cigarette dangling from his fingers 
 red 
 and when they put you in that cell when those bars slam home 
 when you know for real old life blown away in the blink of 
 an long cold season in hell stretching out left but all the time in the world to think about it

 others being brought up to the nd tier

 ion 
 by plato 
 translated by benjamin jowett 
 
 persons of the dialogue socrates ion 
 socrates welcome ion are you from your native city of ephesus 
 ion no socrates but from epidaurus where i attended the festival 
 of asclepius 
 soc and do the epidaurians have contests of rhapsodes at the 
 festival 
 ion o yes and of all sorts of musical performers 
 soc and were you one of the competitors and did you succeed 
 ion i obtained the first prize of all socrates 
 soc well done and i hope that you will do the same for us at the 
 panathenaea 
 ion and i will please heaven 
 soc i often envy the profession of a rhapsode 
 ion for you have always to wear fine clothes and to look as beautiful 
 as you can is a part of your art then again you are obliged to be 
 continually in the company of many good poets and especially of 
 homer who is the best and most divine of them and to understand 
 him and not merely learn his words by rote is a thing greatly to be 
 envied and no man can be a rhapsode who does not understand the 
 meaning of the poet for the rhapsode ought to interpret the mind of 
 the poet to his hearers but how can he interpret him well unless he 
 knows what he means all this is greatly to be envied 
 ion very true socrates interpretation has certainly been the most 
 laborious part of my art and i believe myself able to speak about 
 homer better than any man and that neither metrodorus of 
 lampsacus nor stesimbrotus of thasos nor glaucon nor any one 
 else who ever was had as good ideas about homer as i have or as 
 many 
 soc i am glad to hear you say so ion i see that you will not 
 refuse to acquaint me with them 
 ion certainly socrates and you really ought to hear how 
 exquisitely i render homer i think that the homeridae should give 
 me a golden crown 
 soc i shall take an opportunity of hearing your embellishments of 
 him at some other time but just now i should like to ask you a 
 question does your art extend to hesiod and archilochus or to 
 homer only 
 ion to homer only he is in himself quite enough 
 soc are there any things about which homer and hesiod agree 
 ion yes in my opinion there are a good many 
 soc and can you interpret better what homer says or what hesiod 
 says about these matters in which they agree 
 ion i can interpret them equally well socrates where they agree 
 soc but what about matters in which they do not agree for 
 example about divination of which both homer and hesiod have 
 something to say 
 ion very true 
 soc would you or a good prophet be a better interpreter of what 
 these two poets say about divination not only when they agree but 
 when they disagree 
 ion a prophet 
 soc and if you were a prophet would you be able to interpret 
 them when they disagree as well as when they agree 
 ion clearly 
 soc but how did you come to have this skill about homer only and 
 not about hesiod or the other poets does not homer speak of the 
 same themes which all other poets handle is not war his great 
 argument and does he not speak of human society and of 
 intercourse of men good and bad skilled and unskilled and of the 
 gods conversing with one another and with mankind and about what 
 happens in heaven and in the world below and the generations of 
 gods and heroes are not these the themes of which homer sings 
 ion very true socrates 
 soc and do not the other poets sing of the same 
 ion yes socrates but not in the same way as homer 
 soc what in a worse way 
 ion yes in a far worse 
 soc and homer in a better way 
 ion he is incomparably better 
 soc and yet surely my dear friend ion in a discussion about 
 arithmetic where many people are speaking and one speaks better 
 than the rest there is somebody who can judge which of them is the 
 good speaker 
 ion yes 
 soc and he who judges of the good will be the same as he who 
 judges of the bad speakers 
 ion the same 
 soc and he will be the arithmetician 
 ion yes 
 soc well and in discussions about the wholesomeness of food 
 when many persons are speaking and one speaks better than the rest 
 will he who recognizes the better speaker be a different person from 
 him who recognizes the worse or the same 
 ion clearly the same 
 soc and who is he and what is his name 
 ion the physician 
 soc and speaking generally in all discussions in which the subject 
 is the same and many men are speaking will not he who knows the 
 good know the bad speaker also for if he does not know the bad 
 neither will he know the good when the same topic is being 
 discussed 
 ion true 
 soc is not the same person skilful in both 
 ion yes 
 soc and you say that homer and the other poets such as hesiod 
 and archilochus speak of the same things although not in the same 
 way but the one speaks well and the other not so well 
 ion yes and i am right in saying so 
 soc and if you knew the good speaker you would also know the 
 inferior speakers to be inferior 
 ion that is true 
 soc then my dear friend can i be mistaken in saying that ion is 
 equally skilled in homer and in other poets since he himself 
 acknowledges that the same person will be a good judge of all those 
 who speak of the same things and that almost all poets do speak of 
 the same things 
 ion why then socrates do i lose attention and go to sleep and 
 have absolutely no ideas of the least value when any one speaks of 
 any other poet but when homer is mentioned i wake up at once and 
 am all attention and have plenty to say 
 soc the reason my friend is obvious no one can fail to see 
 that you speak of homer without any art or knowledge if you were 
 able to speak of him by rules of art you would have been able to 
 speak of all other poets for poetry is a whole 
 ion yes 
 soc and when any one acquires any other art as a whole the same 
 may be said of them would you like me to explain my meaning ion 
 ion yes indeed socrates i very much wish that you would for i 
 love to hear you wise men talk 
 soc o that we were wise ion and that you could truly call us 
 so but you rhapsodes and actors and the poets whose verses you 
 sing are wise whereas i am a common man who only speak the 
 truth for consider what a very commonplace and trivial thing is this 
 which i have said a thing which any man might say that when a man 
 has acquired a knowledge of a whole art the enquiry into good and 
 bad is one and the same let us consider this matter is not the art of 
 painting a whole 
 ion yes 
 soc and there are and have been many painters good and bad 
 ion yes 
 soc and did you ever know any one who was skilful in pointing out 
 the excellences and defects of polygnotus the son of aglaophon but 
 incapable of criticizing other painters and when the work of any 
 other painter was produced went to sleep and was at a loss and had 
 no ideas but when he had to give his opinion about polygnotus or 
 whoever the painter might be and about him only woke up and was 
 attentive and had plenty to say 
 ion no indeed i have never known such a person 
 soc or did you ever know of any one in sculpture who was skilful 
 in expounding the merits of daedalus the son of metion or of epeius 
 the son of panopeus or of theodorus the samian or of any 
 individual sculptor but when the works of sculptors in general were 
 produced was at a loss and went to sleep and had nothing to say 
 ion no indeed no more than the other 
 soc and if i am not mistaken you never met with any one among 
 or harp players or singers to the harp or rhapsodes who 
 was able to discourse of olympus or thamyras or orpheus or 
 phemius the rhapsode of ithaca but was at a loss when he came to 
 speak of ion of ephesus and had no notion of his merits or defects 
 ion i cannot deny what you say socrates nevertheless i am 
 conscious in my own self and the world agrees with me in thinking 
 that i do speak better and have more to say about homer than any 
 other man but i do not speak equally well about others tell me the 
 reason of this 
 soc i perceive ion and i will proceed to explain to you what i 
 imagine to be the reason of this the gift which you possess of 
 speaking excellently about homer is not an art but as i was just 
 saying an inspiration there is a divinity moving you like that 
 contained in the stone which euripides calls a magnet but which is 
 commonly known as the stone of heraclea this stone not only 
 attracts iron rings but also imparts to them a similar power of 
 attracting other rings and sometimes you may see a number of pieces 
 of iron and rings suspended from one another so as to form quite a 
 long chain and all of them derive their power of suspension from 
 the original stone in like manner the muse first of all inspires 
 men herself and from these inspired persons a chain of other 
 persons is suspended who take the inspiration for all good poets 
 epic as well as lyric compose their beautiful poems not by art but 
 because they are inspired and possessed and as the corybantian 
 revellers when they dance are not in their right mind so the lyric 
 poets are not in their right mind when they are composing their 
 beautiful strains but when falling under the power of music and metre 
 they are inspired and possessed like bacchic maidens who draw milk 
 and honey from the rivers when they are under the influence of 
 dionysus but not when they are in their right mind and the soul of 
 the lyric poet does the same as they themselves say for they tell us 
 that they bring songs from honeyed fountains culling them out of 
 the gardens and dells of the muses they like the bees winging their 
 way from flower to flower and this is true for the poet is a light 
 and winged and holy thing and there is no invention in him until he 
 has been inspired and is out of his senses and the mind is no 
 longer in him when he has not attained to this state he is powerless 
 and is unable to utter his oracles 
 many are the noble words in which poets speak concerning the 
 actions of men but like yourself when speaking about homer they 
 do not speak of them by any rules of art they are simply inspired to 
 utter that to which the muse impels them and that only and when 
 inspired one of them will make dithyrambs another hymns of praise 
 another choral strains another epic or iambic verses and he who is 
 good at one is not good any other kind of verse for not by art does 
 the poet by power divine had he learned by rules of art he 
 would have known how to speak not of one theme only but of all 
 and therefore god takes away the minds of poets and uses them as 
 his he also uses diviners and holy prophets in order that 
 we who hear them may know them to be speaking not of themselves 
 who utter these priceless words in a state of unconsciousness but 
 that god himself is the speaker and that through them he is 
 conversing with us and tynnichus the chalcidian affords a striking 
 instance of what i am saying he wrote nothing that any one would 
 care to remember but the famous paean which in every mouth 
 one of the finest poems ever written simply an invention of the 
 muses as he himself says for in this way the god would seem to 
 indicate to us and not allow us to doubt that these beautiful poems are 
 not human or the work of man but divine and the work of god and 
 that the poets are only the interpreters of the gods by whom they are 
 severally possessed was not this the lesson which the god intended 
 to teach when by the mouth of the worst of poets he sang the best of 
 songs 
 am i not right ion 
 ion yes indeed socrates i feel that you are for your words 
 touch my soul and i am persuaded that good poets by a divine 
 inspiration interpret the things of the gods to us 
 soc and you rhapsodists are the interpreters of the poets 
 ion there again you are right 
 soc then you are the interpreters of interpreters 
 ion precisely 
 soc i wish you would frankly tell me ion what i am going to ask 
 of you when you produce the greatest effect upon the audience in 
 the recitation of some striking passage such as the apparition of 
 odysseus leaping forth on the floor recognized by the suitors and 
 casting his arrows at his feet or the description of achilles rushing 
 at hector or the sorrows of andromache hecuba or priam are 
 you in your right mind are you not carried out of yourself and does 
 not your soul in an ecstasy seem to be among the persons or places 
 of which you are speaking whether they are in ithaca or in troy or 
 whatever may be the scene of the poem 
 ion that proof strikes home to me socrates for i must frankly 
 confess that at the tale of pity my eyes are filled with tears and 
 when i speak of horrors my hair stands on end and my heart throbs 
 soc well ion and what are we to say of a man who at a sacrifice 
 or festival when he is dressed in holiday attire and has golden 
 crowns upon his head of which nobody has robbed him appears 
 sweeping or in the presence of more than twenty 
 thousand friendly faces when there is no one despoiling or wronging 
 him is he in his right mind or is he not 
 ion no indeed socrates i must say that strictly speaking he 
 is not in his right mind 
 soc and are you aware that you produce similar effects on most 
 spectators 
 ion only too well for i look down upon them from the stage and 
 behold the various emotions of pity wonder sternness stamped 
 upon their countenances when i am speaking and i am obliged to 
 give my very best attention to them for if i make them cry i myself 
 shall laugh and if i make them laugh i myself shall cry when the time 
 of payment arrives 
 soc do you know that the spectator is the last of the rings 
 which as i am saying receive the power of the original magnet from 
 one another the rhapsode like yourself and the actor are 
 intermediate links and the poet himself is the first of them through 
 all these the god sways the souls of men in any direction which he 
 pleases and makes one man hang down from another thus there is a 
 vast chain of dancers and masters and undermasters of choruses 
 who are suspended as if from the stone at the side of the rings 
 which hang down from the muse and every poet has some muse 
 from whom he is suspended and by whom he is said to be 
 possessed which is nearly the same thing for he is taken hold of 
 and from these first rings which are the poets depend others some 
 deriving their inspiration from orpheus others from musaeus but the 
 greater number are possessed and held by homer of whom ion 
 you are one and are possessed by homer and when any one repeats 
 the words of another poet you go to sleep and know not what to say 
 but when any one recites a strain of homer you wake up in a moment 
 and your soul leaps within you have plenty to say for not by 
 art or knowledge about homer do you say what you say but by 
 divine inspiration and by possession 
 just as the corybantian revellers too have a quick perception of 
 that strain only which is appropriated to the god by whom they are 
 possessed and have plenty of dances and words for that but take no 
 heed of any other and you ion when the name of homer is 
 mentioned have plenty to say and have nothing to say of others you 
 ask why is this the answer is that you praise homer not by art 
 but by divine inspiration 
 ion that is good socrates and yet i doubt whether you will ever 
 have eloquence enough to persuade me that i praise homer only 
 when i am mad and possessed and if you could hear me speak of 
 him i am sure you would never think this to be the case 
 soc i should like very much to hear you but not until you have 
 answered a question which i have to ask on what part of homer do 
 you speak well not surely about every part 
 ion there is no part socrates about which i do not speak well 
 of that i can assure you 
 soc surely not about things in homer of which you have no 
 knowledge 
 ion and what is there in homer of which i have no knowledge 
 soc why does not homer speak in many passages about arts for 
 example about driving if i can only remember the lines i will repeat 
 them 
 ion i remember and will repeat them 
 soc tell me then what nestor says to antilochus his son where he 
 bids him be careful of the turn at the in honour of 
 patroclus 
 ion he says bend gently in the polished chariot to the left of them 
 and urge the horse on the right hand with whip and voice and slacken 
 the rein and when you are at the goal let the left horse draw near yet 
 so that the nave of the wheel may not even seem to 
 touch the extremity and avoid catching the stone 
 soc enough now ion will the charioteer or the physician be the 
 better judge of the propriety of these lines 
 ion the charioteer clearly 
 soc and will the reason be that this is his art or will there be 
 any other reason 
 ion no that will be the reason 
 soc and every art is appointed by god to have knowledge of a 
 certain work for that which we know by the art of the pilot we do not 
 know by the art of medicine 
 ion certainly not 
 soc nor do we know by the art of the carpenter that which we know 
 by the art of medicine 
 ion certainly not 
 soc and this is true of all the arts that which we know with 
 one art we do not know with the other but let me ask a prior 
 question you admit that there are differences of arts 
 ion yes 
 soc you would argue as i should that when one art is of one 
 kind of knowledge and another of another they are different 
 ion yes 
 soc yes surely for if the subject of knowledge were the same 
 there would be no meaning in saying that the arts were different 
 if they both gave the same knowledge for example i know that here 
 are five fingers and you know the same and if i were to ask 
 whether i and you became acquainted with this fact by the help of 
 the same art of arithmetic you would acknowledge that we did 
 ion yes 
 soc tell me then what i was intending to ask you whether this 
 holds universally must the same art have the same subject of 
 knowledge and different arts other subjects of knowledge 
 ion that is my opinion socrates 
 soc then he who has no knowledge of a particular art will have no 
 right judgment of the sayings and doings of that art 
 ion very true 
 soc then which will be a better judge of the lines which you were 
 reciting from homer you or the charioteer 
 ion the charioteer 
 soc why yes because you are a rhapsode and not a charioteer 
 ion yes 
 soc and the art of the rhapsode is different from that of the 
 charioteer 
 ion yes 
 soc and if a different knowledge then a knowledge of different 
 matters 
 ion true 
 soc you know the passage in which hecamede the concubine of 
 nestor is described as giving to the wounded machaon a posset as 
 he says made with pramnian wine and she grated cheese of 
 milk with a grater of bronze and at his side placed an onion which 
 gives a relish to drink 
 now would you say that the art of the rhapsode or the art of 
 medicine was better able to judge of the propriety of these lines 
 ion the art of medicine 
 soc and when homer says 
 and she descended into the deep like a leaden plummet which set in 
 the horn of ox that ranges in the fields rushes along carrying 
 death among the ravenous fishes 
 will the art of the fisherman or of the rhapsode be better able to 
 judge whether these lines are rightly expressed or not 
 ion clearly socrates the art of the fisherman 
 soc come now suppose that you were to say to me since you 
 socrates are able to assign different passages in homer to their 
 corresponding arts i wish that you would tell me what are the 
 passages of which the excellence ought to be judged by the prophet 
 and prophetic art and you will see how readily and truly i shall 
 answer you for there are many such passages particularly in the 
 odyssey as for example the passage in which theoclymenus the 
 prophet of the house of melampus says to the suitors 
 wretched men what is happening to you your heads and your faces 
 and your limbs underneath are shrouded in night and the voice of 
 lamentation bursts forth and your cheeks are wet with tears and 
 the vestibule is full and the court is full of ghosts descending 
 into the darkness of erebus and the sun has perished out of heaven 
 and an evil mist is spread abroad 
 and there are many such passages in the iliad also as for example 
 in the description of the battle near the rampart where he says 
 as they were eager to pass the ditch there came to them an omen 
 a soaring eagle holding back the people on the left bore a huge 
 bloody dragon in his talons still living and panting nor had he 
 yet resigned the strife for he bent back and smote the bird which 
 carried him on the breast by the neck and he in pain let him fall 
 from him to the ground into the midst of the multitude and the eagle 
 with a cry was borne afar on the wings of the wind 
 these are the sort of things which i should say that the prophet 
 ought to consider and determine 
 ion and you are quite right socrates in saying so 
 soc yes ion and you are right also and as i have selected from 
 the iliad and odyssey for you passages which describe the office of 
 the prophet and the physician and the fisherman do you who know 
 homer so much better than i do ion select for me passages which 
 relate to the rhapsode and the art and which the 
 rhapsode ought to examine and judge of better than other men 
 ion all passages i should say socrates 
 soc not all ion surely have you already forgotten what you 
 were saying a rhapsode ought to have a better memory 
 ion why what am i forgetting 
 soc do you not remember that you declared the art of the rhapsode 
 to be different from the art of the charioteer 
 ion yes i remember 
 soc and you admitted that being different they would have different 
 subjects of knowledge 
 ion yes 
 soc then upon your own showing the rhapsode and the art of the 
 rhapsode will not know everything 
 ion i should exclude certain things socrates 
 soc you mean to say that you would exclude pretty much the 
 subjects of the other arts as he does not know all of them which of 
 them will he know 
 ion he will know what a man and what a woman ought to say and 
 what a freeman and what a slave ought to say and what a ruler and 
 what a subject 
 soc do you mean that a rhapsode will know better than the pilot 
 what the ruler of a vessel ought to say 
 ion no the pilot will know best 
 soc or will the rhapsode know better than the physician what the 
 ruler of a sick man ought to say 
 ion he will not 
 soc but he will know what a slave ought to say 
 ion yes 
 soc suppose the slave to be a cowherd the rhapsode will know 
 better than the cowherd what he ought to say in order to soothe the 
 infuriated cows 
 ion no he will not 
 soc but he will know what a ought to say about the 
 working of wool 
 ion no 
 soc at any rate he will know what a general ought to say when 
 exhorting his soldiers 
 ion yes that is the sort of thing which the rhapsode will be 
 sure to know 
 soc well but is the art of the rhapsode the art of the general 
 ion i am sure that i should know what a general ought to say 
 soc why yes ion because you may possibly have a knowledge of 
 the art of the general as well as of the rhapsode and you may also 
 have a knowledge of horsemanship as well as of the lyre and then 
 you would know when horses were well or ill managed but suppose 
 i were to ask you by the help of which art ion do you know 
 whether horses are well managed by your skill as a horseman or as a 
 performer on the lyre what would you answer 
 ion i should reply by my skill as a horseman 
 soc and if you judged of performers on the lyre you would admit 
 that you judged of them as a performer on the lyre and not as a 
 horseman 
 ion yes 
 soc and in judging of the art do you judge of it as a 
 general or a rhapsode 
 ion to me there appears to be no difference between them 
 soc what do you mean do you mean to say that the art of the 
 rhapsode and of the general is the same 
 ion yes one and the same 
 soc then he who is a good rhapsode is also a good general 
 ion certainly socrates 
 soc and he who is a good general is also a good rhapsode 
 ion no i do not say that 
 soc but you do say that he who is a good rhapsode is also a good 
 general 
 ion certainly 
 soc and you are the best of hellenic rhapsodes 
 ion far the best socrates 
 soc and are you the best general ion 
 ion to be sure socrates and homer was my master 
 soc but then ion what in the name of goodness can be the reason 
 why you who are the best of generals as well as the best of 
 rhapsodes in all hellas go about as a rhapsode when you might be a 
 general 
 do you think that the hellenes want a rhapsode with his golden 
 crown and do not want a general 
 ion why socrates the reason is that my countrymen the 
 ephesians are the servants and soldiers of athens and do not need 
 a general and you and sparta are not likely to have me for you think 
 that you have enough generals of your own 
 soc my good ion did you never hear of apollodorus of cyzicus 
 ion who may he be 
 soc one who though a foreigner has often been chosen their 
 general by the athenians and there is phanosthenes of andros and 
 heraclides of clazomenae whom they have also appointed to the 
 command of their armies and to other offices although aliens after 
 they had shown their merit and will they not choose ion the 
 ephesian to be their general and honour him if he prove himself 
 worthy were not the ephesians originally athenians and ephesus is 
 no mean city 
 but indeed ion if you are correct in saying that by art and 
 knowledge you are able to praise homer you do not deal fairly with 
 me and after all your professions of knowing many glorious things 
 about homer and promises that you would exhibit them you are 
 only a deceiver and so far from exhibiting the art of which you are a 
 master will not even after my repeated entreaties explain to me the 
 nature of it you have literally as many forms as proteus and now 
 you go all manner of ways twisting and turning and like proteus 
 become all manner of people at once and at last slip away from me in 
 the disguise of a general in order that you may escape exhibiting your 
 homeric lore and if you have art then as i was saying in 
 falsifying your promise that you would exhibit homer you are not 
 dealing fairly with me but if as i believe you have no art but 
 speak all these beautiful words about homer unconsciously under his 
 inspiring influence then i acquit you of dishonesty and shall only 
 say that you are inspired which do you prefer to be thought 
 dishonest or inspired 
 ion there is a great difference socrates between the two 
 alternatives and inspiration is by far the nobler 
 soc then ion i shall assume the nobler alternative and attribute 
 to you in your praises of homer inspiration and not art 
 the end

 ion 
 by plato 
 translated by benjamin jowett 
 
 persons of the dialogue socrates ion 
 socrates welcome ion are you from your native city of ephesus 
 ion no socrates but from epidaurus where i attended the festival 
 of asclepius 
 soc and do the epidaurians have contests of rhapsodes at the 
 festival 
 ion o yes and of all sorts of musical performers 
 soc and were you one of the competitors and did you succeed 
 ion i obtained the first prize of all socrates 
 soc well done and i hope that you will do the same for us at the 
 panathenaea 
 ion and i will please heaven 
 soc i often envy the profession of a rhapsode 
 ion for you have always to wear fine clothes and to look as beautiful 
 as you can is a part of your art then again you are obliged to be 
 continually in the company of many good poets and especially of 
 homer who is the best and most divine of them and to understand 
 him and not merely learn his words by rote is a thing greatly to be 
 envied and no man can be a rhapsode who does not understand the 
 meaning of the poet for the rhapsode ought to interpret the mind of 
 the poet to his hearers but how can he interpret him well unless he 
 knows what he means all this is greatly to be envied 
 ion very true socrates interpretation has certainly been the most 
 laborious part of my art and i believe myself able to speak about 
 homer better than any man and that neither metrodorus of 
 lampsacus nor stesimbrotus of thasos nor glaucon nor any one 
 else who ever was had as good ideas about homer as i have or as 
 many 
 soc i am glad to hear you say so ion i see that you will not 
 refuse to acquaint me with them 
 ion certainly socrates and you really ought to hear how 
 exquisitely i render homer i think that the homeridae should give 
 me a golden crown 
 soc i shall take an opportunity of hearing your embellishments of 
 him at some other time but just now i should like to ask you a 
 question does your art extend to hesiod and archilochus or to 
 homer only 
 ion to homer only he is in himself quite enough 
 soc are there any things about which homer and hesiod agree 
 ion yes in my opinion there are a good many 
 soc and can you interpret better what homer says or what hesiod 
 says about these matters in which they agree 
 ion i can interpret them equally well socrates where they agree 
 soc but what about matters in which they do not agree for 
 example about divination of which both homer and hesiod have 
 something to say 
 ion very true 
 soc would you or a good prophet be a better interpreter of what 
 these two poets say about divination not only when they agree but 
 when they disagree 
 ion a prophet 
 soc and if you were a prophet would you be able to interpret 
 them when they disagree as well as when they agree 
 ion clearly 
 soc but how did you come to have this skill about homer only and 
 not about hesiod or the other poets does not homer speak of the 
 same themes which all other poets handle is not war his great 
 argument and does he not speak of human society and of 
 intercourse of men good and bad skilled and unskilled and of the 
 gods conversing with one another and with mankind and about what 
 happens in heaven and in the world below and the generations of 
 gods and heroes are not these the themes of which homer sings 
 ion very true socrates 
 soc and do not the other poets sing of the same 
 ion yes socrates but not in the same way as homer 
 soc what in a worse way 
 ion yes in a far worse 
 soc and homer in a better way 
 ion he is incomparably better 
 soc and yet surely my dear friend ion in a discussion about 
 arithmetic where many people are speaking and one speaks better 
 than the rest there is somebody who can judge which of them is the 
 good speaker 
 ion yes 
 soc and he who judges of the good will be the same as he who 
 judges of the bad speakers 
 ion the same 
 soc and he will be the arithmetician 
 ion yes 
 soc well and in discussions about the wholesomeness of food 
 when many persons are speaking and one speaks better than the rest 
 will he who recognizes the better speaker be a different person from 
 him who recognizes the worse or the same 
 ion clearly the same 
 soc and who is he and what is his name 
 ion the physician 
 soc and speaking generally in all discussions in which the subject 
 is the same and many men are speaking will not he who knows the 
 good know the bad speaker also for if he does not know the bad 
 neither will he know the good when the same topic is being 
 discussed 
 ion true 
 soc is not the same person skilful in both 
 ion yes 
 soc and you say that homer and the other poets such as hesiod 
 and archilochus speak of the same things although not in the same 
 way but the one speaks well and the other not so well 
 ion yes and i am right in saying so 
 soc and if you knew the good speaker you would also know the 
 inferior speakers to be inferior 
 ion that is true 
 soc then my dear friend can i be mistaken in saying that ion is 
 equally skilled in homer and in other poets since he himself 
 acknowledges that the same person will be a good judge of all those 
 who speak of the same things and that almost all poets do speak of 
 the same things 
 ion why then socrates do i lose attention and go to sleep and 
 have absolutely no ideas of the least value when any one speaks of 
 any other poet but when homer is mentioned i wake up at once and 
 am all attention and have plenty to say 
 soc the reason my friend is obvious no one can fail to see 
 that you speak of homer without any art or knowledge if you were 
 able to speak of him by rules of art you would have been able to 
 speak of all other poets for poetry is a whole 
 ion yes 
 soc and when any one acquires any other art as a whole the same 
 may be said of them would you like me to explain my meaning ion 
 ion yes indeed socrates i very much wish that you would for i 
 love to hear you wise men talk 
 soc o that we were wise ion and that you could truly call us 
 so but you rhapsodes and actors and the poets whose verses you 
 sing are wise whereas i am a common man who only speak the 
 truth for consider what a very commonplace and trivial thing is this 
 which i have said a thing which any man might say that when a man 
 has acquired a knowledge of a whole art the enquiry into good and 
 bad is one and the same let us consider this matter is not the art of 
 painting a whole 
 ion yes 
 soc and there are and have been many painters good and bad 
 ion yes 
 soc and did you ever know any one who was skilful in pointing out 
 the excellences and defects of polygnotus the son of aglaophon but 
 incapable of criticizing other painters and when the work of any 
 other painter was produced went to sleep and was at a loss and had 
 no ideas but when he had to give his opinion about polygnotus or 
 whoever the painter might be and about him only woke up and was 
 attentive and had plenty to say 
 ion no indeed i have never known such a person 
 soc or did you ever know of any one in sculpture who was skilful 
 in expounding the merits of daedalus the son of metion or of epeius 
 the son of panopeus or of theodorus the samian or of any 
 individual sculptor but when the works of sculptors in general were 
 produced was at a loss and went to sleep and had nothing to say 
 ion no indeed no more than the other 
 soc and if i am not mistaken you never met with any one among 
 or harp players or singers to the harp or rhapsodes who 
 was able to discourse of olympus or thamyras or orpheus or 
 phemius the rhapsode of ithaca but was at a loss when he came to 
 speak of ion of ephesus and had no notion of his merits or defects 
 ion i cannot deny what you say socrates nevertheless i am 
 conscious in my own self and the world agrees with me in thinking 
 that i do speak better and have more to say about homer than any 
 other man but i do not speak equally well about others tell me the 
 reason of this 
 soc i perceive ion and i will proceed to explain to you what i 
 imagine to be the reason of this the gift which you possess of 
 speaking excellently about homer is not an art but as i was just 
 saying an inspiration there is a divinity moving you like that 
 contained in the stone which euripides calls a magnet but which is 
 commonly known as the stone of heraclea this stone not only 
 attracts iron rings but also imparts to them a similar power of 
 attracting other rings and sometimes you may see a number of pieces 
 of iron and rings suspended from one another so as to form quite a 
 long chain and all of them derive their power of suspension from 
 the original stone in like manner the muse first of all inspires 
 men herself and from these inspired persons a chain of other 
 persons is suspended who take the inspiration for all good poets 
 epic as well as lyric compose their beautiful poems not by art but 
 because they are inspired and possessed and as the corybantian 
 revellers when they dance are not in their right mind so the lyric 
 poets are not in their right mind when they are composing their 
 beautiful strains but when falling under the power of music and metre 
 they are inspired and possessed like bacchic maidens who draw milk 
 and honey from the rivers when they are under the influence of 
 dionysus but not when they are in their right mind and the soul of 
 the lyric poet does the same as they themselves say for they tell us 
 that they bring songs from honeyed fountains culling them out of 
 the gardens and dells of the muses they like the bees winging their 
 way from flower to flower and this is true for the poet is a light 
 and winged and holy thing and there is no invention in him until he 
 has been inspired and is out of his senses and the mind is no 
 longer in him when he has not attained to this state he is powerless 
 and is unable to utter his oracles 
 many are the noble words in which poets speak concerning the 
 actions of men but like yourself when speaking about homer they 
 do not speak of them by any rules of art they are simply inspired to 
 utter that to which the muse impels them and that only and when 
 inspired one of them will make dithyrambs another hymns of praise 
 another choral strains another epic or iambic verses and he who is 
 good at one is not good any other kind of verse for not by art does 
 the poet by power divine had he learned by rules of art he 
 would have known how to speak not of one theme only but of all 
 and therefore god takes away the minds of poets and uses them as 
 his he also uses diviners and holy prophets in order that 
 we who hear them may know them to be speaking not of themselves 
 who utter these priceless words in a state of unconsciousness but 
 that god himself is the speaker and that through them he is 
 conversing with us and tynnichus the chalcidian affords a striking 
 instance of what i am saying he wrote nothing that any one would 
 care to remember but the famous paean which in every mouth 
 one of the finest poems ever written simply an invention of the 
 muses as he himself says for in this way the god would seem to 
 indicate to us and not allow us to doubt that these beautiful poems are 
 not human or the work of man but divine and the work of god and 
 that the poets are only the interpreters of the gods by whom they are 
 severally possessed was not this the lesson which the god intended 
 to teach when by the mouth of the worst of poets he sang the best of 
 songs 
 am i not right ion 
 ion yes indeed socrates i feel that you are for your words 
 touch my soul and i am persuaded that good poets by a divine 
 inspiration interpret the things of the gods to us 
 soc and you rhapsodists are the interpreters of the poets 
 ion there again you are right 
 soc then you are the interpreters of interpreters 
 ion precisely 
 soc i wish you would frankly tell me ion what i am going to ask 
 of you when you produce the greatest effect upon the audience in 
 the recitation of some striking passage such as the apparition of 
 odysseus leaping forth on the floor recognized by the suitors and 
 casting his arrows at his feet or the description of achilles rushing 
 at hector or the sorrows of andromache hecuba or priam are 
 you in your right mind are you not carried out of yourself and does 
 not your soul in an ecstasy seem to be among the persons or places 
 of which you are speaking whether they are in ithaca or in troy or 
 whatever may be the scene of the poem 
 ion that proof strikes home to me socrates for i must frankly 
 confess that at the tale of pity my eyes are filled with tears and 
 when i speak of horrors my hair stands on end and my heart throbs 
 soc well ion and what are we to say of a man who at a sacrifice 
 or festival when he is dressed in holiday attire and has golden 
 crowns upon his head of which nobody has robbed him appears 
 sweeping or in the presence of more than twenty 
 thousand friendly faces when there is no one despoiling or wronging 
 him is he in his right mind or is he not 
 ion no indeed socrates i must say that strictly speaking he 
 is not in his right mind 
 soc and are you aware that you produce similar effects on most 
 spectators 
 ion only too well for i look down upon them from the stage and 
 behold the various emotions of pity wonder sternness stamped 
 upon their countenances when i am speaking and i am obliged to 
 give my very best attention to them for if i make them cry i myself 
 shall laugh and if i make them laugh i myself shall cry when the time 
 of payment arrives 
 soc do you know that the spectator is the last of the rings 
 which as i am saying receive the power of the original magnet from 
 one another the rhapsode like yourself and the actor are 
 intermediate links and the poet himself is the first of them through 
 all these the god sways the souls of men in any direction which he 
 pleases and makes one man hang down from another thus there is a 
 vast chain of dancers and masters and undermasters of choruses 
 who are suspended as if from the stone at the side of the rings 
 which hang down from the muse and every poet has some muse 
 from whom he is suspended and by whom he is said to be 
 possessed which is nearly the same thing for he is taken hold of 
 and from these first rings which are the poets depend others some 
 deriving their inspiration from orpheus others from musaeus but the 
 greater number are possessed and held by homer of whom ion 
 you are one and are possessed by homer and when any one repeats 
 the words of another poet you go to sleep and know not what to say 
 but when any one recites a strain of homer you wake up in a moment 
 and your soul leaps within you have plenty to say for not by 
 art or knowledge about homer do you say what you say but by 
 divine inspiration and by possession 
 just as the corybantian revellers too have a quick perception of 
 that strain only which is appropriated to the god by whom they are 
 possessed and have plenty of dances and words for that but take no 
 heed of any other and you ion when the name of homer is 
 mentioned have plenty to say and have nothing to say of others you 
 ask why is this the answer is that you praise homer not by art 
 but by divine inspiration 
 ion that is good socrates and yet i doubt whether you will ever 
 have eloquence enough to persuade me that i praise homer only 
 when i am mad and possessed and if you could hear me speak of 
 him i am sure you would never think this to be the case 
 soc i should like very much to hear you but not until you have 
 answered a question which i have to ask on what part of homer do 
 you speak well not surely about every part 
 ion there is no part socrates about which i do not speak well 
 of that i can assure you 
 soc surely not about things in homer of which you have no 
 knowledge 
 ion and what is there in homer of which i have no knowledge 
 soc why does not homer speak in many passages about arts for 
 example about driving if i can only remember the lines i will repeat 
 them 
 ion i remember and will repeat them 
 soc tell me then what nestor says to antilochus his son where he 
 bids him be careful of the turn at the in honour of 
 patroclus 
 ion he says bend gently in the polished chariot to the left of them 
 and urge the horse on the right hand with whip and voice and slacken 
 the rein and when you are at the goal let the left horse draw near yet 
 so that the nave of the wheel may not even seem to 
 touch the extremity and avoid catching the stone 
 soc enough now ion will the charioteer or the physician be the 
 better judge of the propriety of these lines 
 ion the charioteer clearly 
 soc and will the reason be that this is his art or will there be 
 any other reason 
 ion no that will be the reason 
 soc and every art is appointed by god to have knowledge of a 
 certain work for that which we know by the art of the pilot we do not 
 know by the art of medicine 
 ion certainly not 
 soc nor do we know by the art of the carpenter that which we know 
 by the art of medicine 
 ion certainly not 
 soc and this is true of all the arts that which we know with 
 one art we do not know with the other but let me ask a prior 
 question you admit that there are differences of arts 
 ion yes 
 soc you would argue as i should that when one art is of one 
 kind of knowledge and another of another they are different 
 ion yes 
 soc yes surely for if the subject of knowledge were the same 
 there would be no meaning in saying that the arts were different 
 if they both gave the same knowledge for example i know that here 
 are five fingers and you know the same and if i were to ask 
 whether i and you became acquainted with this fact by the help of 
 the same art of arithmetic you would acknowledge that we did 
 ion yes 
 soc tell me then what i was intending to ask you whether this 
 holds universally must the same art have the same subject of 
 knowledge and different arts other subjects of knowledge 
 ion that is my opinion socrates 
 soc then he who has no knowledge of a particular art will have no 
 right judgment of the sayings and doings of that art 
 ion very true 
 soc then which will be a better judge of the lines which you were 
 reciting from homer you or the charioteer 
 ion the charioteer 
 soc why yes because you are a rhapsode and not a charioteer 
 ion yes 
 soc and the art of the rhapsode is different from that of the 
 charioteer 
 ion yes 
 soc and if a different knowledge then a knowledge of different 
 matters 
 ion true 
 soc you know the passage in which hecamede the concubine of 
 nestor is described as giving to the wounded machaon a posset as 
 he says made with pramnian wine and she grated cheese of 
 milk with a grater of bronze and at his side placed an onion which 
 gives a relish to drink 
 now would you say that the art of the rhapsode or the art of 
 medicine was better able to judge of the propriety of these lines 
 ion the art of medicine 
 soc and when homer says 
 and she descended into the deep like a leaden plummet which set in 
 the horn of ox that ranges in the fields rushes along carrying 
 death among the ravenous fishes 
 will the art of the fisherman or of the rhapsode be better able to 
 judge whether these lines are rightly expressed or not 
 ion clearly socrates the art of the fisherman 
 soc come now suppose that you were to say to me since you 
 socrates are able to assign different passages in homer to their 
 corresponding arts i wish that you would tell me what are the 
 passages of which the excellence ought to be judged by the prophet 
 and prophetic art and you will see how readily and truly i shall 
 answer you for there are many such passages particularly in the 
 odyssey as for example the passage in which theoclymenus the 
 prophet of the house of melampus says to the suitors 
 wretched men what is happening to you your heads and your faces 
 and your limbs underneath are shrouded in night and the voice of 
 lamentation bursts forth and your cheeks are wet with tears and 
 the vestibule is full and the court is full of ghosts descending 
 into the darkness of erebus and the sun has perished out of heaven 
 and an evil mist is spread abroad 
 and there are many such passages in the iliad also as for example 
 in the description of the battle near the rampart where he says 
 as they were eager to pass the ditch there came to them an omen 
 a soaring eagle holding back the people on the left bore a huge 
 bloody dragon in his talons still living and panting nor had he 
 yet resigned the strife for he bent back and smote the bird which 
 carried him on the breast by the neck and he in pain let him fall 
 from him to the ground into the midst of the multitude and the eagle 
 with a cry was borne afar on the wings of the wind 
 these are the sort of things which i should say that the prophet 
 ought to consider and determine 
 ion and you are quite right socrates in saying so 
 soc yes ion and you are right also and as i have selected from 
 the iliad and odyssey for you passages which describe the office of 
 the prophet and the physician and the fisherman do you who know 
 homer so much better than i do ion select for me passages which 
 relate to the rhapsode and the art and which the 
 rhapsode ought to examine and judge of better than other men 
 ion all passages i should say socrates 
 soc not all ion surely have you already forgotten what you 
 were saying a rhapsode ought to have a better memory 
 ion why what am i forgetting 
 soc do you not remember that you declared the art of the rhapsode 
 to be different from the art of the charioteer 
 ion yes i remember 
 soc and you admitted that being different they would have different 
 subjects of knowledge 
 ion yes 
 soc then upon your own showing the rhapsode and the art of the 
 rhapsode will not know everything 
 ion i should exclude certain things socrates 
 soc you mean to say that you would exclude pretty much the 
 subjects of the other arts as he does not know all of them which of 
 them will he know 
 ion he will know what a man and what a woman ought to say and 
 what a freeman and what a slave ought to say and what a ruler and 
 what a subject 
 soc do you mean that a rhapsode will know better than the pilot 
 what the ruler of a vessel ought to say 
 ion no the pilot will know best 
 soc or will the rhapsode know better than the physician what the 
 ruler of a sick man ought to say 
 ion he will not 
 soc but he will know what a slave ought to say 
 ion yes 
 soc suppose the slave to be a cowherd the rhapsode will know 
 better than the cowherd what he ought to say in order to soothe the 
 infuriated cows 
 ion no he will not 
 soc but he will know what a ought to say about the 
 working of wool 
 ion no 
 soc at any rate he will know what a general ought to say when 
 exhorting his soldiers 
 ion yes that is the sort of thing which the rhapsode will be 
 sure to know 
 soc well but is the art of the rhapsode the art of the general 
 ion i am sure that i should know what a general ought to say 
 soc why yes ion because you may possibly have a knowledge of 
 the art of the general as well as of the rhapsode and you may also 
 have a knowledge of horsemanship as well as of the lyre and then 
 you would know when horses were well or ill managed but suppose 
 i were to ask you by the help of which art ion do you know 
 whether horses are well managed by your skill as a horseman or as a 
 performer on the lyre what would you answer 
 ion i should reply by my skill as a horseman 
 soc and if you judged of performers on the lyre you would admit 
 that you judged of them as a performer on the lyre and not as a 
 horseman 
 ion yes 
 soc and in judging of the art do you judge of it as a 
 general or a rhapsode 
 ion to me there appears to be no difference between them 
 soc what do you mean do you mean to say that the art of the 
 rhapsode and of the general is the same 
 ion yes one and the same 
 soc then he who is a good rhapsode is also a good general 
 ion certainly socrates 
 soc and he who is a good general is also a good rhapsode 
 ion no i do not say that 
 soc but you do say that he who is a good rhapsode is also a good 
 general 
 ion certainly 
 soc and you are the best of hellenic rhapsodes 
 ion far the best socrates 
 soc and are you the best general ion 
 ion to be sure socrates and homer was my master 
 soc but then ion what in the name of goodness can be the reason 
 why you who are the best of generals as well as the best of 
 rhapsodes in all hellas go about as a rhapsode when you might be a 
 general 
 do you think that the hellenes want a rhapsode with his golden 
 crown and do not want a general 
 ion why socrates the reason is that my countrymen the 
 ephesians are the servants and soldiers of athens and do not need 
 a general and you and sparta are not likely to have me for you think 
 that you have enough generals of your own 
 soc my good ion did you never hear of apollodorus of cyzicus 
 ion who may he be 
 soc one who though a foreigner has often been chosen their 
 general by the athenians and there is phanosthenes of andros and 
 heraclides of clazomenae whom they have also appointed to the 
 command of their armies and to other offices although aliens after 
 they had shown their merit and will they not choose ion the 
 ephesian to be their general and honour him if he prove himself 
 worthy were not the ephesians originally athenians and ephesus is 
 no mean city 
 but indeed ion if you are correct in saying that by art and 
 knowledge you are able to praise homer you do not deal fairly with 
 me and after all your professions of knowing many glorious things 
 about homer and promises that you would exhibit them you are 
 only a deceiver and so far from exhibiting the art of which you are a 
 master will not even after my repeated entreaties explain to me the 
 nature of it you have literally as many forms as proteus and now 
 you go all manner of ways twisting and turning and like proteus 
 become all manner of people at once and at last slip away from me in 
 the disguise of a general in order that you may escape exhibiting your 
 homeric lore and if you have art then as i was saying in 
 falsifying your promise that you would exhibit homer you are not 
 dealing fairly with me but if as i believe you have no art but 
 speak all these beautiful words about homer unconsciously under his 
 inspiring influence then i acquit you of dishonesty and shall only 
 say that you are inspired which do you prefer to be thought 
 dishonest or inspired 
 ion there is a great difference socrates between the two 
 alternatives and inspiration is by far the nobler 
 soc then ion i shall assume the nobler alternative and attribute 
 to you in your praises of homer inspiration and not art 
 the end

 revenge is a kind of wild justice which the more nature runs to the more ought law to weed it out for as for the first wrong it doth but offend the law but the revenge of that wrong putteth the law out of office certainly in taking revenge a man is but even with his enemy but in passing it over he is superior for it is a part to pardon and solomon i am sure saith it is the glory of a man to pass by an offence that which is past is gone and irrevocable and wise men have enough to do with things present and to come therefore they do but trifle with themselves that labour in past matters there is no man doth a wrong for the sake but thereby to purchase himself profit or pleasure or honour or the like therefore why should i be angry with a man for loving himself better than me 
 and if any man should do wrong merely out of ill nature why yet it is but like 
 the thorn or briar which prick and scratch because they can do no other the most tolerable sort of revenge is for those wrongs which there is no law to remedy but then let a man take heed the revenge be such as there is no law to punish else a enemy is still before hand and it is two for one some when they take revenge are desirous the party should know whence it cometh this is the more generous for the delight seemeth to be not so much in doing the hurt as in making the party repent but base and crafty cowards are like the arrow that flieth in the dark cosmus duke of florence had a desperate saying against perfidious or neglecting friends as if those wrongs were unpardonable you shall read saith he mat we are commanded to forgive our enemies but you never read that we are commanded to forgive our friends but yet the spirit of job was in a better tune shall we saith he take good at hands and not be content to take evil also and so of friends in a proportion this is certain that a man that studieth revenge keeps his own wounds green which otherwise would heal and do well public revenges are for the most part fortunate as that for the death of caesar for the death of pertinax for the death of henry the third of france and many more but in private revenges it is not so nay rather vindictive persons live the life of witches who as they are mischievous so end they unfortunate

 book just man 
 chapter iii 
 
 a hard bishopric for a good bishop 
 the bishop did not omit his pastoral visits because he had converted his carriage into alms 
 the diocese of d is a fatiguing one there are very few plains and a great many mountains hardly any roads as we have just seen curacies vicarships and two hundred and auxiliary chapels 
 to visit all these is quite a task 
 the bishop managed to do it 
 he went on foot when it was in the neighborhood in a tilted when it was on the plain and on a donkey in the mountains 
 the two old women accompanied him when the trip was too hard for them he went alone 
 one day he arrived at senez which is an ancient episcopal city he was mounted on an ass 
 his purse which was very dry at that moment did not permit him any other equipage 
 the mayor of the town came to receive him at the gate of the town and watched him dismount from his ass with scandalized eyes 
 some of the citizens were laughing around him 
 monsieur the mayor said the bishop and messieurs citizens i perceive that i shock you 
 you think it very arrogant in a poor priest to ride an animal which was used by jesus christ 
 i have done so from necessity i assure you and not from vanity 
 in the course of these trips he was kind and indulgent and talked rather than preached 
 he never went far in search of his arguments and his examples 
 he quoted to the inhabitants of one district the example of a neighboring district 
 in the cantons where they were harsh to the poor he said 
 look at the people of briancon they have conferred on the poor on widows and orphans the right to have their meadows mown three days in advance of every one else they rebuild their houses for them gratuitously when they are ruined therefore it is a country which is blessed by god 
 for a whole century there has not been a single murderer among them 
 in villages which were greedy for profit and harvest he said look at the people of embrun 
 if at the harvest season the father of a family has his son away on service in the army and his daughters at service in the town and if he is ill and incapacitated the cure recommends him to the prayers of the congregation and on sunday after the mass all the inhabitants of the women and to the poor field and do his harvesting for him and carry his straw and his grain to his granary to families divided by questions of money and inheritance he said look at the mountaineers of devolny a country so wild that the nightingale is not heard there once in fifty years 
 well when the father of a family dies the boys go off to seek their fortunes leaving the property to the girls so that they may find husbands to the cantons which had a taste for lawsuits and where the farmers ruined themselves in stamped paper he said 
 look at those good peasants in the valley of queyras 
 there are three thousand souls of them mon dieu it is like a little republic 
 neither judge nor bailiff is known there 
 the mayor does everything 
 he allots the imposts taxes each person conscientiously judges quarrels for nothing divides inheritances without charge pronounces sentences gratuitously and he is obeyed because he is a just man among simple men to villages where he found no schoolmaster he quoted once more the people of queyras 
 do you know how they manage he said 
 since a little country of a dozen or fifteen hearths cannot always support a teacher they have who are paid by the whole valley who make the round of the villages spending a week in this one ten days in that and instruct them 
 these teachers go to the fairs i have seen them there 
 they are to be recognized by the quill pens which they wear in the cord of their hat 
 those who teach reading only have one pen those who teach reading and reckoning have two pens those who teach reading reckoning and latin have three pens 
 but what a disgrace to be ignorant 
 do like the people of queyras 
 thus he discoursed gravely and paternally in default of examples he invented parables going directly to the point with few phrases and many images which characteristic formed the real eloquence of jesus christ 
 and being convinced himself he was persuasive

 joe 
 he relents

 some italian reassuring him as he opens the cab door and drags ann out 
 
 joe walks up the steps followed by ann head down barely able to keep awake he arrives at the front door as he stops leaning forward to open it ann rests her head on his shoulder before going through he straightens causing her to stand up balancing herself and then goes through ann follows he shuts the door behind her taking her by the hand up the steps without thinking she walks around the outside of the small spiral stairwell instead of following him up so joe turns her around with his hand leaning over the railing from above ann blissfully unaware as he leads her around so happy and leads her back around to the bottom of the steps ann so happy and up the right way 
 she staggers up steps after him stopping by a door as joe goes to unlock his one a few steps up in her stupor she raises her hand and is about to knock on the door when joe sees her running over to catch her hand just in time he leads her to the door and unlocks it he goes in and turns on the light 
 
 joe 
 muttering as ann follows him in 
 out of my head 
 
 he shuts the door behind her 
 
 ann 
 is this the elevator 
 
 joe 
 offended 
 my room 
 
 he turns on a lamp at the other end of the room by the bathroom door 
 
 ann 
 she almost topples over walking to the bed and putting a gloved hand on the endboard to steady herself 
 terribly sorry to mention it but the dizziness is getting worse 
 
 looking around

 joe 
 the general idea 
 
 he walks over and opens a wardrobe on the landing next to the front door 
 
 ann 
 poetically

 joe 
 walking over to ann presenting her with some pyjamas 
 afraid have to rough it these 
 
 ann 
 with delight taking them 
 pyjamas 
 
 joe

 he goes over to open another cupboard by the lamp 
 
 ann 
 will you help me get undressed please 
 
 she stands ready head raised expectantly 
 
 joe 
 pauses unsure then goes to her 
 
 
 he undoes her necktie sliding it away fom her neck presenting it to her 
 er there you are you can handle the rest 
 
 she looks at it blankly then takes it 
 joe walks over to the table by the front door pouring a drink into a glass from a bottle and swallowing it 
 
 ann 
 just putting down her last glove 
 may i have some 
 
 joe 
 firmly 
 no 
 
 puts his glass down going over to her

 some italian reassuring him as he opens the cab door and drags ann out 
 
 joe walks up the steps followed by ann head down barely able to keep awake he arrives at the front door as he stops leaning forward to open it ann rests her head on his shoulder before going through he straightens causing her to stand up balancing herself and then goes through ann follows he shuts the door behind her taking her by the hand up the steps without thinking she walks around the outside of the small spiral stairwell instead of following him up so joe turns her around with his hand leaning over the railing from above ann blissfully unaware as he leads her around so happy and leads her back around to the bottom of the steps ann so happy and up the right way 
 she staggers up steps after him stopping by a door as joe goes to unlock his one a few steps up in her stupor she raises her hand and is about to knock on the door when joe sees her running over to catch her hand just in time he leads her to the door and unlocks it he goes in and turns on the light 
 
 joe 
 muttering as ann follows him in 
 out of my head 
 
 he shuts the door behind her 
 
 ann

 terribly sorry to mention it but the dizziness is getting worse

 a new hope 
 iii 
 
 the burnished conference table was as soulless and unyielding as the mood of theeight imperial senators and officers ranged around it imperial troopers stood guardat the entrance to the chamber which was sparse and coldly lit from lights in the tableand walks one of the youngest of the eight was declaiming he exhibited theattitude of one who had climbed far and fast by methods best not examined tooclosely general tagge did possess a certain twisted genius but it was only partlythat ability which had lifted him to his present exalted position other noisometalents had proven equally efficacious 
 though his uniform was as neatly molded and his body as cleans as that ofanyone else in the room none of the remaining seven cared to touch him a certainsliminess clung cloyingly to him a sensation inferred rather than tactile despitethis many respected him or feared him 
 i tell you gone too far this time the general was insisting is sith lord inflicted on us at the urging of the emperor will be our the battle station is fully operational we remain vulnerable 
 some of you still seem to realize how well equipped and organized therebel alliance is their vessel are excellent their pilots better and they arepropelled by something more powerful than mere engines this perverse reactionaryfanaticism of theirs more dangerous than most of you realize 
 an older officer with facial scars so deeply engraved that even the best cosmeticsurgery could not fully repair them shifted nervously in his chair dangerous toyour starfleet general tagge but not to this battle station wizened eyes hoppedfrom man to man traveling around the table i happen to think lord vader knowswhat doing the rebellion will continue only as long as those cowards have asanctuary a place where their pilots can relax and their machines can be repaired 
 tagge objected i beg to differ with you romodi i think the construction ofthis station has more to do with governor bid for personal power andrecognition than with any justifiable military strategy within the senate the rebelswill continue to increase their support as long 
 the sound of the single doorway sliding aside and the guards snapping toattention cut him off his head turned as did everyone 
 two individuals as different in appearance as they were united in objective hadentered the chamber the nearest to tagge was a thin man with hairand form borrowed from an old broom and the expression of a quiescent grand moff tarkin governor of numerous outlying imperial territories wasdwarfed by broad armored bulk of lord darth vader 
 tagge unintimidated but subdued slowly resumed his seat as tarkin assumedhis place at the end of the conference table vader stood next to him a dominatingpresence behind the chair for a minute tarkin stared directly at glanced away as if he had seen nothing tagge fumed but remained silent 
 as gaze roved around the table a smile of satisfactionremained frozen in his features the imperial senate will no longer be of anyconcern to us gentlemen i have just receive word that the emperor haspermanently dissolved that misguided body 
 a ripple of astonishment ran through the assembly the last remnants tarkincontinued of the old republic have finally been swept away 
 this is impossible tagge interjected how will the emperor maintaincontrol of the imperial 
 senatorial representation has not been formally abolished you mustunderstand tarkin explained it has merely been superseded for the he smileda bit of the emergency regional governors will now have directcontrol and a free hand in administering their territories this means that theimperial presence can at last be brought to bear properly on the vacillating worlds ofthe empire from now on fear will keep potentially traitorous local government inline fear of the imperial fear of this battle station 
 and what of the existing rebellion tagge wanted to know 
 if the rebels somehow managed to gain access to a complete technical schemaof this battle station it is remotely possible that they might be able to locate aweakness susceptible to minor exploitation smile shifted to a smirk ofcourse we all know how well guarded how carefully protected such vital data is itcould not possibly fall into rebel hands 
 the technical data to which you are obliquely referring rumbled darth vaderangrily will soon be back in our hands if 
 tarkin shook the dark lord off something no one else at the table would havedared to do it is immaterial any attack made against this station by the rebelswould be a suicidal gesture suicidal and of any information theymanaged to obtain after many long years of secretive construction he declaredwith evident pleasure this station has become the decisive force in this part of theuniverse events in this region of the galaxy will no longer be determined by decree or by any other agency they will be decided by this station 
 a huge hand gestured slightly and one of the filled cups on the tabledrifted responsively into it with a slightly admonishing tone the dark lordcontinued become too proud of this technological terror the ability to destroy a city a world a whole system is still insignificantwhen set against the force 
 the force tagge sneered try to frighten us with your vader your sad devotion to that ancient mythology has not helped you toconjure up those stolen tapes or gifted you with clairvoyance sufficient to locate hidden fortress why enough to make one laugh fit to 
 eyes abruptly bulged and his hands went to his throat as he began to turna disconcerting shade of blue 
 i find vader ventured mildly this lack of faith disturbing 
 enough of this tarkin snapped distressed vader release him thisbickering among ourselves is pointless 
 vader shrugged as if it were of no consequence tagge slumped in his his throat his wary gaze never leaving the dark giant 
 lord vader will provide us with the location of the rebel fortress by the timethis station is certified operational tarkin declared that known we will proceedto it and destroy it utterly crushing this pathetic rebellion in one swift stoke 
 as the emperor wills it vader added not without sarcasm so shall it be 
 if any of the powerful men seated around the table found this disrespectful toneobjectionable a glance at tagge was sufficient to dissuade them from mentioning it 
 the dim prison reeked of rancid oil and stale lubricants a veritable metalliccharnel house threepio endured the discomfiting atmosphere as best he could itwas a constant battle to avoid being thrown by every unexpected bounce into thewalls or into a fellow machine 
 to conserve also to avoid the steady stream of complaints from histaller detoo had shut down all exterior functions he lay inertamong a pile of secondary parts sublimely unconcerned at the moment as to their fate 
 will this never end threepio was moaning as another violent jolt roughlyjostled the inhabitants of the prison he had already formulated and discarded half ahundred horrible ends he was certain only that their eventual disposition was sureto be worse than anything he could imagine 
 then quite without warning something more unsettling than even the mostbattering bump took place the whine died and the vehicle came to as if in response to query a nervous buzz rose from thosemechanicals who still retained a semblance of sentience as they speculated on theirpresent location and probable fate 
 at least threepio was no longer ignorant of his captors or of their likely captives had explained the nature of the mechanic migrants thejawas traveling in their enormous mobile they scoured the mostinhospitable regions of tatooine in search of valuable salvageablemachinery they had never been seen outside of their protective cloaks andsandmasks so no one knew exactly what they looked like but they were reputed tobe extraordinarily ugly threepio did not have to be convinced 
 leaning over his companion he began a steady shaking of torso epidermal sensors were activated on the artoo unit and the lightson the front side of the little robot began a sequential awakening 
 wake up wake up threepio urged stopped someplace likeseveral of the other more imaginative robots his eyes were warily scanning metalwalls expecting a hidden panel to slide aside at any moment and a giant mechanicalarm to come probing and fumbling for him 
 no doubt about it doomed he recited mournfully as artoo rightedhimself returning to full activation do you think melt us down hebecame silent for several minutes then added this waiting that gets to the far wall of the chamber slid aside and the blinding white glare of atatooine morning rushed in on them sensitive photoreceptors were hardpressed to adjust in time to prevent serious damage 
 several of the jawas scrambled agilely into the chamber stilldressed in the same swathing and filth threepio had observed on them hard weapons of an unknown design they prodded at the machines certainof them threepio noted with a mental swallow did not stir 
 ignoring the immobile ones the jawas herded those still capable of movementoutside artoo and threepio among them both robots found themselves part of anuneven mechanical line 
 shielding his eyes against the glare threepio saw that five of them werearranged alongside the huge sandcrawler thoughts of escape did not enter his a concept was utterly alien to a mechanical the more intelligent a robot more abhorrent and unthinkable the concept besides had he tried to sensors would have detected the critical logic malfunction and melted everycircuit in his brain 
 instead he studied the small domes and vaporators that indicated the presence ofa larger underground human homestead though he was unfamiliar with this type ofconstruction all signs pointed to a modest if isolated habitation thoughts of beingdismembered for parts or slaving in some mine slowly faded hisspirits rose correspondingly 
 maybe this be so bad after all he murmured hopefully if we canconvince these bipedal vermin to unload us here we may enter into sensible humanservice again instead of being melted into slag 
 sole reply was a noncommittal chirp both machines became silent asthe jawas commenced scurrying around them striving to straighten one poor machinewith a badly bent spine to disguise a dent or scrape with liquid and dust 
 as two of them bustled about working on his skin threepio foughtto stifle an expression of disgust one of his many functions was theability to react naturally to offensive odors apparently hygiene was unknownamong the jawas but he was certain no good would come of pointing this out tothem 
 small insects drifted in clouds about the faces of the jawas who ignored the tiny individualized plagues were regarded as just a different sort ofappendage like an extra arm or leg 
 so intent was threepio on his observation that he failed to notice the two figuresmoving toward them from the region of the largest dome artoo had to nudge himslightly before he looked up 
 the first man wore an air of grim exhaustion sandblasted intohis face by too many years of arguing with a hostile environment his graying hairwas frozen in tangled twists like gypsum helicites dust frosted his face and thoughts but the body if not the spirit was still powerful 
 proportionately dwarfed by his body luke strode in his shadow his present attitude one of dejection rather than had a great deal on his mind and it had very little to do with farming mostly itinvolved the rest of his life and the commitment made by his best friend who hadrecently departed beyond the blue sky above to enter a harsher yet more rewardingcareer 
 the bigger man stopped before the assembly and entered into a peculiar squeakydialogue with the jawa in charge when they wished it the jawas could beunderstood 
 luke stood nearby listening indifferently then he shuffled along behind hisuncle as the latter began inspecting the five machines pausing only to mutter anoccasional word or two to his nephew it was hard to pay attention even though heknew he ought to be learning 
 luke a voice called 
 turning away from the conversation which consisted of the lead jawa extollingthe unmatched virtues of all five machines and his uncle countering with walked over to the near edge of the subterranean courtyard and peered down 
 a stout woman with the expression of a misplaced sparrow was busy workingamong decorative plants she looked up at him be sure and tell owen that if hebuys a translator to make sure it speaks bocce luke 
 turning luke looked back over his shoulder and studied the motley collection oftired machines it looks like we have much of a choice he called back downto her but remind him anyway 
 she nodded up at him and he turned to rejoin his uncle 
 apparently owen lars had already come to a decision having settled on a robot this one was similar in shape to artoo detoo save that itsmultiple subsidiary arms were tipped with different functions at an order it hadstepped out of the line and was wobbling along behind owen and the temporarilysubdued jawa 
 proceeding to the end of the line the eyes narrowed as he concentratedon the but still flashy bronze finish of the tall humanoid threepio 
 i presume you function he grumbled at the robot do you know customsand protocol 
 do i know protocol threepio echoed as the farmer looked him up and was determined to embarrass the jawa when it came to selling his i know protocol why my primary function i am also well 
 need a protocol droid the farmer snapped dryly 
 i blame you sir threepio rapidly agreed i be more inagreement what could be more of a wasteful luxury in a climate like this forsomeone of your interests sir a protocol droid would be a useless waste of is my middle name see vee for service been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that requireonly 
 i need the farmer broke in demonstrating imperious disregard for yet unenumerated secondary functions a droid that knows something aboutbinary language of independently programmable moisture vaporators 
 vaporators we are both in luck threepio countered my first assignment was in programming binary load lifters very similar inconstruction and to your vaporators you could almost say 
 luke tapped his uncle on the shoulder and whispered something in his uncle nodded then looked back at the attentive threepio again 
 do you speak bocce 
 of course sir threepio replied confident for a change with a wholly honestanswer like a second language to me as fluent in bocce as 
 the farmer appeared determined never to allow him to conclude a up owen lars looked down at the jawa take this one too 
 shutting up sir responded threepio quickly hard put to conceal his glee atbeing selected 
 take them down to the garage luke his uncle instructed him i want you tohave both of them cleaned up by suppertime 
 luke looked askance at his uncle but i was going into tosche station to pickup some new power converters and 
 lie to me luke his uncle warned him sternly i mind youwasting time with your idle friends but only after finished your chores nowhop to before supper mind 
 downcast luke directed his words irritably to threepio and the smallagricultural robot he knew better than to argue with his uncle 
 follow me you two they started for the garage as owen entered into pricenegotiations with the jawa 
 other jawas were leading the three remaining machines back into thesandcrawler when something let out an almost pathetic beep luke turned to see aartoo unit breaking formation and starting toward him it was immediatelyrestrained by a jawa wielding a control device that activated the disk sealed on front plate 
 luke studied the rebellious droid curiously threepio started to say the circumstances and thought better of it instead he remained straight ahead 
 a minute later something pinged sharply nearby glancing down luke sawthat a head plate had popped off the top of the agricultural droid a grinding noisewas coming from within a second later the machine was throwing internalcomponents all over the sandy ground 
 leaning close luke peered inside the expectorating mechanical he called owen the on this cultivator unit is shot reached in tried to adjust the device and pulled away hurriedly when it began awild sparking the odor of crisped insulation and corroded circuitry filled the cleardesert air with a pungency redolent of mechanized death 
 owen lars glared down at the nervous jawa what kind of junk are you tryingto push on us 
 the jawa responded loudly indignantly while simultaneously taking a couple ofprecautionary steps away from the big human he was distressed that the man wasbetween him and the soothing safely of the sandcrawler 
 meanwhile artoo detoo had scuttled out of the group of machines being ledback toward the mobile fortress doing so turned out to be simple enough since allthe jawas had their attention focused on the argument between their leader and 
 lacking sufficient armature for wild gesticulation the artoo unit suddenly letout a high whistle then broke it off when it was apparent he had gained 
 tapping luke gently on the shoulder the tall droid whispered conspiratoriallyinto his ear if i might say so young sir that artoo unit is a real bargain in topcondition i believe these creatures have any idea what good shape reallyin let all the sand and dust deceive you 
 luke was in the habit of making instant good or owen he called 
 breaking off the argument without taking his attention from the jawa his uncleglanced quickly at him luke gestured toward artoo detoo we want anytrouble what about swapping this he indicated the that one 
 the older man studied the artoo unit professionally then considered the inherently cowards the tiny desert scavengers could be pushed too far thesandcrawler could flatten the the risk of inciting the humancommunity to lethal vengeance 
 faced with a situation for wither side if he pressed too hard owenresumed the argument for sake before gruffly assenting the head jawaconsented reluctantly to the trade and both sides breathed a mental sigh of relief thathostilities had been avoided while the jawa bowed and whined with impatientgreed owen paid him off 
 meanwhile luke had led the two robots toward an opening in the dry few seconds later they were striding down a ramp kept clear of drifting sand byelectrostatic repellers 
 you ever forget this threepio muttered to artoo leaning over thesmaller machine why i stick my neck out for you when all you ever bring me istrouble is beyond my capacity to comprehend 
 the passage widened into garage proper which was cluttered with tools andsections of farming machinery many looked heavily used some to the point ofcollapse but the lights were comforting to both droid and there was a hominess tothe chamber which hinted at a tranquillity not experienced by either machine for along time near the center of the garage was a large tub and the aroma drifting fromit made principal olfactory sensors twitch 
 luke grinned noting the reaction yes a lubrication bath heeyed the tall bronze robot appraisingly and from the looks of it you could useabout a submergence but we afford that so have to settle for anafternoon then luke turned his attention to artoo detoo walking up to him andflipping open a panel that shielded numerous gauges 
 as for you he continued with a whistle of surprise i know how running not surprising knowing the jawas reluctance to part with any they have to recharge time for you he gestured toward a largepower unit 
 artoo detoo followed gesture then beeped once and waddled over theboxy construction finding the proper cord he automatically flipped open a paneland plugged the triple prongs into his face 
 threepio had walked over to the large cistern which was filled almost full witharomatic cleansing oil with a remarkably humanlike sigh he lowered himselfslowly into the tank 
 you two behave yourselves luke cautioned them as he moved to a small sky hopper a powerful little suborbital spacecraft it rested in the hangarsection of the got work of my own to do 
 unfortunately energies were still focused on his farewell encounter withbiggs so that hours later he had finished few of his chores thinking about departure luke was running a caressing hand over the damaged port fin ofthe fin he had damaged while running down an imaginary tie fighter inthe wrenching twists and turns of a narrow canyon that was when the projectingledge had clipped him as effectively as an energy beam 
 abruptly something came to a boil within him with atypical violence he threwa power wrench across a worktable nearby it just fair he declared to no onein particular his voice dropped disconsolately biggs is right never get outof here planning rebellion against the empire and trapped on a blight of afarm 
 i beg your pardon sir 
 luke spun startled but it was only the tall droid threepio the contrast in therobot was striking compared with initial sight of him alloygleamed in the overhead lights of the garage cleaned of pits and dust by the powerfuloils 
 is there anything i might do to help the robot asked solicitously 
 luke studied the machine and as he did so some of his anger drained was no point in yelling cryptically at a robot 
 i doubt it he replied unless you can alter time and speed up the harvest orelse teleport me off this sandpile under uncle nose 
 sarcasm was difficult for even an extremely sophisticated robot to detect sothreepio considered the question objectively before finally replying i think only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things astransatomic physics suddenly the events of the past couple of days seemed tocatch up with him all at once as a matter of fact young sir threepio went onwhile looking around him with fresh vision not even sure which planet on 
 luke chuckled sardonically and assumed a mocking pose if brightcenter to this universe on the world farthest from it 
 yes luke sir 
 the youth shook his head irritably never mind the just this world is called tatooine 
 threepio nodded slightly thank you luke i am see relations specialist he jerked a casual metal thumb back toward therecharge unit that is my companion artoo detoo 
 pleased to meet you threepio luke said easily you too across the garage he checked a gauge on the smaller front the charge cord he saw something which made him frown and lean close 
 something wrong luke threepio inquired 
 luke went to a nearby tool wall and selected a small device know yet threepio 
 returning to the recharger luke bent over artoo and began scraping at severalbumps in the small top with a chromed pick occasionally he jerked backsharply as bits of corrosion were flicked into the air by the tiny tool 
 threepio watched interested as luke worked a lot of strange carbonscoring here of a seen a lot of action out of the ordinary 
 indeed sir threepio admitted forgetting to drop the honorific this timeluke was too absorbed elsewhere to correct him sometimes amazed inas good shape as we are he added as an afterthought while still shying away fromthe thrust of question what with the rebellion and all 
 despite his caution it seemed to threepio that he must have given somethingaway for an almost blaze appeared in eyes you know about therebellion against the empire he demanded 
 in a way threepio confessed reluctantly the rebellion was responsible forour coming into your service we are refugees you se he did not add fromwhere 
 not that luke appeared to care refugees then i did see a space rambled on rapidly excited tell me where how manyencounters how is the rebellion going does the empire take it seriously haveyou seen many ships destroyed 
 a bit slower please sir threepio pleaded you misinterpret our were innocent bystanders our involvement with the rebellion was of the mostmarginal nature 
 as to battles we were in several i think it is difficult to tell when one is notdirectly in contact with the actual battle machinery he shrugged neatly beyondthat there is not much to say remember sir i am little more than a cosmeticizedinterpreter and not very good at telling stories or relating histories and even lessproficient at embellishing them i am a very literal machine 
 luke turned away disappointed and returned to his cleaning of artoo scraping turned up something puzzling enough to demand his full small metal fragment was tightly lodged between two bar conduits that wouldnormally form a linkage setting down the delicate pick luke switched to a largerinstrument 
 well my little friend he murmured got something jammed in herereal good as he pushed and pried luke directed half his attention to you on a star freighter or was it 
 metal gave way with a powerful crack and the recoil sent luke tumbling headover heels getting to his feet he started to froze motionless 
 the front of the artoo unit had begun to glow exuding a less than of a meter square but precisely defined the portraitformed within the box was so exquisite that in a couple of minutes luke discoveredhe was out of he had forgotten to breath 
 despite a superficial sharpness the image flickered and jiggled unsteadily as ifthe recording had been made and installed with haste luke stared at the foreigncolors being projected into the prosaic atmosphere of the garage and started to form aquestion but it was never finished the lips on the figure moved and the rather seemed to speak luke knew the aural accompaniment wasgenerated somewhere within artoo squat torso 
 kenobi the voice implored huskily help me my onlyremaining hope a burst of static dissolved the face momentarily then itcoalesced again and once more the voice repeated kenobi my onlyremaining hope 
 with a raspy hum the hologram continued luke sat perfectly still for a longmoment considering what he was seeing then he blinked and directed his words tothe artoo unit 
 this all about artoo detoo 
 the stubby droid shifted slightly the cubish portrait shifting with him andbeeped what sounded vaguely like a sheepish reply 
 threepio appeared as mystified as luke what is that he inquired at the speaking portrait and then at luke you were asked a and who is that and how are you originating why 
 the artoo unit generated a beep of surprise for all the world as if just noticingthe hologram this was followed by a whistling stream of information 
 threepio digested the data tried to frown and strove to convey his ownconfusion via the tone of his voice he insist nothing sir merely data a tape that should have been erased but was missed heinsists we pay it no mind 
 that was like telling luke to ignore a cache of durindfires he might stumbleover in the desert who is she he demanded staring enraptured at the beautiful 
 i really know who she is threepio confessed honestly i think shemight have been a passenger on our last voyage from what i recall she was apersonage of some importance this might have something to do with the fact thatour captain was attach to 
 luke cut him off savoring the way sensuous lips formed and reformed thesentence fragment is there any more to this recording it sounds like getting to his feet luke reached out for the artoo unit 
 the robot moved backward and produced whistles of such frantic concern thatluke hesitated and held off reaching for the internal controls 
 threepio was shocked behave yourself artoo he finally chastised hiscompanion going to get us into trouble he had vision of the both ofthem being packed up as uncooperative and shipped back to the jawas which wasenough to make him imitate a shudder 
 all our master now threepio indicated luke you cantrust him i feel that he has our best interests in mind 
 detoo appeared to hesitate uncertain then he whistled and beeped a longcomplexity at his friend 
 well luke prompted impatiently 
 threepio paused before replying he says that he is the property of one kenobi a resident of this world of this very region in fact the sentencefragment we are hearing is part of a private message intended for this person 
 threepio shook his head slowly quite frankly sir i know what about our last master was captain colton i never heard artoo mention aprior master certainly never heard of an kenobi but with all through he concluded apologetically afraid his logic circuits have gottena bit scrambled become decidedly eccentric at times and while lukeconsidered this turn of events threepio took the opportunity to throw artoo a furiouslook of warning 
 kenobi luke recited thoughtfully his expression suddenlybrightened sayi wonder if he could be referring to old ben kenobi 
 begging your pardon threepio gulped astonished beyond measure but youactually know of such a person 
 not exactly he admitted in a more subdued voice i know anyonenamed old ben lives somewhere out on the fringe of the western dunesea kind of a local hermit uncle owen and a few of the otherfarmers say a sorcerer 
 he comes around once in a while to trade things i hardly ever talk to my uncle usually runs him off he paused and glanced across at thesmall robot again but i never heard that old ben owned a droid of any kind atleast none that i ever heard tell of 
 gaze was drawn irresistibly back to the hologram i wonder who she must be if what you told me just now is true sounds and looks as if in some kind of trouble maybe the message isimportant we ought to hear the rest of it 
 he reached again for the internal controls and the robot scurriedbackward again squeaking a blue streak 
 he says a restraining separator bolt circuiting out his components threepio translated he suggests that if you move thebolt he might be able to repeat the entire message threepio finished luke continued to stare at the portrait threepio added more loudly sir 
 luke shook himself what oh yes he considered the he moved and peered into the open panel this time artoo retreat 
 i see it i think well i guess too small to run away from me if i takethis off i wonder what someone would be sending a message to old ben for 
 selecting the proper tool luke reached down into the exposed circuitry andpopped the restraining bolt free the first noticeable result of this action was thatthe portrait disappeared 
 luke stood back there now there was an uncomfortable pause duringwhich the hologram showed no sign of returning where did she go lukefinally prompted make her come back play the entire message artoo detoo 
 an beep came from the robot threepio appearedembarrassed and nervous as he translated he said what message 
 attention turned half angrily to his companion what know what message the one you just played a fragment of for us the hauling around inside tour recalcitrant innards you stubborn bunkof junk 
 artoo sat and hummed softly to himself 
 sorry sir threepio said slowly but he shows signs of having developedan alarming flutter in his module perhaps if we 
 a voice from down a corridor interrupted him lukeoh todinner 
 luke hesitated then rose and turned away from the puzzling little he called coming aunt beru he lowered his voice as he spoke tothreepio see what you can do with him be back soon tossing the restraining bolt on the workbench he hurried from the chamber 
 as soon as the human was gone threepio whirled on his shorter better consider playing that whole recording for him he growled withsuggestive nod toward a workbench laden with dismembered machine liable to take up that cleaning pick again and go digging for it hemight not be too careful what he cuts through if he believes deliberatelywithholding something from him 
 a plaintive beep came from artoo 
 no threepio responded i think he likes you at all 
 a second beep failed to alter the stern tone in the taller voice no like you either

 a new hope 
 iii 
 
 the burnished conference table was as soulless and unyielding as the mood of theeight imperial senators and officers ranged around it imperial troopers stood guardat the entrance to the chamber which was sparse and coldly lit from lights in the tableand walks one of the youngest of the eight was declaiming he exhibited theattitude of one who had climbed far and fast by methods best not examined tooclosely general tagge did possess a certain twisted genius but it was only partlythat ability which had lifted him to his present exalted position other noisometalents had proven equally efficacious 
 though his uniform was as neatly molded and his body as cleans as that ofanyone else in the room none of the remaining seven cared to touch him a certainsliminess clung cloyingly to him a sensation inferred rather than tactile despitethis many respected him or feared him 
 i tell you gone too far this time the general was insisting is sith lord inflicted on us at the urging of the emperor will be our the battle station is fully operational we remain vulnerable 
 some of you still seem to realize how well equipped and organized therebel alliance is their vessel are excellent their pilots better and they arepropelled by something more powerful than mere engines this perverse reactionaryfanaticism of theirs more dangerous than most of you realize 
 an older officer with facial scars so deeply engraved that even the best cosmeticsurgery could not fully repair them shifted nervously in his chair dangerous toyour starfleet general tagge but not to this battle station wizened eyes hoppedfrom man to man traveling around the table i happen to think lord vader knowswhat doing the rebellion will continue only as long as those cowards have asanctuary a place where their pilots can relax and their machines can be repaired 
 tagge objected i beg to differ with you romodi i think the construction ofthis station has more to do with governor bid for personal power andrecognition than with any justifiable military strategy within the senate the rebelswill continue to increase their support as long 
 the sound of the single doorway sliding aside and the guards snapping toattention cut him off his head turned as did everyone 
 two individuals as different in appearance as they were united in objective hadentered the chamber the nearest to tagge was a thin man with hairand form borrowed from an old broom and the expression of a quiescent grand moff tarkin governor of numerous outlying imperial territories wasdwarfed by broad armored bulk of lord darth vader 
 tagge unintimidated but subdued slowly resumed his seat as tarkin assumedhis place at the end of the conference table vader stood next to him a dominatingpresence behind the chair for a minute tarkin stared directly at glanced away as if he had seen nothing tagge fumed but remained silent 
 as gaze roved around the table a smile of satisfactionremained frozen in his features the imperial senate will no longer be of anyconcern to us gentlemen i have just receive word that the emperor haspermanently dissolved that misguided body 
 a ripple of astonishment ran through the assembly the last remnants tarkincontinued of the old republic have finally been swept away 
 this is impossible tagge interjected how will the emperor maintaincontrol of the imperial 
 senatorial representation has not been formally abolished you mustunderstand tarkin explained it has merely been superseded for the he smileda bit of the emergency regional governors will now have directcontrol and a free hand in administering their territories this means that theimperial presence can at last be brought to bear properly on the vacillating worlds ofthe empire from now on fear will keep potentially traitorous local government inline fear of the imperial fear of this battle station 
 and what of the existing rebellion tagge wanted to know 
 if the rebels somehow managed to gain access to a complete technical schemaof this battle station it is remotely possible that they might be able to locate aweakness susceptible to minor exploitation smile shifted to a smirk ofcourse we all know how well guarded how carefully protected such vital data is itcould not possibly fall into rebel hands 
 the technical data to which you are obliquely referring rumbled darth vaderangrily will soon be back in our hands if 
 tarkin shook the dark lord off something no one else at the table would havedared to do it is immaterial any attack made against this station by the rebelswould be a suicidal gesture suicidal and of any information theymanaged to obtain after many long years of secretive construction he declaredwith evident pleasure this station has become the decisive force in this part of theuniverse events in this region of the galaxy will no longer be determined by decree or by any other agency they will be decided by this station 
 a huge hand gestured slightly and one of the filled cups on the tabledrifted responsively into it with a slightly admonishing tone the dark lordcontinued become too proud of this technological terror the ability to destroy a city a world a whole system is still insignificantwhen set against the force 
 the force tagge sneered try to frighten us with your vader your sad devotion to that ancient mythology has not helped you toconjure up those stolen tapes or gifted you with clairvoyance sufficient to locate hidden fortress why enough to make one laugh fit to 
 eyes abruptly bulged and his hands went to his throat as he began to turna disconcerting shade of blue 
 i find vader ventured mildly this lack of faith disturbing 
 enough of this tarkin snapped distressed vader release him thisbickering among ourselves is pointless 
 vader shrugged as if it were of no consequence tagge slumped in his his throat his wary gaze never leaving the dark giant 
 lord vader will provide us with the location of the rebel fortress by the timethis station is certified operational tarkin declared that known we will proceedto it and destroy it utterly crushing this pathetic rebellion in one swift stoke 
 as the emperor wills it vader added not without sarcasm so shall it be 
 if any of the powerful men seated around the table found this disrespectful toneobjectionable a glance at tagge was sufficient to dissuade them from mentioning it 
 the dim prison reeked of rancid oil and stale lubricants a veritable metalliccharnel house threepio endured the discomfiting atmosphere as best he could itwas a constant battle to avoid being thrown by every unexpected bounce into thewalls or into a fellow machine 
 to conserve also to avoid the steady stream of complaints from histaller detoo had shut down all exterior functions he lay inertamong a pile of secondary parts sublimely unconcerned at the moment as to their fate 
 will this never end threepio was moaning as another violent jolt roughlyjostled the inhabitants of the prison he had already formulated and discarded half ahundred horrible ends he was certain only that their eventual disposition was sureto be worse than anything he could imagine 
 then quite without warning something more unsettling than even the mostbattering bump took place the whine died and the vehicle came to as if in response to query a nervous buzz rose from thosemechanicals who still retained a semblance of sentience as they speculated on theirpresent location and probable fate 
 at least threepio was no longer ignorant of his captors or of their likely captives had explained the nature of the mechanic migrants thejawas traveling in their enormous mobile they scoured the mostinhospitable regions of tatooine in search of valuable salvageablemachinery they had never been seen outside of their protective cloaks andsandmasks so no one knew exactly what they looked like but they were reputed tobe extraordinarily ugly threepio did not have to be convinced 
 leaning over his companion he began a steady shaking of torso epidermal sensors were activated on the artoo unit and the lightson the front side of the little robot began a sequential awakening 
 wake up wake up threepio urged stopped someplace likeseveral of the other more imaginative robots his eyes were warily scanning metalwalls expecting a hidden panel to slide aside at any moment and a giant mechanicalarm to come probing and fumbling for him 
 no doubt about it doomed he recited mournfully as artoo rightedhimself returning to full activation do you think melt us down hebecame silent for several minutes then added this waiting that gets to the far wall of the chamber slid aside and the blinding white glare of atatooine morning rushed in on them sensitive photoreceptors were hardpressed to adjust in time to prevent serious damage 
 several of the jawas scrambled agilely into the chamber stilldressed in the same swathing and filth threepio had observed on them hard weapons of an unknown design they prodded at the machines certainof them threepio noted with a mental swallow did not stir 
 ignoring the immobile ones the jawas herded those still capable of movementoutside artoo and threepio among them both robots found themselves part of anuneven mechanical line 
 shielding his eyes against the glare threepio saw that five of them werearranged alongside the huge sandcrawler thoughts of escape did not enter his a concept was utterly alien to a mechanical the more intelligent a robot more abhorrent and unthinkable the concept besides had he tried to sensors would have detected the critical logic malfunction and melted everycircuit in his brain 
 instead he studied the small domes and vaporators that indicated the presence ofa larger underground human homestead though he was unfamiliar with this type ofconstruction all signs pointed to a modest if isolated habitation thoughts of beingdismembered for parts or slaving in some mine slowly faded hisspirits rose correspondingly 
 maybe this be so bad after all he murmured hopefully if we canconvince these bipedal vermin to unload us here we may enter into sensible humanservice again instead of being melted into slag 
 sole reply was a noncommittal chirp both machines became silent asthe jawas commenced scurrying around them striving to straighten one poor machinewith a badly bent spine to disguise a dent or scrape with liquid and dust 
 as two of them bustled about working on his skin threepio foughtto stifle an expression of disgust one of his many functions was theability to react naturally to offensive odors apparently hygiene was unknownamong the jawas but he was certain no good would come of pointing this out tothem 
 small insects drifted in clouds about the faces of the jawas who ignored the tiny individualized plagues were regarded as just a different sort ofappendage like an extra arm or leg 
 so intent was threepio on his observation that he failed to notice the two figuresmoving toward them from the region of the largest dome artoo had to nudge himslightly before he looked up 
 the first man wore an air of grim exhaustion sandblasted intohis face by too many years of arguing with a hostile environment his graying hairwas frozen in tangled twists like gypsum helicites dust frosted his face and thoughts but the body if not the spirit was still powerful 
 proportionately dwarfed by his body luke strode in his shadow his present attitude one of dejection rather than had a great deal on his mind and it had very little to do with farming mostly itinvolved the rest of his life and the commitment made by his best friend who hadrecently departed beyond the blue sky above to enter a harsher yet more rewardingcareer 
 the bigger man stopped before the assembly and entered into a peculiar squeakydialogue with the jawa in charge when they wished it the jawas could beunderstood 
 luke stood nearby listening indifferently then he shuffled along behind hisuncle as the latter began inspecting the five machines pausing only to mutter anoccasional word or two to his nephew it was hard to pay attention even though heknew he ought to be learning 
 luke a voice called 
 turning away from the conversation which consisted of the lead jawa extollingthe unmatched virtues of all five machines and his uncle countering with walked over to the near edge of the subterranean courtyard and peered down 
 a stout woman with the expression of a misplaced sparrow was busy workingamong decorative plants she looked up at him be sure and tell owen that if hebuys a translator to make sure it speaks bocce luke 
 turning luke looked back over his shoulder and studied the motley collection oftired machines it looks like we have much of a choice he called back downto her but remind him anyway 
 she nodded up at him and he turned to rejoin his uncle 
 apparently owen lars had already come to a decision having settled on a robot this one was similar in shape to artoo detoo save that itsmultiple subsidiary arms were tipped with different functions at an order it hadstepped out of the line and was wobbling along behind owen and the temporarilysubdued jawa 
 proceeding to the end of the line the eyes narrowed as he concentratedon the but still flashy bronze finish of the tall humanoid threepio 
 i presume you function he grumbled at the robot do you know customsand protocol 
 do i know protocol threepio echoed as the farmer looked him up and was determined to embarrass the jawa when it came to selling his i know protocol why my primary function i am also well 
 need a protocol droid the farmer snapped dryly 
 i blame you sir threepio rapidly agreed i be more inagreement what could be more of a wasteful luxury in a climate like this forsomeone of your interests sir a protocol droid would be a useless waste of is my middle name see vee for service been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that requireonly 
 i need the farmer broke in demonstrating imperious disregard for yet unenumerated secondary functions a droid that knows something aboutbinary language of independently programmable moisture vaporators 
 vaporators we are both in luck threepio countered my first assignment was in programming binary load lifters very similar inconstruction and to your vaporators you could almost say 
 luke tapped his uncle on the shoulder and whispered something in his uncle nodded then looked back at the attentive threepio again 
 do you speak bocce 
 of course sir threepio replied confident for a change with a wholly honestanswer like a second language to me as fluent in bocce as 
 the farmer appeared determined never to allow him to conclude a up owen lars looked down at the jawa take this one too 
 shutting up sir responded threepio quickly hard put to conceal his glee atbeing selected 
 take them down to the garage luke his uncle instructed him i want you tohave both of them cleaned up by suppertime 
 luke looked askance at his uncle but i was going into tosche station to pickup some new power converters and 
 lie to me luke his uncle warned him sternly i mind youwasting time with your idle friends but only after finished your chores nowhop to before supper mind 
 downcast luke directed his words irritably to threepio and the smallagricultural robot he knew better than to argue with his uncle 
 follow me you two they started for the garage as owen entered into pricenegotiations with the jawa 
 other jawas were leading the three remaining machines back into thesandcrawler when something let out an almost pathetic beep luke turned to see aartoo unit breaking formation and starting toward him it was immediatelyrestrained by a jawa wielding a control device that activated the disk sealed on front plate 
 luke studied the rebellious droid curiously threepio started to say the circumstances and thought better of it instead he remained straight ahead 
 a minute later something pinged sharply nearby glancing down luke sawthat a head plate had popped off the top of the agricultural droid a grinding noisewas coming from within a second later the machine was throwing internalcomponents all over the sandy ground 
 leaning close luke peered inside the expectorating mechanical he called owen the on this cultivator unit is shot reached in tried to adjust the device and pulled away hurriedly when it began awild sparking the odor of crisped insulation and corroded circuitry filled the cleardesert air with a pungency redolent of mechanized death 
 owen lars glared down at the nervous jawa what kind of junk are you tryingto push on us 
 the jawa responded loudly indignantly while simultaneously taking a couple ofprecautionary steps away from the big human he was distressed that the man wasbetween him and the soothing safely of the sandcrawler 
 meanwhile artoo detoo had scuttled out of the group of machines being ledback toward the mobile fortress doing so turned out to be simple enough since allthe jawas had their attention focused on the argument between their leader and 
 lacking sufficient armature for wild gesticulation the artoo unit suddenly letout a high whistle then broke it off when it was apparent he had gained 
 tapping luke gently on the shoulder the tall droid whispered conspiratoriallyinto his ear if i might say so young sir that artoo unit is a real bargain in topcondition i believe these creatures have any idea what good shape reallyin let all the sand and dust deceive you 
 luke was in the habit of making instant good or owen he called 
 breaking off the argument without taking his attention from the jawa his uncleglanced quickly at him luke gestured toward artoo detoo we want anytrouble what about swapping this he indicated the that one 
 the older man studied the artoo unit professionally then considered the inherently cowards the tiny desert scavengers could be pushed too far thesandcrawler could flatten the the risk of inciting the humancommunity to lethal vengeance 
 faced with a situation for wither side if he pressed too hard owenresumed the argument for sake before gruffly assenting the head jawaconsented reluctantly to the trade and both sides breathed a mental sigh of relief thathostilities had been avoided while the jawa bowed and whined with impatientgreed owen paid him off 
 meanwhile luke had led the two robots toward an opening in the dry few seconds later they were striding down a ramp kept clear of drifting sand byelectrostatic repellers 
 you ever forget this threepio muttered to artoo leaning over thesmaller machine why i stick my neck out for you when all you ever bring me istrouble is beyond my capacity to comprehend 
 the passage widened into garage proper which was cluttered with tools andsections of farming machinery many looked heavily used some to the point ofcollapse but the lights were comforting to both droid and there was a hominess tothe chamber which hinted at a tranquillity not experienced by either machine for along time near the center of the garage was a large tub and the aroma drifting fromit made principal olfactory sensors twitch 
 luke grinned noting the reaction yes a lubrication bath heeyed the tall bronze robot appraisingly and from the looks of it you could useabout a submergence but we afford that so have to settle for anafternoon then luke turned his attention to artoo detoo walking up to him andflipping open a panel that shielded numerous gauges 
 as for you he continued with a whistle of surprise i know how running not surprising knowing the jawas reluctance to part with any they have to recharge time for you he gestured toward a largepower unit 
 artoo detoo followed gesture then beeped once and waddled over theboxy construction finding the proper cord he automatically flipped open a paneland plugged the triple prongs into his face 
 threepio had walked over to the large cistern which was filled almost full witharomatic cleansing oil with a remarkably humanlike sigh he lowered himselfslowly into the tank 
 you two behave yourselves luke cautioned them as he moved to a small sky hopper a powerful little suborbital spacecraft it rested in the hangarsection of the got work of my own to do 
 unfortunately energies were still focused on his farewell encounter withbiggs so that hours later he had finished few of his chores thinking about departure luke was running a caressing hand over the damaged port fin ofthe fin he had damaged while running down an imaginary tie fighter inthe wrenching twists and turns of a narrow canyon that was when the projectingledge had clipped him as effectively as an energy beam 
 abruptly something came to a boil within him with atypical violence he threwa power wrench across a worktable nearby it just fair he declared to no onein particular his voice dropped disconsolately biggs is right never get outof here planning rebellion against the empire and trapped on a blight of afarm 
 i beg your pardon sir 
 luke spun startled but it was only the tall droid threepio the contrast in therobot was striking compared with initial sight of him alloygleamed in the overhead lights of the garage cleaned of pits and dust by the powerfuloils 
 is there anything i might do to help the robot asked solicitously 
 luke studied the machine and as he did so some of his anger drained was no point in yelling cryptically at a robot 
 i doubt it he replied unless you can alter time and speed up the harvest orelse teleport me off this sandpile under uncle nose 
 sarcasm was difficult for even an extremely sophisticated robot to detect sothreepio considered the question objectively before finally replying i think only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things astransatomic physics suddenly the events of the past couple of days seemed tocatch up with him all at once as a matter of fact young sir threepio went onwhile looking around him with fresh vision not even sure which planet on 
 luke chuckled sardonically and assumed a mocking pose if brightcenter to this universe on the world farthest from it 
 yes luke sir 
 the youth shook his head irritably never mind the just this world is called tatooine 
 threepio nodded slightly thank you luke i am see relations specialist he jerked a casual metal thumb back toward therecharge unit that is my companion artoo detoo 
 pleased to meet you threepio luke said easily you too across the garage he checked a gauge on the smaller front the charge cord he saw something which made him frown and lean close 
 something wrong luke threepio inquired 
 luke went to a nearby tool wall and selected a small device know yet threepio 
 returning to the recharger luke bent over artoo and began scraping at severalbumps in the small top with a chromed pick occasionally he jerked backsharply as bits of corrosion were flicked into the air by the tiny tool 
 threepio watched interested as luke worked a lot of strange carbonscoring here of a seen a lot of action out of the ordinary 
 indeed sir threepio admitted forgetting to drop the honorific this timeluke was too absorbed elsewhere to correct him sometimes amazed inas good shape as we are he added as an afterthought while still shying away fromthe thrust of question what with the rebellion and all 
 despite his caution it seemed to threepio that he must have given somethingaway for an almost blaze appeared in eyes you know about therebellion against the empire he demanded 
 in a way threepio confessed reluctantly the rebellion was responsible forour coming into your service we are refugees you se he did not add fromwhere 
 not that luke appeared to care refugees then i did see a space rambled on rapidly excited tell me where how manyencounters how is the rebellion going does the empire take it seriously haveyou seen many ships destroyed 
 a bit slower please sir threepio pleaded you misinterpret our were innocent bystanders our involvement with the rebellion was of the mostmarginal nature 
 as to battles we were in several i think it is difficult to tell when one is notdirectly in contact with the actual battle machinery he shrugged neatly beyondthat there is not much to say remember sir i am little more than a cosmeticizedinterpreter and not very good at telling stories or relating histories and even lessproficient at embellishing them i am a very literal machine 
 luke turned away disappointed and returned to his cleaning of artoo scraping turned up something puzzling enough to demand his full small metal fragment was tightly lodged between two bar conduits that wouldnormally form a linkage setting down the delicate pick luke switched to a largerinstrument 
 well my little friend he murmured got something jammed in herereal good as he pushed and pried luke directed half his attention to you on a star freighter or was it 
 metal gave way with a powerful crack and the recoil sent luke tumbling headover heels getting to his feet he started to froze motionless 
 the front of the artoo unit had begun to glow exuding a less than of a meter square but precisely defined the portraitformed within the box was so exquisite that in a couple of minutes luke discoveredhe was out of he had forgotten to breath 
 despite a superficial sharpness the image flickered and jiggled unsteadily as ifthe recording had been made and installed with haste luke stared at the foreigncolors being projected into the prosaic atmosphere of the garage and started to form aquestion but it was never finished the lips on the figure moved and the rather seemed to speak luke knew the aural accompaniment wasgenerated somewhere within artoo squat torso 
 kenobi the voice implored huskily help me my onlyremaining hope a burst of static dissolved the face momentarily then itcoalesced again and once more the voice repeated kenobi my onlyremaining hope 
 with a raspy hum the hologram continued luke sat perfectly still for a longmoment considering what he was seeing then he blinked and directed his words tothe artoo unit 
 this all about artoo detoo 
 the stubby droid shifted slightly the cubish portrait shifting with him andbeeped what sounded vaguely like a sheepish reply 
 threepio appeared as mystified as luke what is that he inquired at the speaking portrait and then at luke you were asked a and who is that and how are you originating why 
 the artoo unit generated a beep of surprise for all the world as if just noticingthe hologram this was followed by a whistling stream of information 
 threepio digested the data tried to frown and strove to convey his ownconfusion via the tone of his voice he insist nothing sir merely data a tape that should have been erased but was missed heinsists we pay it no mind 
 that was like telling luke to ignore a cache of durindfires he might stumbleover in the desert who is she he demanded staring enraptured at the beautiful 
 i really know who she is threepio confessed honestly i think shemight have been a passenger on our last voyage from what i recall she was apersonage of some importance this might have something to do with the fact thatour captain was attach to 
 luke cut him off savoring the way sensuous lips formed and reformed thesentence fragment is there any more to this recording it sounds like getting to his feet luke reached out for the artoo unit 
 the robot moved backward and produced whistles of such frantic concern thatluke hesitated and held off reaching for the internal controls 
 threepio was shocked behave yourself artoo he finally chastised hiscompanion going to get us into trouble he had vision of the both ofthem being packed up as uncooperative and shipped back to the jawas which wasenough to make him imitate a shudder 
 all our master now threepio indicated luke you cantrust him i feel that he has our best interests in mind 
 detoo appeared to hesitate uncertain then he whistled and beeped a longcomplexity at his friend 
 well luke prompted impatiently 
 threepio paused before replying he says that he is the property of one kenobi a resident of this world of this very region in fact the sentencefragment we are hearing is part of a private message intended for this person 
 threepio shook his head slowly quite frankly sir i know what about our last master was captain colton i never heard artoo mention aprior master certainly never heard of an kenobi but with all through he concluded apologetically afraid his logic circuits have gottena bit scrambled become decidedly eccentric at times and while lukeconsidered this turn of events threepio took the opportunity to throw artoo a furiouslook of warning 
 kenobi luke recited thoughtfully his expression suddenlybrightened sayi wonder if he could be referring to old ben kenobi 
 begging your pardon threepio gulped astonished beyond measure but youactually know of such a person 
 not exactly he admitted in a more subdued voice i know anyonenamed old ben lives somewhere out on the fringe of the western dunesea kind of a local hermit uncle owen and a few of the otherfarmers say a sorcerer 
 he comes around once in a while to trade things i hardly ever talk to my uncle usually runs him off he paused and glanced across at thesmall robot again but i never heard that old ben owned a droid of any kind atleast none that i ever heard tell of 
 gaze was drawn irresistibly back to the hologram i wonder who she must be if what you told me just now is true sounds and looks as if in some kind of trouble maybe the message isimportant we ought to hear the rest of it 
 he reached again for the internal controls and the robot scurriedbackward again squeaking a blue streak 
 he says a restraining separator bolt circuiting out his components threepio translated he suggests that if you move thebolt he might be able to repeat the entire message threepio finished luke continued to stare at the portrait threepio added more loudly sir 
 luke shook himself what oh yes he considered the he moved and peered into the open panel this time artoo retreat 
 i see it i think well i guess too small to run away from me if i takethis off i wonder what someone would be sending a message to old ben for 
 selecting the proper tool luke reached down into the exposed circuitry andpopped the restraining bolt free the first noticeable result of this action was thatthe portrait disappeared 
 luke stood back there now there was an uncomfortable pause duringwhich the hologram showed no sign of returning where did she go lukefinally prompted make her come back play the entire message artoo detoo 
 an beep came from the robot threepio appearedembarrassed and nervous as he translated he said what message 
 attention turned half angrily to his companion what know what message the one you just played a fragment of for us the hauling around inside tour recalcitrant innards you stubborn bunkof junk 
 artoo sat and hummed softly to himself 
 sorry sir threepio said slowly but he shows signs of having developedan alarming flutter in his module perhaps if we 
 a voice from down a corridor interrupted him lukeoh todinner 
 luke hesitated then rose and turned away from the puzzling little he called coming aunt beru he lowered his voice as he spoke tothreepio see what you can do with him be back soon tossing the restraining bolt on the workbench he hurried from the chamber 
 as soon as the human was gone threepio whirled on his shorter better consider playing that whole recording for him he growled withsuggestive nod toward a workbench laden with dismembered machine liable to take up that cleaning pick again and go digging for it hemight not be too careful what he cuts through if he believes deliberatelywithholding something from him 
 a plaintive beep came from artoo 
 no threepio responded i think he likes you at all 
 a second beep failed to alter the stern tone in the taller voice no like you either
