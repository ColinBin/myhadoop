 madness this is madness he shook his head slowly this time bedestroyed for sure 
 artoo did not comment immediately barrel torso tilted backward powerfullegs gripping the deck the robot was engrossed in studying the roofoverhead though he did not have a head to cock in a listening posture like hisfriend artoo still somehow managed to convey that impression a series of shortbeeps and chirps issued from his speaker to even a sensitive human ear they wouldhave been just so much static but to threepio they formed words as clear and pure asdirect current 
 yes i suppose they did have to shut the drive down threepio admitted butwhat are we going to do now we enter atmosphere with our main stablizer findestroyed i believe simply going to surrender 
 a small band of armed humans suddenly appeared rifles held at the expressions were as as their uniforms and they carried aboutthem the aura of men prepared to die 
 threepio watched silently until they had vanished around a far bend in thepassageway then looked back at artoo the smaller robot shifted from hisposition of listening gaze turned upward also though he knew were slightly sharper than his own 
 what is it artoo a short burst of beeping came in response anothermoment and there was no need for highly attuned sensors for a minute or twomore the corridor remained deathly silent then a faint scrape scrape could beheard like a cat at a door from somewhere on the hull 
 when several muffled explosions sounded threepio murmured in somewhere above us no escape for the captain this he peered down at artoo i think better 
 the shriek of overstressed metal filled the air before he could finish and the farend of the passageway was lit by a blinding actinic flash somewhere down therethe little cluster of armed crew who had passed by minutes before had encountered attackers 
 threepio turned his face and delicate photoreceptors away just in time to avoidthe fragments of metal that flew down the corridor at the far end a gaping holeappeared in the roof and reflective forms like big metal beads began dropping to thecorridor floor both robots knew that no machine could match the fluidity withwhich those shapes moved and instantly assumed fighting postures the newarrivals were humans in armor not mechanicals 
 one of them looked straight at not at him the panicked robotthrough frantically but past him the figure shifted its big rifle around in armoredhands too late a beam of intense light struck the head sending pieces of and flesh flying in all directions 
 half the invading imperial troops turned and began returning fire up past the two robots 
 way threepio ordered intending to retreat from the turned with him they had taken only a couple of steps when they saw therebel crewmen in position ahead firing down the corridor in seconds thepassageway was filled with smoke and crisscrossing beams of energy 
 red green and blue bolts ricocheted off polished sections of wall and floor orripped long gashes in metal surfaces screams of injured and dying humans apeculiarly unrobotic sound threepio piercingly above the inorganicdestruction 
 one beam struck near the feet at the same time as a second one burst thewall directly behind him exposing sparking circuitry and rows of conduits theforce of the twin blast tumbled threepio into the shredded cables where a dozendifferent currents turned him into a jerking twisting display 
 strange sensations coursed through his metal they caused no confusion every time he moved and tried to free himself there was anotherviolent crackling as a fresh cluster of componentry broke the noise and remained constant around him as the battle continued to rage 
 smoke began to fill the corridor artoo detoo bustled about trying to help freehis friend the little robot evidenced a phlegmatic indifference to the raveningenergies filling the passageway he was built so low that most of the beams passedover him anyhow 
 help threepio yelled suddenly frightened at a new message from aninternal sensor i think something is melting free my left nearthe pelvic servomotor typically his tone turned abruptly from pleading to berating 
 this is all your fault he shouted angrily i should have known better than totrust the logic of a thermocapsulary dehousing assister i know whyyou insisted we leave our assigned stations to come down this stupid access that it matters now the whole ship must be artoo detoo cut him off inmidspeech with some angry beepings and hoots of his own though he continued tocut and pull with precision at the tangled cables 
 is that so threepio sneered in reply the same to you you little 
 and exceptionally violent explosion shook the passage drowning him out miasma of carbonized component filled the air obscuring everything 
 two meters tall bipedal flowing black robes trailing from the figure and aface forever masked by a functional if bizarre black metal breath screen a dark lordof the sith was an awesome threatening shape as it strode through the corridors of therebel ship

 one purpose one thought one obsession dominated that mind now it burnedin the brain of darth vader as he turned down another passageway in the brokenfighter there smoke was beginning to clear though the sound of faraway fightingstill resounded through the hull the battle here had ended and moved on 
 only a robot was left to stir freely in the wake of the dark passing seethreepio finally stepped clear of the last restraining cable somewhere behind himhuman screams could be heard from where relentless imperial troops were moppingup the last remnants of rebel resistance 
 threepio glanced down and saw only scarred deck as he looked around hisvoice was full of concern artoo are you the smoke seemed topart just a bit more threepio found himself staring up the passageway

 threepio started toward them as the haze thickened once more but when hereached the end of the corridor only artoo stood there waiting threepio peeredpast him uncertain robots were occasionally subject to electronic why should he hallucinate a human

 where have you been threepio finally asked hiding i suppose hedecided not to mention the if it had been a hallucination he to give artoo the satisfaction of knowing how badly recent events had unsettledhis logic circuits

 the most fascinating woman in petersburg 
 to each new arrival anna pavlovna said you have not yet seen my aunt or you do not know my aunt and very gravely conducted him or her to a little old lady wearing large bows of ribbon in her cap who had come sailing in from another room as soon as the guests began to arrive and slowly turning her eyes from the visitor to her aunt anna pavlovna mentioned each name and then left them 
 each visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom not one of them knew not one of them wanted to know and not one of them cared about anna pavlovna observed these greetings with mournful and solemn interest and silent approval the aunt spoke to each of them in the same words about their health and her own and the health of her majesty who thank god was better today and each visitor though politeness prevented his showing impatience left the old woman with a sense of relief at having performed a vexatious duty and did not return to her the whole evening 
 the young princess bolkonskaya had brought some work in a velvet bag her pretty little upper lip on which a delicate dark down was just perceptible was too short for her teeth but it lifted all the more sweetly and was especially charming when she occasionally drew it down to meet the lower lip as is always the case with a thoroughly attractive woman her defect the shortness of her upper lip and her mouth seemed to be her own special and peculiar form of beauty everyone brightened at the sight of this pretty young woman so soon to become a mother so full of life and health and carrying her burden so lightly old men and dull dispirited young ones who looked at her after being in her company and talking to her a little while felt as if they too were becoming like her full of life and health all who talked to her and at each word saw her bright smile and the constant gleam of her white teeth thought that they were in a specially amiable mood that day 
 the little princess went round the table with quick short swaying steps her workbag on her arm and gaily spreading out her dress sat down on a sofa near the silver samovar as if all she was doing was a pleasure to herself and to all around her i have brought my work said she in french displaying her bag and addressing all present mind annette i hope you have not played a wicked trick on me she added turning to her hostess you wrote that it was to be quite a small reception and just see how badly i am dressed and she spread out her arms to show her dainty gray dress girdled with a broad ribbon just below the breast 
 soyez tranquille lise you will always be prettier than anyone else replied anna pavlovna 
 you know said the princess in the same tone of voice and still in french turning to a general my husband is deserting me he is going to get himself killed tell me what this wretched war is for she added addressing prince vasili and without waiting for an answer she turned to speak to his daughter the beautiful helene 
 what a delightful woman this little princess is said prince vasili to anna pavlovna 
 one of the next arrivals was a stout heavily built young man with hair spectacles the breeches fashionable 
 at that time a very high ruffle and a brown dress coat this stout young man was an illegitimate son of count bezukhov a grandee of time who now lay dying in moscow the young man had not yet entered either the military or civil service as he had only just returned from abroad where he had been educated and this was his first appearance in society anna pavlovna greeted him with the nod she accorded to the lowest hierarchy in her drawing room but in spite of this greeting a look of anxiety and fear as at the sight of something too large and unsuited to the place came over her face when she saw pierre enter though he was certainly rather bigger than the other men in the room her anxiety could only have reference to the clever though shy but observant and natural expression which distinguished him from everyone else in that drawing room 
 it is very good of you monsieur pierre to come and visit a poor invalid said anna pavlovna exchanging an alarmed glance with her aunt as she conducted him to her 
 pierre murmured something unintelligible and continued to look round as if in search of something on his way to the aunt he bowed to the little princess with a pleased smile as to an intimate acquaintance 
 anna alarm was justified for pierre turned away from the aunt without waiting to hear her speech about her health anna pavlovna in dismay detained him with the words do you know the abbe morio he is a most interesting man 
 yes i have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace and it is very interesting but hardly feasible 
 you think so rejoined anna pavlovna in order to say something and get away to attend to her duties as hostess but pierre now committed a reverse act of impoliteness first he had left a lady before she had finished speaking to him and now he continued to speak to another who wished to get away with his head bent and his big feet spread apart he began explaining his reasons for thinking the plan chimerical 
 we will talk of it later said anna pavlovna with a smile 
 and having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave she resumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch ready to help at any point where the conversation might happen to flag as the foreman of a spinning mill when he has set the hands to work goes round and notices here a spindle that has stopped or there one that creaks or makes more noise than it should and hastens to check the machine or set it in proper motion so anna pavlovna moved about her drawing room approaching now a silent now a group and by a word or slight rearrangement kept the conversational machine in steady proper and regular motion but amid these cares her anxiety about pierre was evident she kept an anxious watch on him when he approached the group round mortemart to listen to what was being said there and again when he passed to another group whose center was the abbe 
 pierre had been educated abroad and this reception at anna was the first he had attended in russia he knew that all the intellectual lights of petersburg were gathered there and like a child in a toyshop did not know which way to look afraid of missing any clever conversation that was to be heard seeing the and refined expression on the faces of those present he was always expecting to hear something very profound at last he came up to morio here the conversation seemed interesting and he stood waiting for an opportunity to express his own views as young people are fond of doing

 chapter 
 
 yesterday afternoon set in misty and cold i had half a mind to spend it by my study fire instead of wading through heath and mud to wuthering heights on coming up from dinner however i dine between twelve and one the housekeeper a matronly lady taken as a fixture along with the house could not or would not comprehend my request that i might be served at five on mounting the stairs with this lazy intention and stepping into the room i saw a servant girl on her knees surrounded by brushes and and raising an infernal dust as she extinguished the flames with heaps of cinders this spectacle drove me back immediately i took my hat and after a walk arrived at garden gate just in time to escape the first feathery flakes of a snow shower 
 on that bleak hill top the earth was hard with a black frost and the air made me shiver through every limb being unable to remove the chain i jumped over and running up the flagged causeway bordered with straggling gooseberry bushes knocked vainly for admittance till my knuckles tingled and the dogs howled 
 wretched inmates i ejaculated mentally you deserve perpetual isolation from your species for your churlish inhospitality at least i would not keep my doors barred in the day time i will get in so resolved i grasped the latch and shook it vehemently joseph projected his head from a round window of the barn 
 whet are ye for he shouted t dahn i t fowld go rahnd by th end ut laith if yah went tuh spake tull him 
 is there nobody inside to open the door i hallooed responsively 
 nobbut t missis and nut an ye mak yer flaysome dins till neeght 
 why cannot you tell her who i am eh joseph 
 me hae noa hend muttered the head vanishing 
 the snow began to drive thickly i seized the handle to essay another trial when a young man without coat and shouldering a pitchfork appeared in the yard behind he hailed me to follow him and after marching through a and a paved area containing a coal shed pump and pigeon cot we at length arrived in the huge warm cheerful apartment where i was formerly received it glowed delightfully in the radiance of an immense fire compounded of coal peat and wood and near the table laid for a plentiful evening meal i was pleased to observe the missis an individual whose existence i had never previously suspected i bowed and waited thinking she would bid me take a seat she looked at me leaning back in her chair and remained motionless and mute 
 rough weather i remarked afraid mrs heathcliff the door must bear the consequence of your servants leisure attendance i had hard work to make them hear me 
 she never opened her mouth i stared also at any rate she kept her eyes on me in a cool regardless manner exceedingly embarrassing and disagreeable 
 sit down said the young man gruffly be in soon 
 i obeyed and hemmed and called the villain juno who deigned at this second interview to move the extreme tip of her tail in token of owning my acquaintance 
 a beautiful animal i commenced again do you intend parting with the little ones madam 
 they are not mine said the amiable hostess more repellingly than heathcliff himself could have replied 
 ah your favourites are among these i continued turning to an obscure cushion full of something like cats 
 a strange choice of favourites she observed scornfully 
 unluckily it was a heap of dead rabbits i hemmed once more and drew closer to the hearth repeating my comment on the wildness of the evening 
 you should not have come out she said rising and reaching from the two of the painted canisters 
 her position before was sheltered from the light now i had a distinct view of her whole figure and countenance she was slender and apparently scarcely past girlhood an admirable form and the most exquisite little face that i have ever had the pleasure of beholding small features very fair flaxen ringlets or rather golden hanging loose on her delicate neck and eyes had they been agreeable in expression they would have been irresistible fortunately for my susceptible heart the only sentiment they evinced hovered between scorn and a kind of desperation singularly unnatural to be detected there the canisters were almost out of her reach i made a motion to aid her she turned upon me as a miser might turn if anyone attempted to assist him in counting his gold 
 i want your help she snapped i can get them for myself 
 i beg your pardon i hastened to reply 
 were you asked to tea she demanded tying an apron over her neat black frock and standing with a spoonful of the leaf poised over the pot 
 i shall be glad to have a cup i answered 
 were you asked she repeated 
 no i said half smiling you are the proper person to ask me 
 she flung the tea back spoon and all and resumed her chair in a pet her forehead corrugated and her red under lip pushed out like a ready to cry 
 meanwhile the young man had slung on to his person a decidedly shabby upper garment and erecting himself before the blaze looked down on me from the corner of his eyes for all the world as if there were some mortal feud unavenged between us i began to doubt whether he were a servant or not his dress and speech were both rude entirely devoid of the superiority observable in mr and mrs heathcliff his thick brown curls were rough and uncultivated his whiskers encroached bearishly over his cheeks and his hands were embrowned like those of a common labourer still his bearing was free almost haughty and he showed none of a assiduity in attending on the lady of the house in the absence of clear proofs of his condition i deemed it best to abstain from noticing his curious conduct and five minutes afterwards the entrance of heathcliff relieved me in some measure from my uncomfortable state 
 you see sir i am come according to promise i exclaimed assuming the cheerful and i fear i shall be weatherbound for half an hour if you can afford me shelter during that space 
 half an hour he said shaking the white flakes from his clothes i wonder you should select the thick of a snowstorm to ramble about in do you know that you run a risk of being lost in the marshes people familiar with these moors often miss their road on such evenings and i can tell you there is no chance of a change at present 
 perhaps i can get a guide among your lads and he might stay at the grange till you spare me one 
 no i could not 
 oh indeed well then i must trust to my own sagacity 
 umph 
 are you going to mak th tea demanded he of the shabby coat shifting his ferocious gaze from me to the young lady 
 is he to have any she asked appealing to heathcliff 
 get it ready will you was the answer uttered so savagely that i started the tone in which the words were said revealed a genuine bad nature i no longer felt inclined to call heathcliff a capital fellow when the preparations were finished he invited me sir bring forward your chair and we all including the rustic youth drew round the table an austere silence prevailing while we discussed our meal 
 i thought if i had caused the cloud it was my duty to make an effort to dispel it they could not every day sit so grim and taciturn and it was impossible however they might be that the universal scowl they wore was their everyday countenance 
 it is strange i began in the interval of swallowing one cup of tea and receiving is strange how custom can mould our tastes and ideas many could not imagine the existence of happiness in a life of such complete exile from the world as you spend mr heathcliff yet venture to say that surrounded by your family and with your amiable lady as the presiding genius over your home and heart 
 my amiable lady he interrupted with an almost diabolical sneer on his face where is amiable lady 
 mrs heathcliff your wife i mean 
 well you would intimate that her spirit has taken the post of ministering angel and guards the fortunes of wuthering heights even when her body is gone is that it 
 perceiving myself in a blunder i attempted to correct it i might have seen there was too great a disparity between the ages of the parties to make it likely that they were man and wife one was about forty a period of mental vigour at which men seldom cherish the delusion of being married for love by girls that dream is reserved for the solace of our declining years the other did not look seventeen 
 then it flashed upon clown at my elbow who is drinking his tea out of a basin and eating his bread with unwashed hands may be her husband heathcliff junior of course here is the consequence of being buried alive she has thrown herself away upon that boor from sheer ignorance that better individuals existed a sad must beware how i cause her to regret her choice the last reflection may seem conceited it was not my neighbour struck me as bordering on repulsive i knew through experience that i was tolerably attractive 
 mrs heathcliff is my said heathcliff corroborating my surmise he turned as he spoke a peculiar look in her direction a look of hatred unless he has a most perverse set of facial muscles that will not like those of other people interpret the language of his soul 
 ah see now you are the favoured possessor of the beneficent fairy i remarked turning to my neighbour 
 this was worse than before the youth grew crimson and clenched his fist with every appearance of a meditated assault but he seemed to recollect himself presently and smothered the storm in a brutal curse muttered on my behalf which however i took care not to notice 
 unhappy in your conjectures sir observed my host we neither of us have the privilege of owning your good fairy her mate is dead i said she was my therefore she must have married my son 
 and this young man is 
 not my son assuredly 
 heathcliff smiled again as if it were rather too bold a jest to attribute the paternity of that bear to him 
 my name is hareton earnshaw growled the other and counsel you to respect it 
 shown no disrespect was my reply laughing internally at the dignity with which he announced himself 
 he fixed his eye on me longer than i cared to return the stare for fear i might be tempted either to box his ears or render my hilarity audible i began to feel unmistakably out of place in that pleasant family circle the dismal spiritual atmosphere overcame and more than neutralized the glowing physical comforts round me and i resolved to be cautious how i ventured under those rafters a third time 
 the business of eating being concluded and no one uttering a word of sociable conversation i approached a window to examine the weather a sorrowful sight i saw dark night coming down prematurely and sky and hills mingled in one bitter whirl of wind and suffocating snow 
 i think it possible for me to get home now without a guide i could not help exclaiming the roads will be buried already and if they were bare i could scarcely distinguish a foot in advance 
 hareton drive those dozen sheep into the barn porch be covered if left in the fold all night and put a plank before them said heathcliff 
 how must i do i continued with rising irritation 
 there was no reply to my question and on looking round i saw only joseph bringing in a pail of porridge for the dogs and mrs heathcliff leaning over the fire diverting herself with burning a bundle of matches which had fallen from the as she restored the tea canister to its place the former when he had deposited his burden took a critical survey of the room and in cracked tones grated out 
 aw woonder hagh yah can faishion tuh stand thear i idleness un war when all on goan aght bud a nowt and noa use talking niver mend uh yer ill ways bud goa raight tuh t divil like yer mother afore ye 
 i imagined for a moment that this piece of eloquence was addressed to me and sufficiently enraged stepped towards the aged rascal with an intention of kicking him out of the door mrs heathcliff however checked me by her answer 
 you scandalous old hypocrite she replied are you not afraid of being carried away bodily whenever you mention the name i warn you to refrain from provoking me or ask your abduction as a special favour stop look here joseph she continued taking a long dark book from a shelf show you how far progressed in the black art i shall soon be competent to make a clear house of it the red cow die by chance and your rheumatism can hardly be reckoned among providential visitations 
 oh wicked wicked gasped the elder may the lord deliver us from evil 
 no reprobate you are a off or hurt you seriously have you all modelled in wax and clay and the first who passes the limits i fix not say what he shall be done see go looking at you 
 the little witch put a mock malignity into her beautiful eyes and joseph trembling with sincere horror hurried out praying and ejaculating wicked as he went i thought her conduct must be prompted by a species of dreary fun and now that we were alone i endeavoured to interest her in my distress 
 mrs heathcliff i said earnestly you must excuse me for troubling you i presume because with that face sure you cannot help being do point out some landmarks by which i may know my way home i have no more idea how to get there than you would have how to get to london 
 take the road you came she answered ensconcing herself in a chair with a candle and the long book open before her it is brief advice but as sound as i can give 
 then if you hear of me being discovered dead in a bog or a pit full of snow your conscience whisper that it is partly your fault 
 how so i cannot escort you they let me go to the end of the garden wall 
 you i should be sorry to ask you to cross the threshold for my convenience on such a night i cried i want you to tell me my way net to show it or else to persuade mr heathcliff to give me a guide 
 who there is himself earnshaw zillah joseph and i which would you have 
 are there no boys at the farm 
 no those are all 
 then it follows that i am compelled to stay 
 that you may settle with your host i have nothing to do with it 
 i hope it will be a lesson to you to make no more rash journeys on these hills cried stern voice from the kitchen entrance as to staying here i keep accommodations for visitors you must share a bed with hareton or joseph if you do 
 i can sleep on a chair in this room i replied 
 no no a stranger is a stranger be he rich or poor it will not suit me to permit anyone the range of the place while i am off guard said the unmannerly wretch 
 with this insult my patience was at an end i uttered an expression of disgust and pushed past him into the yard running against earnshaw in my haste it was so dark that i could not see the means of exit and as i wandered round i heard another specimen of their civil behaviour amongst each other at first the young man appeared about to befriend me 
 go with him as far as the park he said 
 go with him to hell exclaimed his master or whatever relation he bore and who is to look after the horses eh 
 a life is of more consequence than one neglect of the horses somebody must go murmured mrs heathcliff more kindly than i expected 
 not at your command retorted hareton if you set store on him better be quiet 
 then i hope his ghost will haunt you and i hope mr heathcliff will never get another tenant till the grange is a ruin she answered sharply 
 hearken hearken cursing on em muttered joseph towards whom i had been steering 
 he sat within earshot milking the cows by the light of a lantern which i seized unceremoniously and calling out that i would send it back on the morrow rushed to the nearest postern 
 maister maister stealing t lantern shouted the ancient pursuing my retreat hey gnasher hey dog hey wolf holld him holld him 
 on opening the little door two hairy monsters flew at my throat bearing me down and extinguishing the light while a mingled guffaw from heathcliff and hareton put the copestone on my rage and humiliation fortunately the beasts seemed more bent on stretching their paws and yawning and flourishing their tails than devouring me alive but they would suffer no resurrection and i was forced to lie till their malignant master pleased to deliver me then hatless and trembling with wrath i ordered the miscreants to let me their peril to keep me one minute several incoherent threats of retaliation that in their indefinite depth of virulency smacked of king lear 
 the vehemence of my agitation brought on a copious bleeding at the nose and still heathcliff laughed and still i scolded i know what would have concluded the scene had there not been one person at hand rather more rational than myself and more benevolent than my entertainer this was zillah the stout housewife who at length issued forth to inquire into the nature of the uproar she thought that some of them had been laying violent hands on me and not daring to attack her master she turned her vocal artillery against the young scoundrel 
 well mr earnshaw she cried i wonder what have agait next are we going to murder folk on our very doorstones i see this house will never do for at t poor lad fair choking wisht wisht you go on so come in and cure that there now hold ye still 
 with these words she suddenly splashed a pint of icy water down my neck and pulled me into the kitchen mr heathcliff followed his accidental merriment expiring quickly in his habitual moroseness 
 i was sick exceedingly and dizzy and faint and thus compelled perforce to accept lodgings under his roof he told zillah to give me a glass of brandy and then passed on to the inner room while she condoled with me on my sorry predicament and having obeyed his orders whereby i was somewhat revived ushered me to bed

 are you going to mak th tea demanded he of the shabby coat shifting his ferocious gaze from me to the young lady 
 is he to have any she asked appealing to heathcliff 
 get it ready will you was the answer uttered so savagely that i started the tone in which the words were said revealed a genuine bad nature i no longer felt inclined to call heathcliff a capital fellow when the preparations were finished he invited me sir bring forward your chair and we all including the rustic youth drew round the table an austere silence prevailing while we discussed our meal 
 i thought if i had caused the cloud it was my duty to make an effort to dispel it they could not every day sit so grim and taciturn and it was impossible however they might be that the universal scowl they wore was their everyday countenance 
 it is strange i began in the interval of swallowing one cup of tea and receiving is strange how custom can mould our tastes and ideas many could not imagine the existence of happiness in a life of such complete exile from the world as you spend mr heathcliff yet venture to say that surrounded by your family and with your amiable lady as the presiding genius over your home and heart 
 my amiable lady he interrupted with an almost diabolical sneer on his face where is amiable lady 
 mrs heathcliff your wife i mean 
 well you would intimate that her spirit has taken the post of ministering angel and guards the fortunes of wuthering heights even when her body is gone is that it 
 perceiving myself in a blunder i attempted to correct it i might have seen there was too great a disparity between the ages of the parties to make it likely that they were man and wife one was about forty a period of mental vigour at which men seldom cherish the delusion of being married for love by girls that dream is reserved for the solace of our declining years the other did not look seventeen 
 then it flashed upon clown at my elbow who is drinking his tea out of a basin and eating his bread with unwashed hands may be her husband heathcliff junior of course here is the consequence of being buried alive she has thrown herself away upon that boor from sheer ignorance that better individuals existed a sad must beware how i cause her to regret her choice the last reflection may seem conceited it was not my neighbour struck me as bordering on repulsive i knew through experience that i was tolerably attractive 
 mrs heathcliff is my said heathcliff corroborating my surmise he turned as he spoke a peculiar look in her direction a look of hatred unless he has a most perverse set of facial muscles that will not like those of other people interpret the language of his soul 
 ah see now you are the favoured possessor of the beneficent fairy i remarked turning to my neighbour 
 this was worse than before the youth grew crimson and clenched his fist with every appearance of a meditated assault but he seemed to recollect himself presently and smothered the storm in a brutal curse muttered on my behalf which however i took care not to notice 
 unhappy in your conjectures sir observed my host we neither of us have the privilege of owning your good fairy her mate is dead i said she was my therefore she must have married my son 
 and this young man is 
 not my son assuredly 
 heathcliff smiled again as if it were rather too bold a jest to attribute the paternity of that bear to him 
 my name is hareton earnshaw growled the other and counsel you to respect it 
 shown no disrespect was my reply laughing internally at the dignity with which he announced himself 
 he fixed his eye on me longer than i cared to return the stare for fear i might be tempted either to box his ears or render my hilarity audible i began to feel unmistakably out of place in that pleasant family circle the dismal spiritual atmosphere overcame and more than neutralized the glowing physical comforts round me and i resolved to be cautious how i ventured under those rafters a third time 
 the business of eating being concluded and no one uttering a word of sociable conversation i approached a window to examine the weather a sorrowful sight i saw dark night coming down prematurely and sky and hills mingled in one bitter whirl of wind and suffocating snow 
 i think it possible for me to get home now without a guide i could not help exclaiming the roads will be buried already and if they were bare i could scarcely distinguish a foot in advance 
 hareton drive those dozen sheep into the barn porch be covered if left in the fold all night and put a plank before them said heathcliff 
 how must i do i continued with rising irritation 
 there was no reply to my question and on looking round i saw only joseph bringing in a pail of porridge for the dogs and mrs heathcliff leaning over the fire diverting herself with burning a bundle of matches which had fallen from the as she restored the tea canister to its place the former when he had deposited his burden took a critical survey of the room and in cracked tones grated out 
 aw woonder hagh yah can faishion tuh stand thear i idleness un war when all on goan aght bud a nowt and noa use talking niver mend uh yer ill ways bud goa raight tuh t divil like yer mother afore ye 
 i imagined for a moment that this piece of eloquence was addressed to me and sufficiently enraged stepped towards the aged rascal with an intention of kicking him out of the door mrs heathcliff however checked me by her answer 
 you scandalous old hypocrite she replied are you not afraid of being carried away bodily whenever you mention the name i warn you to refrain from provoking me or ask your abduction as a special favour stop look here joseph she continued taking a long dark book from a shelf show you how far progressed in the black art i shall soon be competent to make a clear house of it the red cow die by chance and your rheumatism can hardly be reckoned among providential visitations 
 oh wicked wicked gasped the elder may the lord deliver us from evil 
 no reprobate you are a off or hurt you seriously have you all modelled in wax and clay and the first who passes the limits i fix not say what he shall be done see go looking at you 
 the little witch put a mock malignity into her beautiful eyes and joseph trembling with sincere horror hurried out praying and ejaculating wicked as he went i thought her conduct must be prompted by a species of dreary fun and now that we were alone i endeavoured to interest her in my distress 
 mrs heathcliff i said earnestly you must excuse me for troubling you i presume because with that face sure you cannot help being do point out some landmarks by which i may know my way home i have no more idea how to get there than you would have how to get to london 
 take the road you came she answered ensconcing herself in a chair with a candle and the long book open before her it is brief advice but as sound as i can give 
 then if you hear of me being discovered dead in a bog or a pit full of snow your conscience whisper that it is partly your fault 
 how so i cannot escort you they let me go to the end of the garden wall 
 you i should be sorry to ask you to cross the threshold for my convenience on such a night i cried i want you to tell me my way net to show it or else to persuade mr heathcliff to give me a guide 
 who there is himself earnshaw zillah joseph and i which would you have 
 are there no boys at the farm 
 no those are all 
 then it follows that i am compelled to stay 
 that you may settle with your host i have nothing to do with it 
 i hope it will be a lesson to you to make no more rash journeys on these hills cried stern voice from the kitchen entrance as to staying here i keep accommodations for visitors you must share a bed with hareton or joseph if you do 
 i can sleep on a chair in this room i replied 
 no no a stranger is a stranger be he rich or poor it will not suit me to permit anyone the range of the place while i am off guard said the unmannerly wretch 
 with this insult my patience was at an end i uttered an expression of disgust and pushed past him into the yard running against earnshaw in my haste it was so dark that i could not see the means of exit and as i wandered round i heard another specimen of their civil behaviour amongst each other at first the young man appeared about to befriend me 
 go with him as far as the park he said 
 go with him to hell exclaimed his master or whatever relation he bore and who is to look after the horses eh 
 a life is of more consequence than one neglect of the horses somebody must go murmured mrs heathcliff more kindly than i expected 
 not at your command retorted hareton if you set store on him better be quiet 
 then i hope his ghost will haunt you and i hope mr heathcliff will never get another tenant till the grange is a ruin she answered sharply 
 hearken hearken cursing on em muttered joseph towards whom i had been steering 
 he sat within earshot milking the cows by the light of a lantern which i seized unceremoniously and calling out that i would send it back on the morrow rushed to the nearest postern 
 maister maister stealing t lantern shouted the ancient pursuing my retreat hey gnasher hey dog hey wolf holld him holld him 
 on opening the little door two hairy monsters flew at my throat bearing me down and extinguishing the light while a mingled guffaw from heathcliff and hareton put the copestone on my rage and humiliation fortunately the beasts seemed more bent on stretching their paws and yawning and flourishing their tails than devouring me alive but they would suffer no resurrection and i was forced to lie till their malignant master pleased to deliver me then hatless and trembling with wrath i ordered the miscreants to let me their peril to keep me one minute several incoherent threats of retaliation that in their indefinite depth of virulency smacked of king lear 
 the vehemence of my agitation brought on a copious bleeding at the nose and still heathcliff laughed and still i scolded i know what would have concluded the scene had there not been one person at hand rather more rational than myself and more benevolent than my entertainer this was zillah the stout housewife who at length issued forth to inquire into the nature of the uproar she thought that some of them had been laying violent hands on me and not daring to attack her master she turned her vocal artillery against the young scoundrel 
 well mr earnshaw she cried i wonder what have agait next are we going to murder folk on our very doorstones i see this house will never do for at t poor lad fair choking wisht wisht you go on so come in and cure that there now hold ye still 
 with these words she suddenly splashed a pint of icy water down my neck and pulled me into the kitchen mr heathcliff followed his accidental merriment expiring quickly in his habitual moroseness 
 i was sick exceedingly and dizzy and faint and thus compelled perforce to accept lodgings under his roof he told zillah to give me a glass of brandy and then passed on to the inner room while she condoled with me on my sorry predicament and having obeyed his orders whereby i was somewhat revived ushered me to bed

 chapter two 
 
 jo was the first to wake in the gray dawn of christmas morning no stockings hung at the fireplace and for a moment she felt as much disappointed as she did long ago when her little sock fell down because it was crammed so full of goodies then she remembered her promise and slipping her hand under her pillow drew out a little book she knew it very well for it was that beautiful old story of the best life ever lived and jo felt that it was a true guidebook for any pilgrim going on a long journey she woke meg with a merry christmas and bade her see what was under her pillow a green covered book appeared with the same picture inside and a few words written by their mother which made their one present very precious in their eyes presently beth and amy woke to rummage and find their little books also one the other blue and all sat looking at and talking about them while the east grew rosy with the coming day 
 in spite of her small vanities margaret had a sweet and pious nature which unconsciously influenced her sisters especially jo who loved her very tenderly and obeyed her because her advice was so gently given 
 girls said meg seriously looking from the tumbled head beside her to the two little ones in the room beyond mother wants us to read and love and mind these books and we must begin at once we used to be faithful about it but since father went away and all this war trouble unsettled us we have neglected many things you can do as you please but i shall keep my book on the table here and read a little every morning as soon as i wake for i know it will do me good and help me through the day 
 then she opened her new book and began to read jo put her arm round her and leaning cheek to cheek read also with the quiet expression so seldom seen on her restless face 
 how good meg is come amy do as they do help you with the hard words and they explain things if we understand whispered beth very much impressed by the pretty books and her sisters example 
 glad mine is blue said amy and then the rooms were very still while the pages were softly turned and the winter sunshine crept in to touch the bright heads and serious faces with a christmas greeting 
 where is mother asked meg as she and jo ran down to thank her for their gifts half an hour later 
 goodness only knows some poor creeter came and your ma went straight off to see what was needed there never was such a woman for givin away vittles and drink clothes and firin replied hannah who had lived with the family since meg was born and was considered by them all more as a friend than a servant 
 she will be back soon i think so fry your cakes and have everything ready said meg looking over the presents which were collected in a basket and kept under the sofa ready to be produced at the proper time why where is bottle of cologne she added as the little flask did not appear 
 she took it out a minute ago and went off with it to put a ribbon on it or some such notion replied jo dancing about the room to take the first stiffness off the new army slippers 
 how nice my handkerchiefs look they hannah washed and ironed them for me and i marked them all myself said beth looking proudly at the somewhat uneven letters which had cost her such labor 
 bless the child gone and put mother on them instead of m march how funny cried jo taking one up 
 that right i thought it was better to do it so because initials are and i want anyone to use these but marmee said beth looking troubled 
 all right dear and a very pretty idea quite sensible too for no one can ever mistake now it will please her very much i know said meg with a frown for jo and a smile for beth 
 mother hide the basket quick cried jo as a door slammed and steps sounded in the hall 
 amy came in hastily and looked rather abashed when she saw her sisters all waiting for her 
 where have you been and what are you hiding behind you asked meg surprised to see by her hood and cloak that lazy amy had been out so early 
 laugh at me jo i mean anyone should know till the time came i only meant to change the little bottle for a big one and i gave all my money to get it and truly trying not to be selfish any more 
 as she spoke amy showed the handsome flask which replaced the cheap one and looked so earnest and humble in her little effort to forget herself that meg hugged her on the spot and jo pronounced her a trump while beth ran to the window and picked her finest rose to ornament the stately bottle 
 you see i felt ashamed of my present after reading and talking about being good this morning so i ran round the corner and changed it the minute i was up and so glad for mine is the handsomest now 
 another bang of the street door sent the basket under the sofa and the girls to the table eager for breakfast 
 merry christmas marmee many of them thank you for our books we read some and mean to every day they all cried in chorus merry christmas little daughters glad you began at once and hope you will keep on but i want to say one word before we sit down not far away from here lies a poor woman with a little newborn baby six children are huddled into one bed to keep from freezing for they have no fire there is nothing to eat over there and the oldest boy came to tell me they were suffering hunger and cold my girls will you give them your breakfast as a christmas present 
 they were all unusually hungry having waited nearly an hour and for a minute no one spoke only a minute for jo exclaimed impetuously so glad you came before we began 
 may i go and help carry the things to the poor little children asked beth eagerly 
 i shall take the cream and the muffings added amy heroically giving up the article she most liked 
 meg was already covering the buckwheats and piling the bread into one big plate 
 i thought do it said mrs march smiling as if satisfied you shall all go and help me and when we come back we will have bread and milk for breakfast and make it up at dinnertime 
 they were soon ready and the procession set out fortunately it was early and they went through back streets so few people saw them and no one laughed at the queer party 
 a poor bare miserable room it was with broken windows no fire ragged bedclothes a sick mother wailing baby and a group of pale hungry children cuddled under one old quilt trying to keep warm 
 how the big eyes stared and the blue lips smiled as the girls went in 
 ach mein gott it is good angels come to us said the poor woman crying for joy 
 funny angels in hoods and mittens said jo and set them to laughing 
 in a few minutes it really did seem as if kind spirits had been at work there hannah who had carried wood made a fire and stopped up the broken panes with old hats and her own cloak mrs march gave the mother tea and gruel and comforted her with promises of help while she dressed the little baby as tenderly as if it had been her own the girls meantime spread the table set the children round the fire and fed them like so many hungry birds laughing talking and trying to understand the funny broken english 
 das ist gut die cried the poor things as they ate and warmed their purple hands at the comfortable blaze the girls had never been called angel children before and thought it very agreeable especially jo who had been considered a sancho ever since she was born that was a very happy breakfast though they get any of it and when they went away leaving comfort behind i think there were not in all the city four merrier people than the hungry little girls who gave away their breakfasts and contented themselves with bread and milk on christmas morning 
 loving our neighbor better than ourselves and i like it said meg as they set out their presents while their mother was upstairs collecting clothes for the poor hummels 
 not a very splendid show but there was a great deal of love done up in the few little bundles and the tall vase of red roses white chrysanthemums and trailing vines which stood in the middle gave quite an elegant air to the table 
 coming strike up beth open the door amy three cheers for marmee cried jo prancing about while meg went to conduct mother to the seat of honor 
 beth played her gayest march amy threw open the door and meg enacted escort with great dignity mrs march was both surprised and touched and smiled with her eyes full as she examined her presents and read the little notes which accompanied them the slippers went on at once a new handkerchief was slipped into her pocket well scented with cologne the rose was fastened in her bosom and the nice gloves were pronounced a perfect fit 
 there was a good deal of laughing and kissing and explaining in the simple loving fashion which makes these home festivals so pleasant at the time so sweet to remember long afterward and then all fell to work 
 the morning charities and ceremonies took so much time that the rest of the day was devoted to preparations for the evening festivities being still too young to go often to the theater and not rich enough to afford any great outlay for private performances the girls put their wits to work and necessity being the mother of invention made whatever they needed very clever were some of their productions pasteboard guitars antique lamps made of butter boats covered with silver paper gorgeous robes of old cotton glittering with tin spangles from a pickle factory and armor covered with the same useful diamond shaped bits left inn sheets when the lids of preserve pots were cut out the big chamber was the scene of many innocent revels 
 no gentleman were admitted so jo played male parts to her content and took immense satisfaction in a pair of russet leather boots given her by a friend who knew a lady who knew an actor these boots an old foil and a slashed doublet once used by an artist for some picture were chief treasures and appeared on all occasions the smallness of the company made it necessary for the two principal actors to take several parts apiece and they certainly deserved some credit for the hard work they did in learning three or four different parts whisking in and out of various costumes and managing the stage besides it was excellent drill for their memories a harmless amusement and employed many hours which otherwise would have been idle lonely or spent in less profitable society 
 on christmas night a dozen girls piled onto the bed which was the dress circle and sat before the blue and yellow chintz curtains in a most flattering state of expectancy there was a good deal of rustling and whispering behind the curtain a trifle of lamp smoke and an occasional giggle from amy who was apt to get hysterical in the excitement of the moment presently a bell sounded the curtains flew apart and the operatic tragedy began 
 a gloomy wood according to the one playbill was represented by a few shrubs in pots green baize on the floor and a cave in the distance this cave was made with a clothes horse for a roof bureaus for walls and in it was a small furnace in full blast with a black pot on it and an old witch bending over it the stage was dark and the glow of the furnace had a fine effect especially as real steam issued from the kettle when the witch took off the cover a moment was allowed for the first thrill to subside then hugo the villain stalked in with a clanking sword at his side a slouching hat black beard mysterious cloak and the boots after pacing to and fro in much agitation he struck his forehead and burst out in a wild strain singing of his hatred to roderigo his love for zara and his pleasing resolution to kill the one and win the other the gruff tones of voice with an occasional shout when his feelings overcame him were very impressive and the audience applauded the moment he paused for breath bowing with the air of one accustomed to public praise he stole to the cavern and ordered hagar to come forth with a commanding what ho minion i need thee 
 out came meg with gray horsehair hanging about her face a red and black robe a staff and cabalistic signs upon her cloak hugo demanded a potion to make zara adore him and one destroy roderigo hagar in a fine dramatic melody promised both and proceeded to call up the spirit who would bring the love philter 
 hither hither from thy home 
 airy sprite i bid thee come 
 born of roses fed on dew 
 charms and potions canst thou brew 
 bring me here with elfin speed 
 the fragrant philter which i need 
 make it sweet and swift and strong 
 spirit answer now my song 
 a soft strain of music sounded and then at the back of the cave appeared a little figure in cloudy white with glittering wings golden hair and a garland of roses on its head waving a wand it sang 
 hither i come 
 from my airy home 
 afar in the silver moon 
 take the magic spell 
 and use it well 
 or its power will vanish soon 
 and dropping a small gilded bottle at the feet the spirit vanished another chant from hagar produced another apparition not a lovely one for with a bang an ugly black imp appeared and having croaked a reply tossed a dark bottle at hugo and disappeared with a mocking laugh having warbled his thanks and put the potions in his boots hugo departed and hagar informed the audience that as he had killed a few of her friends in times past she had cursed him and intends to thwart his plans and be revenged on him then the curtain fell and the audience reposed and ate candy while discussing the merits of the play 
 a good deal of hammering went on before the curtain rose again but when it became evident what a masterpiece of stage carpentery had been got up no one murmured at the delay it was truly superb a tower rose to the ceiling halfway up appeared a window with a lamp burning in it and behind the white curtain appeared zara in a lovely blue and silver dress waiting for roderigo he came in gorgeous array with plumed cap red cloak chestnut lovelocks a guitar and the boots of course kneeling at the foot of the tower he sang a serenade in melting tones zara replied and after a musical dialogue consented to fly then came the grand effect of the play roderigo produced a rope ladder with five steps to it threw up one end and invited zara to descend timidly she crept from her lattice put her hand on shoulder and was about to leap gracfully down when alas alas for zara she forgot her train it caught in the window the tower tottered leaned forward fell with a crash and buried the unhappy lovers in the ruins 
 a universal shriek arose as the russet boots waved wildly from the wreck and a golden head emerged exclaiming i told you so i told you so with wonderful presence of mind don pedro the cruel sire rushed in dragged out his daughter with a hasty aside 
 laugh act as if it was all right and ordering roderigo up banished him form the kingdom with wrath and scorn though decidedly shaken by the fall from the tower upon him roderigo defied the old gentleman and refused to stir this dauntless example fired zara she also defied her sire and he ordered them both to the deepest dungeons of the castle a stout little retainer came in with chains and led them away looking very much frightened and evidently forgetting the speech he ought to have made 
 act third was the castle hall and here hagar appeared having come to free the lovers and finish hugo she hears him coming and hides sees him put the potions into two cups of wine and bid the the timid little servant bear them to the captives in their cells and tell them i shall come anon the servant takes hugo aside to tell him something and hagar changes the cups for two others which are harmless ferdinando the minion carries them away and hagar puts back the cup which holds the poison meant for roderigo hugo getting thirsty after a long warble drinks it loses his wits and after a good deal of clutching and stamping falls flat and dies while hagar informs him what she has done in a song of exquisite power and melody 
 this was a truly thrilling scene though some persons might have thought that the sudden tumbling down of a quantity of long red hair rather marred the effect of the death he was called before the curtain and with great propriety appeared leading hagar whose singing was considered more wonderful than all the rest of the performance put together 
 act fourth displayed the despairing roderigo on the point of stabbing himself because he has been told that zara has deserted him just as the dagger is at his heart a lovely song is sung under his window informing him that zara is true but in danger and he can save her if he will a key is thrown in which unlocks the door and in a spasm of rapture he tears off his chains and rushes away to find and rescue his lady love 
 act fifth opened with a stormy scene between zara and don pedro he wishes her to go into a convent but she hear of it and after a touching appeal is about to faint when roderigo dashes in and demands her hand don pedro refuses because he is not rich they shout and gesticulate tremendously but cannot agree and rodrigo is about to bear away the exhausted zara when the timid servant enters with a letter and a bag from hagar who has mysteriously disappeared the latter informs the party that she bequeths untold wealth to the young pair and an awful doom to don pedro if he make them happy the bag is opened and several quarts of tin money shower down upon the stage till it is quite glorified with the glitter this entirely softens the stern sire he consents without a murmur all join in a joyful chorus and the curtain falls upon the lovers kneeling to receive don blessing in attitudes of the most romantic grace 
 tumultuous applause followed but received an unexpected check for the cot bed on which the dress circle was built suddenly shut up and extinguished the enthusiastic audience roderigo and don pedro flew to the rescue and all were taken out unhurt though many were speechless with laughter the excitement had hardly subsided when hannah appeared with mrs compliments and would the ladies walk down to supper 
 this was a surprise even to the actors and when they saw the table they looked at one another in rapturous amazement it was like marmee to get up a little treat for them but anything so fine as this was unheard of since the departed days of plenty there was ice cream actually two dishes of it pink and white and cake and fruit and distracting french bonbons and in the middle of the table four great bouquets of hot house flowers 
 it quite took their breath away and they stared first at the table and then at their mother who looked as if she enjoyed it immensely 
 is it fairies asked amy 
 santa claus said beth 
 mother did it and meg smiled her sweetest in spite of her gray beard and white eyebrows 
 aunt march had a good fit and sent the supper cried jo with a sudden inspiration 
 all wrong old mr laurence sent it replied mrs march 
 the laurence grandfather what in the world put such a thing into his head we know him exclaimed meg 
 
 
 hannah told one of his servants about your breakfast party he is an odd old gentleman but that pleased him he knew my father years ago and he sent me a polite note this afternoon saying he hoped i would allow him to express his friendly feeling toward my children by sending them a few trifles in honor of the day i could not refuse and so you have a little feast at night to make up for the breakfast 
 that boy put it into his head i know he did a capital fellow and i wish we could get acquainted he looks as if like to know us but bashful and meg is so prim she let me speak to him when we pass said jo as the plates went round and the ice began to melt out of sight with ohs and ahs of satisfaction 
 you mean the people who live in the big house next door you asked one of the girls my mother knows old mr laurence but says very proud and like to mix with his neighbors he keeps his grandson shut up when he riding or walking with his tutor and makes him study very hard we invited him to our party but he come mother says very nice though he never speaks to us girls 
 our cat ran away once and he brought her back and we talked over the fence and were getting on capitally all about cricket and so on when he saw meg coming and walked off i mean to know him some day for he needs fun sure he does said jo decidedly 
 i like his manners and he looks like a little gentleman so no objection to your knowing him if a proper opportunity comes he brought the flowers himself and i should have asked him in if i had been sure what was going on upstairs he looked so wistful as he went away hearing the frolic and evidently having none of his own 
 a mercy you mother laughed jo looking at her boots but have another play sometime that he can see perhaps help act that be jolly 
 i never had such a fine bouquet before how pretty it is and meg examined her flowers with great interest 
 they are lovely but roses are sweeter to me said mrs march smelling the posy in her belt 
 beth nestled up to her and whispered softly i wish i could send my bunch to father afraid he having such a merry christmas as we are

 a poor bare miserable room it was with broken windows no fire ragged bedclothes a sick mother wailing baby and a group of pale hungry children cuddled under one old quilt trying to keep warm 
 how the big eyes stared and the blue lips smiled as the girls went in 
 ach mein gott it is good angels come to us said the poor woman crying for joy 
 funny angels in hoods and mittens said jo and set them to laughing 
 in a few minutes it really did seem as if kind spirits had been at work there hannah who had carried wood made a fire and stopped up the broken panes with old hats and her own cloak mrs march gave the mother tea and gruel and comforted her with promises of help while she dressed the little baby as tenderly as if it had been her own the girls meantime spread the table set the children round the fire and fed them like so many hungry birds laughing talking and trying to understand the funny broken english 
 das ist gut die cried the poor things as they ate and warmed their purple hands at the comfortable blaze the girls had never been called angel children before and thought it very agreeable especially jo who had been considered a sancho ever since she was born that was a very happy breakfast though they get any of it and when they went away leaving comfort behind i think there were not in all the city four merrier people than the hungry little girls who gave away their breakfasts and contented themselves with bread and milk on christmas morning 
 loving our neighbor better than ourselves and i like it said meg as they set out their presents while their mother was upstairs collecting clothes for the poor hummels 
 not a very splendid show but there was a great deal of love done up in the few little bundles and the tall vase of red roses white chrysanthemums and trailing vines which stood in the middle gave quite an elegant air to the table 
 coming strike up beth open the door amy three cheers for marmee cried jo prancing about while meg went to conduct mother to the seat of honor 
 beth played her gayest march amy threw open the door and meg enacted escort with great dignity mrs march was both surprised and touched and smiled with her eyes full as she examined her presents and read the little notes which accompanied them the slippers went on at once a new handkerchief was slipped into her pocket well scented with cologne the rose was fastened in her bosom and the nice gloves were pronounced a perfect fit 
 there was a good deal of laughing and kissing and explaining in the simple loving fashion which makes these home festivals so pleasant at the time so sweet to remember long afterward and then all fell to work 
 the morning charities and ceremonies took so much time that the rest of the day was devoted to preparations for the evening festivities being still too young to go often to the theater and not rich enough to afford any great outlay for private performances the girls put their wits to work and necessity being the mother of invention made whatever they needed very clever were some of their productions pasteboard guitars antique lamps made of butter boats covered with silver paper gorgeous robes of old cotton glittering with tin spangles from a pickle factory and armor covered with the same useful diamond shaped bits left inn sheets when the lids of preserve pots were cut out the big chamber was the scene of many innocent revels 
 no gentleman were admitted so jo played male parts to her content and took immense satisfaction in a pair of russet leather boots given her by a friend who knew a lady who knew an actor these boots an old foil and a slashed doublet once used by an artist for some picture were chief treasures and appeared on all occasions the smallness of the company made it necessary for the two principal actors to take several parts apiece and they certainly deserved some credit for the hard work they did in learning three or four different parts whisking in and out of various costumes and managing the stage besides it was excellent drill for their memories a harmless amusement and employed many hours which otherwise would have been idle lonely or spent in less profitable society 
 on christmas night a dozen girls piled onto the bed which was the dress circle and sat before the blue and yellow chintz curtains in a most flattering state of expectancy there was a good deal of rustling and whispering behind the curtain a trifle of lamp smoke and an occasional giggle from amy who was apt to get hysterical in the excitement of the moment presently a bell sounded the curtains flew apart and the operatic tragedy began 
 a gloomy wood according to the one playbill was represented by a few shrubs in pots green baize on the floor and a cave in the distance this cave was made with a clothes horse for a roof bureaus for walls and in it was a small furnace in full blast with a black pot on it and an old witch bending over it the stage was dark and the glow of the furnace had a fine effect especially as real steam issued from the kettle when the witch took off the cover a moment was allowed for the first thrill to subside then hugo the villain stalked in with a clanking sword at his side a slouching hat black beard mysterious cloak and the boots after pacing to and fro in much agitation he struck his forehead and burst out in a wild strain singing of his hatred to roderigo his love for zara and his pleasing resolution to kill the one and win the other the gruff tones of voice with an occasional shout when his feelings overcame him were very impressive and the audience applauded the moment he paused for breath bowing with the air of one accustomed to public praise he stole to the cavern and ordered hagar to come forth with a commanding what ho minion i need thee 
 out came meg with gray horsehair hanging about her face a red and black robe a staff and cabalistic signs upon her cloak hugo demanded a potion to make zara adore him and one destroy roderigo hagar in a fine dramatic melody promised both and proceeded to call up the spirit who would bring the love philter 
 hither hither from thy home 
 airy sprite i bid thee come 
 born of roses fed on dew 
 charms and potions canst thou brew 
 bring me here with elfin speed 
 the fragrant philter which i need 
 make it sweet and swift and strong 
 spirit answer now my song 
 a soft strain of music sounded and then at the back of the cave appeared a little figure in cloudy white with glittering wings golden hair and a garland of roses on its head waving a wand it sang 
 hither i come 
 from my airy home 
 afar in the silver moon 
 take the magic spell 
 and use it well 
 or its power will vanish soon 
 and dropping a small gilded bottle at the feet the spirit vanished another chant from hagar produced another apparition not a lovely one for with a bang an ugly black imp appeared and having croaked a reply tossed a dark bottle at hugo and disappeared with a mocking laugh having warbled his thanks and put the potions in his boots hugo departed and hagar informed the audience that as he had killed a few of her friends in times past she had cursed him and intends to thwart his plans and be revenged on him then the curtain fell and the audience reposed and ate candy while discussing the merits of the play 
 a good deal of hammering went on before the curtain rose again but when it became evident what a masterpiece of stage carpentery had been got up no one murmured at the delay it was truly superb a tower rose to the ceiling halfway up appeared a window with a lamp burning in it and behind the white curtain appeared zara in a lovely blue and silver dress waiting for roderigo he came in gorgeous array with plumed cap red cloak chestnut lovelocks a guitar and the boots of course kneeling at the foot of the tower he sang a serenade in melting tones zara replied and after a musical dialogue consented to fly then came the grand effect of the play roderigo produced a rope ladder with five steps to it threw up one end and invited zara to descend timidly she crept from her lattice put her hand on shoulder and was about to leap gracfully down when alas alas for zara she forgot her train it caught in the window the tower tottered leaned forward fell with a crash and buried the unhappy lovers in the ruins 
 a universal shriek arose as the russet boots waved wildly from the wreck and a golden head emerged exclaiming i told you so i told you so with wonderful presence of mind don pedro the cruel sire rushed in dragged out his daughter with a hasty aside 
 laugh act as if it was all right and ordering roderigo up banished him form the kingdom with wrath and scorn though decidedly shaken by the fall from the tower upon him roderigo defied the old gentleman and refused to stir this dauntless example fired zara she also defied her sire and he ordered them both to the deepest dungeons of the castle a stout little retainer came in with chains and led them away looking very much frightened and evidently forgetting the speech he ought to have made 
 act third was the castle hall and here hagar appeared having come to free the lovers and finish hugo she hears him coming and hides sees him put the potions into two cups of wine and bid the the timid little servant bear them to the captives in their cells and tell them i shall come anon the servant takes hugo aside to tell him something and hagar changes the cups for two others which are harmless ferdinando the minion carries them away and hagar puts back the cup which holds the poison meant for roderigo hugo getting thirsty after a long warble drinks it loses his wits and after a good deal of clutching and stamping falls flat and dies while hagar informs him what she has done in a song of exquisite power and melody 
 this was a truly thrilling scene though some persons might have thought that the sudden tumbling down of a quantity of long red hair rather marred the effect of the death he was called before the curtain and with great propriety appeared leading hagar whose singing was considered more wonderful than all the rest of the performance put together 
 act fourth displayed the despairing roderigo on the point of stabbing himself because he has been told that zara has deserted him just as the dagger is at his heart a lovely song is sung under his window informing him that zara is true but in danger and he can save her if he will a key is thrown in which unlocks the door and in a spasm of rapture he tears off his chains and rushes away to find and rescue his lady love 
 act fifth opened with a stormy scene between zara and don pedro he wishes her to go into a convent but she hear of it and after a touching appeal is about to faint when roderigo dashes in and demands her hand don pedro refuses because he is not rich they shout and gesticulate tremendously but cannot agree and rodrigo is about to bear away the exhausted zara when the timid servant enters with a letter and a bag from hagar who has mysteriously disappeared the latter informs the party that she bequeths untold wealth to the young pair and an awful doom to don pedro if he make them happy the bag is opened and several quarts of tin money shower down upon the stage till it is quite glorified with the glitter this entirely softens the stern sire he consents without a murmur all join in a joyful chorus and the curtain falls upon the lovers kneeling to receive don blessing in attitudes of the most romantic grace 
 tumultuous applause followed but received an unexpected check for the cot bed on which the dress circle was built suddenly shut up and extinguished the enthusiastic audience roderigo and don pedro flew to the rescue and all were taken out unhurt though many were speechless with laughter the excitement had hardly subsided when hannah appeared with mrs compliments and would the ladies walk down to supper 
 this was a surprise even to the actors and when they saw the table they looked at one another in rapturous amazement it was like marmee to get up a little treat for them but anything so fine as this was unheard of since the departed days of plenty there was ice cream actually two dishes of it pink and white and cake and fruit and distracting french bonbons and in the middle of the table four great bouquets of hot house flowers 
 it quite took their breath away and they stared first at the table and then at their mother who looked as if she enjoyed it immensely 
 is it fairies asked amy 
 santa claus said beth 
 mother did it and meg smiled her sweetest in spite of her gray beard and white eyebrows 
 aunt march had a good fit and sent the supper cried jo with a sudden inspiration 
 all wrong old mr laurence sent it replied mrs march 
 the laurence grandfather what in the world put such a thing into his head we know him exclaimed meg 
 
 
 hannah told one of his servants about your breakfast party he is an odd old gentleman but that pleased him he knew my father years ago and he sent me a polite note this afternoon saying he hoped i would allow him to express his friendly feeling toward my children by sending them a few trifles in honor of the day i could not refuse and so you have a little feast at night to make up for the breakfast 
 that boy put it into his head i know he did a capital fellow and i wish we could get acquainted he looks as if like to know us but bashful and meg is so prim she let me speak to him when we pass said jo as the plates went round and the ice began to melt out of sight with ohs and ahs of satisfaction 
 you mean the people who live in the big house next door you asked one of the girls my mother knows old mr laurence but says very proud and like to mix with his neighbors he keeps his grandson shut up when he riding or walking with his tutor and makes him study very hard we invited him to our party but he come mother says very nice though he never speaks to us girls 
 our cat ran away once and he brought her back and we talked over the fence and were getting on capitally all about cricket and so on when he saw meg coming and walked off i mean to know him some day for he needs fun sure he does said jo decidedly 
 i like his manners and he looks like a little gentleman so no objection to your knowing him if a proper opportunity comes he brought the flowers himself and i should have asked him in if i had been sure what was going on upstairs he looked so wistful as he went away hearing the frolic and evidently having none of his own 
 a mercy you mother laughed jo looking at her boots but have another play sometime that he can see perhaps help act that be jolly 
 i never had such a fine bouquet before how pretty it is and meg examined her flowers with great interest 
 they are lovely but roses are sweeter to me said mrs march smelling the posy in her belt 
 beth nestled up to her and whispered softly i wish i could send my bunch to father afraid he having such a merry christmas as we are

 deep in the bowels of the museum lie the stacks rows upon rows of towering 
 bookshelves filled with literature on the antiquities standing at the top 
 of a tall ladder between two of these rows and leaning against one of the 
 bookshelves is a rather uninteresting british girl 
 long boring dress your typical prudish nightmare this is 
 evelyn carnarvon going to fall in love with her 
 evelyn pulls a book out from a stack under her arm blows the dust off it 
 then places it on a shelf with other books whose titles all begin with the 
 letter o then she grabs another book out from under her arm and reads 
 the title 
 evelyn 
 tuthmosis now how did you get up here 
 carefully so as not to lose her balance she looks over her shoulder to 
 the bookshelf behind her where all the titles begin with the letter to 
 then she looks down a long way to the bottom evelyn gently sets the 
 other books down on the top shelf then turns and gingerly starts to reach 
 across the aisle with the tuthmosis book a little too far so she 
 stretches reaching holding the top of the ladder with 
 her fingertips almost got it closer now closer 
 and when the ladder pulls away from the shelf evelyn yelps flings 
 the tuthmosis book and grabs the top of the ladder which stands straight 
 up evelyn holds her breath swaying precariously a long beat and then 
 she loses her balance the ladder swings around and evelyn starts 
 stiltwalking down the aisle 
 evelyn 
 oheiugm ahhhhhh

 came evelyn clings to the top struggling for balance the ladder teeters 
 out into the main aisle and picks up speed evelyn screams as it does a 
 spins into another aisle and finally crashes to a stop at the top of a 
 bookshelf evelyn holds her breath then sighs heavily 
 and when the bookshelf falls away from her and crashes into the next 
 bookshelf evelyn slides down the ladder and plops to the floor she looks 
 up just as the domino effect each bookshelf crashing into the 
 next and onward it goes bookshelf after bookshelf thousands of volumes 
 flinging off shelves and scattering across the floor it finally ends as 
 the last shelf crashes into a wall eyes are closed she opens one 
 eye looks left then right then opens the other eye and stares at the

 hears a noise and quickly turns around a beat 
 evelyn

 quiet eerie and then she hears it again like feet slowly shuffling 
 across the floor coming from a nearby gallery 
 evelyn 
 abdul mohammed bob 
 evelyn walks through the stacks and enters 
 int the ramesseum 
 filled with treasures and plunder from the middle kingdom very dark 
 and quiet in here the only light is from flickering torches at either end 
 of the spooky gallery 
 the noise again from the far side of the room feet slowly shuffling 
 plodding across the floor evelyn grabs a torch looks a statue 
 of anubis another of horus they stare down at evelyn who is starting to 
 get scared now she walks down the aisle past a closed sarcophagus past 
 cases of ancient artifacts past another sarcophagus only this one is 
 open evelyn freezes swallows hard nervously looks around to see who 
 could have opened it then she slowly leans forward with the torch and 
 peers inside 
 a hideous rotted mummy sits up and screeches at her evelyn 
 screams drops the torch and backs away scared out of her wits and then 
 coming from inside the sarcophagus she hears a man laughing her eyes 
 narrow as a foppish cad crawls out from behind the mummy laughing his ass 
 off half drunk 
 evelyn 
 you you 
 jonathan 
 drunkard fool please call 
 me something original 
 meet jonathan carnarvon as he crawls out of the sarcophagus evelyn pulls 
 a cigarette out of the mouth 
 evelyn

 jonathan

 he grins drunkenly evelyn punches him hard in the chest 
 evelyn 
 well i wish do it sooner rather than 
 later before you ruin my 
 career the way ruined yours 
 jonathan

 he belches then falls back and sits on the edge of a tomb 
 evelyn

 scrounging around egypt and what have you

 jonathan excitedly starts scrounging around in his jacket 
 jonathan 
 oh yes i do i have something right here 
 evelyn 
 oh no not another worthless trinket 
 jonathan if i bring one more 
 piece of junk to the curator to try 
 and sell for you 
 jonathan pulls out a small ancient box the collapsed key to 
 sarcophagus and coffin evelyn is instantly curious she grabs the box out 
 of his hand 
 evelyn 
 where did you get this 
 jonathan knows her weaknesses gives her a mischievous smile 
 jonathan 
 on a dig down in thebes 
 evelyn rolls the box around in her hands mumbling to herself as she 
 translates the hieratics and hieroglyphs covering it jonathan licks his 
 lips in anticipation 
 jonathan 
 my whole life never found 
 anything evy tell me 
 found something 
 fingers play with the various little slats on the box shifting 
 them this way and that way like a puzzle box then suddenly it 
 unfolds itself turning itself into the key sitting 
 inside the open is a folded piece of golden papyrus an ancient 
 map 
 evelyn 
 jonathan 
 jonathan

 evelyn

 royal seal of seti the first sure of it

 jonathan leans in from across the desk 
 jonathan 
 two questions who the hell is seti the first 
 and was he rich 
 evelyn

 said to be the wealthiest pharaoh of them all 
 jonathan

 established in the opening scenes of the movie 
 evelyn 
 already dated it this map 
 is almost four thousand years old

 pharaohs were said to have 
 hidden the wealth of egypt 
 jonathan 
 right right in a big underground treasure 
 chamber everybody knows the story the entire 
 necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand on 
 command a flick of the switch and the 
 whole place could disappear beneath the dunes 
 evelyn 
 all we know is that the city mysteriously 
 vanished around 
 the curator holds the map closer to the burning 
 curator 
 as the americans would say all fairy 
 tales and hokum 
 the map accidentally catches on fire the curator throws it to the 
 floor jonathan drops to his knees and quickly puts it out lifts it up 
 the left third of the map is now missing 
 jonathm

 surprised at you miss

 me something original 
 meet jonathan carnarvon as he crawls out of the sarcophagus evelyn pulls 
 a cigarette out of the mouth 
 evelyn 
 have you no respect for the dead 
 jonathan 
 right now i only wish to join them 
 he grins drunkenly evelyn punches him hard in the chest 
 evelyn 
 well i wish do it sooner rather than 
 later before you ruin my 
 career the way ruined yours 
 jonathan 
 my dear sweet baby sister have you 
 know that at this moment my career is on a high note 
 he belches then falls back and sits on the edge of a tomb 
 evelyn 
 high note ha for five years been 
 scrounging around egypt and what have you 
 to show for it nothing 
 jonathan excitedly starts scrounging around in his jacket 
 jonathan 
 oh yes i do i have something right here 
 evelyn 
 oh no not another worthless trinket 
 jonathan if i bring one more 
 piece of junk to the curator to try 
 and sell for you 
 jonathan pulls out a small ancient box the collapsed key to 
 sarcophagus and coffin evelyn is instantly curious she grabs the box out 
 of his hand 
 evelyn 
 where did you get this 
 jonathan knows her weaknesses gives her a mischievous smile 
 jonathan 
 on a dig down in thebes 
 evelyn rolls the box around in her hands mumbling to herself as she 
 translates the hieratics and hieroglyphs covering it jonathan licks his 
 lips in anticipation 
 jonathan 
 my whole life never found 
 anything evy tell me 
 found something 
 fingers play with the various little slats on the box shifting 
 them this way and that way like a puzzle box then suddenly it 
 unfolds itself turning itself into the key sitting 
 inside the open is a folded piece of golden papyrus an ancient 
 map 
 evelyn 
 jonathan 
 jonathan 
 yes 
 evelyn 
 i think you found something 
 int office day 
 the curator sits at his desk staring through a eyepiece at the evelyn hovers behind him excited 
 evelyn 
 see the cartouche there the official 
 royal seal of seti the first sure of it 
 curator 
 perhaps 
 jonathan leans in from across the desk 
 jonathan 
 two questions who the hell is seti the first 
 and was he rich 
 evelyn 
 he was the last pharaoh of the old kingdom 
 said to be the wealthiest pharaoh of them all 
 jonathan 
 alright good good i like this fellow 
 like him very much 
 the curator picks up the map actually the exact same map that we 
 established in the opening scenes of the movie 
 evelyn 
 already dated it this map 
 is almost four thousand years old 
 and the hieratics over here 
 inhales deeply 
 hamunaptra 
 the curator freezes suddenly very nervous then he recovers 
 curator 
 my dear girl be ridiculous 
 we are scholars not treasure 
 hunters hamunaptra is a myth 
 jonathan 
 are we talking about the hamunaptra 
 evelyn 
 yes the city of the dead where the early 
 pharaohs were said to have 
 hidden the wealth of egypt 
 jonathan 
 right right in a big underground treasure 
 chamber everybody knows the story the entire 
 necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand on 
 command a flick of the switch and the 
 whole place could disappear beneath the dunes 
 evelyn 
 all we know is that the city mysteriously 
 vanished around 
 the curator holds the map closer to the burning 
 curator 
 as the americans would say all fairy 
 tales and hokum 
 the map accidentally catches on fire the curator throws it to the 
 floor jonathan drops to his knees and quickly puts it out lifts it up 
 the left third of the map is now missing 
 jonathm 
 you burned it you burned off the part with the lost city 
 curator 
 for the best sure many men have 
 wasted their lives in the foolish pursuit of 
 hamunaptra no one has ever found it most have 
 never returned 
 jonathan devastated 
 you killed my map 
 curator 
 sure it was a fake anyway 
 surprised at you miss 
 carnarvon to be so fooled 
 the curator reaches for the evelyn quickly snatches it off the 
 desk and gives him a very angry suspicious look 
 ext cairo prison gallows courtyard day

 scumbag can be found here the warden a first rate scumbag himself

 evelyn and jonathan quickly look around hoping the guards hear him 
 they step closer evelyn plays coy 
 evelyn

 to hamunaptra 
 
 because where i found it 
 i was there 
 evelyn is dumbstruck but jonathan looks suspicious 
 jonathan

 fist comes flying through the bars hits jonathan square in the 
 jaw decks him he hits the floor out cold a guard clubs his 
 head bounces off the bars again he shows no pain but gives the guard

 the doctor leaves followed by the countess who turns off the light and looking back at the princess shuts the door behind her 
 alone the princess looks around the large room at the lavish ancient ornamentation on the ceiling and the huge sculpted headboard she lies back and then remembering eagerly climbs out of bed and runs to the window she looks out longingly at the dancing below the breeze blowing in her face then out over the city the buildings lit up in the night far in the distance thinking she looks back at the door and then back out the window then she runs to her wardrobe and starts rummaging in the clothes hung there 
 
 later dressed in a plain white blouse and skirt and picking up her gloves from the dresser she peers out the door of the bedchambers she sees a guard sat at the end of the wall stir in his pausing as she closes the door she goes out of the side window onto the balcony outside she walks along to the edge of the adjacent balcony jumping down with a slight noise onto the ground glancing furtively around she goes inside to a large empty room she pauses for moment to look around on either side and then continues going through the door she finds herself on a corridor upstairs encircling the large central area she runs along to the end turning the corner and then onto the other side she continues on reaches a staircase and goes down it towards the exit

 in the driveway carolyn now dressed for work in a completely different but equally outfit stands next to a ml reaching in through the drivers window to blow the horn again 
 her pov lester comes out the front door dressed in abusiness suit and carrying a briefcase fumbling with his tie jane is close behind him buttoning her flannel shirt her knapsack slung over her shoulder 
 carolyn frowns at both of them 
 carolynjane honey are you trying to look unattractive 
 janeyes 
 carolynwell congratulations succeeded admirably 
 briefcase suddenly springs open his papers and files spilling onto the driveway as he drops to his knees to gather everything jane sidesteps around him 
 janenice going dad 
 lester looks up her sheepishly then at carolyn 
 his pov she looks down at us slightly contemptuous but alsobored as if she gave up expecting anything more long ago 
 lesteri keep meaning to get this thing fixed 
 he smiles trying to lighten the moment but expression change she opens the door and gets into the drivers seat jane takes the passenger seat and lester climbs into the back the ml starts to slowly back out of the driveway 
 lester my family and this is my think i miss it so much 
 int ml a short time later 
 carolyn is driving jane stares out the window lester is asleep in the back seat clint black sings desperado on the stereo 
 janewhy are we listening to this music 
 just what was on 
 jane fiddles the tuner searching for another suddenly catches eye 
 her pov an advertisement on a bus stop bench shows a silver man smiling a toothy smile it reads leonard kane the real estate king highest sales record three years straight we recognize him as the man seated next to carolyn in court during trial 
 carolyn glare at the advertisement as she drives past itobviously bothers her 
 janei see how you people can listen to that hillbilly crap it makes me want to buy a gun and shoot up a burger king 
 carolynwell your father was the last one to drive this car you know i like country music myself so common and twangy i much prefer the old standards sinatra bobby darin doris day 
 jane finally finds a station she likes moody alternativerock they drive along without speaking for a moment then 
 janewake up dad here 
 no response from lester 
 jane look garth brooks and wearing that groovy cowboy hat maybe you can get his autograph 
 hush 
 int commuter train a short time later 
 lester sits in the crowded train his head up against thewindow fast asleep 
 lester my wife and my daughter think this gigantic loser 
 he has a paper cup of coffee in one hand haphazardly holdingit against his knee slowly it tips over spilling onto his pants leg he remains asleep 
 lester right lost something very important not exactly sure what it is but i know i always fell this sedated 
 finally lester opens one eye 
 pov from the front of the path train zooming along aboveground unnaturally fast heading toward a tunnel 
 lester you know what never too late to get it back 
 and we accelerate into the tunnel and blackness 
 int office building dayclose on a computer monitor scrolling copy moving by too quickly for us to read but we can make out words here and there marketing profits strategy etc 
 lester sits at his workstation in a beige cubicle surrounded by several identical beige cubicles staring at the monitor and talking on a headset phone the light friendly tone of his voice is at odds with the beleaguered expression on his face 
 
 lesterhello this is lester burnham from media monthly magazine calling for actually already left a message about four messages to be exact i understand but i have questions about the new product launch that your press release quite cover 
 brad an affable man in his early thirties appears behindlester lester is immediately aware of his presence 
 lester already given you my yes lester burnham thank you 
 he punches a button on his keyboard then turns to brad smiling perfunctorily 
 bradles got a minute 
 lesterfor you brad got five 
 bradgood why we talk in my smiles and crosses off lester watches him go frowning 
 int office moments later 
 brad is seated behind his desk 
 sure you can understand the need to cut corners around here 
 lester sits across from him scowling like a teenager been sent to the office 
 lestersure times are tight and you need to free up cash gotta spend money to make money 
 bradexactly 
 brad stands ready to usher lester out but lester remainsseated 
 when our editorial director used the company mastercard to pay for a hooker and then she used the card number to stay at the st regis for what was it three months 
 unsubstantiated gossip 
 fifty thousand dollars salary somebody probably gonna get fired because craig has to pay women to fuck him 
 bradjesus calm down getting fired yet why having everyone write a job description mapping out in detail how they contribute that way management can assess valuable and 
 lesterexpendable 
 just business 
 been writing for this magazine for fourteen years brad been here how long a month 
 one of the good guys les i trying to level with you this is your one chance to save your job 
 lester leans back in his chair incredulous 
 int commuter train a short time later 
 once again lester sits in the crowded train his head upagainst the window but this time not asleep he glares darkly out at the tunnel walls as they fly by 
 ext burnham house that night 
 the ml pulls into the driveway driven bycarolyn a moving van is parked in front of the pale blue colonial house next door a couple of movers carry a couch down the driveway toward the house 
 as lester and carolyn get out of the ml and head towardtheir front door 
 carolynthere is no decision just write the damn thing 
 lesteryou think weird and kinda fascist 
 carolynpossibly but you want to be unemployed 
 lester 
 oh okay all sell our sols to satan because more convenient that way 
 you be just a little bit more dramatic please 
 carolyn scopes out the moving van next door 
 carolyn finally got new neighbors about time if the lomans had let me represent them instead real estate king that house would have sold within a week instead of sitting on the market for six months 
 lesterthey were still mad at you for cutting down their sycamore 
 carolyntheir sycamore it was on our property 
 int burnham house dining room later that night 
 we hear john coltrane and johnny rendition of you are too beautiful on the stereo 
 lester carolyn and jane are seated at dinner in the formaldining room they eat by candlelight and a profusion of red roses spills from a vase at the center of the table we circle them slowly as they eat nobody makes eye contact or even seems aware of anybody presence until 
 janemom do we always have to listen to this elevator music 
 no we as soon as prepared a nutritious yet flavorful meal that about to eat you can listen to whatever you like 
 a long beat lester suddenly turns to jane 
 lesterso janie how was school 
 was okay 
 lesterjust okay 
 janeno dad it was beat 
 lesterwant to know how things went at my job 
 now she looks at him as if lost his mind 
 lester hired this efficiency expert really friendly and i really hate his guts see going to lay somebody off but in the interest of being democratic everybody gets to write a job description for him in the hopes the assholes in management will read it and say whoa we without this guy 
 he trails off obviously waiting for a response from jane 
 lester possibly care any less could you 
 carolyn is watching this closely 
 what do you expect you all of a sudden be my best friend just because got a problem 
 she gets up and heads toward the kitchen 
 jane mean hello barely even spoken to me for months

 lesteroh what you treat her like a employee 
 
 he gets up and starts after jane 
 lesteryou treat us both like employees

 briefcase suddenly springs open his papers and files spilling onto the driveway as he drops to his knees to gather everything jane sidesteps around him 
 janenice going dad 
 lester looks up her sheepishly then at carolyn 
 his pov she looks down at us slightly contemptuous but alsobored as if she gave up expecting anything more long ago 
 lesteri keep meaning to get this thing fixed 
 he smiles trying to lighten the moment but expression change she opens the door and gets into the drivers seat jane takes the passenger seat and lester climbs into the back the ml starts to slowly back out of the driveway 
 lester my family and this is my think i miss it so much 
 int ml a short time later 
 carolyn is driving jane stares out the window lester is asleep in the back seat clint black sings desperado on the stereo 
 janewhy are we listening to this music 
 just what was on 
 jane fiddles the tuner searching for another suddenly catches eye 
 her pov an advertisement on a bus stop bench shows a silver man smiling a toothy smile it reads leonard kane the real estate king highest sales record three years straight we recognize him as the man seated next to carolyn in court during trial

 jane finally finds a station she likes moody alternativerock they drive along without speaking for a moment then 
 janewake up dad here 
 no response from lester

 hush 
 int commuter train a short time later 
 lester sits in the crowded train his head up against thewindow fast asleep 
 lester my wife and my daughter think this gigantic loser 
 he has a paper cup of coffee in one hand haphazardly holdingit against his knee slowly it tips over spilling onto his pants leg he remains asleep 
 lester right lost something very important not exactly sure what it is but i know i always fell this sedated 
 finally lester opens one eye 
 pov from the front of the path train zooming along aboveground unnaturally fast heading toward a tunnel 
 lester you know what never too late to get it back 
 and we accelerate into the tunnel and blackness 
 int office building dayclose on a computer monitor scrolling copy moving by too quickly for us to read but we can make out words here and there marketing profits strategy etc 
 lester sits at his workstation in a beige cubicle surrounded by several identical beige cubicles staring at the monitor and talking on a headset phone the light friendly tone of his voice is at odds with the beleaguered expression on his face 
 
 lesterhello this is lester burnham from media monthly magazine calling for actually already left a message about four messages to be exact i understand but i have questions about the new product launch that your press release quite cover 
 brad an affable man in his early thirties appears behindlester lester is immediately aware of his presence 
 lester already given you my yes lester burnham thank you 
 he punches a button on his keyboard then turns to brad smiling perfunctorily 
 bradles got a minute 
 lesterfor you brad got five 
 bradgood why we talk in my smiles and crosses off lester watches him go frowning 
 int office moments later 
 brad is seated behind his desk 
 sure you can understand the need to cut corners around here 
 lester sits across from him scowling like a teenager been sent to the office 
 lestersure times are tight and you need to free up cash gotta spend money to make money 
 bradexactly 
 brad stands ready to usher lester out but lester remainsseated 
 when our editorial director used the company mastercard to pay for a hooker and then she used the card number to stay at the st regis for what was it three months 
 unsubstantiated gossip 
 fifty thousand dollars salary somebody probably gonna get fired because craig has to pay women to fuck him 
 bradjesus calm down getting fired yet why having everyone write a job description mapping out in detail how they contribute that way management can assess valuable and 
 lesterexpendable 
 just business 
 been writing for this magazine for fourteen years brad been here how long a month 
 one of the good guys les i trying to level with you this is your one chance to save your job 
 lester leans back in his chair incredulous 
 int commuter train a short time later 
 once again lester sits in the crowded train his head upagainst the window but this time not asleep he glares darkly out at the tunnel walls as they fly by 
 ext burnham house that night 
 the ml pulls into the driveway driven bycarolyn a moving van is parked in front of the pale blue colonial house next door a couple of movers carry a couch down the driveway toward the house 
 as lester and carolyn get out of the ml and head towardtheir front door 
 carolynthere is no decision just write the damn thing 
 lesteryou think weird and kinda fascist 
 carolynpossibly but you want to be unemployed 
 lester 
 oh okay all sell our sols to satan because more convenient that way 
 you be just a little bit more dramatic please 
 carolyn scopes out the moving van next door 
 carolyn finally got new neighbors about time if the lomans had let me represent them instead real estate king that house would have sold within a week instead of sitting on the market for six months 
 lesterthey were still mad at you for cutting down their sycamore 
 carolyntheir sycamore it was on our property 
 int burnham house dining room later that night 
 we hear john coltrane and johnny rendition of you are too beautiful on the stereo 
 lester carolyn and jane are seated at dinner in the formaldining room they eat by candlelight and a profusion of red roses spills from a vase at the center of the table we circle them slowly as they eat nobody makes eye contact or even seems aware of anybody presence until 
 janemom do we always have to listen to this elevator music 
 no we as soon as prepared a nutritious yet flavorful meal that about to eat you can listen to whatever you like 
 a long beat lester suddenly turns to jane 
 lesterso janie how was school

 lesterjust okay 
 janeno dad it was beat 
 lesterwant to know how things went at my job 
 now she looks at him as if lost his mind 
 lester hired this efficiency expert really friendly and i really hate his guts see going to lay somebody off but in the interest of being democratic everybody gets to write a job description for him in the hopes the assholes in management will read it and say whoa we without this guy 
 he trails off obviously waiting for a response from jane 
 lester possibly care any less could you 
 carolyn is watching this closely 
 what do you expect you all of a sudden be my best friend just because got a problem 
 she gets up and heads toward the kitchen 
 jane mean hello barely even spoken to me for months

 the law of club and fang 
 
 
 first day on the yea beach was like a nightmare every hour was filled with shock and surprise he had been suddenly jerked from the heart of civilization and flung into the heart of things primordial no lazy life was this with nothing to do but loaf and be bored here was neither peace nor rest nor a safety all was confusion and action and every moment life and limb were in peril there was imperative need to be constantly alert for these dogs and men were not town dogs and men they were savages all of them who knew no law but the law of club and fang 
 he had never seen dogs fight as these wolfish creatures fought and his first experience taught him an unforgettable lesson it is true it was a vicarious experience else he would not have lived to profit by it curly was the victim they were camped near the log store where she in her friendly way made advances to a husky dog the size of a wolf though not half so large as she there was no warning only a leap in like a flash a metallic clip of teeth a leap out equally swift and face was ripped open from eye to jaw 
 it was the wolf manner of fighting to strike and leap away but there was more to it than this thirty or forty huskies ran to the spot and surrounded the combatants in an intent and silent circle buck did not comprehend that silent intentness nor the eager way with which they were licking their chops curly rushed her antagonist who struck again and leaped aside he met her next rush with his chest in a peculiar fashion that tumbled her off her feet she never regained them this was what the onlooking huskies had waited for they closed in upon her snarling and yelping and she was buried screaming with agony beneath the bristling mass of bodies 
 so sudden was it and so unexpected that buck was taken aback he saw spitz run out his scarlet tongue in a way he had of laughing and he saw francois swinging an axe spring into the mess of dogs three men with clubs were helping him to scatter them it did not take long two minutes from the time curly went down the last of her assailants were clubbed off but she lay there limp and lifeless in the bloody trampled snow almost literally torn to pieces the swart standing over her and cursing horribly the scene often came back to buck to trouble him in his sleep so that was the way no fair play once down that was the end of you well he would see to it that he never went down spitz ran out his tongue and laughed again and from that moment buck hated him with a bitter and deathless hatred 
 before he had recovered from the shock caused by the tragic passing of curly he received another shock francois fastened upon him an arrangement of straps and buckles it was a harness such as he had seen the grooms put on the horses at home and as he had seen horses work so he was set to work hauling francois on a sled to the forest that fringed the valley and returning with a load of firewood though his dignity was sorely hurt by thus being made a draught animal he was too wise to rebel he buckled down with a will and did his best though it was all new and strange francois was stern demanding instant obedience and by virtue of his whip receiving instant obedience while dave who was an experienced wheeler nipped hindquarters whenever he was in error spitz was the leader likewise experienced and while he could not always get at buck he growled sharp reproof now and again or cunningly threw his weight in the traces to jerk buck into the way he should go buck learned easily and under the combined tuition of his two mates and francois made remarkable progress ere they returned to camp he knew enough to stop at ho to go ahead at mush to swing wide on the bends and to keep clear of the wheeler when the loaded sled shot downhill at their heels 
 three very good dogs francois told perrault dat buck him pull like hell i teach him quick as anything 
 by afternoon perrault who was in a hurry to be on the trail with his dispatches returned with two more dogs billee and joe he called them two brothers and true huskies both sons of the one mother though they were they were different as day and night one fault was his excessive good nature while joe was the very opposite sour and introspective with a perpetual snarl and a malignant eye buck received them in comradely fashion dave ignored them while spitz proceeded to thrash first one and then the other billee wagged his tail appeasingly turned to run when he saw that appeasement was of no avail and cried still appeasingly when sharp teeth scored his flank but no matter how spitz circled joe whirled around on his heels to face him mane bristling ears laid back lips writhing and snarling jaws clipping together as fast as he could snap and eyes diabolically incarnation of belligerent fear so terrible was his appearance that spitz was forced to forego disciplining him but to cover his own discomfiture he turned upon the inoffensive and wailing billee and drove him to the confines of the camp 
 by evening perrault secured another dog an old husky long and lean and gaunt with a face and a single eye which flashed a warning of prowess that commanded respect he was called which means the angry one like dave he asked nothing gave nothing expected nothing and when he marched slowly and deliberately into their midst even spitz left him alone he had one peculiarity which buck was unlucky enough to discover he did not like to be approached on his blind side of this offense buck was unwittingly guilty and the first knowledge he had of his indiscretion was when whirled upon him and slashed his shoulder to the bone for three inches up and down forever after buck avoided his blind side and to the last of their comradeship had no more his only apparent ambition like was to be left alone though as buck was afterward to learn each of them possessed one other and even more vital ambition 
 that night buck faced the great problem of sleeping the tent illumined by a candle glowed warmly in the midst of the white plain and when he as a matter of course entered it both perrault and francois bombarded him with curses and cooking utensils till he recovered from his consternation and fled ignominiously into the outer cold a chill wind was blowing that nipped him sharply and bit with especial venom into his wounded shoulder he lay down on the snow and attempted to sleep but the frost soon drove him shivering to his feet miserable and disconsolate he wandered about among the many tents only to find that one place was as cold as another here and there savage dogs rushed upon him but he bristled his and snarled for he was learning fast and they let him go his way unmolested 
 finally an idea came to him he would return and see how his own teammates were making out to his astonishment they had disappeared again he wandered about through the great camp looking for them and again he returned were they in the tent no that could not be else he would not have been driven out then where could they possibly be with drooping tail and shivering body very forlorn indeed he aimlessly circled the tent suddenly the snow gave way beneath his fore legs and he sank down something wriggled under his feet he sprang back bristling and snarling fearful of the unseen and unknown but a friendly little yelp reassured him and he went back to investigate a whiff of warm air ascended to his nostrils and there curled up under the snow in a snug ball lay billee he whined placatingly squirmed and wriggled to show his good will and intentions and even ventured as a bribe for peace to lick face with his warm wet tongue 
 another lesson so that was the way they did it eh buck confidently selected a spot and with much fuss and wasted effort proceeded to dig a hole for himself in a trice the heat from his body filled the confined space and he was asleep the day had been long and arduous and he slept soundly and comfortably though he growled and barked and wrestled with bad dreams 
 nor did he open his eyes till roused by the noises of the waking camp at first he did not know where he was it had snowed during the night and he was completely buried the snow walls pressed him on every side and a great surge of fear swept through fear of the wild thing for the trap it was a token that he was harking back through his own life to the lives of his forebears for he was a civilized dog an unduly civilized dog and of his own experience knew no trap and so could not of himself fear it the muscles of his whole body contracted spasmodically and instinctively the hair on his neck and shoulders stood on end and with a ferocious snarl he bounded straight up into the blinding day the snow flying about him in a flashing cloud ere he landed on his feet he saw the white camp spread out before him and knew where he was and remembered all that had passed from the time he went for a stroll with manuel to the hole he had dug for himself the night before 
 a shout from francois hailed his appearance what i say the cried to perrault dat buck for sure learn quick as anything 
 perrault nodded gravely as courier for the canadian government bearing important dispatches he was anxious to secure the best dogs and he was particularly gladdened by the possession of buck 
 three more huskies were added to the team inside an hour making a total of nine and before another quarter of an hour had passed they were in harness and swinging up the trail toward the yea canyon buck was glad to be gone and though the work was hard he found he did not particularly despise it he was surprised at the eagerness which animated the whole team and which was communicated to but still more surprising was the change wrought in dave and they were new dogs utterly transformed by the harness all passiveness and unconcern had dropped from them they were alert and active anxious that the work should go well and fiercely irritable with whatever by delay or confusion retarded that work the toil of the traces seemed the supreme expression of their being and all that they lived for and the only thing in which they took delight 
 dave was wheeler or sled dog pulling in front of him was buck then came the rest of the team was strung out ahead single file to the leader which position was filled by spitz 
 buck had been purposely placed between dave and so that he might receive instruction apt scholar that he was they were equally apt teachers never allowing him to linger long in error and enforcing their teaching with their sharp teeth dave was fair and very wise he never nipped buck without cause and he never failed to nip him when he stood in need of it as francois whip backed him up buck found it to be cheaper to mend his ways than to retaliate once during a brief halt when he got tangled in the traces and delayed the start both dave and flew at him and administered a sound trouncing the resulting tangle was even worse but buck took good care to keep the traces clear thereafter and ere the day was done so well had he mastered his work his mates about ceased nagging him francois whip snapped less frequently and perrault even honored buck by lifting up his feet and carefully examining them 
 it was a hard run up the canyon through sheep camp past the scales and the timber line across glaciers and snowdrifts hundreds of feet deep and over the great chilcoot divide which stands between the salt water and the fresh and guards forbiddingly the sad and lonely north they made good time down the chain of lakes which fills the craters of extinct volcanoes and late that night pulled into the huge camp at the head of lake bennett where thousands of were building boats against the breakup of the ice in the spring buck made his hole in the snow and slept the sleep of the exhausted just but all too early was routed out in the cold darkness and harnessed with his mates to the sled 
 that day they made forty miles the trail being packed but the next day and for many days to follow they broke their own trail worked harder and made poorer time as a rule perrault traveled ahead of the team packing the snow with webbed shoes to make it easier for them francois guiding the sled at the sometimes exchanged places with him but not often perrault was in a hurry and he prided himself on his knowledge of ice which knowledge was indispensable for the fall ice was very thin and where there was swift water there was no ice at all 
 day after day for days unending buck toiled in the traces always they broke camp in the dark and the first gray of dawn found them hitting the trail with fresh miles reeled off behind them and always they pitched camp after dark eating their bit of fish and crawling to sleep into the snow buck was ravenous the pound and a half of sundried salmon which was his ration for each day seemed to go nowhere he never had enough and suffered from perpetual hunger pangs yet the other dogs because they weighed less and were born to the life received a pound only of the fish and managed to keep in good condition 
 he swiftly lost the fastidiousness which had characterized his old life a dainty eater he found that his mates finishing first robbed him of his unfinished ration there was no defending it while he was fighting off two or three it was disappearing down the throats of the others to remedy this he ate as fast as they and so greatly did hunger compel him he was not above taking what did not belong to him he watched and learned when he saw pike one of the new dogs a clever malingerer and thief slyly steal a slice of bacon when back was turned he duplicated the performance the following day getting away with the whole chunk a great uproar was raised but he was unsuspected while dub an awkward blunderer who was always getting caught was punished for misdeed 
 this first theft marked buck as fit to survive in the hostile northland environment it marked his adaptability his capacity to adjust himself to changing conditions the lack of which would have meant swift and terrible death it marked further the decay or going to pieces of his moral nature a vain thing and a handicap in the ruthless struggle for existence it was all well enough in the southland under the law of love and fellowship to respect private property and personal feeling but in the northland under the law of club and fang whoso took such things into account was a fool and in so far as he observed them he would fail to prosper 
 not that buck reasoned it out he was fit that was all and unconsciously he accommodated himself to the new mode of life all his days no matter what the odds he had never run from a fight but the club of the man in the red sweater had beaten into him a more fundamental and primitive code civilized he could have died for a moral consideration say the defense of judge riding whip but the completeness of his decivilization was now evidenced by his ability to flee from the defense of a moral consideration and so save his hide he did not steal for joy of it but because of the clamor of his stomach he did not rob openly but stole secretly and cunningly out of respect for club and fang in short the things he did were done because it was easier to do them than not to do them 
 his development or retrogression was rapid his muscles became hard as iron and he grew callous to all ordinary pain he achieved an internal as well as external economy he could eat anything no matter how loathsome or indigestible and once eaten the juices of his stomach extracted the last least particle of nutriment and his blood carried it to the farthest reaches of his body building it into the toughest and stoutest of tissues sight and scent became remarkably keen while his hearing developed such acuteness that in his sleep he heard the faintest sound and knew whether it heralded peace or peril he learned to bite the ice out with his teeth when it collected between his toes and when he was thirsty and there was a thick scum of ice over the water hole he would break it by rearing and striking it with stiff fore legs his most conspicuous trait was an ability to scent the wind and forecast it a night in advance no matter how breathless the air when he dug his nest by tree or bank the wind that later blew inevitably found him to leeward sheltered and snug 
 and not only did he learn by experience but instincts long dead became alive again the domesticated generations fell from him in vague ways he remembered back to the youth of the breed to the time the wild dogs ranged in packs through the primeval forest and killed their meat as they ran it down it was no task for him to learn to fight with cut and slash and the quick wolf snap in this manner had fought forgotten ancestors they quickened the old life within him and the old tricks which they had stamped into the heredity of the breed were his tricks they came to him without effort or discovery as though they had been his always and when on the still cold nights he pointed his nose at a star and howled long and it was his ancestors dead and dust pointing nose at star and howling down through the centuries and through him and his cadences were their cadences the cadences which voiced their woe and what to them was the meaning of the stillness and the cold and dark 
 thus as token of what a puppet thing life is the ancient song surged through him and he came into his own again and he came because men had found a yellow metal in the north and because manuel was a helper whose wages did not lap over the needs of his wife and divers small copies of himself

 i sent two units bringing her down now 
 agent smith 
 no lieutenant your men are dead 
 
 int chase hotel 
 the big cop flicks out his cuffs the other cops holding 
 a bead done this a hundred times they know 
 got her until the big cop reaches with the cuff 
 and trinity moves 
 it almost register so smooth and fast inhumanly 
 fast 
 the eye blinks and palm snaps up and the nose 
 explodes blood erupting the cop is dead before he 
 begins to fall 
 and trinity is moving again 
 seizing a wrist misdirecting a gun as a startled cop 
 fires 
 a head explodes 
 in blind panic another airs his gun the barrel a fixed 
 black hole 
 and fires 
 trinity twists out of the way the bullet missing as she 
 reverses into a roundhouse kick knocking the gun away 
 the cop begins to scream when a jump kick crushes his 
 windpipe killing the scream as he falls to the ground 
 she looks at the four bodies 
 trinity
