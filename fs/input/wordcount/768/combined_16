 just them another visitor entered the drawing room prince andrew bolkonski the little princess husband he was a very handsome young man of medium height with firm clearcut features everything about him from his weary bored expression to his quiet measured step offered a most striking contrast to his quiet little wife it was evident that he not only knew everyone in the drawing room but had found them to be so tiresome that it wearied him to look at or listen to them and among all these faces that he found so tedious none seemed to bore him so much as that of his pretty wife he turned away from her with a grimace that distorted his handsome face kissed anna hand and screwing up his eyes scanned the whole company 
 you are off to the war prince said anna pavlovna 
 general kutuzov said bolkonski speaking french and stressing the last syllable of the name like a frenchman has been pleased to take me as an 
 and lise your wife 
 she will go to the country 
 are you not ashamed to deprive us of your charming wife 
 andre said his wife addressing her husband in the same coquettish manner in which she spoke to other men the vicomte has been telling us such a tale about mademoiselle george and buonaparte 
 prince andrew screwed up his eyes and turned away pierre who from the moment prince andrew entered the room had watched him with glad affectionate eyes now came up and took his arm before he looked round prince andrew frowned again expressing his annoyance with whoever was touching his arm but when he saw beaming face he gave him an unexpectedly kind and pleasant smile 
 there now so you too are in the great world said he to pierre 
 i knew you would be here replied pierre i will come to supper with you may i he added in a low voice so as not to disturb the vicomte who was continuing his story 
 no impossible said prince andrew laughing and pressing hand to show that there was no need to ask the question he wished to say something more but at that moment prince vasili and his daughter got up to go and the two young men rose to let them pass 
 you must excuse me dear vicomte said prince vasili to the frenchman holding him down by the sleeve in a friendly way to prevent his rising this unfortunate fete at the deprives me of a pleasure and obliges me to interrupt you i am very sorry to leave your enchanting party said he turning to anna pavlovna 
 his daughter princess helene passed between the chairs lightly holding up the folds of her dress and the smile shone still more radiantly on her beautiful face pierre gazed at her with rapturous almost frightened eyes as she passed him 
 very lovely said prince andrew 
 very said pierre 
 in passing prince vasili seized hand and said to anna pavlovna educate this bear for me he has been staying with me a whole month and this is the first time i have seen him in society nothing is so necessary for a young man as the society of clever women 
 anna pavlovna smiled and promised to take pierre in hand she knew his father to be a connection of prince the elderly lady who had been sitting with the old aunt rose hurriedly and overtook prince vasili in the anteroom all the affectation of interest she had assumed had left her kindly and tearworn face and it now expressed only anxiety and fear 
 how about my son boris prince said she hurrying after him into the anteroom i remain any longer in petersburg tell me what news i may take back to my poor boy 
 although prince vasili listened reluctantly and not very politely to the elderly lady even betraying some impatience she gave him an ingratiating and appealing smile and took his hand that he might not go away 
 what would it cost you to say a word to the emperor and then he would be transferred to the guards at once said she 
 believe me princess i am ready to do all i can answered prince vasili but it is difficult for me to ask the emperor i should advise you to appeal to rumyantsev through prince golitsyn that would be the best way 
 the elderly lady was a princess drubetskaya belonging to one of the best families in russia but she was poor and having long been out of society had lost her former influential connections she had now come to petersburg to procure an appointment in the guards for her only son it was in fact solely to meet prince vasili that she had obtained an invitation to anna reception and had sat listening to the story prince words frightened her an embittered look clouded her once handsome face but only for a moment then she smiled again and dutched prince arm more tightly 
 listen to me prince said she i have never yet asked you for anything and i never will again nor have i ever reminded you of my friendship for you but now i entreat you for sake to do this for my son and i shall always regard you as a benefactor she added hurriedly no be angry but promise i have asked golitsyn and he has refused be the kindhearted man you always were she said trying to smile though tears were in her eyes 
 papa we shall be late said princess helene turning her beautiful head and looking over her classically molded shoulder as she stood waiting by the door 
 influence in society however is a capital which has to be economized if it is to last prince vasili knew this and having once realized that if he asked on behalf of all who begged of him he would soon be unable to ask for himself he became chary of using his influence but in princess case he felt after her second appeal something like qualms of conscience she had reminded him of what was quite true he had been indebted to her father for the first steps in his career moreover he could see by her manners that she was one of those women mostly mothers who having once made up their minds will not rest until they have gained their end and are prepared if necessary to go on insisting day after day and hour after hour and even to make scenes this last consideration moved him 
 my dear anna mikhaylovna said he with his usual familiarity and weariness of tone it is almost impossible for me to do what you ask but to prove my devotion to you and how i respect your memory i will do the impossible your son shall be transferred to the guards here is my hand on it are you satisfied 
 my dear benefactor this is what i expected from you i knew your kindness he turned to go 
 wait just a word when he has been transferred to the guards she faltered you are on good terms with michael ilarionovich kutuzov recommend boris to him as adjutant then i shall be at rest and then 
 prince vasili smiled 
 no i promise that you know how kutuzov is pestered since his appointment as commander in chief he told me himself that all the moscow ladies have conspired to give him all their sons as adjutants 
 no but do promise i let you go my dear benefactor 
 papa said his beautiful daughter in the same tone as before we shall be late 
 well au revoir you hear her 
 then tomorrow you will speak to the emperor 
 certainly but about kutuzov i promise 
 do promise do promise vasili cried anna mikhaylovna as he went with the smile of a coquettish girl which at one time probably came naturally to her but was now very to her careworn face 
 apparently she had forgotten her age and by force of habit employed all the old feminine arts but as soon as the prince had gone her face resumed its former cold artificial expression she returned to the group where the vicomte was still talking and again pretended to listen while waiting till it would be time to leave her task was accomplished

 chapter 
 
 what vain we are i who had determined to hold myself independent of all social intercourse and thanked my stars that at length i had lighted on a spot where it was next to weak wretch after maintaining till dusk a struggle with low spirits and solitude was finally compelled to strike my colours and under pretence of gaining information concerning the necessities of my establishment i desired mrs dean when she brought in supper to sit down while i ate it hoping sincerely she would prove a regular gossip and either rouse me to animation or lull me to sleep by her talk 
 you have lived here a considerable time i commenced did you not say sixteen years 
 eighteen sir i came when the mistress was married to wait on her after she died the master retained me for his housekeeper 
 indeed 
 there ensued a pause she was not a gossip i feared unless about her own affairs and those could hardly interest me however having studied for an interval with a fist on either knee and a cloud of meditation over her ruddy countenance she ejaculated 
 ah times are greatly changed since then 
 yes i remarked seen a good many alterations i suppose 
 i have and troubles too she said 
 oh turn the talk on my family i thought to myself a good subject to that pretty i should like to know her history whether she be a native of the country or as is more probable an exotic that the surly indigenae will not recognize for kin with this intention i asked mrs dean why heathcliff let thrushcross grange and preferred living in a situation and residence so much inferior is he not rich enough to keep the estate in good order i inquired 
 rich sir she returned he has nobody knows what money and every year it increases yes yes rich enough to live in a finer house than this but very and if he had meant to flit to thrushcross grange as soon as he heard of a good tenant he could not have borne to miss the chance of getting a few hundreds more it is strange people should be so greedy when they are alone in the world 
 he had a son it seems 
 yes he had is dead 
 and that young lady mrs heathcliff is his widow 
 yes 
 where did she come from originally 
 why sir she is my late daughter catherine linton was her maiden name i nursed her poor thing i did wish mr heathcliff would remove here and then we might have been together again 
 what catherine linton i exclaimed astonished but a reflection convinced me it was not my ghostly catherine 
 then i continued my name was linton 
 it was 
 and who is that earnshaw hareton earnshaw who lives with mr heathcliff are they relations 
 no he is the late mrs nephew 
 the young cousin then 
 yes and her husband was her cousin also one on the the other on the side heathcliff married mr sister 
 i see the house at wuthering heights has earnshaw carved over the front door are they an old family 
 very old sir and hareton is the last of them as our miss cathy is of mean of the lintons have you been to wuthering heights i beg pardon for asking but i should like to hear how she is 
 mrs heathcliff she looked very well and very handsome yet i think not very happy 
 oh dear i wonder and how did you like the master a rough fellow rather mrs dean is not that his character 
 rough as a saw edge and hard as whinstone the less you meddle with him the better 
 he must have had some ups and downs in life to make him such a churl do you know anything of his history 
 a know all about it except where he was born and who were his parents and how he got his money at first and hareton has been cast out like an unfledged dunnock the unfortunate lad is the only one in all this parish that does not guess how he has been cheated 
 well mrs dean it will be a charitable deed to tell me something of my neighbours i feel i shall not rest if i go to bed so be good enough to sit and chat an hour 
 oh certainly sir just fetch a little sewing and then sit as long as you please but caught cold i saw you shivering and you must have some gruel to drive it out 
 the worthy woman bustled off and i crouched nearer the fire my head felt hot and the rest of me chill moreover i was excited almost to a pitch of foolishness through my nerves and brain 
 this caused me to feel not uncomfortable but rather fearful as i am still of serious effects from the incidents of today and yesterday she returned presently bringing a smoking basin and a basket of work and having placed the former on the hob drew in her seat evidently pleased to find me so companionable 
 before i came to live here she no further invitation to her was almost always at wuthering heights because my mother had nursed mr hindley earnshaw that was father and i got used to playing with the children i ran errands too and helped to make hay and hung about the farm ready for anything that anybody would set me to one fine summer was the beginning of harvest i earnshaw the old master came downstairs dressed for a journey and after he had told joseph what was to be done during the day he turned to hindley and cathy and i sat eating my porridge with he said speaking to his son now my bonny man going to liverpool today what shall i bring you you may choose what you like only let it be little for i shall walk there and back sixty miles each way that is a long spell hindley named a fiddle and then he asked miss cathy she was hardly six years old but she could ride any horse in the stable and she chose a whip he did not forget me for he had a kind heart though he was rather severe sometimes he promised to bring me a pocketful of apples and pears and then he kissed his children goodbye and set off 
 it seemed a long while to us three days of his often did little cathy ask when he would be home mrs earnshaw expected him by supper time on the third evening and she put the meal off hour after hour there were no signs of his coming however and at last the children got tired of running down to the gate to look then it grew dark she would have had them to bed but they begged sadly to be allowed to stay up and just about eleven the door latch was raised quietly and in stepped the master he threw himself into a chair laughing and groaning and bid them all stand off for he was nearly would not have such another walk for the three kingdoms 
 and at the end of it to be flighted to death he said opening his greatcoat which he held bundled up in his arms see here wife i was never so beaten with anything in my life but you must take it as a gift of god though as dark almost as if it came from the devil 
 we crowded round and over miss head i had a peep at a dirty ragged child big enough both to walk and talk indeed its face looked older than yet when it was set on its feet it only stared round and repeated over and over again some gibberish that nobody could understand i was frightened and mrs earnshaw was ready to fling it out of doors she did fly up asking how he could fashion to bring that gipsy brat into the house when they had their own bairns to feed and fend for what he meant to do with it and whether he were mad the master tried to explain the matter but he was really half dead with fatigue and all that i could make out amongst her scolding was a tale of his seeing it starving and houseless and as good as dumb in the streets of liverpool where he picked it up and inquired for its owner not a soul knew to whom it belonged he said and his money and time being both limited he thought it better to take it home with him at once than run into vain expenses there because he was determined he would not leave it as he found it well the conclusion was that my mistress grumbled herself calm and mr earnshaw told me to wash it and give it clean things and let it sleep with the children 
 hindley and cathy contented themselves with looking and listening till peace was restored then both began searching their pockets for the presents he had promised them the former was a boy of fourteen but when he drew out what had been a fiddle crushed to morsels in the greatcoat he blubbered aloud and cathy when she learned the master had lost her whip in attending on the stranger showed her humour by grinning and spitting at the stupid little thing earning for her pains a sound blow from her father to teach her cleaner manners they entirely refused to have it in bed with them or even in their room and i had no more sense so i put it on the landing of the stairs hoping it might be gone on the morrow by chance or else attracted by hearing his voice it crept to mr door and there he found it on quitting his chamber inquiries were made as to how it got there i was obliged to confess and in recompense for my cowardice and inhumanity was sent out of the house 
 this was first introduction to the family on coming back a few days afterwards for i did not consider my banishment perpetual i found they had christened him heathcliff it was the name of a son who died in childhood and it has served him ever since both for christian and surname miss cathy and he were now very thick but hindley hated him and to say the truth i did the same and we plagued and went on with him shamefully for i reasonable enough to feel my injustice and the mistress never put in a word on his behalf when she saw him wronged 
 he seemed a sullen patient child hardened perhaps to he would stand blows without winking or shedding a tear and my pinches moved him only to draw in a breath and open his eyes as if he had hurt himself by accident and nobody was to blame this endurance made old earnshaw furious when he discovered his son persecuting the poor fatherless child as he called him he took to heathcliff strangely believing all he said for that matter he said precious little and generally the truth and petting him up far above cathy who was too mischievous and wayward for a favourite 
 so from the very beginning he bred bad feeling in the house and at mrs death which happened in less than two years after the young master had learned to regard his father as an oppressor rather than a friend and heathcliff as a usurper of his affections and his privileges and he grew bitter with brooding over these injuries i sympathized awhile but when the children fell ill of the measles and i had to tend them and take on me the cares of a woman at once i changed my ideas heathcliff was dangerously sick and while he lay at the worst he would have me constantly by his pillow i suppose he felt i did a good deal for him and he wit to guess that i was compelled to do it however i will say this he was the quietest child that ever nurse watched over the difference between him and the others forced me to be less partial cathy and her brother harassed me terribly he was as uncomplaining as a lamb though hardness not gentleness made him give little trouble 
 he got through and the doctor affirmed it was in a great measure owing to me and praised me for my care i was vain of his commendations and softened towards the being by whose means i earned them and thus hindley lost his last ally still i dote on heathcliff and i wondered often what my master saw to admire so much in the sullen boy who never to my recollection repaid his indulgence by any sign of gratitude he was not insolent to his benefactor he was simply insensible though knowing perfectly the hold he had on his heart and conscious he had only to speak and all the house would be obliged to bend to his wishes as an instance i remember mr earnshaw once bought a couple of colts at the parish fair and gave the lads each one heathcliff took the handsomest but it soon fell lame and when he discovered it he said to hindley 
 you must exchange horses with me i like mine and if you i shall tell your father of the three thrashings given me this week and show him my arm which is black to the shoulder hindley put out his tongue and cuffed him over the ears better do it at once he persisted escaping to the porch they were in the stable you will have to and if i speak of these blows get them again with interest off dog cried hindley threatening him with an iron weight used for weighing potatoes and hay throw it he replied standing still and then tell how you boasted that you would turn me out of doors as soon as he died and see whether he will not turn you out directly hindley threw it hitting him on the breast and down he fell but staggered up immediately breathless and white and had not i prevented it he would have gone just so to the master and got full revenge by letting his condition plead for him intimating who had caused it take my colt gipsy then said young earnshaw and i pray that he may break your neck take him and be damned you beggarly interloper and wheedle my father out of all he has only afterwards show him what you are imp of take that i hope kick out your brains 
 heathcliff had gone to loose the beast and shift it to his own stall he was passing behind it when hindley finished his speech by knocking him under its feet and without stopping to examine whether his hopes were fulfilled ran away as fast as he could i was surprised to witness how coolly the child gathered himself up and went on with his intention exchanging saddles and all and then sitting down on a bundle of hay to overcome the qualm which the violent blow occasioned before he entered the house i persuaded him easily to let me lay the blame of his bruises on the horse he minded little what tale was told since he had what he wanted he complained so seldom indeed of such stirs as these that i really thought him not vindictive i was deceived completely as you will hear

 this was first introduction to the family on coming back a few days afterwards for i did not consider my banishment perpetual i found they had christened him heathcliff it was the name of a son who died in childhood and it has served him ever since both for christian and surname miss cathy and he were now very thick but hindley hated him and to say the truth i did the same and we plagued and went on with him shamefully for i reasonable enough to feel my injustice and the mistress never put in a word on his behalf when she saw him wronged 
 he seemed a sullen patient child hardened perhaps to he would stand blows without winking or shedding a tear and my pinches moved him only to draw in a breath and open his eyes as if he had hurt himself by accident and nobody was to blame this endurance made old earnshaw furious when he discovered his son persecuting the poor fatherless child as he called him he took to heathcliff strangely believing all he said for that matter he said precious little and generally the truth and petting him up far above cathy who was too mischievous and wayward for a favourite 
 so from the very beginning he bred bad feeling in the house and at mrs death which happened in less than two years after the young master had learned to regard his father as an oppressor rather than a friend and heathcliff as a usurper of his affections and his privileges and he grew bitter with brooding over these injuries i sympathized awhile but when the children fell ill of the measles and i had to tend them and take on me the cares of a woman at once i changed my ideas heathcliff was dangerously sick and while he lay at the worst he would have me constantly by his pillow i suppose he felt i did a good deal for him and he wit to guess that i was compelled to do it however i will say this he was the quietest child that ever nurse watched over the difference between him and the others forced me to be less partial cathy and her brother harassed me terribly he was as uncomplaining as a lamb though hardness not gentleness made him give little trouble 
 he got through and the doctor affirmed it was in a great measure owing to me and praised me for my care i was vain of his commendations and softened towards the being by whose means i earned them and thus hindley lost his last ally still i dote on heathcliff and i wondered often what my master saw to admire so much in the sullen boy who never to my recollection repaid his indulgence by any sign of gratitude he was not insolent to his benefactor he was simply insensible though knowing perfectly the hold he had on his heart and conscious he had only to speak and all the house would be obliged to bend to his wishes as an instance i remember mr earnshaw once bought a couple of colts at the parish fair and gave the lads each one heathcliff took the handsomest but it soon fell lame and when he discovered it he said to hindley 
 you must exchange horses with me i like mine and if you i shall tell your father of the three thrashings given me this week and show him my arm which is black to the shoulder hindley put out his tongue and cuffed him over the ears better do it at once he persisted escaping to the porch they were in the stable you will have to and if i speak of these blows get them again with interest off dog cried hindley threatening him with an iron weight used for weighing potatoes and hay throw it he replied standing still and then tell how you boasted that you would turn me out of doors as soon as he died and see whether he will not turn you out directly hindley threw it hitting him on the breast and down he fell but staggered up immediately breathless and white and had not i prevented it he would have gone just so to the master and got full revenge by letting his condition plead for him intimating who had caused it take my colt gipsy then said young earnshaw and i pray that he may break your neck take him and be damned you beggarly interloper and wheedle my father out of all he has only afterwards show him what you are imp of take that i hope kick out your brains 
 heathcliff had gone to loose the beast and shift it to his own stall he was passing behind it when hindley finished his speech by knocking him under its feet and without stopping to examine whether his hopes were fulfilled ran away as fast as he could i was surprised to witness how coolly the child gathered himself up and went on with his intention exchanging saddles and all and then sitting down on a bundle of hay to overcome the qualm which the violent blow occasioned before he entered the house i persuaded him easily to let me lay the blame of his bruises on the horse he minded little what tale was told since he had what he wanted he complained so seldom indeed of such stirs as these that i really thought him not vindictive i was deceived completely as you will hear

 chapter four 
 
 oh dear how hard it does seem to take up our packs and go on sighed meg the morning after the party for now the holidays were over the week of merrymaking did not fit her for going on easily with the task she never liked 
 i wish it was christmas or new all the time it be fun answered jo yawning dismally 
 we enjoy ourselves half so much as we do now but it does seem so nice to have little suppers and bouquets and go to parties and drive home and read and rest and not work like other people you know and i always envy girls who do such things so fond of luxury said meg trying to decide which of two shabby gowns was the least shabby 
 well we have it so let us grumble but shoulder our bundles and trudge along as cheerfully as marmee does sure aunt march is a regular old man of the sea to me but i suppose when learned to carry her without complaining she will tumble off or get so light that i mind her 
 this idea tickled fancy and put her in good spirits but meg brighten for her burden consisting of four spoiled children seemed heavier than ever she had not heart enough even to make herself pretty as usual by putting on a blue neck ribbon and dressing her hair in the most becoming way 
 the use of looking nice when no one sees me but those cross midgets and no one cares whether pretty or not she muttered shutting her drawer with a jerk i shall have to toil and moil all my days with only little bits of fun now and then and get old and ugly and sour because poor and enjoy my life as other girls do a shame 
 so meg went down wearing an injured look and at all agreeable at breakfast time everyone seemed rather out of sorts and inclined to croak 
 beth had a headache and lay on the sofa trying to comfort herself with the cat and three kittens amy was fretting because her lessons were not learned and she find her rubbers jo would whistle and make a great racket getting ready 
 mrs march was very busy trying to finish a letter which must go at once and hannah had the grumps for being up late suit her 
 there never was such a cross family cried jo losing her temper when she had upset an inkstand broken both boot lacings and sat down upon her hat 
 the crossest person in it returned amy washing out the sum that was all wrong with the tears that had fallen on her slate 
 beth if you keep these horrid cats down cellar have them drowned exclaimed meg angrily as she tried to get rid of the kitten which had scrambled up her back and stuck like a burr just out of reach 
 jo laughed meg scolded beth implored and amy wailed because she remember how much nine times twelve was 
 girls girls do be quiet one minute i must get this off by the early mail and you drive me distracted with your worry cried mrs march crossing out the third spoiled sentence in her letter 
 there was a momentary lull broken by hannah who stalked in laid two hot turnovers on the table and stalked out again these turnovers were an institution and the girls called them muffs for they had no others and found the hot pies very comforting to their hands on cold mornings 
 hannah never forgot to make them no matter how busy or grumpy she might be for the walk was long and bleak the poor things got no other lunch and were seldom home before two 
 cuddle your cats and get over your headache bethy goodbye marmee we are a set of rascals this morning but come home regular angels now then meg and jo tramped away feeling that the pilgrims were not setting out as they ought to do 
 they always looked back before turning the corner for their mother was always at the window to nod and smile and wave her hand to them somehow it seemed as if they have got through the day without that for whatever their mood might be the last glimpse of that motherly face was sure to affect them like sunshine 
 if marmee shook her fist instead of kissing her hand to us it would serve us right for more ungrateful wretches than we are were never seen cried jo taking a remorseful satisfaction in the snowy walk and bitter wind use such dreadful expressions replied meg from the depths of the veil in which she had shrouded herself like a nun sick of the world 
 i like good strong words that mean something replied jo catching her hat as it took a leap off her head preparatory to flying away altogether 
 call yourself any names you like but i am neither a rascal nor a wretch and i choose to be called so 
 a blighted being and decidedly cross today because you sit in the lap of luxury all the time poor dear just wait till i make my fortune and you shall revel in carriages and ice cream and slippers and posies and boys to dance with 
 how ridiculous you are jo but meg laughed at the nonsense and felt better in spite of herself 
 lucky for you i am for if i put on crushed airs and tried to be dismal as you do we should be in a nice state thank goodness i can always find something funny to keep me up croak any more but come home jolly a dear 
 jo gave her sister an encouraging pat on the shoulder as they parted for the day each going a different way each hugging her little warm turnover and each trying to be cheerful in spite of wintry weather hard work and the unsatisfied desires of youth 
 when mr march lost his property in trying to help an unfortunate friend the two oldest girls begged to be allowed to do something toward their own support at least believing that they could not begin too early to cultivate energy industry and independence their parents consented and both fell to work with the hearty good will which in spite of all obstacles is sure to succeed at last 
 margaret found a place as nursery governess and felt rich with her small salary as she said she was fond of luxury and her chief trouble was poverty she found it harder to bear than the others because she could remember a time when home was beautiful life full of ease and pleasure and want of any kind unknown she tried not to be envious or discontented but it was very natural that the young girl should long for pretty things gay friends accomplishments and a happy life at the kings she daily saw all she wanted for the older sisters were just out and meg caught frequent glimpses of dainty ball dresses and bouquets heard lively gossip about theaters concerts sleighing parties and merrymakings of all kinds and saw money lavished on trifles which would have been so precious to her poor meg seldom complained but a sense of injustice made her feel bitter toward everyone sometimes for she had not yet learned to know how rich she was in the blessings which alone can make life happy 
 jo happened to suit aunt march who was lame and needed an active person to wait upon her the childless old lady had offered to adopt one of the girls when the troubles came and was much offended because her offer was declined other friends told the marches that they had lost all chance of being remembered in the rich old will but the unworldly marches only said 
 we give up our girls for a dozen fortunes rich or poor we will keep together and be happy in one another 
 the old lady speak to them for a time but happening to meet jo at at a something in her comical face and blunt manners struck the old fancy and she proposed to take her for a companion this did not suit jo at all but she accepted the place since nothing better appeared and to every surprise got on remarkably well with her irascible relative there was an occasional tempest and once jo marched home declaring she bear it longer but aunt march always cleared up quickly and sent for her to come back again with such urgency that she could not refuse for in her heart she rather liked the peppery old lady 
 i suspect that the real attraction was a large library of fine books which was left to dust and spiders since uncle march died jo remembered the kind old gentleman who used to let her build railroads and bridges with his big dictionaries tell her stories about queer pictures in his latin books and buy her cards of gingerbread whenever he met her in the street the dim dusty room with the busts staring down from the tall bookcases the cozy chairs the globes and best of all the wilderness of books in which she could wander where she liked made the library a region of bliss to her 
 the moment aunt march took her nap or was busy with company jo hurried to this quiet place and curling herself up in the easy chair devoured poetry romance history travels and pictures like a regular bookworm but like all happiness it did not last long for as sure as she had just reached the heart of the story the sweetest verse of a song or the most perilous adventure of her traveler a shrill voice called and she had to leave her paradise to wind yarn wash the poodle or read essays by the hour together 
 ambition was to do something very splendid what it was she had no idea as yet but left it for time to tell her and meanwhile found her greatest affliction in the fact that she read run and ride as much as she liked a quick temper sharp tongue and restless spirit were always getting her into scrapes and her life was a series of ups and downs which were both comic and pathetic but the training she received at aunt was just what she needed and the thought that she was doing something to support herself made her happy in spite of the perpetual 
 beth was too bashful to go to had been tried but she suffered so much that it was given up and she did her lessons at home with her father even when he went away and her mother was called to devote her skill and energy to soldiers aid societies beth went faithfully on by herself and did the best she could she was a housewifely little creature and helped hannah keep home neat and comfortable for the workers never thinking of any reward but to be loved long quiet days she spent not lonely nor idle for her little world was peopled with imaginary friends and she was by nature a busy bee there were six dolls to be taken up and dressed every morning for beth was a child still and and loved her pets as well as ever not one whole or handsome one among them all were outcasts till beth took them in for when her sisters outgrew these idols they passed to her because amy would have nothing old or ugly beth cherished them all the more tenderly for that very reason and set up a hospital for infirm dolls no pins were ever stuck into their cotton vitals no harsh words or blows were ever given them no neglect ever saddened the heart or the most repulsive but all were fed and clothed nursed and caressed with an affection which never failed one forlorn fragment of dollanity had belonged to jo and having led a tempestuous life was left a wreck in the rag bag from which dreary poorhouse it was rescued by beth and taken to her refuge having no top to its head she tied on a neat little cap and as both arms and legs were gone she hid these deficiencies by folding it in a blanket and devoting her best bed to this chronic invalid if anyone had known the care lavished on that dolly i think it would have touched their hearts even while they laughed she brought it bits of bouquets she read to it took it out to breathe fresh air hidden under her coat she sang it lullabies and never went to be without kissing its dirty face and whispering tenderly i hope have a good night my poor dear 
 beth had her troubles as well as the others and not being an angel but a very human little girl she often wept a little weep as jo said because she take music lessons and have a fine piano she loved music so dearly tried so hard to learn and practiced away so patiently at the jingling old instrument that it did seem as if someone not to hint aunt march ought to help her nobody did however and nobody saw beth wipe the tears off the yellow keys that keep in tune when she was all alone she sang like a little lark about her work never was too tired for marmee and the girls and day after day said hopefully to herself i know get my music some time if good 
 
 
 there are many beths in the world shy and quiet sitting in corners till needed and living for others so cheerfully that no one sees the sacrifices till the little cricket on the hearth stops chirping and the sweet sunshiny presence vanishes leaving silence and shadow behind 
 if anybody had asked amy what the greatest trial of her life was she would have answered at once my nose when she was a baby jo had accidently dropped her into the coal hod and amy insisted that the fall had ruined her nose forever it was not big nor red like poor it was only rather flat and all the pinching in the world could not give it an aristocratic point no one minded it but herself and it was doing its best to grow but amy felt deeply the want of a grecian nose and drew whole sheets of handsome ones to console herself 
 little raphael as her sisters called her had a decided talent for drawing and was never so happy as when copying flowers designing fairies or illustrating stories with queer specimens of art her teachers complained that instead of doing her sums she covered her slate with animals the blankpages of her atlas were used to copy maps on and caricatures of the most ludicrous description came fluttering out of all her books at unlucky moments she got through her lessons as well as she could and managed to escape reprimands by being a model of deportment she was a great favorite with her mates being and possessing the happy art of pleasing without effort her little airs and graces were much admired so were her accomplishments for besides her drawing she could play twelve tunes crochet and read french without mispronouncing more than of the words she had a plaintive way of saying when papa was rich we did which was very touching and her long words were considered perfectly elegant by the girls 
 amy was in a fair way to be spoiled for everyone petted her and her small vanities and selfishnesses were growing nicely one thing however rather quenched the vanities she had to wear her clothes now mama a particle of taste and amy suffered deeply at having to wear a red instead of a blue bonnet unbecoming gowns and fussy aprons that did not fit everything was good well made and little worn but artistic eyes were much afflicted especially this winter when her school dress was a dull purple with yellow dots and no trimming 
 my only comfort she said to meg with tears in her eyes is that mother take tucks in my dresses whenever naughty as maria mother does my dear really dreadful for sometimes she is so bad her frock is up to her knees and she come to school when i think of this deggerredation i fell that i can bear even my flat nose and purple gown with yellow skyrockets on it 
 meg was confidante and monitor and by some strange attraction of opposites jo was gentle to jo alone did the shy child tell her thoughts and over her big sister beth unconsciously exercised more influence than anyone in the family the two older girls were a great deal to one another but each took one of the younger sisters into her keeping and watched over her in her own way playing mother they called it and put their sisters in the places of discarded dolls with the maternal instinct of litte women 
 has anybody got anything to tell been such a dismal day really dying for some amusement said meg as they sat sewing together that evening 
 i had a queer time with aunt today and as i got the best of it tell you about it began jo who dearly loved to tell stories i was reading that everlasting belsham and droning away as i always do for aunt soon drops off and then i take out some nice book and read like fury till she wakes up i actually made myself sleepy and before she began to nod i gave such a gape that she asked me what i meant by opening my mouth wide enough to take the whole book in at once 
 i wish i could and be done with it said i trying not to be saucy 
 then she gave me a long lecture on my sins and told me to sit and think them over while she just lost herself for a moment she never finds herself very soon so the minute her cap began to bob like a dahlia i whipped the vicar of wakefield out of my pocket and read away with one eye on him and one on aunt just got to where they all tumbled into the water when i forgot and laughed out loud aunt woke up and being more after her nap told me to read a bit and show what frivolous work i preferred to the worthy and instructive belsham i did my very best and she liked it though she only said 
 i understand what all about go back and begin it child 
 back i went and made the primroses as interesting as ever i could once i was wicked enough to stop in a thrilling place and say meekly afraid it tires you i stop now 
 she caught up her knitting which had dropped out of her hands gave me a sharp look through her specs and said in her short way finish the chapter and be impertinent miss 
 did she own she liked it asked meg 
 oh bless you no but she let old belsham rest and when i ran back after my gloves this afternoon there she was so hard at the vicar that she hear me laugh as i danced a jig in the hall because of the good time coming what a pleasant life she might have if only she chose i envy her much in spite of her money for after all rich people have about as many worries as poor ones i think added jo 
 that reminds me said meg that got something to tell it funny like story but i thought about it a good deal as i came home at the kings today i found everybody in a flurry and one of the children said that her oldest brother had done something dreadful and papa had sent him away i heard mrs king crying and mr king talking very loud and grace and ellen turned away their faces when they passed me so i see how red and swollen their eyes were i ask any questions of course but i felt so sorry for them and was rather glad i any wild brothers to do wicked things and disgrace the family 
 i think being disgraced in school is a great deal tryinger than anything bad boys can do said amy shaking her head as if her experience of life had been a deep one susie perkins came to school today with a lovely red carnelian ring i wanted it dreadfully and wished i was her with all my might well she drew a picture of mr davis with a monstrous nose and a hump and the words young ladies my eye is upon you coming out of his mouth in a balloon thing we were laughing over it when all of a sudden his eye was on us and he ordered susie to bring up her slate she was parrylized with fright but she went and oh what do you think he did he took her by the ear just fancy how led her to the recitation platform and made her stand there half and hour holding the slate so everyone could see 
 the girls laugh at the picture asked jo who relished the scrape 
 laugh not one they sat still as mice and susie cried quarts i know she did i envy her then for i felt that millions of carnelian rings have made me happy after that i never never should have got over such a agonizing mortification and amy went on with her work in the proud consciousness of virtue and the successful utterance of two long words in a breath 
 i saw something i liked this morning and i meant to tell it at dinner but i forgot said beth putting basket in order as she talked when i went to get some oysters for hannah mr laurence was in the fish shop but he see me for i kept behind the fish barrel and he was busy with mr cutter the fishman a poor woman came in with a pail a mop and asked mr cutter if he would let her do some scrubbing for a bit of fish because she any dinner for her children and had been disappointed of a work mr cutter was in a hurry and said no rather crossly so she was going away looking hungry and sorry when mr laurence hooked up a big fish with the crooked end of his cane and held it out to her she was so glad and surprised she took it right into her arms and thanked him over and over he told her to go along and cook it and she hurried off so happy it good of him oh she did look so funny hugging the big slippery fish and hoping mr bed in heaven would be aisy 
 when they had laughed at story they asked their mother for one and after a moments thought she said soberly as i sat cutting out blue flannel jackets today at the rooms i felt very anxious about father and thought how lonely and helpless we should be if anything happened to him it was not a wise thing to do but i kept on worrying till an old man came in with an order for some clothes he sat down near me and i began to talk to him for he looked poor and tired and anxious 
 have you sons in the army i asked for the note he brought was not to me 
 yes i had four but two were killed one is a prisoner and going to the other who is very sick in a washington hospital he answered quietly 
 you have done a great deal for your country sir i said feeling respect now instead of pity 
 not a mite more than i ought go myself if i was any use as i i give my boys and give em free 
 he spoke so cheerfully looked so sincere and seemed so glad to give his all that i was ashamed of myself given one man and thought it too much while he gave four without grudging them i had all my girls to comfort me at home and his last son was waiting miles away to say to him perhaps i felt so rich so happy thinking of my blessings that i made him a nice bundle gave him some money and thanked him heartily for the lesson he had taught me 
 tell another story mother one with a moral to it like this i like to think about them afterward if they are real and not too preachy said jo after a silence 
 mrs march smiled and began at once for she had told stories to this little audience for many years and knew how to please them 
 once upon a time there were four girls who had enough to eat and drink and wear a good many comforts and pleasures kind friends and parents who loved them dearly and yet they were not contented 
 here the listeners stole sly looks at one another and began to sew diligently 
 these girls were anxious to be good and made many excellent resolutions but they did not keep them very well and were constantly saying if only we had this or if we could only do that quite forgetting how much they already had and how many things they actually could do so they asked an old woman what spell they could use to make them happy and she said when you feel discontented think over your blessings and be grateful here jo looked up quickly as if about to speak but changed her mind seeing that the story was not done yet 
 being sensible girls they decided to try her advice and soon were surprised to see how well off they were one discovered that money keep shame and sorrow out of rich houses another that though she was poor she was a great deal happier with her youth health and good spirits than a certain fretful feeble old lady who enjoy her comforts a third that disagreeable as it was to help get dinner it was harder still to go begging for it and the fourth that even carnelian rings were not so valuable as good behavior so they agreed to stop complaining to enjoy the blessings already possessed and try to deserve them lest they should be taken away entirely instead of increased and i believe they were never disappointed or sorry that they took the old advice 
 now marmee that is very cunning of you to turn our own stories against us and give us a sermon instead of a romance cried meg 
 i like that kind of sermon the sort father used to tell us said beth thoughtfully putting the needles straight on cushion 
 i complain near as much as the others do and i shall be more careful than ever now for had warning from downfall said amy morally 
 we needed that lesson and we forget it if we do so you just say to us as old chloe did in uncle tom tink ob yer marcies chillen tink ob yer marcies added jo who could not for the life of her help getting a morsel of fun out of the little sermon though she took it to heart as much as any of them

 i suspect that the real attraction was a large library of fine books which was left to dust and spiders since uncle march died jo remembered the kind old gentleman who used to let her build railroads and bridges with his big dictionaries tell her stories about queer pictures in his latin books and buy her cards of gingerbread whenever he met her in the street the dim dusty room with the busts staring down from the tall bookcases the cozy chairs the globes and best of all the wilderness of books in which she could wander where she liked made the library a region of bliss to her 
 the moment aunt march took her nap or was busy with company jo hurried to this quiet place and curling herself up in the easy chair devoured poetry romance history travels and pictures like a regular bookworm but like all happiness it did not last long for as sure as she had just reached the heart of the story the sweetest verse of a song or the most perilous adventure of her traveler a shrill voice called and she had to leave her paradise to wind yarn wash the poodle or read essays by the hour together 
 ambition was to do something very splendid what it was she had no idea as yet but left it for time to tell her and meanwhile found her greatest affliction in the fact that she read run and ride as much as she liked a quick temper sharp tongue and restless spirit were always getting her into scrapes and her life was a series of ups and downs which were both comic and pathetic but the training she received at aunt was just what she needed and the thought that she was doing something to support herself made her happy in spite of the perpetual 
 beth was too bashful to go to had been tried but she suffered so much that it was given up and she did her lessons at home with her father even when he went away and her mother was called to devote her skill and energy to soldiers aid societies beth went faithfully on by herself and did the best she could she was a housewifely little creature and helped hannah keep home neat and comfortable for the workers never thinking of any reward but to be loved long quiet days she spent not lonely nor idle for her little world was peopled with imaginary friends and she was by nature a busy bee there were six dolls to be taken up and dressed every morning for beth was a child still and and loved her pets as well as ever not one whole or handsome one among them all were outcasts till beth took them in for when her sisters outgrew these idols they passed to her because amy would have nothing old or ugly beth cherished them all the more tenderly for that very reason and set up a hospital for infirm dolls no pins were ever stuck into their cotton vitals no harsh words or blows were ever given them no neglect ever saddened the heart or the most repulsive but all were fed and clothed nursed and caressed with an affection which never failed one forlorn fragment of dollanity had belonged to jo and having led a tempestuous life was left a wreck in the rag bag from which dreary poorhouse it was rescued by beth and taken to her refuge having no top to its head she tied on a neat little cap and as both arms and legs were gone she hid these deficiencies by folding it in a blanket and devoting her best bed to this chronic invalid if anyone had known the care lavished on that dolly i think it would have touched their hearts even while they laughed she brought it bits of bouquets she read to it took it out to breathe fresh air hidden under her coat she sang it lullabies and never went to be without kissing its dirty face and whispering tenderly i hope have a good night my poor dear 
 beth had her troubles as well as the others and not being an angel but a very human little girl she often wept a little weep as jo said because she take music lessons and have a fine piano she loved music so dearly tried so hard to learn and practiced away so patiently at the jingling old instrument that it did seem as if someone not to hint aunt march ought to help her nobody did however and nobody saw beth wipe the tears off the yellow keys that keep in tune when she was all alone she sang like a little lark about her work never was too tired for marmee and the girls and day after day said hopefully to herself i know get my music some time if good 
 
 
 there are many beths in the world shy and quiet sitting in corners till needed and living for others so cheerfully that no one sees the sacrifices till the little cricket on the hearth stops chirping and the sweet sunshiny presence vanishes leaving silence and shadow behind 
 if anybody had asked amy what the greatest trial of her life was she would have answered at once my nose when she was a baby jo had accidently dropped her into the coal hod and amy insisted that the fall had ruined her nose forever it was not big nor red like poor it was only rather flat and all the pinching in the world could not give it an aristocratic point no one minded it but herself and it was doing its best to grow but amy felt deeply the want of a grecian nose and drew whole sheets of handsome ones to console herself 
 little raphael as her sisters called her had a decided talent for drawing and was never so happy as when copying flowers designing fairies or illustrating stories with queer specimens of art her teachers complained that instead of doing her sums she covered her slate with animals the blankpages of her atlas were used to copy maps on and caricatures of the most ludicrous description came fluttering out of all her books at unlucky moments she got through her lessons as well as she could and managed to escape reprimands by being a model of deportment she was a great favorite with her mates being and possessing the happy art of pleasing without effort her little airs and graces were much admired so were her accomplishments for besides her drawing she could play twelve tunes crochet and read french without mispronouncing more than of the words she had a plaintive way of saying when papa was rich we did which was very touching and her long words were considered perfectly elegant by the girls 
 amy was in a fair way to be spoiled for everyone petted her and her small vanities and selfishnesses were growing nicely one thing however rather quenched the vanities she had to wear her clothes now mama a particle of taste and amy suffered deeply at having to wear a red instead of a blue bonnet unbecoming gowns and fussy aprons that did not fit everything was good well made and little worn but artistic eyes were much afflicted especially this winter when her school dress was a dull purple with yellow dots and no trimming 
 my only comfort she said to meg with tears in her eyes is that mother take tucks in my dresses whenever naughty as maria mother does my dear really dreadful for sometimes she is so bad her frock is up to her knees and she come to school when i think of this deggerredation i fell that i can bear even my flat nose and purple gown with yellow skyrockets on it 
 meg was confidante and monitor and by some strange attraction of opposites jo was gentle to jo alone did the shy child tell her thoughts and over her big sister beth unconsciously exercised more influence than anyone in the family the two older girls were a great deal to one another but each took one of the younger sisters into her keeping and watched over her in her own way playing mother they called it and put their sisters in the places of discarded dolls with the maternal instinct of litte women 
 has anybody got anything to tell been such a dismal day really dying for some amusement said meg as they sat sewing together that evening 
 i had a queer time with aunt today and as i got the best of it tell you about it began jo who dearly loved to tell stories i was reading that everlasting belsham and droning away as i always do for aunt soon drops off and then i take out some nice book and read like fury till she wakes up i actually made myself sleepy and before she began to nod i gave such a gape that she asked me what i meant by opening my mouth wide enough to take the whole book in at once 
 i wish i could and be done with it said i trying not to be saucy 
 then she gave me a long lecture on my sins and told me to sit and think them over while she just lost herself for a moment she never finds herself very soon so the minute her cap began to bob like a dahlia i whipped the vicar of wakefield out of my pocket and read away with one eye on him and one on aunt just got to where they all tumbled into the water when i forgot and laughed out loud aunt woke up and being more after her nap told me to read a bit and show what frivolous work i preferred to the worthy and instructive belsham i did my very best and she liked it though she only said 
 i understand what all about go back and begin it child 
 back i went and made the primroses as interesting as ever i could once i was wicked enough to stop in a thrilling place and say meekly afraid it tires you i stop now 
 she caught up her knitting which had dropped out of her hands gave me a sharp look through her specs and said in her short way finish the chapter and be impertinent miss 
 did she own she liked it asked meg 
 oh bless you no but she let old belsham rest and when i ran back after my gloves this afternoon there she was so hard at the vicar that she hear me laugh as i danced a jig in the hall because of the good time coming what a pleasant life she might have if only she chose i envy her much in spite of her money for after all rich people have about as many worries as poor ones i think added jo 
 that reminds me said meg that got something to tell it funny like story but i thought about it a good deal as i came home at the kings today i found everybody in a flurry and one of the children said that her oldest brother had done something dreadful and papa had sent him away i heard mrs king crying and mr king talking very loud and grace and ellen turned away their faces when they passed me so i see how red and swollen their eyes were i ask any questions of course but i felt so sorry for them and was rather glad i any wild brothers to do wicked things and disgrace the family 
 i think being disgraced in school is a great deal tryinger than anything bad boys can do said amy shaking her head as if her experience of life had been a deep one susie perkins came to school today with a lovely red carnelian ring i wanted it dreadfully and wished i was her with all my might well she drew a picture of mr davis with a monstrous nose and a hump and the words young ladies my eye is upon you coming out of his mouth in a balloon thing we were laughing over it when all of a sudden his eye was on us and he ordered susie to bring up her slate she was parrylized with fright but she went and oh what do you think he did he took her by the ear just fancy how led her to the recitation platform and made her stand there half and hour holding the slate so everyone could see 
 the girls laugh at the picture asked jo who relished the scrape 
 laugh not one they sat still as mice and susie cried quarts i know she did i envy her then for i felt that millions of carnelian rings have made me happy after that i never never should have got over such a agonizing mortification and amy went on with her work in the proud consciousness of virtue and the successful utterance of two long words in a breath 
 i saw something i liked this morning and i meant to tell it at dinner but i forgot said beth putting basket in order as she talked when i went to get some oysters for hannah mr laurence was in the fish shop but he see me for i kept behind the fish barrel and he was busy with mr cutter the fishman a poor woman came in with a pail a mop and asked mr cutter if he would let her do some scrubbing for a bit of fish because she any dinner for her children and had been disappointed of a work mr cutter was in a hurry and said no rather crossly so she was going away looking hungry and sorry when mr laurence hooked up a big fish with the crooked end of his cane and held it out to her she was so glad and surprised she took it right into her arms and thanked him over and over he told her to go along and cook it and she hurried off so happy it good of him oh she did look so funny hugging the big slippery fish and hoping mr bed in heaven would be aisy 
 when they had laughed at story they asked their mother for one and after a moments thought she said soberly as i sat cutting out blue flannel jackets today at the rooms i felt very anxious about father and thought how lonely and helpless we should be if anything happened to him it was not a wise thing to do but i kept on worrying till an old man came in with an order for some clothes he sat down near me and i began to talk to him for he looked poor and tired and anxious 
 have you sons in the army i asked for the note he brought was not to me 
 yes i had four but two were killed one is a prisoner and going to the other who is very sick in a washington hospital he answered quietly 
 you have done a great deal for your country sir i said feeling respect now instead of pity 
 not a mite more than i ought go myself if i was any use as i i give my boys and give em free 
 he spoke so cheerfully looked so sincere and seemed so glad to give his all that i was ashamed of myself given one man and thought it too much while he gave four without grudging them i had all my girls to comfort me at home and his last son was waiting miles away to say to him perhaps i felt so rich so happy thinking of my blessings that i made him a nice bundle gave him some money and thanked him heartily for the lesson he had taught me 
 tell another story mother one with a moral to it like this i like to think about them afterward if they are real and not too preachy said jo after a silence 
 mrs march smiled and began at once for she had told stories to this little audience for many years and knew how to please them 
 once upon a time there were four girls who had enough to eat and drink and wear a good many comforts and pleasures kind friends and parents who loved them dearly and yet they were not contented 
 here the listeners stole sly looks at one another and began to sew diligently 
 these girls were anxious to be good and made many excellent resolutions but they did not keep them very well and were constantly saying if only we had this or if we could only do that quite forgetting how much they already had and how many things they actually could do so they asked an old woman what spell they could use to make them happy and she said when you feel discontented think over your blessings and be grateful here jo looked up quickly as if about to speak but changed her mind seeing that the story was not done yet 
 being sensible girls they decided to try her advice and soon were surprised to see how well off they were one discovered that money keep shame and sorrow out of rich houses another that though she was poor she was a great deal happier with her youth health and good spirits than a certain fretful feeble old lady who enjoy her comforts a third that disagreeable as it was to help get dinner it was harder still to go begging for it and the fourth that even carnelian rings were not so valuable as good behavior so they agreed to stop complaining to enjoy the blessings already possessed and try to deserve them lest they should be taken away entirely instead of increased and i believe they were never disappointed or sorry that they took the old advice 
 now marmee that is very cunning of you to turn our own stories against us and give us a sermon instead of a romance cried meg 
 i like that kind of sermon the sort father used to tell us said beth thoughtfully putting the needles straight on cushion 
 i complain near as much as the others do and i shall be more careful than ever now for had warning from downfall said amy morally 
 we needed that lesson and we forget it if we do so you just say to us as old chloe did in uncle tom tink ob yer marcies chillen tink ob yer marcies added jo who could not for the life of her help getting a morsel of fun out of the little sermon though she took it to heart as much as any of them

 and then suddenly the volcano shifts across the horizon 
 passing across the sun as it goes a mirage 
 the americans crash their horses to a stop and race the other 
 way after the volcano evelyn and jonathan smile amazed 
 the volcano shifts again floating across the watery horizon 
 the americans crash to a stop again and chase after the 
 volcano all three of them confused and cursing 
 and beni just stare waiting the volcano shifts again and 
 the americans crash to a stop again burns is thrown from his 
 horse henderson angrily rips his hat off and chucks it to 
 the ground daniels just curses as they give up the chase

 the americans are on the far right nothing moves a beat 
 and then grins so does beni they share a look 
 and then swat their camels and race away everybody else 
 after them and beni are 
 and then evelyn comes galloping up hair flying in the wind

 trying to knock him off his camel once crack twice crack 
 but on the third try grabs the whip and jerks beni 
 off his camel beni slams to the ground and tumbles 
 evelyn and race across the desert evelyn has never

 evelyn ignores him as she races up the ramp towards the gate 
 
 slow down evelyn slow down 
 a really big 
 int hamunaptra day 
 evelyn goes through the air and crash lands 
 in a sand dune she sits up stunned sandy hair in her eyes 
 stops at the edge of the ramp next to her camel 
 
 never mind 
 the americans ride up and look in wonder at the ruins inside 
 the volcano gives them a big grin 
 
 you boys owe me five hundred dollars 
 ext hamunaptra day 
 under the guidance of the egyptologist the diggers are busy 
 hauling rock and dirt out of the temple doorway the three 
 americans are playing poker beni smokes a hookah and swats 
 flies dozens of stray camels roam the decrepit city dusty 
 backpacks and old saddlebags still slung over their humps 
 daniels 
 all these camels come from 
 beni 
 they belong to the dead they 
 will wait years for their 
 masters to return before leaving 
 ext our heroes dig day 
 evelyn jonathan and the warden are working next 
 to a narrow crevice which weaves way through the ruins 
 ties a rope around a pillar and throws the rest of 
 the coils into the crevice about to rappel down jonathan 
 bends over to have a look his ass hits something he yelps 
 and backs away the decrepit face of anubis 
 jonathan 
 that thing gives me the creeps 
 
 be nice that thing saved my life 
 evelyn is positioning ancient mirrors along the crevice 
 evelyn 
 that thing gets me excited 
 
 sarcastic 
 the things that get you excited 
 evelyn 
 according to bembridge scholars 
 inside the statue of anubis was 
 a secret compartment perhaps 
 containing the book of the living 
 
 what are those mirrors for 
 evelyn 
 ancient egyptian trick see 
 shrugs then rappels down into the crevice 
 int chamber day 
 waves a torch as jonathan evelyn and the warden 
 drop down next to him evelyn peers into the spooky darkness 
 evelyn 
 do you realize we are standing 
 inside a room that no one has 
 entered in over four thousand years 
 warden 
 who cares i see no treasure 
 
 welcome to my share of 
 the spider webs 
 jonathan 
 and it stinks to high heaven in here 
 evelyn just rolls her eyes 
 evelyn 
 cretins 
 jonathan sniffs the foul air then he looks at the warden and 
 realizes where the smell is coming from he stops sniffing 
 evelyn brushes cobwebs away from a metal disk on the wall 
 then repositions it on pedestal aiming it at a ray of 
 light shining in from the outer mirrors the ray of light 
 hits the disk and quickly shoots around the room from one 
 disk to another until the whole chamber is lit up light rays 
 shoot off down the passageways the chamber 
 
 that is a neat trick 
 evelyn 
 oh my god a preparation room 
 
 preparation for what 
 evelyn 
 for entering the afterlife 
 quickly draws his gun jonathan gently nudges him 
 jonathan 
 mummies my good son this is 
 where they made the mummies 
 evelyn heads down a narrow passageway the others follow 
 int labyrinth day 
 evelyn and jonathan crouch as they make their way 
 through a narrow cobweb infested labyrinth the short squat 
 warden can stand straight up then they hear something and 
 freeze it sounds like somebody is clawing inside the walls 
 they share looks then slowly move forward getting darker 
 and darker as they go the strange sound getting louder and 
 louder and then it stops evelyn holds her breath jonathan 
 licks his lips cocks his pistol the warden farts 
 jonathan and evelyn glare at him 
 anubis chamber day 
 they slowly creep out of the labyrinth and up to the foot of 
 an enormous statue the lower half of anubis 
 then they hear the sound again coming closer now from the 
 other side of the statue and closer pulls evelyn 
 behind him and closer raises his gun and closer 
 leaps out three horrible sweaty faces lunge at 
 him reacts but pull the trigger because 
 just the americans their guns are up cocked and aimed 
 henderson 
 ya scared the bejeezus out of 
 us 
 
 likewise 
 but nobody lowers their guns daniels grins the tough one 
 daniels 
 this here is our 
 
 see your name on 
 and when beni five diggers and the egyptologist step 
 out of the shadows all holding guns aimed at 
 beni 
 ten to one your 
 odds are 
 
 had worse 
 jonathan clenches a tiny derringer 
 jonathan 
 yes me too 
 gives him a sideways glance beni cocks his gun 
 grinning he wants it to happen the tension thickens then 
 evelyn gently takes gun hand and pulls it down 
 evelyn 
 be nice children if 
 going to play together 
 we must learn to share 
 evelyn pulls away jonathan and the warden follow 
 beni and the americans slowly lower their guns laughing the 
 egyptologist excitedly begins translating the hieroglyphs 
 int imhotepis chamber day 
 and jonathan are using against the 
 ceiling evelyn is gently chipping away with a tiny chisel 
 evelyn 
 according to my calculations 
 we should be right under the 
 statue come up right 
 between his legs 
 she blushes and laughs 
 oh my 
 jonathan 
 and when those dirty yanks go 
 to sleep 
 looks at 
 no offense 
 
 none taken 
 jonathan 
 sneak up and steal that 
 book right out from under them 
 
 and sure you can find the 
 secret compartment

 jonathan looks around

 those guys around here somewhere 
 flaming room night 
 hot melted wax covers face as he holds his sore eye 
 and struggles to the door then he notices the on the 
 floor he bends over to pick it up and when the door 
 is kicked open again it hits him in the ass and knocks him 
 into the fire jonathan leans in sees nothing but flames 
 jonathan 
 evy 
 then he sees the on the floor and picks it up 
 a hand suddenly snatches the away from him 
 jonathan 
 hey mine 
 hook his backside is now on fire he lifts his pistol 
 jonathan quickly backpedals out the door as hook opens fire 
 ext camel paddock night 
 and evelyn race out onto the deck near the horse 
 paddock people are screaming and shouting lots of panic 
 blam a chunk of the wall is blown off next to head 
 pivots and fires back the last mumia on the 
 other side of the paddock he and exchange gunfire 
 another lantern bursts into flames shoots off the 
 paddock lock the horses go nuts fires over their 
 heads they charge forward and crash through the door the 
 mumia screams as the horses stampede over him flames sweep 
 up the walls and race across the roof half the barge is now 
 on fire throws the over his shoulder 
 
 can you swim 
 evelyn

 he picks her up and throws her over the side 
 
 the occasion calls for it 
 evelyn splashes into the water dives in after her 
 ext barge bow night 
 jonathan runs out onto the bow sees the three americans 
 guns in every hand fanning their pistols shooting 
 everything in sight jonathan just shakes his head 
 jonathan 
 americans 
 hook suddenly stumbles up behind him now a flaming torch 
 jonathan turns around hook grabs him by the throat with his 
 flaming arm and pins him to the cabin wall eyes 
 widen as he sees a hook rising up inside the flames about to 
 strike him the americans pivot and open fire blow hook over 
 the railing jonathan turns to the americans and smiles 
 jonathan 
 i say good show 
 then he points his thumb at himself 
 jonathan 
 and did i panic 
 he lifts up his other hand he has the back 
 jonathan 
 i think not 
 and when the horses stampede onto the bow jonathan 
 dives over one side the three americans dive over the other 
 nile riverbank night 
 evelyn jonathan and the warden wade out of the 
 water nightgown clings tight to her body as she 
 wrings it out she looks good notices everybody 
 else including the horses is getting out on the far shore 
 spots beni running up to the americans 
 beni 
 hey looks to me 
 like i got all the horses

 beni looks up at the stars then angrily kicks the sand 
 cursing the flaming barge drifts off slowly sinking 
 bedouin trading post day 
 barters in arabic with a camel trader at a trading 
 post jonathan forks over some cash the trader hands them 
 the reins of four ugly old camels

 we had to do was give em your sister 
 
 jonathan 
 yes awfully tempting it

 and when evelyn steps out of a trading tent 
 changed into a gorgeous tightly fitted bedouin dress 
 
 then again 
 sahara desert sand dunes day 
 evelyn jonathan and the warden are on camels in 
 the middle of the frying pan the endless sunbaked sahara 
 jonathan 
 never did like camels filthy 
 buggers they smell they bite 
 they spit disgusting 
 the warden savagely attacks a chicken wing with his vile 
 green teeth flies buzz around his head he sucks at his 
 gums then spits out some gristle watches him 
 
 yeah disgusting 
 evelyn is having the time of her life on top of her camel 
 evelyn 
 well i think cute 
 we do several time dissolves showing the majesty of the 
 desert and our heroes getting deeper and deeper into it 
 frying pan night 
 the moon shines down an four lone camel trekking 
 across the vast wasteland 
 jonathan is sound asleep his head bobbing comically to 
 the rhythm of his camel on the camel next to him the 
 warden snores loudly up in front of them evelyn slowly 
 starts to slide off her saddle reaches over and 
 stops her then gently pushes her back up onto her saddle 
 never waking her for a long moment his eyes watch evelyn 
 and then he looks up at a distant ridge 
 where ardeth bay and a group of mumia riders are pacing them 
 ext giant sand dune endless horizon day 
 the dawning sun yet crested the distant horizon as 
 jonathan and the warden ride alongside a giant sand dune 
 jonathan 
 and you snore 
 warden 
 i do not snore 
 jonathan 
 all night you snored 
 warden 
 i have never snored 
 up in front of them looks at evelyn 
 
 almost there 
 evelyn 
 are you sure 
 looks down at the ground 
 
 pretty sure 
 the others look down and see dozens of skeletons sticking out 
 of the ground bleached and eaten away some of the skeletons 
 look like trying to crawl up out of the desert floor 
 jonathan 
 what in bloody hell is this 
 the warden shivers in fear 
 warden 
 other seekers of hamunaptra 
 the american expedition rides out from behind the far end of 
 the dune the americans are accompanied by two dozen native 
 diggers and an arab egyptologist beni rides lead on a camel 
 the rest ride horses 
 beni 
 good morning my friend 
 just nods the two parties come to a stop a hundred 
 feet apart turns and stares out across the endless 
 horizon beni does likewise the americans look puzzled 
 daniels 
 well what the hell we doin 
 beni 
 patience my good sahib patience 
 henderson looks over at 
 henderson 
 first one to the city 
 five hundred cash bucks 
 and beni just stare out at the flat nothingness 
 evelyn and jonathan share a look and then the sun starts to 
 rise in the distance breaking the flat horizon 
 
 get ready 
 evelyn can feel the suspense and the majesty of the moment 
 evelyn 
 for what 
 
 about to be shown the way 
 far off to the right a huge shape begins to rise with the 
 sun a volcano and beni watch it expressionless 
 daniels henderson and burns share a look and then 
 
 heya 
 the americans take off racing towards the rising volcano 
 daniels 
 see ya there 
 evelyn and jonathan give anxious sarcastic looks 
 jonathan 
 ah begging your pardon but 
 we be going 
 evelyn 
 after all you rode us night 
 and day to win that bet 
 say a word staring hard 
 beni watches the americans and spits into the sand 
 beni 
 fools 
 
 and then suddenly the volcano shifts across the horizon 
 passing across the sun as it goes a mirage 
 the americans crash their horses to a stop and race the other 
 way after the volcano evelyn and jonathan smile amazed 
 the volcano shifts again floating across the watery horizon 
 the americans crash to a stop again and chase after the 
 volcano all three of them confused and cursing 
 and beni just stare waiting the volcano shifts again and 
 the americans crash to a stop again burns is thrown from his 
 horse henderson angrily rips his hat off and chucks it to 
 the ground daniels just curses as they give up the chase 
 the volcano comes to a stop on the far left of the horizon 
 the americans are on the far right nothing moves a beat 
 and then grins so does beni they share a look 
 and then swat their camels and race away everybody else 
 after them and beni are 
 and then evelyn comes galloping up hair flying in the wind 
 beni takes out his camel whip and starts whipping 
 trying to knock him off his camel once crack twice crack 
 but on the third try grabs the whip and jerks beni 
 off his camel beni slams to the ground and tumbles 
 evelyn and race across the desert evelyn has never 
 felt so alive she laughs grins he likes this 
 girl beni stumbles to his feet then quickly dances out of 
 the way as jonathan and all the other riders stampede past 
 him evelyn beats to the stone ramp racing hard 
 
 evelyn slow down 
 evelyn ignores him as she races up the ramp towards the gate 
 
 slow down evelyn slow down 
 a really big 
 int hamunaptra day 
 evelyn goes through the air and crash lands 
 in a sand dune she sits up stunned sandy hair in her eyes 
 stops at the edge of the ramp next to her camel 
 
 never mind 
 the americans ride up and look in wonder at the ruins inside 
 the volcano gives them a big grin 
 
 you boys owe me five hundred dollars 
 ext hamunaptra day 
 under the guidance of the egyptologist the diggers are busy 
 hauling rock and dirt out of the temple doorway the three 
 americans are playing poker beni smokes a hookah and swats 
 flies dozens of stray camels roam the decrepit city dusty 
 backpacks and old saddlebags still slung over their humps 
 daniels 
 all these camels come from 
 beni 
 they belong to the dead they 
 will wait years for their 
 masters to return before leaving 
 ext our heroes dig day 
 evelyn jonathan and the warden are working next 
 to a narrow crevice which weaves way through the ruins 
 ties a rope around a pillar and throws the rest of 
 the coils into the crevice about to rappel down jonathan 
 bends over to have a look his ass hits something he yelps 
 and backs away the decrepit face of anubis 
 jonathan 
 that thing gives me the creeps 
 
 be nice that thing saved my life 
 evelyn is positioning ancient mirrors along the crevice 
 evelyn 
 that thing gets me excited 
 
 sarcastic 
 the things that get you excited 
 evelyn 
 according to bembridge scholars 
 inside the statue of anubis was 
 a secret compartment perhaps 
 containing the book of the living 
 
 what are those mirrors for 
 evelyn 
 ancient egyptian trick see 
 shrugs then rappels down into the crevice 
 int chamber day 
 waves a torch as jonathan evelyn and the warden 
 drop down next to him evelyn peers into the spooky darkness 
 evelyn 
 do you realize we are standing 
 inside a room that no one has 
 entered in over four thousand years 
 warden 
 who cares i see no treasure 
 
 welcome to my share of 
 the spider webs 
 jonathan 
 and it stinks to high heaven in here 
 evelyn just rolls her eyes 
 evelyn 
 cretins 
 jonathan sniffs the foul air then he looks at the warden and 
 realizes where the smell is coming from he stops sniffing 
 evelyn brushes cobwebs away from a metal disk on the wall 
 then repositions it on pedestal aiming it at a ray of 
 light shining in from the outer mirrors the ray of light 
 hits the disk and quickly shoots around the room from one 
 disk to another until the whole chamber is lit up light rays 
 shoot off down the passageways the chamber 
 
 that is a neat trick 
 evelyn 
 oh my god a preparation room 
 
 preparation for what 
 evelyn 
 for entering the afterlife 
 quickly draws his gun jonathan gently nudges him 
 jonathan 
 mummies my good son this is 
 where they made the mummies 
 evelyn heads down a narrow passageway the others follow 
 int labyrinth day 
 evelyn and jonathan crouch as they make their way 
 through a narrow cobweb infested labyrinth the short squat 
 warden can stand straight up then they hear something and 
 freeze it sounds like somebody is clawing inside the walls 
 they share looks then slowly move forward getting darker 
 and darker as they go the strange sound getting louder and 
 louder and then it stops evelyn holds her breath jonathan 
 licks his lips cocks his pistol the warden farts 
 jonathan and evelyn glare at him 
 anubis chamber day 
 they slowly creep out of the labyrinth and up to the foot of 
 an enormous statue the lower half of anubis 
 then they hear the sound again coming closer now from the 
 other side of the statue and closer pulls evelyn 
 behind him and closer raises his gun and closer 
 leaps out three horrible sweaty faces lunge at 
 him reacts but pull the trigger because 
 just the americans their guns are up cocked and aimed 
 henderson 
 ya scared the bejeezus out of 
 us 
 
 likewise 
 but nobody lowers their guns daniels grins the tough one 
 daniels 
 this here is our 
 
 see your name on 
 and when beni five diggers and the egyptologist step 
 out of the shadows all holding guns aimed at 
 beni 
 ten to one your 
 odds are 
 
 had worse 
 jonathan clenches a tiny derringer 
 jonathan 
 yes me too 
 gives him a sideways glance beni cocks his gun 
 grinning he wants it to happen the tension thickens then 
 evelyn gently takes gun hand and pulls it down 
 evelyn 
 be nice children if 
 going to play together 
 we must learn to share 
 evelyn pulls away jonathan and the warden follow 
 beni and the americans slowly lower their guns laughing the 
 egyptologist excitedly begins translating the hieroglyphs 
 int imhotepis chamber day 
 and jonathan are using against the 
 ceiling evelyn is gently chipping away with a tiny chisel 
 evelyn 
 according to my calculations 
 we should be right under the 
 statue come up right 
 between his legs 
 she blushes and laughs 
 oh my 
 jonathan 
 and when those dirty yanks go 
 to sleep 
 looks at 
 no offense 
 
 none taken 
 jonathan 
 sneak up and steal that 
 book right out from under them 
 
 and sure you can find the 
 secret compartment 
 evelyn 
 yes if their egyptologist 
 already found it 
 jonathan looks around 
 jonathan 
 i say our smelly little 
 friend got himself up to

 who has won to mastership 
 
 eh what i say i speak true when i say dat buck two devils 
 this was speech next morning when he discovered spitz missing and buck covered with wounds he drew him to the fire and by its light pointed them out 
 dat spitz fight like hell said perrault as he surveyed the gaping rips and cuts 
 an dat buck fight like two hells was answer and now we make good time no more spitz no more trouble sure 
 while perrault packed the camp outfit and loaded the sled the proceeded to harness the dogs buck trotted up to the place spitz would have occupied as leader but francois not noticing him brought to the coveted position in his judgment was the best left buck sprang upon in a fury driving him back and standing in his place 
 eh eh francois cried slapping his thighs gleefully look at dat buck him kill dat spitz him think to take de job 
 go way hook he cried but buck refused to budge 
 he took buck by the scruff of the neck and though the dog growled threateningly dragged him to one side and replaced the old dog did not like it and showed plainly that he was afraid of buck francois was obdurate but when he turned his back buck again displaced who was not at all unwilling to go 
 francois was angry now by gar i fix you he cried coming back with a heavy club in his hand 
 buck remembered the man in the red sweater and retreated slowly nor did he attempt to charge in when was once more brought forward but he circled just beyond the range of the club snarling with bitterness and rage and while he circled he watched the club so as to dodge it if thrown by francois for he was become wise in the way of clubs 
 the driver went about his work and he called to buck when he was ready to put him in his old place in front of dave buck retreated two or three steps francois followed him up whereupon he again retreated after some time of this francois threw down the club thinking that buck feared a thrashing but buck was in open revolt he wanted not to escape a clubbing but to have the leadership it was his by right he had earned it and he would not be content with less 
 perrault took a hand between them they ran him about for the better part of an hour they threw clubs at him he dodged they cursed him and his fathers and mothers before him and all his seed to come after him down to the remotest generation and every hair on his body and drop of blood in his veins and he answered curse with snarl and kept out of their reach he did not try to run away but retreated around and around the camp advertising plainly that when his desire was met he would come in and be good 
 francois sat down and scratched his head perrault looked at his watch and swore time was flying and they should have been on the trail an hour gone francois scratched his head again he shook it and grinned sheepishly at the courier who shrugged his shoulders in sign that they were beaten then francois went up to where stood and called to buck buck laughed as dogs laugh yet kept his distance francois unfastened traces and put him back in his old place the team stood harnessed to the sled in an unbroken line ready for the trail there was no place for buck save at the front once more francois called and once more buck laughed and kept away 
 throw down de club perrault commanded 
 francois complied whereupon buck trotted in laughing triumphantly and swung around into position at the head of the team his traces were fastened the sled broken out and with both men running they dashed out on to the river trail 
 highly as the had forevalued buck with his two devils he found while the day was yet young that he had undervalued at a bound buck took up the duties of leadership and where judgment was required and quick thinking and quick acting he showed himself the superior even of spitz of whom francois had never seen an equal 
 but it was in giving the law and making his mates live up to it that buck excelled dave and did not mind the change in leadership it was none of their business their business was to toil and toil mightily in the traces so long as that was not interfered with they did not care what happened billee the could lead for all they cared so long as he kept order the rest of the team however had grown unruly during the last days of spitz and their surprise was great now that buck proceeded to lick them into shape 
 pike who pulled at heels and who never put an ounce more of his weight against the breastband than he was compelled to do was swiftly and repeatedly shaken for loafing and ere the first day was done he was pulling more than ever before in his life the first night in camp joe the sour one was punished thing that spitz had never succeeded in doing buck simply smothered him by virtue of superior weight and cut him up till he ceased snapping and began to whine for mercy 
 the general tone of the team picked up immediately it recovered its solidarity and once more the dogs leaped as one dog in the traces at the rink rapids two native huskies teek and koona were added and the celerity with which buck broke them in took away breath 
 never such a dog as dat buck he cried no never him worth one thousand dollair by gar eh what you say perrault 
 and perrault nodded he was ahead of the record then and gaining day by day the trail was in excellent condition well packed and hard and there was no snow with which to contend it was not too cold the temperature dropped to fifty below zero and remained there the whole trip the men rode and ran by turn and the dogs were kept on the jump with but infrequent 
 the thirty mile river was comparatively coated with ice and they covered in one day going out what had taken them ten days coming in in one run they made a dash from the foot of lake lebarge to the white horse rapids across marsh tagish and bennett seventy miles of lakes they flew so fast that the man whose turn it was to run towed behind the sled at the end of a rope and on the last night of the second week they topped white pass and dropped down the sea slope with the lights of skaguay and of the shipping at their feet 
 it was a record run each day for fourteen days they had averaged forty miles for three days perrault and francois threw chests up and down the main street of skaguay and were deluged with invitations to drink while the team was the constant center of a worshipful crowd of dogbusters and mushers then three or four western bad men aspired to clean out the town were riddled like pepperboxes for their pains and public interest turned to other idols next came official orders francois called buck to him threw his arms around him wept over him and that was the last of francois and perrault like other men they passed out of life for good 
 a scotch took charge of him and his mates and in company with a dozen other he started back over the weary trail to dawson it was no light running now nor record time but heavy toil each day with a heavy load behind for this was the mail train carrying word from the world to the men who sought gold under the shadow of the pole 
 buck did not like it but he bore up well to the work taking pride in it after the manner of dave and and seeing that his mates whether they prided in it or not did their fair share it was a monotonous life operating with regularity one day was very like another at a certain time each morning the cooks turned out fires were built and breakfast was eaten then while some broke camp others harnessed the dogs and they were under way an hour or so before the darkness fell which gave warning of dawn at night camp was made some pitched the tents others cut firewood and pine boughs for the beds and still others carried water or ice for the cooks also the dogs were fed to them this was the one feature of the day though it was good to loaf around after the fish was eaten for an hour or so with the other dogs of which there were fivescore and odd there were fierce fighters among them but three battles with the fiercest brought buck to mastery so that when he bristled and showed his teeth they got out of his way 
 best of all perhaps he loved to lie near the fire hind legs crouched under him fore legs stretched out in front head raised and eyes blinking drearily at the flames sometimes he thought of judge big house in the santa clara valley and of the cement swimming tank and ysabel the mexican hairless and toots the japanese pug but oftener he remembered the man in the red sweater the death of curly the great fight with spitz and the good things he had eaten or would like to eat he was not homesick the sunland was very dim and distant and such memories had no power over him far more potent were the memories of his heredity that gave things he had never seen before a seeming familiarity the instincts which were but the memories of his ancestors become habits which had lapsed in later days and still later in him quickened and became alive again 
 sometimes as he crouched there blinking dreamily at the flames it seemed that the flames were of another fire and that as he crouched by this other fire he saw another and different man from the cook before him this other man was shorter of leg and longer of arm with muscles that were stringy and knotty rather than rounded and swelling the hair of this man was long and matted and his head slanted back under it from the eyes he uttered strange sounds and seemed very much afraid of the darkness into which he peered continually clutching in his hand which hung midway between knee and foot a stick with a heavy stone made fast to the end he was all but naked a ragged and skin hanging part way down his back but on his body there was much hair in some places across the chest and shoulders and down the outside of the arms and thighs it was matted into almost a thick fur he did not stand erect but with trunk inclined forward from the hips on legs that bent at the knees about his body there was a peculiar springiness or resiliency almost catlike and a quick alertness as of one who lived in perpetual fear of things seen and unseen 
 at other times this hairy man squatted by the fire with head between his legs and slept on such occasions his elbows were on his knees his hands clasped above his head as though to shed rain by the hairy arms and beyond that fire in the circling darkness buck could see many gleaming coals two by two always two by two which he knew to be the eyes of great beasts of prey and he could hear the crashing of their bodies through the undergrowth and the noises they made in the night and dreaming there by the yukon bank with lazy eyes blinking at the fire these sounds and sights of another world would make the hair to rise along his back and stand on end across his shoulders and up his neck till he whimpered low and suppressedly or growled softly and the cook shouted at him hey you buck wake up whereupon the other world would vanish and the real world come into his eyes and he would get up and yawn and stretch as though he had been asleep 
 it was a hard trip with the mail behind them and the heavy work wore them down they were short of weight and in poor condition when they made dawson and should have had a ten days or a rest at least but in two days time they dropped down the yukon bank from the barracks loaded with letters for the outside the dogs were tired the drivers grumbling and to make matters worse it snowed every day this meant a soft trail greater friction on the runners and heavier pulling for the dogs yet the drivers were fair through it all and did their best for the animals 
 each night the dogs were attended to first they ate before the drivers ate and no man sought his till he had seen to the feet of the dogs he drove still their strength went down since the beginning of the winter they had traveled eighteen hundred miles dragging sleds the whole weary distance and eighteen hundred miles will tell upon life of the toughest buck stood it keeping his mates up to their work and maintaining discipline though he too was very tired billee cried and whimpered regularly in his sleep each night joe was sourer than ever and was unapproachable blind side or other side 
 but it was dave who suffered most of all something had gone wrong with him he became more morose and irritable and when camp was pitched at once made his nest where his driver fed him once out of the harness and down he did not get on his feet again till time in the morning sometimes in the traces when jerked by a sudden stoppage of the sled or by straining to start it he would cry out with pain the driver examined him but could find nothing all the drivers became interested in his case they talked it over at and over their last pipes before going to bed and one night they held a consultation he was brought from his nest to the fire and was pressed and prodded till he cried out many times something was wrong inside but they could locate no broken bones could not make it out 
 by the time cassiar bar was reached he was so weak that he was falling repeatedly in the traces the scotch called a halt and took him out of the team making the next dog fast to the sled his intention was to rest dave letting him run free behind the sled sick as he was dave resented being taken out grunting and growling while the traces were unfastened and whimpering when he saw in the position he had held and served so long for the pride of trace and trail was his and sick unto death he could not bear that another dog should do his work 
 when the sled started he floundered in the soft snow alongside the beaten trail attacking with his teeth rushing against him and trying to thrust him off into the soft snow on the other side striving to leap inside his traces and get between him and the sled and all the while whining and yelping and crying with grief and pain the tried to drive him away with the whip but he paid no heed to the stinging lash and the man had not the heart to strike harder dave refused to run quietly on the trail behind the sled where the going was easy but continued to flounder alongside in the soft snow where the going was most difficult till exhausted then he fell and lay where he fell howling lugubriously as the long train of sleds churned by 
 with the last remnant of his strength he managed to stagger along behind till the train made another stop when he floundered past the sleds to his own where he stood alongside his driver lingered a moment to get a light for his pipe from the man behind then he returned and started his dogs they swung out on the trail with remarkable lack of exertion turned their heads uneasily and stopped in surprise the driver was surprised too the sled had not moved he called his comrades to witness the sight dave had bitten through both of traces and was standing directly in front of the sled in his proper place 
 he pleaded with his eyes to remain there the driver was perplexed his comrades talked of how a dog could break its heart through being denied the work that killed it and recalled instances they had known where dogs too old for the toil or injured had died because they were cut out of the traces also they held it a mercy since dave was to die anyway that he should die in the traces and content so he was harnessed in again and proudly he pulled as of old though more than once he cried out involuntarily from the bite of his inward hurt several times fell down and was dragged in the traces and once the sled ran upon him so that he limped thereafter on one of his hind legs 
 but he held out till camp was reached when his driver made a place for him by the fire morning found him too weak to travel at time he tried to crawl to his driver by convulsive efforts he got on his feet staggered and fell then he wormed his way forward slowly toward where the harnesses were being put on his mates he would advance his fore legs and drag up his body with a sort of hitching movement when he would advance his fore legs and hitch ahead again for a few more inches his strength left him and the last his mates saw of him he lay gasping in the snow and yearning toward them but they could hear him mournfully howling till they passed out of sight behind a belt of river timber 
 here the train was halted the scotch slowly retraced his steps to the camp they had left the men ceased talking a rang out the man came back hurriedly the whips snapped the bells tinkled merrily the sleds churned along the trail but buck knew and every dog knew what had taken place behind the belt of river trees

lionfish nov chapter four at flourish and blottscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 life at the burrow was as different as possible from life on privet drive the dursleys liked everything neat and ordered the burst with the strange and unexpected harry got a shock the first time he looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantelpiece and it shouted tuck your shirt in scruffy the ghoul in the attic howled and dropped pipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet and small explosions from fred and bedroom were considered perfectly normal what harry found most unusual about life at however the talking mirror or the clanking ghoul it was the fact that everybody there seemed to like him 
 
 mrs weasley fussed over the state of his socks and tried to force him to eat fourth helpings at every meal mr weasley liked harry to sit next to him at the dinner table so that he could bombard him with questions about life with muggles asking him to explain how things like plugs and the postal service worked 
 
 fascinating he would say as harry talked him through using a telephone ingenious really how many ways muggles have found of getting along without magic 
 
 harry heard from hogwarts one sunny morning about a week after he had arrived at the burrow he and ron went down to breakfast to find mr and mrs weasley and ginny already sitting at the kitchen table the moment she saw harry ginny accidentally knocked her porridge bowl to the floor with a loud clatter ginny seemed very prone to knocking things over whenever harry entered a room she dived under the table to retrieve the bowl and emerged with her face glowing like the setting sun pretending he noticed this harry sat down and took the toast mrs weasley offered him 
 
 letters from school said mr weasley passing harry and ron identical envelopes of yellowish parchment addressed in green ink dumbledore already knows here harry miss a trick that man you got them too he added as fred and george ambled in still in their pajamas 
 
 for a few minutes there was silence as they all read their letters told him to catch the hogwarts express as usual from cross station on september first there was also a list of the new books need for the coming year 
 
 students will require 
 
 the standard book of spells grade by miranda goshawk 
 
 break with a banshee by gilderoy lockhart 
 
 gadding with ghouls by gilderoy lockhart 
 
 holidays with hags by gilderoy lockhart 
 
 travels with trolls by gilderoy lockhart 
 
 voyages with vampires by gilderoy lockhart 
 
 wanderings with werewolves by gilderoy lockhart 
 
 year with the yeti by gilderoy lockhart 
 
 fred who had finished his own list peered over at 
 
 been told to get all books too he said the new defense against the dark arts teacher must be a fan bet a witch 
 
 at this point fred caught his eye and quickly busied himself with the marmalade 
 
 that lot come cheap said george with a quick look at his parents books are really expensive 
 
 well manage said mrs weasley but she looked worried i expect be able to pick up a lot of things secondhand 
 
 oh are you starting at hogwarts this year harry asked ginny 
 
 she nodded blushing to the roots of her flaming hair and put her elbow in the butter dish fortunately no one saw this except harry because just then elder brother percy walked in he was already dressed his hogwarts prefect badge pinned to his sweater vest 
 
 morning all said percy briskly lovely day 
 
 he sat down in the only remaining chair but leapt up again almost immediately pulling from underneath him a molting gray feather duster at least that was what harry thought it was until he saw that it was breathing 
 
 errol said ron taking the limp owl from percy and extracting a letter from under its wing finally got answer i wrote to her saying we were going to try and rescue you from the dursleys 
 
 he carried errol to a perch just inside the back door and tried to stand him on it but errol flopped straight off again so ron lay him on the draining board instead muttering pathetic then he ripped open letter and read it out loud 
 
 dear ron and harry if there 
 
 i hope everything went all right and that harry is okay and that you do anything illegal to get him out ron because that would get harry into trouble too been really worried and if harry is all right will you please let me know at once but perhaps it would be better if you used a different owl because i think another delivery might finish your one off 
 
 very busy with schoolwork of course how can she be said ron in horror on vacation and going to london next wednesday to buy my new books why we meet in diagon alley 
 
 let me know happening as soon as you can love from hermione 
 
 well that fits in nicely we can go and get all your things then too said mrs weasley starting to clear the table you all up to today 
 
 harry ron fred and george were planning to go up the hill to a small paddock the weasleys owned it was surrounded by trees that blocked it from view of the village below meaning that they could practice quidditch there as long as they fly too high 
 
 they use real quidditch balls which would have been hard to explain if they had escaped and flown away over the village instead they threw apples for one another to catch they took turns riding nimbus two thousand which was easily the best broom old shooting star was often outstripped by passing butterflies 
 
 five minutes later they were marching up the hill broomsticks over their shoulders they had asked percy if he wanted to join them but he had said he was busy harry had only seen percy at mealtimes so far he stayed shut in his room the rest of the time 
 
 wish i knew what he was up to said fred frowning not himself his exam results came the day before you did twelve and he hardly gloated at all 
 
 ordinary wizarding levels george explained seeing puzzled look bill got twelve too if not careful have another head boy in the family i think i could stand the shame 
 
 bill was the oldest weasley brother he and the next brother charlie had already left hogwarts harry had never met either of them but knew that charlie was in romania studying dragons and bill in egypt working for the bank gringotts 
 
 dunno how mum and dad are going to afford all our school stuff this year said george after a while five sets of lockhart books and ginny needs robes and a wand and everything 
 
 harry said nothing he felt a bit awkward stored in an underground vault at gringotts in london was a small fortune that his parents had left him of course it was only in the wizarding world that he had money you use galleons sickles and knuts in muggle shops he had never mentioned his gringotts bank account to the dursleys he think their horror of anything connected with magic would stretch to a large pile of gold 
 
 mrs weasley woke them all early the following wednesday after a quick half a dozen bacon sandwiches each they pulled on their coats and mrs weasley took a flowerpot off the kitchen mantelpiece and peered inside 
 
 running low arthur she sighed have to buy some more today ah well guests first after you harry dear 
 
 and she offered him the flowerpot 
 
 harry stared at them all watching him 
 
 am i supposed to do he stammered 
 
 never traveled by floo powder said ron suddenly sorry harry i forgot 
 
 never said mr weasley but how did you get to diagon alley to buy your school things last year 
 
 i went on the underground 
 
 really said mr weasley eagerly were there escapators how exactly 
 
 not now arthur said mrs weasley floo a lot quicker dear but goodness me if never used it before 
 
 be all right mum said fred harry watch us first 
 
 he took a pinch of glittering powder out of the flowerpot stepped up to the fire and threw the powder into the flames 
 
 with a roar the fire turned emerald green and rose higher than fred who stepped right into it shouted diagon alley and vanished 
 
 you must speak clearly dear mrs weasley told harry as george dipped his hand into the flowerpot and be sure to get out at the right grate 
 
 the right what said harry nervously as the fire roared and whipped george out of sight too 
 
 well there are an awful lot of wizard fires to choose from you know but as long as spoken clearly 
 
 be fine molly fuss said mr weasley helping himself to floo powder too 
 
 but dear if he got lost how would we ever explain to his aunt and uncle 
 
 they mind harry reassured her dudley would think it was a brilliant joke if i got lost up a chimney worry about that 
 
 well all right you go after arthur said mrs weasley now when you get into the fire say where going 
 
 and keep your elbows tucked in ron advised 
 
 and your eyes shut said mrs weasley the soot 
 
 fidget said ron or you might well fall out of the wrong fireplace 
 
 but panic and get out too early wait until you see fred and george 
 
 trying hard to bear all this in mind harry took a pinch of floo powder and walked to the edge of the fire he took a deep breath scattered the powder into the flames and stepped forward the fire felt like a warm breeze he opened his mouth and immediately swallowed a lot of hot ash 
 
 alley he coughed 
 
 it felt as though he was being sucked down a giant drain he seemed to be spinning very fast the roaring in his ears was deafening he tried to keep his eyes open but the whirl of green flames made him feel sick something hard knocked his elbow and he tucked it in tightly still spinning and spinning now it felt as though cold hands were slapping his face squinting through his glasses he saw a blurred stream of fireplaces and snatched glimpses of the rooms beyond his bacon sandwiches were churning inside him he closed his eyes again wishing it would stop and then 
 
 he fell face forward onto cold stone and felt the bridge of his glasses snap 
 
 dizzy and bruised covered in soot he got gingerly to his feet holding his broken glasses up to his eyes he was quite alone but where he was he had no idea all he could tell was that he was standing in the stone fireplace of what looked like a large dimly lit shop but nothing in here was ever likely to be on a hogwarts school list 
 
 a glass case nearby held a withered hand on a cushion a bloodstained pack of cards and a staring glass eye masks stared down from the walls an assortment of human bones lay upon the counter and rusty spiked instruments hung from the ceiling even worse the dark narrow street harry could see through the dusty shop window was definitely not diagon alley 
 
 the sooner he got out of here the better nose still stinging where it had hit the hearth harry made his way swiftly and silently toward the door but before got halfway toward it two people appeared on the other side of the glass and one of them was the very last person harry wanted to meet when he was lost covered in soot and wearing broken glasses draco malfoy 
 
 harry looked quickly around and spotted a large black cabinet to his left he shot inside it and pulled the doors closed leaving a small crack to peer through seconds later a bell clanged and malfoy stepped into the shop 
 
 the man who followed could only be father he had the same pale pointed face and identical cold gray eyes mr malfoy crossed the shop looking lazily at the items on display and rang a bell on the counter before turning to his son and saying touch nothing draco 
 
 malfoy who had reached for the glass eye said i thought you were going to buy me a present 
 
 i said i would buy you a racing broom said his father drumming his fingers on the counter 
 
 the good of that if not on the house team said malfoy looking sulky and harry potter got a nimbus two thousand last year special permission from dumbledore so he could play for gryffindor not even that good just because famous famous for having a stupid scar on his forehead 
 
 malfoy bent down to examine a shelf full of skulls 
 
 everyone thinks so smart wonderful potter with his scar and his broomstick 
 
 you have told me this at least a dozen times already said mr malfoy with a quelling look at his son and i would remind you that it is not prudent to appear less than fond of harry potter not when most of our kind regard him as the hero who made the dark lord disappear ah mr borgin 
 
 a stooping man had appeared behind the counter smoothing his greasy hair back from his face 
 
 mr malfoy what a pleasure to see you again said mr borgin in a voice as oily as his hair delighted and young master malfoy too charmed how may i be of assistance i must show you just in today and very reasonably priced 
 
 not buying today mr borgin but selling said mr malfoy 
 
 selling the smile faded slightly from mr face 
 
 you have heard of course that the ministry is conducting more raids said mr malfoy taking a roll of parchment from his inside pocket and unraveling it for mr borgin to read i have a few ah items at home that might embarrass me if the ministry were to call 
 
 mr borgin fixed a pair of to his nose and looked down the list 
 
 the ministry presume to trouble you sir surely 
 
 mr lip curled 
 
 i have not been visited yet the name malfoy still commands a certain respect yet the ministry grows ever more meddlesome there are rumors about a new muggle protection act no doubt that fool arthur weasley is behind it 
 
 harry felt a hot surge of anger 
 
 and as you see certain of these poisons might make it appear 
 
 i understand sir of course said mr borgin let me see 
 
 can i have that interrupted draco pointing at the withered hand on its cushion 
 
 ah the hand of glory said mr borgin abandoning mr list and scurrying over to draco insert a candle and it gives light only to the holder best friend of thieves and plunderers your son has fine taste sir 
 
 i hope my son will amount to more than a thief or a plunderer borgin said mr malfoy coldly and mr borgin said quickly no offense sir no offense meant 
 
 though if his grades pick up said mr malfoy more coldly still that may indeed be all he is fit for 
 
 not my fault retorted draco the teachers all have favorites that hermione granger 
 
 i would have thought be ashamed that a girl of no wizard family beat you in every exam snapped mr malfoy 
 
 ha said harry under his breath pleased to see draco looking both abashed and angry 
 
 the same all over said mr borgin in his oily voice wizard blood is counting for less everywhere 
 
 not with me said mr malfoy his long nostrils flaring 
 
 no sir nor with me sir said mr borgin with a deep bow 
 
 in that case perhaps we can return to my list said mr malfoy shortly i am in something of a hurry borgin i have important business elsewhere today 
 
 they started to haggle harry watched nervously as draco drew nearer and nearer to his hiding place examining the objects for sale draco paused to examine a long coil of rope and to read smirking the card propped on a magnificent necklace of opals caution do not touch cursed has claimed the lives of nineteen muggle owners to date 
 
 draco turned away and saw the cabinet right in front of him he walked forward he stretched out his hand for the handle done said mr malfoy at the counter come draco 
 
 harry wiped his forehead on his sleeve as draco turned away 
 
 good day to you mr borgin expect you at the manor tomorrow to pick up the goods 
 
 the moment the door had closed mr borgin dropped his oily manner 
 
 good day yourself mister malfoy and if the stories are true you sold me half of hidden in your manor 
 
 muttering darkly mr borgin disappeared into a back room harry waited for a minute in case he came back then quietly as he could slipped out of the cabinet past the glass cases and out of the shop door 
 
 clutching his broken glasses to his face harry stared around he had emerged into a dingy alleyway that seemed to be made up entirely of shops devoted to the dark arts the one just left borgin and burkes looked like the largest but opposite was a nasty window display of shrunken heads and two doors down a large cage was alive with gigantic black spiders two wizards were watching him from the shadow of a doorway muttering to each other feeling jumpy harry set off trying to hold his glasses on straight and hoping against hope be able to find a way out of here 
 
 an old wooden street sign hanging over a shop selling poisonous candles told him he was in knockturn alley this help as harry had never heard of such a place he supposed he spoken clearly enough through his mouthful of ashes back in the trying to stay calm he wondered what to do 
 
 not lost are you my dear said a voice in his ear making him jump 
 
 an aged witch stood in front of him holding a tray of what looked horribly like whole human fingernails she leered at him showing mossy teeth harry backed away 
 
 fine thanks he said just 
 
 harry what think yer there 
 
 heart leapt so did the witch a load of fingernails cascaded down over her feet and she cursed as the massive form of hagrid the came striding toward them eyes flashing over his great bristling beard 
 
 hagrid harry croaked in relief i was lost floo powder 
 
 hagrid seized harry by the scruff of the neck and pulled him away from the witch knocking the tray right out of her hands her shrieks followed them all the way along the twisting alleyway out into bright sunlight harry saw a familiar marble building in the distance gringotts bank hagrid had steered him right into diagon alley 
 
 yer a mess said hagrid gruffly brushing soot off harry so forcefully he nearly knocked him into a barrel of dragon dung outside an apothecary knockturn alley i dunno dodgy place harry no one ter see yeh down there 
 
 i realized that said harry ducking as hagrid made to brush him off again i told you i was lost what were you doing down there anyway 
 
 i was a repellent growled hagrid school cabbages yer not on yer own 
 
 staying with the weasleys but we got separated harry explained got to go and find them 
 
 they set off together down the street 
 
 how come yeh never wrote back ter me said hagrid as harry jogged alongside him he had to take three steps to every stride of enormous boots harry explained all about dobby and the dursleys 
 
 lousy muggles growled hagrid if known 
 
 harry harry over here 
 
 harry looked up and saw hermione granger standing at the top of the white flight of steps to gringotts she ran down to meet them her bushy brown hair flying behind her 
 
 what happened to your glasses hello hagrid oh wonderful to see you two again are you coming into gringotts harry 
 
 as soon as found the weasleys said harry 
 
 yeh have long ter wait hagrid said with a grin 
 
 harry and hermione looked around sprinting up the crowded street were ron fred george percy and mr weasley 
 
 harry mr weasley panted we hoped only gone one grate too far he mopped his glistening bald patch frantic coming now 
 
 where did you come out ron asked 
 
 knockturn alley said hagrid grimly 
 
 excellent said fred and george together 
 
 never been allowed in said ron enviously 
 
 i should ruddy well think not growled hagrid mrs weasley now came galloping into view her handbag swinging wildly in one hand ginny just clinging onto the other 
 
 oh harry oh my dear you could have been anywhere 
 
 gasping for breath she pulled a large clothes brush out of her bag and began sweeping off the soot hagrid managed to beat away mr weasley took glasses gave them a tap of his wand and returned them good as new 
 
 well gotta be off said hagrid who was having his hand wrung by mrs weasley knockturn alley if you found him hagrid see yer at hogwarts and he strode away head and shoulders taller than anyone else in the packed street 
 
 guess who i saw in borgin and burkes harry asked ron and hermione as they climbed the gringotts steps malfoy and his father 
 
 did lucius malfoy buy anything said mr weasley sharply behind them 
 
 no he was selling 
 
 so worried said mr weasley with grim satisfaction oh love to get lucius malfoy for something 
 
 you be careful arthur said mrs weasley sharply as they were bowed into the bank by a goblin at the door that trouble go biting off more than you can chew 
 
 so you think a match for lucius malfoy said mr weasley indignantly but he was distracted almost at once by the sight of parents who were standing nervously at the counter that ran all along the great marble hall waiting for hermione to introduce them 
 
 but muggles said mr weasley delightedly we must have a drink that got there oh changing muggle money molly look he pointed excitedly at the notes in mr hand 
 
 meet you back here ron said to hermione as the weasleys and harry were led off to their underground vaults by another gringotts goblin 
 
 the vaults were reached by means of small carts that sped along miniature train tracks through the underground tunnels harry enjoyed the breakneck journey down to the but felt dreadful far worse than he had in knockturn alley when it was opened there was a very small pile of silver sickles inside and just one gold galleon mrs weasley felt right into the corners before sweeping the whole lot into her bag harry felt even worse when they reached his vault he tried to block the contents from view as he hastily shoved handfuls of coins into a leather bag 
 
 back outside on the marble steps they all separated percy muttered vaguely about needing a new quill fred and george had spotted their friend from hogwarts lee jordan mrs weasley and ginny were going to a secondhand robe shop mr weasley was insisting on taking the grangers off to the leaky cauldron for a drink 
 
 all meet at flourish and blotts in an hour to buy your schoolbooks said mrs weasley setting off with ginny and not one step down knockturn alley she shouted at the backs 
 
 harry ron and hermione strolled off along the winding cobbled street the bag of gold silver and bronze jangling cheerfully in pocket was clamoring to be spent so he bought three large ice creams which they slurped happily as they wandered up the alley examining the fascinating shop windows ron gazed longingly at a full set of chudley cannon robes in the windows of quality quidditch supplies until hermione dragged them off to buy ink and parchment next door in gambol and japes wizarding joke shop they met fred george and lee jordan who were stocking up on dr fabulous fireworks and in a tiny junk shop full of broken wands lopsided brass scales and old cloaks covered in potion stains they found percy deeply immersed in a small and deeply boring book called prefects who gained power 
 
 a study of hogwarts prefects and their later careers ron read aloud off the back cover that sounds fascinating 
 
 go away percy snapped 
 
 course very ambitious percy got it all planned out he wants to be minister of magic ron told harry and hermione in an undertone as they left percy to it 
 
 an hour later they headed for flourish and blotts they were by no means the only ones making their way to the bookshop as they approached it they saw to their surprise a large crowd jostling outside the doors trying to get in the reason for this was proclaimed by a large banner stretched across the upper windows 
 
 gilderoy lockhart 
 
 will be signing copies of his autobiography 
 
 magical me 
 
 today to 
 
 we can actually meet him hermione squealed i mean written almost the whole booklist 
 
 the crowd seemed to be made up mostly of witches around mrs age a wizard stood at the door saying calmly please ladies push there mind the books now 
 
 harry ron and hermione squeezed inside a long line wound right to the back of the shop where gilderoy lockhart was signing his books they each grabbed a copy of the standard book of spells grade and sneaked up the line to where the rest of the weasleys were standing with mr and mrs granger 
 
 oh there you are good said mrs weasley she sounded breathless and kept patting her hair be able to see him in a minute 
 
 gilderoy lockhart came slowly into view seated at a table surrounded by large pictures of his own face all winking and flashing dazzlingly white teeth at the crowd the real lockhart was wearing robes of blue that exactly matched his eyes his pointed hat was set at a jaunty angle on his wavy hair 
 
 a short man was dancing around taking photographs with a large black camera that emitted puffs of purple smoke with every blinding flash 
 
 out of the way there he snarled at ron moving back to get a better shot this is for the daily prophet 
 
 big deal said ron rubbing his foot where the photographer had stepped on it 
 
 gilderoy lockhart heard him he looked up he saw ron and then he saw harry he stared then he leapt to his feet and positively shouted it be harry potter 
 
 the crowd parted whispering excitedly lockhart dived forward seized arm and pulled him to the front the crowd burst into applause face burned as lockhart shook his hand for the photographer who was clicking away madly wafting thick smoke over the weasleys 
 
 nice big smile harry said lockhart through his own gleaming teeth together you and i are worth the front page 
 
 when he finally let go of hand harry could hardly feel his fingers he tried to sidle back over to the weasleys but lockhart threw an arm around his shoulders and clamped him tightly to his side 
 
 ladies and gentlemen he said loudly waving for quiet what an extraordinary moment this is the perfect moment for me to make a little announcement been sitting on for some time 
 
 when young harry here stepped into flourish and blotts today he only wanted to buy my autobiography which i shall be happy to present him now free of charge the crowd applauded again he had no idea lockhart continued giving harry a little shake that made his glasses slip to the end of his nose that he would shortly be getting much much more than my book magical me he and his schoolmates will in fact be getting the real magical me yes ladies and gentlemen i have great pleasure and pride in announcing that this september i will be taking up the post of defense against the dark arts teacher at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry 
 
 the crowd cheered and clapped and harry found himself being presented with the entire works of gilderoy lockhart staggering slightly under their weight he managed to make his way out of the limelight to the edge of the room where ginny was standing next to her new cauldron 
 
 you have these harry mumbled to her tipping the books into the cauldron buy my own 
 
 bet you loved that you potter said a voice harry had no trouble recognizing he straightened up and found himself with draco malfoy who was wearing his usual sneer 
 
 famous harry potter said malfoy even go into a bookshop without making the front page 
 
 leave him alone he want all that said ginny it was the first time she had spoken in front of harry she was glaring at malfoy 
 
 potter got yourself a girlfriend drawled malfoy ginny went scarlet as ron and hermione fought their way over both clutching stacks of books 
 
 oh you said ron looking at malfoy as if he were something unpleasant on the sole of his shoe bet surprised to see harry here eh 
 
 not as surprised as i am to see you in a shop weasley retorted malfoy i suppose your parents will go hungry for a month to pay for all those 
 
 ron went as red as ginny he dropped his books into the cauldron too and started toward malfoy but harry and hermione grabbed the back of his jacket 
 
 ron said mr weasley struggling over with fred and george what are you doing too crowded in here go outside 
 
 well well well arthur weasley 
 
 it was mr malfoy he stood with his hand on shoulder sneering in just the same way 
 
 lucius said mr weasley nodding coldly 
 
 busy time at the ministry i hear said mr malfoy all those raids i hope paying you overtime 
 
 he reached into cauldron and extracted from amid the glossy lockhart books a very old very battered copy of a guide to transfiguration 
 
 obviously not mr malfoy said dear me the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they even pay you well for it 
 
 mr weasley flushed darker than either ron or ginny 
 
 we have a very different idea of what disgraces the name of wizard malfoy he said 
 
 clearly said mr malfoy his pale eyes straying to mr and mrs granger who were watching apprehensively the company you keep weasley and i thought your family could sink no lower 
 
 there was a thud of metal as cauldron went flying mr weasley had thrown himself at mr malfoy knocking him backward into a bookshelf dozens of heavy spellbooks came thundering down on all their heads there was a yell of get him dad from fred or george mrs weasley was shrieking no arthur no the crowd stampeded backward knocking more shelves over gentlemen please please cried the assistant and then louder than all 
 
 break it up there gents break it up 
 
 hagrid was wading toward them through the sea of books in an instant he had pulled mr weasley and mr malfoy apart mr weasley had a cut lip and mr malfoy had been hit in the eye by an encyclopedia of toadstools he was still holding old transfiguration book he thrust it at her his eyes glittering with malice 
 
 here girl take your book the best your father can give you pulling himself out of grip he beckoned to draco and swept from the shop 
 
 yeh ignored him arthur said hagrid almost lifting mr weasley off his feet as he straightened his robes rotten ter the core the whole family everyone knows that no worth bad blood what it is come on now get outta here 
 
 the assistant looked as though he wanted to stop them leaving but he barely came up to waist and seemed to think better of it they hurried up the street the grangers shaking with fright and mrs weasley beside herself with fury 
 
 a fine example to set for your children brawling in public what gilderoy lockhart thought 
 
 he was pleased said fred you hear him as we were leaving he was asking that bloke from the daily prophet if be able to work the fight into his report said it was all publicity 
 
 but it was a subdued group that headed back to the fireside in the leaky cauldron where harry the weasleys and all their shopping would be traveling back to the burrow using floo powder they said to the grangers who were leaving the pub for the muggle street on the other side mr weasley started to ask them how bus stops worked but stopped quickly at the look on mrs face 
 
 harry took off his glasses and put them safely in his pocket before helping himself to floo powder it definitely his favorite way to travel

 the chamber of secrets 
 

lionfish nov chapter four at flourish and blottscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 life at the burrow was as different as possible from life on privet drive the dursleys liked everything neat and ordered the burst with the strange and unexpected harry got a shock the first time he looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantelpiece and it shouted tuck your shirt in scruffy the ghoul in the attic howled and dropped pipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet and small explosions from fred and bedroom were considered perfectly normal what harry found most unusual about life at however the talking mirror or the clanking ghoul it was the fact that everybody there seemed to like him 
 
 mrs weasley fussed over the state of his socks and tried to force him to eat fourth helpings at every meal mr weasley liked harry to sit next to him at the dinner table so that he could bombard him with questions about life with muggles asking him to explain how things like plugs and the postal service worked 
 
 fascinating he would say as harry talked him through using a telephone ingenious really how many ways muggles have found of getting along without magic 
 
 harry heard from hogwarts one sunny morning about a week after he had arrived at the burrow he and ron went down to breakfast to find mr and mrs weasley and ginny already sitting at the kitchen table the moment she saw harry ginny accidentally knocked her porridge bowl to the floor with a loud clatter ginny seemed very prone to knocking things over whenever harry entered a room she dived under the table to retrieve the bowl and emerged with her face glowing like the setting sun pretending he noticed this harry sat down and took the toast mrs weasley offered him 
 
 letters from school said mr weasley passing harry and ron identical envelopes of yellowish parchment addressed in green ink dumbledore already knows here harry miss a trick that man you got them too he added as fred and george ambled in still in their pajamas 
 
 for a few minutes there was silence as they all read their letters told him to catch the hogwarts express as usual from cross station on september first there was also a list of the new books need for the coming year 
 
 students will require 
 
 the standard book of spells grade by miranda goshawk 
 
 break with a banshee by gilderoy lockhart 
 
 gadding with ghouls by gilderoy lockhart 
 
 holidays with hags by gilderoy lockhart 
 
 travels with trolls by gilderoy lockhart 
 
 voyages with vampires by gilderoy lockhart 
 
 wanderings with werewolves by gilderoy lockhart 
 
 year with the yeti by gilderoy lockhart 
 
 fred who had finished his own list peered over at 
 
 been told to get all books too he said the new defense against the dark arts teacher must be a fan bet a witch 
 
 at this point fred caught his eye and quickly busied himself with the marmalade 
 
 that lot come cheap said george with a quick look at his parents books are really expensive 
 
 well manage said mrs weasley but she looked worried i expect be able to pick up a lot of things secondhand 
 
 oh are you starting at hogwarts this year harry asked ginny 
 
 she nodded blushing to the roots of her flaming hair and put her elbow in the butter dish fortunately no one saw this except harry because just then elder brother percy walked in he was already dressed his hogwarts prefect badge pinned to his sweater vest 
 
 morning all said percy briskly lovely day 
 
 he sat down in the only remaining chair but leapt up again almost immediately pulling from underneath him a molting gray feather duster at least that was what harry thought it was until he saw that it was breathing 
 
 errol said ron taking the limp owl from percy and extracting a letter from under its wing finally got answer i wrote to her saying we were going to try and rescue you from the dursleys 
 
 he carried errol to a perch just inside the back door and tried to stand him on it but errol flopped straight off again so ron lay him on the draining board instead muttering pathetic then he ripped open letter and read it out loud 
 
 dear ron and harry if there 
 
 i hope everything went all right and that harry is okay and that you do anything illegal to get him out ron because that would get harry into trouble too been really worried and if harry is all right will you please let me know at once but perhaps it would be better if you used a different owl because i think another delivery might finish your one off 
 
 very busy with schoolwork of course how can she be said ron in horror on vacation and going to london next wednesday to buy my new books why we meet in diagon alley 
 
 let me know happening as soon as you can love from hermione 
 
 well that fits in nicely we can go and get all your things then too said mrs weasley starting to clear the table you all up to today 
 
 harry ron fred and george were planning to go up the hill to a small paddock the weasleys owned it was surrounded by trees that blocked it from view of the village below meaning that they could practice quidditch there as long as they fly too high 
 
 they use real quidditch balls which would have been hard to explain if they had escaped and flown away over the village instead they threw apples for one another to catch they took turns riding nimbus two thousand which was easily the best broom old shooting star was often outstripped by passing butterflies 
 
 five minutes later they were marching up the hill broomsticks over their shoulders they had asked percy if he wanted to join them but he had said he was busy harry had only seen percy at mealtimes so far he stayed shut in his room the rest of the time 
 
 wish i knew what he was up to said fred frowning not himself his exam results came the day before you did twelve and he hardly gloated at all 
 
 ordinary wizarding levels george explained seeing puzzled look bill got twelve too if not careful have another head boy in the family i think i could stand the shame 
 
 bill was the oldest weasley brother he and the next brother charlie had already left hogwarts harry had never met either of them but knew that charlie was in romania studying dragons and bill in egypt working for the bank gringotts 
 
 dunno how mum and dad are going to afford all our school stuff this year said george after a while five sets of lockhart books and ginny needs robes and a wand and everything 
 
 harry said nothing he felt a bit awkward stored in an underground vault at gringotts in london was a small fortune that his parents had left him of course it was only in the wizarding world that he had money you use galleons sickles and knuts in muggle shops he had never mentioned his gringotts bank account to the dursleys he think their horror of anything connected with magic would stretch to a large pile of gold 
 
 mrs weasley woke them all early the following wednesday after a quick half a dozen bacon sandwiches each they pulled on their coats and mrs weasley took a flowerpot off the kitchen mantelpiece and peered inside 
 
 running low arthur she sighed have to buy some more today ah well guests first after you harry dear 
 
 and she offered him the flowerpot 
 
 harry stared at them all watching him 
 
 am i supposed to do he stammered 
 
 never traveled by floo powder said ron suddenly sorry harry i forgot 
 
 never said mr weasley but how did you get to diagon alley to buy your school things last year 
 
 i went on the underground 
 
 really said mr weasley eagerly were there escapators how exactly 
 
 not now arthur said mrs weasley floo a lot quicker dear but goodness me if never used it before 
 
 be all right mum said fred harry watch us first 
 
 he took a pinch of glittering powder out of the flowerpot stepped up to the fire and threw the powder into the flames 
 
 with a roar the fire turned emerald green and rose higher than fred who stepped right into it shouted diagon alley and vanished 
 
 you must speak clearly dear mrs weasley told harry as george dipped his hand into the flowerpot and be sure to get out at the right grate 
 
 the right what said harry nervously as the fire roared and whipped george out of sight too 
 
 well there are an awful lot of wizard fires to choose from you know but as long as spoken clearly 
 
 be fine molly fuss said mr weasley helping himself to floo powder too 
 
 but dear if he got lost how would we ever explain to his aunt and uncle 
 
 they mind harry reassured her dudley would think it was a brilliant joke if i got lost up a chimney worry about that 
 
 well all right you go after arthur said mrs weasley now when you get into the fire say where going 
 
 and keep your elbows tucked in ron advised 
 
 and your eyes shut said mrs weasley the soot 
 
 fidget said ron or you might well fall out of the wrong fireplace 
 
 but panic and get out too early wait until you see fred and george 
 
 trying hard to bear all this in mind harry took a pinch of floo powder and walked to the edge of the fire he took a deep breath scattered the powder into the flames and stepped forward the fire felt like a warm breeze he opened his mouth and immediately swallowed a lot of hot ash 
 
 alley he coughed 
 
 it felt as though he was being sucked down a giant drain he seemed to be spinning very fast the roaring in his ears was deafening he tried to keep his eyes open but the whirl of green flames made him feel sick something hard knocked his elbow and he tucked it in tightly still spinning and spinning now it felt as though cold hands were slapping his face squinting through his glasses he saw a blurred stream of fireplaces and snatched glimpses of the rooms beyond his bacon sandwiches were churning inside him he closed his eyes again wishing it would stop and then 
 
 he fell face forward onto cold stone and felt the bridge of his glasses snap 
 
 dizzy and bruised covered in soot he got gingerly to his feet holding his broken glasses up to his eyes he was quite alone but where he was he had no idea all he could tell was that he was standing in the stone fireplace of what looked like a large dimly lit shop but nothing in here was ever likely to be on a hogwarts school list 
 
 a glass case nearby held a withered hand on a cushion a bloodstained pack of cards and a staring glass eye masks stared down from the walls an assortment of human bones lay upon the counter and rusty spiked instruments hung from the ceiling even worse the dark narrow street harry could see through the dusty shop window was definitely not diagon alley 
 
 the sooner he got out of here the better nose still stinging where it had hit the hearth harry made his way swiftly and silently toward the door but before got halfway toward it two people appeared on the other side of the glass and one of them was the very last person harry wanted to meet when he was lost covered in soot and wearing broken glasses draco malfoy 
 
 harry looked quickly around and spotted a large black cabinet to his left he shot inside it and pulled the doors closed leaving a small crack to peer through seconds later a bell clanged and malfoy stepped into the shop 
 
 the man who followed could only be father he had the same pale pointed face and identical cold gray eyes mr malfoy crossed the shop looking lazily at the items on display and rang a bell on the counter before turning to his son and saying touch nothing draco 
 
 malfoy who had reached for the glass eye said i thought you were going to buy me a present 
 
 i said i would buy you a racing broom said his father drumming his fingers on the counter 
 
 the good of that if not on the house team said malfoy looking sulky and harry potter got a nimbus two thousand last year special permission from dumbledore so he could play for gryffindor not even that good just because famous famous for having a stupid scar on his forehead 
 
 malfoy bent down to examine a shelf full of skulls 
 
 everyone thinks so smart wonderful potter with his scar and his broomstick 
 
 you have told me this at least a dozen times already said mr malfoy with a quelling look at his son and i would remind you that it is not prudent to appear less than fond of harry potter not when most of our kind regard him as the hero who made the dark lord disappear ah mr borgin 
 
 a stooping man had appeared behind the counter smoothing his greasy hair back from his face 
 
 mr malfoy what a pleasure to see you again said mr borgin in a voice as oily as his hair delighted and young master malfoy too charmed how may i be of assistance i must show you just in today and very reasonably priced 
 
 not buying today mr borgin but selling said mr malfoy 
 
 selling the smile faded slightly from mr face 
 
 you have heard of course that the ministry is conducting more raids said mr malfoy taking a roll of parchment from his inside pocket and unraveling it for mr borgin to read i have a few ah items at home that might embarrass me if the ministry were to call 
 
 mr borgin fixed a pair of to his nose and looked down the list 
 
 the ministry presume to trouble you sir surely 
 
 mr lip curled 
 
 i have not been visited yet the name malfoy still commands a certain respect yet the ministry grows ever more meddlesome there are rumors about a new muggle protection act no doubt that fool arthur weasley is behind it 
 
 harry felt a hot surge of anger 
 
 and as you see certain of these poisons might make it appear 
 
 i understand sir of course said mr borgin let me see 
 
 can i have that interrupted draco pointing at the withered hand on its cushion 
 
 ah the hand of glory said mr borgin abandoning mr list and scurrying over to draco insert a candle and it gives light only to the holder best friend of thieves and plunderers your son has fine taste sir 
 
 i hope my son will amount to more than a thief or a plunderer borgin said mr malfoy coldly and mr borgin said quickly no offense sir no offense meant 
 
 though if his grades pick up said mr malfoy more coldly still that may indeed be all he is fit for 
 
 not my fault retorted draco the teachers all have favorites that hermione granger 
 
 i would have thought be ashamed that a girl of no wizard family beat you in every exam snapped mr malfoy 
 
 ha said harry under his breath pleased to see draco looking both abashed and angry 
 
 the same all over said mr borgin in his oily voice wizard blood is counting for less everywhere 
 
 not with me said mr malfoy his long nostrils flaring 
 
 no sir nor with me sir said mr borgin with a deep bow 
 
 in that case perhaps we can return to my list said mr malfoy shortly i am in something of a hurry borgin i have important business elsewhere today 
 
 they started to haggle harry watched nervously as draco drew nearer and nearer to his hiding place examining the objects for sale draco paused to examine a long coil of rope and to read smirking the card propped on a magnificent necklace of opals caution do not touch cursed has claimed the lives of nineteen muggle owners to date 
 
 draco turned away and saw the cabinet right in front of him he walked forward he stretched out his hand for the handle done said mr malfoy at the counter come draco 
 
 harry wiped his forehead on his sleeve as draco turned away 
 
 good day to you mr borgin expect you at the manor tomorrow to pick up the goods 
 
 the moment the door had closed mr borgin dropped his oily manner 
 
 good day yourself mister malfoy and if the stories are true you sold me half of hidden in your manor 
 
 muttering darkly mr borgin disappeared into a back room harry waited for a minute in case he came back then quietly as he could slipped out of the cabinet past the glass cases and out of the shop door 
 
 clutching his broken glasses to his face harry stared around he had emerged into a dingy alleyway that seemed to be made up entirely of shops devoted to the dark arts the one just left borgin and burkes looked like the largest but opposite was a nasty window display of shrunken heads and two doors down a large cage was alive with gigantic black spiders two wizards were watching him from the shadow of a doorway muttering to each other feeling jumpy harry set off trying to hold his glasses on straight and hoping against hope be able to find a way out of here 
 
 an old wooden street sign hanging over a shop selling poisonous candles told him he was in knockturn alley this help as harry had never heard of such a place he supposed he spoken clearly enough through his mouthful of ashes back in the trying to stay calm he wondered what to do 
 
 not lost are you my dear said a voice in his ear making him jump 
 
 an aged witch stood in front of him holding a tray of what looked horribly like whole human fingernails she leered at him showing mossy teeth harry backed away 
 
 fine thanks he said just 
 
 harry what think yer there 
 
 heart leapt so did the witch a load of fingernails cascaded down over her feet and she cursed as the massive form of hagrid the came striding toward them eyes flashing over his great bristling beard 
 
 hagrid harry croaked in relief i was lost floo powder 
 
 hagrid seized harry by the scruff of the neck and pulled him away from the witch knocking the tray right out of her hands her shrieks followed them all the way along the twisting alleyway out into bright sunlight harry saw a familiar marble building in the distance gringotts bank hagrid had steered him right into diagon alley 
 
 yer a mess said hagrid gruffly brushing soot off harry so forcefully he nearly knocked him into a barrel of dragon dung outside an apothecary knockturn alley i dunno dodgy place harry no one ter see yeh down there 
 
 i realized that said harry ducking as hagrid made to brush him off again i told you i was lost what were you doing down there anyway 
 
 i was a repellent growled hagrid school cabbages yer not on yer own 
 
 staying with the weasleys but we got separated harry explained got to go and find them 
 
 they set off together down the street 
 
 how come yeh never wrote back ter me said hagrid as harry jogged alongside him he had to take three steps to every stride of enormous boots harry explained all about dobby and the dursleys 
 
 lousy muggles growled hagrid if known 
 
 harry harry over here 
 
 harry looked up and saw hermione granger standing at the top of the white flight of steps to gringotts she ran down to meet them her bushy brown hair flying behind her 
 
 what happened to your glasses hello hagrid oh wonderful to see you two again are you coming into gringotts harry 
 
 as soon as found the weasleys said harry 
 
 yeh have long ter wait hagrid said with a grin 
 
 harry and hermione looked around sprinting up the crowded street were ron fred george percy and mr weasley 
 
 harry mr weasley panted we hoped only gone one grate too far he mopped his glistening bald patch frantic coming now 
 
 where did you come out ron asked 
 
 knockturn alley said hagrid grimly 
 
 excellent said fred and george together 
 
 never been allowed in said ron enviously 
 
 i should ruddy well think not growled hagrid mrs weasley now came galloping into view her handbag swinging wildly in one hand ginny just clinging onto the other 
 
 oh harry oh my dear you could have been anywhere 
 
 gasping for breath she pulled a large clothes brush out of her bag and began sweeping off the soot hagrid managed to beat away mr weasley took glasses gave them a tap of his wand and returned them good as new 
 
 well gotta be off said hagrid who was having his hand wrung by mrs weasley knockturn alley if you found him hagrid see yer at hogwarts and he strode away head and shoulders taller than anyone else in the packed street 
 
 guess who i saw in borgin and burkes harry asked ron and hermione as they climbed the gringotts steps malfoy and his father 
 
 did lucius malfoy buy anything said mr weasley sharply behind them 
 
 no he was selling 
 
 so worried said mr weasley with grim satisfaction oh love to get lucius malfoy for something 
 
 you be careful arthur said mrs weasley sharply as they were bowed into the bank by a goblin at the door that trouble go biting off more than you can chew 
 
 so you think a match for lucius malfoy said mr weasley indignantly but he was distracted almost at once by the sight of parents who were standing nervously at the counter that ran all along the great marble hall waiting for hermione to introduce them 
 
 but muggles said mr weasley delightedly we must have a drink that got there oh changing muggle money molly look he pointed excitedly at the notes in mr hand 
 
 meet you back here ron said to hermione as the weasleys and harry were led off to their underground vaults by another gringotts goblin 
 
 the vaults were reached by means of small carts that sped along miniature train tracks through the underground tunnels harry enjoyed the breakneck journey down to the but felt dreadful far worse than he had in knockturn alley when it was opened there was a very small pile of silver sickles inside and just one gold galleon mrs weasley felt right into the corners before sweeping the whole lot into her bag harry felt even worse when they reached his vault he tried to block the contents from view as he hastily shoved handfuls of coins into a leather bag 
 
 back outside on the marble steps they all separated percy muttered vaguely about needing a new quill fred and george had spotted their friend from hogwarts lee jordan mrs weasley and ginny were going to a secondhand robe shop mr weasley was insisting on taking the grangers off to the leaky cauldron for a drink 
 
 all meet at flourish and blotts in an hour to buy your schoolbooks said mrs weasley setting off with ginny and not one step down knockturn alley she shouted at the backs 
 
 harry ron and hermione strolled off along the winding cobbled street the bag of gold silver and bronze jangling cheerfully in pocket was clamoring to be spent so he bought three large ice creams which they slurped happily as they wandered up the alley examining the fascinating shop windows ron gazed longingly at a full set of chudley cannon robes in the windows of quality quidditch supplies until hermione dragged them off to buy ink and parchment next door in gambol and japes wizarding joke shop they met fred george and lee jordan who were stocking up on dr fabulous fireworks and in a tiny junk shop full of broken wands lopsided brass scales and old cloaks covered in potion stains they found percy deeply immersed in a small and deeply boring book called prefects who gained power 
 
 a study of hogwarts prefects and their later careers ron read aloud off the back cover that sounds fascinating 
 
 go away percy snapped 
 
 course very ambitious percy got it all planned out he wants to be minister of magic ron told harry and hermione in an undertone as they left percy to it 
 
 an hour later they headed for flourish and blotts they were by no means the only ones making their way to the bookshop as they approached it they saw to their surprise a large crowd jostling outside the doors trying to get in the reason for this was proclaimed by a large banner stretched across the upper windows 
 
 gilderoy lockhart 
 
 will be signing copies of his autobiography 
 
 magical me 
 
 today to 
 
 we can actually meet him hermione squealed i mean written almost the whole booklist 
 
 the crowd seemed to be made up mostly of witches around mrs age a wizard stood at the door saying calmly please ladies push there mind the books now 
 
 harry ron and hermione squeezed inside a long line wound right to the back of the shop where gilderoy lockhart was signing his books they each grabbed a copy of the standard book of spells grade and sneaked up the line to where the rest of the weasleys were standing with mr and mrs granger 
 
 oh there you are good said mrs weasley she sounded breathless and kept patting her hair be able to see him in a minute 
 
 gilderoy lockhart came slowly into view seated at a table surrounded by large pictures of his own face all winking and flashing dazzlingly white teeth at the crowd the real lockhart was wearing robes of blue that exactly matched his eyes his pointed hat was set at a jaunty angle on his wavy hair 
 
 a short man was dancing around taking photographs with a large black camera that emitted puffs of purple smoke with every blinding flash 
 
 out of the way there he snarled at ron moving back to get a better shot this is for the daily prophet 
 
 big deal said ron rubbing his foot where the photographer had stepped on it 
 
 gilderoy lockhart heard him he looked up he saw ron and then he saw harry he stared then he leapt to his feet and positively shouted it be harry potter 
 
 the crowd parted whispering excitedly lockhart dived forward seized arm and pulled him to the front the crowd burst into applause face burned as lockhart shook his hand for the photographer who was clicking away madly wafting thick smoke over the weasleys 
 
 nice big smile harry said lockhart through his own gleaming teeth together you and i are worth the front page 
 
 when he finally let go of hand harry could hardly feel his fingers he tried to sidle back over to the weasleys but lockhart threw an arm around his shoulders and clamped him tightly to his side 
 
 ladies and gentlemen he said loudly waving for quiet what an extraordinary moment this is the perfect moment for me to make a little announcement been sitting on for some time 
 
 when young harry here stepped into flourish and blotts today he only wanted to buy my autobiography which i shall be happy to present him now free of charge the crowd applauded again he had no idea lockhart continued giving harry a little shake that made his glasses slip to the end of his nose that he would shortly be getting much much more than my book magical me he and his schoolmates will in fact be getting the real magical me yes ladies and gentlemen i have great pleasure and pride in announcing that this september i will be taking up the post of defense against the dark arts teacher at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry 
 
 the crowd cheered and clapped and harry found himself being presented with the entire works of gilderoy lockhart staggering slightly under their weight he managed to make his way out of the limelight to the edge of the room where ginny was standing next to her new cauldron 
 
 you have these harry mumbled to her tipping the books into the cauldron buy my own 
 
 bet you loved that you potter said a voice harry had no trouble recognizing he straightened up and found himself with draco malfoy who was wearing his usual sneer 
 
 famous harry potter said malfoy even go into a bookshop without making the front page 
 
 leave him alone he want all that said ginny it was the first time she had spoken in front of harry she was glaring at malfoy 
 
 potter got yourself a girlfriend drawled malfoy ginny went scarlet as ron and hermione fought their way over both clutching stacks of books 
 
 oh you said ron looking at malfoy as if he were something unpleasant on the sole of his shoe bet surprised to see harry here eh 
 
 not as surprised as i am to see you in a shop weasley retorted malfoy i suppose your parents will go hungry for a month to pay for all those 
 
 ron went as red as ginny he dropped his books into the cauldron too and started toward malfoy but harry and hermione grabbed the back of his jacket 
 
 ron said mr weasley struggling over with fred and george what are you doing too crowded in here go outside 
 
 well well well arthur weasley 
 
 it was mr malfoy he stood with his hand on shoulder sneering in just the same way 
 
 lucius said mr weasley nodding coldly 
 
 busy time at the ministry i hear said mr malfoy all those raids i hope paying you overtime 
 
 he reached into cauldron and extracted from amid the glossy lockhart books a very old very battered copy of a guide to transfiguration 
 
 obviously not mr malfoy said dear me the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they even pay you well for it 
 
 mr weasley flushed darker than either ron or ginny 
 
 we have a very different idea of what disgraces the name of wizard malfoy he said 
 
 clearly said mr malfoy his pale eyes straying to mr and mrs granger who were watching apprehensively the company you keep weasley and i thought your family could sink no lower 
 
 there was a thud of metal as cauldron went flying mr weasley had thrown himself at mr malfoy knocking him backward into a bookshelf dozens of heavy spellbooks came thundering down on all their heads there was a yell of get him dad from fred or george mrs weasley was shrieking no arthur no the crowd stampeded backward knocking more shelves over gentlemen please please cried the assistant and then louder than all 
 
 break it up there gents break it up 
 
 hagrid was wading toward them through the sea of books in an instant he had pulled mr weasley and mr malfoy apart mr weasley had a cut lip and mr malfoy had been hit in the eye by an encyclopedia of toadstools he was still holding old transfiguration book he thrust it at her his eyes glittering with malice 
 
 here girl take your book the best your father can give you pulling himself out of grip he beckoned to draco and swept from the shop 
 
 yeh ignored him arthur said hagrid almost lifting mr weasley off his feet as he straightened his robes rotten ter the core the whole family everyone knows that no worth bad blood what it is come on now get outta here 
 
 the assistant looked as though he wanted to stop them leaving but he barely came up to waist and seemed to think better of it they hurried up the street the grangers shaking with fright and mrs weasley beside herself with fury 
 
 a fine example to set for your children brawling in public what gilderoy lockhart thought 
 
 he was pleased said fred you hear him as we were leaving he was asking that bloke from the daily prophet if be able to work the fight into his report said it was all publicity 
 
 but it was a subdued group that headed back to the fireside in the leaky cauldron where harry the weasleys and all their shopping would be traveling back to the burrow using floo powder they said to the grangers who were leaving the pub for the muggle street on the other side mr weasley started to ask them how bus stops worked but stopped quickly at the look on mrs face 
 
 harry took off his glasses and put them safely in his pocket before helping himself to floo powder it definitely his favorite way to travel
