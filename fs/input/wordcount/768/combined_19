 book just man 
 chapter iv 
 
 works corresponding to words 
 his conversation was gay and affable 
 he put himself on a level with the two old women who had passed their lives beside him when he laughed it was the laugh of a schoolboy 
 madame magloire liked to call him your grace votre grandeur one day he rose from his and went to his library in search of a book this book was on one of the upper shelves 
 as the bishop was rather short of stature he could not reach it 
 madame magloire said he fetch me a chair 
 my greatness grandeur does not reach as far as that shelf 
 one of his distant relatives madame la comtesse de lo rarely allowed an opportunity to escape of enumerating in his presence what she designated as the expectations of her three sons she had numerous relatives who were very old and near to death and of whom her sons were the natural heirs 
 the youngest of the three was to receive from a a good hundred thousand livres of income the second was the heir by entail to the title of the duke his uncle the eldest was to succeed to the peerage of his grandfather 
 the bishop was accustomed to listen in silence to these innocent and pardonable maternal boasts 
 on one occasion however he appeared to be more thoughtful than usual while madame de lo was relating once again the details of all these inheritances and all these expectations 
 she interrupted herself impatiently mon dieu cousin 
 what are you thinking about 
 i am thinking replied the bishop of a singular remark which is to be found i believe in st your hopes in the man from whom you do not inherit 
 at another time on receiving a notification of the decease of a gentleman of the wherein not only the dignities of the dead man but also the feudal and noble qualifications of all his relatives spread over an entire page 
 what a stout back death has he exclaimed 
 what a strange burden of titles is cheerfully imposed on him and how much wit must men have in order thus to press the tomb into the service of vanity 
 he was gifted on occasion with a gentle raillery which almost always concealed a serious meaning 
 in the course of one lent a youthful vicar came to d and preached in the cathedral he was tolerably eloquent 
 the subject of his sermon was charity he urged the rich to give to the poor in order to avoid hell which he depicted in the most frightful manner of which he was capable and to win paradise which he represented as charming and desirable among the audience there was a wealthy retired merchant who was somewhat of a usurer named m geborand who had amassed two millions in the manufacture of coarse cloth serges and woollen galloons never in his whole life had m geborand bestowed alms on any poor wretch after the delivery of that sermon it was observed that he gave a sou every sunday to the poor old at the door of the cathedral there were six of them to share it 
 one day the bishop caught sight of him in the act of bestowing this charity and said to his sister with a smile there is m geborand purchasing paradise for a sou 
 when it was a question of charity he was not to be rebuffed even by a refusal and on such occasions he gave utterance to remarks which induced reflection 
 once he was begging for the poor in a of the town there was present the marquis de champtercier a wealthy and avaricious old man who contrived to be at one and the same time an and an this variety of man has actually existed 
 when the bishop came to him he touched his arm you must give me something m le marquis the marquis turned round and answered dryly i have poor people of my own monseigneur 
 give them to me replied the bishop 
 one day he preached the following sermon in the cathedral 
 my very dear brethren my good friends there are thirteen hundred and twenty thousand peasants dwellings in france which have but three openings eighteen hundred and seventeen thousand hovels which have but two openings the door and one window and three hundred and thousand cabins besides which have but one opening the door 
 and this arises from a thing which is called the tax on doors and windows 
 just put poor families old women and little children in those buildings and behold the fevers and maladies which result 
 alas 
 god gives air to men the law sells it to them i do not blame the law but i bless god 
 in the department of the isere in the var in the two departments of the alpes the hautes and the basses the peasants have not even wheelbarrows they transport their manure on the backs of men they have no candles and they burn resinous sticks and bits of rope dipped in pitch that is the state of affairs throughout the whole of the hilly country of dauphine 
 they make bread for six months at one time they bake it with dried in the winter they break this bread up with an axe and they soak it for hours in order to render it eatable 
 my brethren have pity behold the suffering on all sides of you 
 born a provencal he easily familiarized himself with the dialect of the south 
 he said en be moussu ses sage as in lower languedoc onte anaras passa as in the puerte un bouen moutu embe un bouen fromage grase as in upper dauphine 
 this pleased the people extremely and contributed not a little to win him access to all spirits 
 he was perfectly at home in the thatched cottage and in the mountains 
 he understood how to say the grandest things in the most vulgar of idioms 
 as he spoke all tongues he entered into all hearts 
 moreover he was the same towards people of the world and towards the lower classes 
 he condemned nothing in haste and without taking circumstances into account 
 he said examine the road over which the fault has passed 
 being as he described himself with a smile an he had none of the asperities of austerity and he professed with a good deal of distinctness and without the frown of the ferociously virtuous a doctrine which may be summed up as follows 
 man has upon him his flesh which is at once his burden and his temptation 
 he drags it with him and yields to it he must watch it cheek it repress it and obey it only at the last extremity 
 there may be some fault even in this obedience but the fault thus committed is venial it is a fall but a fall on the knees which may terminate in prayer 
 to be a saint is the exception to be an upright man is the rule err fall sin if you will but be upright 
 the least possible sin is the law of man 
 no sin at all is the dream of the angel 
 all which is terrestrial is subject to sin sin is a gravitation 
 when he saw everyone exclaiming very loudly and growing angry very quickly oh oh he said with a smile to all appearance this is a great crime which all the world commits 
 these are hypocrisies which have taken fright and are in haste to make protest and to put themselves under shelter 
 he was indulgent towards women and poor people on whom the burden of human society rest 
 he said the faults of women of children of the feeble the indigent and the ignorant are the fault of the husbands the fathers the masters the strong the rich and the wise 
 he said moreover teach those who are ignorant as many things as possible society is culpable in that it does not afford instruction gratis it is responsible for the night which it produces this soul is full of shadow sin is therein committed 
 the guilty one is not the person who has committed the sin but the person who has created the shadow 
 it will be perceived that he had a peculiar manner of his own of judging things 
 i suspect that he obtained it from the gospel 
 one day he heard a criminal case which was in preparation and on the point of trial discussed in a a wretched man being at the end of his resources had coined counterfeit money out of love for a woman and for the child which he had had by her counterfeiting was still punishable with death at that epoch the woman had been arrested in the act of passing the first false piece made by the man 
 she was held but there were no proofs except against her 
 she alone could accuse her lover and destroy him by her confession 
 she denied they insisted 
 she persisted in her denial 
 thereupon an idea occurred to the attorney for the crown he invented an infidelity on the part of the lover and succeeded by means of fragments of letters cunningly presented in persuading the unfortunate woman that she had a rival and that the man was deceiving her 
 thereupon exasperated by jealousy she denounced her lover confessed all proved all 
 the man was ruined 
 he was shortly to be tried at aix with his accomplice 
 they were relating the matter and each one was expressing enthusiasm over the cleverness of the magistrate by bringing jealousy into play he had caused the truth to burst forth in wrath he had educed the justice of revenge 
 the bishop listened to all this in silence 
 when they had finished he inquired 
 where are this man and woman to be tried 
 at the court of assizes 
 he went on and where will the advocate of the crown be tried 
 a tragic event occurred at d a man was condemned to death for murder 
 he was a wretched fellow not exactly educated not exactly ignorant who had been a mountebank at fairs and a writer for the public 
 the town took a great interest in the trial on the eve of the day fixed for the execution of the condemned man the chaplain of the prison fell ill 
 a priest was needed to attend the criminal in his last moments 
 they sent for the cure it seems that he refused to come saying that is no affair of mine 
 i have nothing to do with that unpleasant task and with that mountebank 
 i too am ill and besides it is not my place this reply was reported to the bishop who said monsieur le cure is right 
 it is not his place it is mine 
 he went instantly to the prison descended to the cell of the mountebank called him by name took him by the hand and spoke to him he passed the entire day with him forgetful of food and sleep praying to god for the soul of the condemned man and praying the condemned man for his own 
 he told him the best truths which are also the most simple 
 he was father brother friend he was bishop only to bless 
 he taught him everything encouraged and consoled him the man was on the point of dying in despair 
 death was an abyss to him as he stood trembling on its mournful brink he recoiled with horror he was not sufficiently ignorant to be absolutely indifferent his condemnation which had been a profound shock had in a manner broken through here and there that wall which separates us from the mystery of things and which we call life 
 he gazed incessantly beyond this world through these fatal breaches and beheld only darkness 
 the bishop made him see light 
 on the following day when they came to fetch the unhappy wretch the bishop was still there 
 he followed him and exhibited himself to the eyes of the crowd in his purple camail and with his episcopal cross upon his neck side by side with the criminal bound with cords 
 he mounted the tumbril with him he mounted the scaffold with him the sufferer who had been so gloomy and cast down on the preceding day was radiant 
 he felt that his soul was reconciled and he hoped in god 
 the bishop embraced him and at the moment when the knife was about to fall he said to him 
 god raises from the dead him whom man slays he whom his brothers have rejected finds his father once more 
 pray believe enter into life 
 the father is there when he descended from the scaffold there was something in his look which made the people draw aside to let him pass 
 they did not know which was most worthy of admiration his pallor or his serenity on his return to the humble dwelling which he designated with a smile as his palace he said to his sister i have just officiated pontifically 
 since the most sublime things are often those which are the least understood there were people in the town who said when commenting on this conduct of the bishop it is affectation 
 this however was a remark which was confined to the the populace which perceives no jest in holy deeds was touched and admired him 
 as for the bishop it was a shock to him to have beheld the guillotine and it was a long time before he recovered from it 
 in fact when the scaffold is there all erected and prepared it has something about it which produces hallucination one may feel a certain indifference to the death penalty one may refrain from pronouncing upon it from saying yes or no so long as one has not seen a guillotine with own eyes but if one encounters one of them the shock is violent one is forced to decide and to take part for or against some admire it like de maistre others execrate it like beccaria the guillotine is the concretion of the law it is called vindicte it is not neutral and it does not permit you to remain neutral he who sees it shivers with the most mysterious of shivers all social problems erect their interrogation point around this the scaffold is a vision 
 the scaffold is not a piece of carpentry the scaffold is not a machine the scaffold is not an inert bit of mechanism constructed of wood iron and cords 
 it seems as though it were a being possessed of i know not what sombre initiative one would say that this piece of work saw that this machine heard that this mechanism understood that this wood this iron and these cords were possessed of will in the frightful meditation into which its presence casts the soul the scaffold appears in terrible guise and as though taking part in what is going on 
 the scaffold is the accomplice of the executioner it devours it eats flesh it drinks blood the scaffold is a sort of monster fabricated by the judge and the carpenter a spectre which seems to live with a horrible vitality composed of all the death which it has inflicted 
 therefore the impression was terrible and profound on the day following the execution and on many succeeding days the bishop appeared to be crushed 
 the almost violent serenity of the funereal moment had disappeared the phantom of social justice tormented him 
 he who generally returned from all his deeds with a radiant satisfaction seemed to be reproaching himself at times he talked to himself and stammered lugubrious monologues in a low voice 
 this is one which his sister overheard one evening and preserved 
 i did not think that it was so monstrous it is wrong to become absorbed in the divine law to such a degree as not to perceive human law 
 death belongs to god alone by what right do men touch that unknown thing 
 in course of time these impressions weakened and probably vanished nevertheless it was observed that the bishop thenceforth avoided passing the place of execution 
 m myriel could be summoned at any hour to the bedside of the sick and dying 
 he did not ignore the fact that therein lay his greatest duty and his greatest labor 
 widowed and orphaned families had no need to summon him he came of his own accord 
 he understood how to sit down and hold his peace for long hours beside the man who had lost the wife of his love of the mother who had lost her child 
 as he knew the moment for silence he knew also the moment for speech 
 oh admirable consoler 
 he sought not to efface sorrow by forgetfulness but to magnify and dignify it by hope 
 he said 
 have a care of the manner in which you turn towards the dead think not of that which perishes 
 gaze steadily 
 you will perceive the living light of your dead in the depths of heaven he knew that faith is wholesome 
 he sought to counsel and calm the despairing man by pointing out to him the resigned man and to transform the grief which gazes upon a grave by showing him the grief which fixes its gaze upon a star

 in the course of one lent a youthful vicar came to d and preached in the cathedral he was tolerably eloquent 
 the subject of his sermon was charity he urged the rich to give to the poor in order to avoid hell which he depicted in the most frightful manner of which he was capable and to win paradise which he represented as charming and desirable among the audience there was a wealthy retired merchant who was somewhat of a usurer named m geborand who had amassed two millions in the manufacture of coarse cloth serges and woollen galloons never in his whole life had m geborand bestowed alms on any poor wretch after the delivery of that sermon it was observed that he gave a sou every sunday to the poor old at the door of the cathedral there were six of them to share it 
 one day the bishop caught sight of him in the act of bestowing this charity and said to his sister with a smile there is m geborand purchasing paradise for a sou 
 when it was a question of charity he was not to be rebuffed even by a refusal and on such occasions he gave utterance to remarks which induced reflection 
 once he was begging for the poor in a of the town there was present the marquis de champtercier a wealthy and avaricious old man who contrived to be at one and the same time an and an this variety of man has actually existed 
 when the bishop came to him he touched his arm you must give me something m le marquis the marquis turned round and answered dryly i have poor people of my own monseigneur 
 give them to me replied the bishop 
 one day he preached the following sermon in the cathedral 
 my very dear brethren my good friends there are thirteen hundred and twenty thousand peasants dwellings in france which have but three openings eighteen hundred and seventeen thousand hovels which have but two openings the door and one window and three hundred and thousand cabins besides which have but one opening the door 
 and this arises from a thing which is called the tax on doors and windows 
 just put poor families old women and little children in those buildings and behold the fevers and maladies which result 
 alas 
 god gives air to men the law sells it to them i do not blame the law but i bless god 
 in the department of the isere in the var in the two departments of the alpes the hautes and the basses the peasants have not even wheelbarrows they transport their manure on the backs of men they have no candles and they burn resinous sticks and bits of rope dipped in pitch that is the state of affairs throughout the whole of the hilly country of dauphine 
 they make bread for six months at one time they bake it with dried in the winter they break this bread up with an axe and they soak it for hours in order to render it eatable 
 my brethren have pity behold the suffering on all sides of you 
 born a provencal he easily familiarized himself with the dialect of the south 
 he said en be moussu ses sage as in lower languedoc onte anaras passa as in the puerte un bouen moutu embe un bouen fromage grase as in upper dauphine 
 this pleased the people extremely and contributed not a little to win him access to all spirits 
 he was perfectly at home in the thatched cottage and in the mountains 
 he understood how to say the grandest things in the most vulgar of idioms 
 as he spoke all tongues he entered into all hearts 
 moreover he was the same towards people of the world and towards the lower classes 
 he condemned nothing in haste and without taking circumstances into account 
 he said examine the road over which the fault has passed 
 being as he described himself with a smile an he had none of the asperities of austerity and he professed with a good deal of distinctness and without the frown of the ferociously virtuous a doctrine which may be summed up as follows 
 man has upon him his flesh which is at once his burden and his temptation 
 he drags it with him and yields to it he must watch it cheek it repress it and obey it only at the last extremity 
 there may be some fault even in this obedience but the fault thus committed is venial it is a fall but a fall on the knees which may terminate in prayer 
 to be a saint is the exception to be an upright man is the rule err fall sin if you will but be upright 
 the least possible sin is the law of man 
 no sin at all is the dream of the angel 
 all which is terrestrial is subject to sin sin is a gravitation 
 when he saw everyone exclaiming very loudly and growing angry very quickly oh oh he said with a smile to all appearance this is a great crime which all the world commits 
 these are hypocrisies which have taken fright and are in haste to make protest and to put themselves under shelter 
 he was indulgent towards women and poor people on whom the burden of human society rest 
 he said the faults of women of children of the feeble the indigent and the ignorant are the fault of the husbands the fathers the masters the strong the rich and the wise 
 he said moreover teach those who are ignorant as many things as possible society is culpable in that it does not afford instruction gratis it is responsible for the night which it produces this soul is full of shadow sin is therein committed 
 the guilty one is not the person who has committed the sin but the person who has created the shadow 
 it will be perceived that he had a peculiar manner of his own of judging things 
 i suspect that he obtained it from the gospel 
 one day he heard a criminal case which was in preparation and on the point of trial discussed in a a wretched man being at the end of his resources had coined counterfeit money out of love for a woman and for the child which he had had by her counterfeiting was still punishable with death at that epoch the woman had been arrested in the act of passing the first false piece made by the man 
 she was held but there were no proofs except against her 
 she alone could accuse her lover and destroy him by her confession 
 she denied they insisted 
 she persisted in her denial 
 thereupon an idea occurred to the attorney for the crown he invented an infidelity on the part of the lover and succeeded by means of fragments of letters cunningly presented in persuading the unfortunate woman that she had a rival and that the man was deceiving her 
 thereupon exasperated by jealousy she denounced her lover confessed all proved all 
 the man was ruined 
 he was shortly to be tried at aix with his accomplice 
 they were relating the matter and each one was expressing enthusiasm over the cleverness of the magistrate by bringing jealousy into play he had caused the truth to burst forth in wrath he had educed the justice of revenge 
 the bishop listened to all this in silence 
 when they had finished he inquired 
 where are this man and woman to be tried 
 at the court of assizes 
 he went on and where will the advocate of the crown be tried 
 a tragic event occurred at d a man was condemned to death for murder 
 he was a wretched fellow not exactly educated not exactly ignorant who had been a mountebank at fairs and a writer for the public 
 the town took a great interest in the trial on the eve of the day fixed for the execution of the condemned man the chaplain of the prison fell ill 
 a priest was needed to attend the criminal in his last moments 
 they sent for the cure it seems that he refused to come saying that is no affair of mine 
 i have nothing to do with that unpleasant task and with that mountebank 
 i too am ill and besides it is not my place this reply was reported to the bishop who said monsieur le cure is right 
 it is not his place it is mine 
 he went instantly to the prison descended to the cell of the mountebank called him by name took him by the hand and spoke to him he passed the entire day with him forgetful of food and sleep praying to god for the soul of the condemned man and praying the condemned man for his own 
 he told him the best truths which are also the most simple 
 he was father brother friend he was bishop only to bless 
 he taught him everything encouraged and consoled him the man was on the point of dying in despair 
 death was an abyss to him as he stood trembling on its mournful brink he recoiled with horror he was not sufficiently ignorant to be absolutely indifferent his condemnation which had been a profound shock had in a manner broken through here and there that wall which separates us from the mystery of things and which we call life 
 he gazed incessantly beyond this world through these fatal breaches and beheld only darkness 
 the bishop made him see light 
 on the following day when they came to fetch the unhappy wretch the bishop was still there 
 he followed him and exhibited himself to the eyes of the crowd in his purple camail and with his episcopal cross upon his neck side by side with the criminal bound with cords 
 he mounted the tumbril with him he mounted the scaffold with him the sufferer who had been so gloomy and cast down on the preceding day was radiant 
 he felt that his soul was reconciled and he hoped in god 
 the bishop embraced him and at the moment when the knife was about to fall he said to him 
 god raises from the dead him whom man slays he whom his brothers have rejected finds his father once more 
 pray believe enter into life 
 the father is there when he descended from the scaffold there was something in his look which made the people draw aside to let him pass 
 they did not know which was most worthy of admiration his pallor or his serenity on his return to the humble dwelling which he designated with a smile as his palace he said to his sister i have just officiated pontifically 
 since the most sublime things are often those which are the least understood there were people in the town who said when commenting on this conduct of the bishop it is affectation 
 this however was a remark which was confined to the the populace which perceives no jest in holy deeds was touched and admired him 
 as for the bishop it was a shock to him to have beheld the guillotine and it was a long time before he recovered from it 
 in fact when the scaffold is there all erected and prepared it has something about it which produces hallucination one may feel a certain indifference to the death penalty one may refrain from pronouncing upon it from saying yes or no so long as one has not seen a guillotine with own eyes but if one encounters one of them the shock is violent one is forced to decide and to take part for or against some admire it like de maistre others execrate it like beccaria the guillotine is the concretion of the law it is called vindicte it is not neutral and it does not permit you to remain neutral he who sees it shivers with the most mysterious of shivers all social problems erect their interrogation point around this the scaffold is a vision 
 the scaffold is not a piece of carpentry the scaffold is not a machine the scaffold is not an inert bit of mechanism constructed of wood iron and cords 
 it seems as though it were a being possessed of i know not what sombre initiative one would say that this piece of work saw that this machine heard that this mechanism understood that this wood this iron and these cords were possessed of will in the frightful meditation into which its presence casts the soul the scaffold appears in terrible guise and as though taking part in what is going on 
 the scaffold is the accomplice of the executioner it devours it eats flesh it drinks blood the scaffold is a sort of monster fabricated by the judge and the carpenter a spectre which seems to live with a horrible vitality composed of all the death which it has inflicted 
 therefore the impression was terrible and profound on the day following the execution and on many succeeding days the bishop appeared to be crushed 
 the almost violent serenity of the funereal moment had disappeared the phantom of social justice tormented him 
 he who generally returned from all his deeds with a radiant satisfaction seemed to be reproaching himself at times he talked to himself and stammered lugubrious monologues in a low voice 
 this is one which his sister overheard one evening and preserved 
 i did not think that it was so monstrous it is wrong to become absorbed in the divine law to such a degree as not to perceive human law 
 death belongs to god alone by what right do men touch that unknown thing 
 in course of time these impressions weakened and probably vanished nevertheless it was observed that the bishop thenceforth avoided passing the place of execution 
 m myriel could be summoned at any hour to the bedside of the sick and dying 
 he did not ignore the fact that therein lay his greatest duty and his greatest labor 
 widowed and orphaned families had no need to summon him he came of his own accord 
 he understood how to sit down and hold his peace for long hours beside the man who had lost the wife of his love of the mother who had lost her child 
 as he knew the moment for silence he knew also the moment for speech 
 oh admirable consoler 
 he sought not to efface sorrow by forgetfulness but to magnify and dignify it by hope 
 he said 
 have a care of the manner in which you turn towards the dead think not of that which perishes 
 gaze steadily 
 you will perceive the living light of your dead in the depths of heaven he knew that faith is wholesome 
 he sought to counsel and calm the despairing man by pointing out to him the resigned man and to transform the grief which gazes upon a grave by showing him the grief which fixes its gaze upon a star

 a new hope 
 iv 
 
 aunt beru was filling a pitcher with blue liquid from a refrigerated her in the dining area a steady buzz of conversation reached to the kitchen 
 she sighed sadly the mealtime discussions between her husband and lukehad grown steadily more acrimonious as the restlessness pulled him indirections other than farming directions for which owen a stolid man of the soil ifthere ever was one had absolutely no sympathy 
 returning the bulk container to the refrigerator unit she placed the pitcher on atray and hurried back to the dining room beru was not a brilliant woman but shepossessed an instinctive understanding of her important position in this functioned like the damping rods in a nuclear reactor as long as she waspresent owen and luke would continue to generate a lot of heat but if she was out oftheir presence for too 
 condenser units built into the bottom of each plate kept the food on the table hot as she hurried in immediately both men lowered their voices tosomething civilized and shifted the subject beru pretended not to notice the change 
 i think that artoo unit might have been stolen uncle owen luke was if that had been the topic of conversation all along 
 his uncle helped himself to the milk pitcher mumbling his reply around amouthful of food the jawas have a tendency to pick up anything not tieddown luke but remember basically afraid of their own shadows to resortto outright theft have to have considered the consequences of being pursuedand punished theoretically their minds be capable of that what makesyou think the droid is stolen 
 for one thing in awfully good shape for a discard it generated ahologram recording while i was cleaning luke tried to conceal his horror at theslip he added hastily but not important the reason i think it might bestolen is because it claims to be the property of someone it calls kenobi 
 maybe something in the food or perhaps the milk caused uncle to again it might have been an expression of disgust which was way ofindicating his opinion of that peculiar personage in any case he continued eatingwithout looking up at his nephew 
 luke pretended the display of graphic dislike had never happened i continued determinedly it might have meant old ben the first name is the last is identical 
 when his uncle steadfastly maintained his silence luke prompted him you know who talking about uncle owen 
 surprisingly his uncle looked uncomfortable instead of angry mumbled still not meeting gaze a name from another time hesquirmed nervously in his seat a name that can only mean trouble 
 luke refused to heed the implied warning and pressed on is it someonerelated to old ben then i know he had any relatives 
 you stay away from that old wizard he hear me his uncle substituting threat for reason 
 owen aunt beru started to interject gently but the big farmer cut her offsternly 
 now this is important beru he turned his attention back to his told you about kenobi before a crazy old man dangerous and fullof mischief and the best left well along 
 pleading gaze caused him to quiet somewhat that droid has nothingto do with him have he grumbled half to himself tomorrow i want you to take the unit into anchorhead and have its memoryflushed 
 snorting owen bent to his meal with determination that will bethe end of this foolishness i care where that machine thinks it came from ipaid hard credit for it and it belongs to us now 
 but suppose it does belong to someone else luke wondered what if person comes looking for his droid 
 an expression between sorrow and a sneer crossed his seamed face at aremembrance he i think that man exists anymore he died aboutthe same time as your father a huge mouthful of hot food was shoveled forget about it 
 then it was a real person luke murmured staring down at his plate headded slowly did he know my father 
 i said forge about it owen snapped your only worry as far as thosetwo droids are concerned is having them ready for work tomorrow remember thelast of our saving is tied up in those two even have bought them if so near harvest he shook a spoon at his nephew in the morning i wantyou to have them working with the irrigation units up on the south ridge 
 you know luke replied distantly i think these droids are going to work outfine in fact i he hesitated shooting his uncle a surreptitious glare i wasthinking about our agreement about me staying on for another season 
 his uncle failed to react so luke rushed on before his nerve failed if thesenew droids do work out i want to transmit my application to enter the academy fornext year 
 owen scowled trying to hide his displeasure with food you mean you wantto transmit application next the harvest 
 you have more than enough droids now and in good last 
 droids yes his uncle agreed but droids replace a man luke youknow that the harvest is when i need you the most just for one more seasonafter this one he looked away bluster and anger gone now 
 luke toyed with his food not eating saying nothing 
 listen his uncle told him for the first time got a chance for a realfortune make enough to hire some extra hands for next time not then you can go to the academy he fumbled over words unaccustomedto pleading i need you here luke you understand that you 
 another year his nephew objected sullenly another year 
 how many times had he heard that before how many times had theyrepeated this identical charade with the same result 
 convinced once more that luke had come round to his way of thinking owenshrugged the objection off time will pass before you know it 
 abruptly luke rose shoving his barely touched plate of food aside you said last year when biggs left he spun and half ran from the room 
 where are you going luke his aunt yelled worriedly after him 
 reply was bleak bitter looks like going nowhere then headded out of consideration for his sensibilities i have to finish cleaningthose droids if going to be ready to work tomorrow 
 silence hung in the air of the dining room after luke departed husband andwife ate mechanically eventually aunt beru stopped shoving her food around herplate looked up and pointed out earnestly owen you keep him here of his friends are gone the people he grew up with the academy means somuch to him 
 listlessly her husband replied make it up to him next year i have maybe the year after that 
 just not a farmer owen she continued firmly he never will be nomatter how hard you try to make him one she shook her head slowly gottoo much of his father in him 
 for the first time all evening owen lars looked thoughtful as well as concernedas he gazed down the passage luke had taken what afraid of hewhispered 
 luke had gone topside he stood on the sand watching the double sunset asfirst one and then the other of twin suns sank slowly behind the distantrange of dunes in the fading light the sands turned gold russet and flaming before advancing night put the bright colors to sleep for another day the first time those sands would blossom with food plants this formerwasteland would see and eruption of green 
 the thought ought to have sent a thrill of anticipation through luke he shouldhave been as flushed with excitement as his uncle was whenever he described thecoming harvest instead luke felt nothing but a vast indifferent emptiness noteven the prospect of having a lot of money for the first time in his life excited was there to do with money in on tatooine for thatmatter 
 part of him an increasingly large part was growing more and more restless atremaining unfulfilled this was not an uncommon feeling in youths his age but forreasons luke did not understand it was much stronger in him than in any of hisfriends 
 as the night cold came creeping over the sand and up his legs he brushed thegrit from his trousers and descended into the garage maybe working on the droidswould bury some of the remorse a little deeper in his mind a quick survey of thechamber showed no movement neither of the new machines was in slightly luke took a small control box from his belt and activated a coupleof switches set into the plastic 
 a low him came from the box the caller produced the taller of the two in fact he gave a yell of surprise as he jumped up behind the skyhopper 
 luke started toward him openly puzzled what are you hiding back therefor 
 the robot came stumbling around the prow of the craft he attitude one ofdesperation it occurred to luke then that despite his activating the caller the artoounit was still nowhere to be seen 
 the reason for his something related to pouring unbiddenfrom threepio it my fault the robot begged frantically please me i told him not to go but faulty he must be has totally boiled his logic circuits he kept babbling on about some sortof mission sir i never heard a robot with delusions of grandeur before suchthings even be within the cogitative theory units of one as basic as anartoo unit and 
 you mean luke started to gape 
 yes gone 
 and i removed his restraining coupling myself luke muttered he could visualize his face the last of their savings tied up inthese droids he had said 
 racing out of the garage luke hunted for reasons why the artoounit should go berserk threepio followed on his heels 
 from a small ridge which formed the highest point close by the homestead lukehad a panoramic view of the surrounding desert bringing out the preciousmacrobinoculars he scanned the rapidly darkening horizons for something and out of its mechanical mind 
 threepio fought his way up through the sand to stand beside luke that artoounit has always caused nothing but trouble he groaned astromech droids arebecoming too iconoclastic even for me to understand sometimes 
 the binoculars finally came down and luke commented nowhere in sight he kicked furiously at the ground damn could ihave been so stupid letting it trick me into removing that restrainer uncle to kill me 
 begging your pardon sir ventured a hopeful threepio visions of jawasdancing in his head but we go after him luke turned studiously he examined the wall of black advancing toward at night too dangerous with all the raiders around not too concernedabout the jawas but sandpeopleno not in the dark have to wait untilmorning to try to track him 
 a shout rose from the homestead below are you finished withthose droids yet turning down the power for the night 
 all right luke responded sidestepping the question be down in a fewminutes uncle owen turning he took one last look at the vanished am i in for it he muttered that little going to get me in a lot oftrouble 
 oh he excells at that sir threepio confirmed with mock cheerfulness lukethrew him a sour look and together they turned and descended into the garage 
 lukeluke still rubbing the morning sleep from his eyes owen glancedfrom side to side loosening his neck muscles where could that boy be loafingnow he wondered aloud at the lack of response there was no sign of movementin the homestead and he had already checked above 
 luke he yelled again luke luke lukethe name echoed teasing back athim from the homestead walls turning angrily he stalked back into the beru was preparing breakfast 
 have you seen luke this morning he asked as softly as he could manage 
 she glance briefly at him then returned to her cooking yes he said he hadsome things to do before he started out to the south ridge this morning so he leftearly 
 before breakfast owen frowned worriedly not like him did hetake the new droids with him 
 i think so i am sure i saw at least one of them with him 
 well owen mused uncomfortable but with nothing to really hangimprecations on better have those ridge units repaired by midday or behell to pay 
 an unseen face shielded by smooth white metal emerged from the pod that now formed the backbone of a dune slightly higher than its voice sounded efficient but tired 
 nothing the inspecting trooper muttered to his several companions notapes and no sign of habitation 
 powerful handguns lowered at the information that the pod was deserted oneof the armored men turned calling out to an officer standing some distance is definitely the pod that cleared the rebel ship sir but nothing onboard 
 yet it set down intact the officer was murmuring to himself it could havedone so on automatics but if it was a true malfunction then they have beenengaged something make sense 
 why nothing on board and no hint of life sir a voice declared 
 the officer turned and strode several paces to where another trooper waskneeling in the sand he held up an object for the inspection it shone inthe sun 
 droid plating the officer observed after a quick glance at the metal and underling exchanged a significant glance then their eyes turnedsimultaneously to the high mesas off to the north 
 gravel and fine sand formed a gritty fog beneath the landspeeder as it slid acrossthe rippling wasteland of tatooine on humming repulsors occasionally the craftwould jog slightly as it encountered a dip or slight rise to return to its smooth passageas its pilot compensated for the change in terrain 
 luke leaned back in the seat luxuriating in unaccustomed relaxation as threepioskillfully directed the powerful landcraft around dunes and rocky outcrops youhandle a landspeeder pretty well for a machine he noted admiringly 
 thank you sir a gratified threepio responded his eyes never moving from thelandscape ahead i was not lying to your uncle when i claimed versatility as mymiddle name in fact on occasion i have been called upon to perform unexpectedfunctions in circumstances which would have appalled my designers 
 something pinged behind them then pinged again 
 luke frowned and popped the speeder canopy a few moments of digging inthe motor casing eliminated the metallic bark 
 that he yelled forward 
 threepio signaled that the adjustment was satisfactory luke turned back intothe cockpit and closed the canopy over them again silently he brushed his hair back out of his eyes as his attention returned to the dry desert ahead ofthem 
 old ben kenobi is supposed to live out in this general direction even thoughnobody knows exactly where i see how that artoo unit could have come this farso quickly his expression was downcast we must have missed him back in thedunes somewhere he could be anywhere out here and uncle owen must bewondering why i called in from the south ridge by now 
 threepio considered a moment then ventured would it help sir if you toldhim that it was my fault 
 luke appeared to brighten at the suggestion surehe needs you twice asmuch now probably only deactivate you for a day or so or give you a partialmemory flush 
 deactivate memory flush threepio added hastily on second thought would still be around if you removed his restraining module 
 but something more important than fixing responsibility for the little was on mind at the moment wait a minute he advisedthreepio as he stared fixedly at the instrument panel something deadahead on the metal scanner distinguish outlines at this distance but judgingby size alone it could be our wandering droid hit it 
 the landspeeder jumped forward as threepio engaged the accelerator but itsoccupants were totally unaware that other eyes were watching as the craft increasedits speed 
 those eyes were not organic but then they wholly mechanical one could say for certain because no one had ever made that intimate a study ofthe tusken less formally to the margin farmers of tatooine simply asthe sandpeople 
 the tusken permit close study of themselves discouraging potentialobservers by methods as effective as they were uncivilized a few xenologiststhought they must be related to the jawas even fewer hypothesized that the jawaswere actually the mature form of the sandpeople but this theory was discounted bythe majority of serious scientists 
 both races affected tight clothing to shield them from twin dose ofsolar radiation but there most comparisons ended instead of heavy woven cloakslike the jawas wore the sandpeople wrapped themselves in endlessswathing and bandages and loose bits of cloth 
 where the jawas feared everything a tusken raider feared little thesandpeople were larger stronger and far more aggressive fortunately for thehuman colonists of tatooine they were not very numerous and elected to pursue theirnomadic existence in some of most desolate regions contact betweenhuman and tusken therefore was infrequent and uneasy and they murdered no morethan a handful of human per year since the human population had claimed its shareof tuskens not always with reason a peace of a sort existed between the as neither side gained an advantage 
 one of the pair felt that that unstable condition had temporarily shifted in hisfavor and he was about to take full advantage of it as he raised his rifle toward thelandspeeder but his companion grabbed the weapon and shoved down on it beforeit could be fired this set off a violent argument between the two and as theytraded vociferous opinions in a language consisting mostly of consonants thelandspeeder sped on its way 
 either because the speeder had passed out of range or because the second tuskenhad convinced the other the two broke off the discussion and scrambled down thebackside of the high ridge snuffling and a shifting of weight took place at the ridgebottom as the two banthas stirred at the approach of their masters each was aslarge as a small dinosaur with bright eyes and long thick fur they hissed anxiouslyas the two sandpeople approached then mounted them from knee to saddle 
 with a kick banthas rose moving slowly but with enormous strides the twomassive horned creatures swept down the back of the rugged bluff urged on by theiranxious equally outrageous mahouts 
 him all right luke declared with mixed anger and satisfaction as the tinytripodal form came into view the speeder banked and swung down onto the floorof a huge sandstone canyon luke slipped his rifle out from behind the seat andswung it over his shoulder come round in front of him threepio he instructed 
 with pleasure sir 
 the artoo unit obviously noted their approach but mad no move to escape itcould hardly have outrun the landspeeder anyway artoo simply halted as soon as itdetected them and waited until the craft swung around in a smooth arc threepiocame to a sharp halt sending up a low cloud of sand on the smaller the whine from the engine dropped to a low idling hum asthreepio put it in parking mode a last sigh and the craft stopped completely 
 after finishing a cautious survey of the canyon luke led his companion out ontothe gravelly surface and up to artoo detoo just where he inquired sharply didyou think you were going 
 a feeble whistle issued from the apologetic robot but it was threepio and notthe recalcitrant rover who was abruptly doing most of the talking 
 master luke here is now your rightful owner artoo how could you justamble away from him like this now found you have no more ofthis gibberish i know where picked that thatmelodramatic hologram either 
 artoo started to beep in protest but indignation was too great topermit excuses and talk to me about your mission what rot master luke blast you into a million pieces right here and now 
 not much chance of that admitted luke a bit overwhelmed by vindictiveness come getting late he eyed the rapidly risingsuns i just hope we can get back before uncle owen really lets go 
 if you mind my saying so threepio suggested apparently unwilling thatthe artoo unit should get off so easily i think you ought to deactivate the littlefugitive until gotten him safely back in the garage 
 no not going to try anything luke studied the softly beeping droidsternly i hope learned his lesson no need to 
 without warning the artoo unit suddenly leaped off the mean featconsidering the weakness of the spring mechanisms in his three thick legs hiscylindrical body was twisting and spinning as he let out a frantic symphony ofwhistles hoots and electronic exclamations 
 luke was tired not alarmed what is it wrong with him was beginning to see how patience could be worn thin he had hadabout enough of this addled instrument himself 
 undoubtedly the artoo unit had acquired the holo of the girl by accident thenused it to entice luke into removing his restraining module threepio probably hadthe right attitude still once luke got its circuits realigned and its logic couplingscleaned it would make a perfectly serviceable farm unit onlyif that was the why was threepio looking around so anxiously 
 oh my sir artoo claims there are several creatures of unknown typeapproaching from the southeast 
 that could be another attempt by artoo to distract them but luke takethe chance instantly he had his rifle off his shoulder and had activated the energycell he examined the horizon in the indicated direction and saw nothing but were experts at making themselves unseeable 
 luke suddenly realized exactly how far out they were how much ground thelandspeeder had covered that morning never been out in this direction this farfrom the farm before he informed threepio there are some awfully strangethings living out here not all of them have been classified better to treatanything as dangerous until determined otherwise of course if somethingutterly new his curiosity prodded him in any case this was probably justanother ruse of artoo take a look he decided 
 moving cautiously forward and keeping his rifle ready he led threepio towardthe crest of a nearby high dune at the same time he took care not to let artoo out ofhis sight 
 once at the top he lay flat and traded his rifle for the macrobinoculars canyon spread out before them rising to a wall of rust andocher advancing the binocs slowly across the canyon floor he settled unexpectedlyon two tethered shapes riderless 
 did you say something sir wheezed threepio struggling up behind locomotors were not designed for such outer climbing and scrambling 
 banthas all right luke whispered over his shoulder not considering in theexcitement of the moment that threepio might not know a bantha from a panda 
 he looked back into the eyepieces refocusing slightly i see one of them 
 something dark suddenly blocked his sight for a moment he thought that arock might have moved in front of them irritably he dropped the binoculars andreached out to move the blinding object aside his hand touched something like softmetal 
 it was a bandaged leg about as big around as both of together looked upand up the towering figure glaring down at him was no jawa ithad seemingly erupted straight from the sand 
 threepio took a startled step backward and found no footing as gyros whinedin protest the tall robot tumbled backward down the side of the dune frozen inplace luke heard steadily fading bangs and rattles as threepio bounced down thesteep slope behind him 
 as the moment of confrontation passed the tusken let out a terrifying grunt offury and pleasure and brought down his heavy gaderffii the axwould have cleaved skull neatly in two except that he threw the rifle up in agesture more instinctive than calculated his weapon deflected the blow but wouldnever do so again made from cannibalized freighter plating the huge ax shatteredthe barrel and made metallic confetti of the delicate insides 
 luke scrambled backward and found himself against a steep drop the raiderstalked him slowly weapon held high over its head it uttered agruesome chuckling laugh the sound made all the more inhuman by the distortioneffect of its sandfilter 
 luke tried to view his situation objectively as he had been instructed to do insurvival school trouble was his mouth was dry his hands were shaking and hewas paralyzed with fear with the raider in front of him and a probably fatal dropbehind something else in his mind took over and opted for the least painful fainted 
 none of the raiders notice artoo detoo as the tiny robot force himself into asmall alcove in the rocks near the landspeeder one of them was carrying the inertform of luke he dumped the unconscious youth in a heap next to the speeder thenjoined his fellows as they began swarming over the open craft 
 supplies and spare parts were thrown in all directions from time to time theplundering would be interrupted as several of them quibbled or fought over aparticularly choice bit of booty 
 unexpectedly distribution of the content ceased and withfrightening speed the raiders became part of the desertscape looking in all directions 
 a lost breeze idled absently down the canyon far off to the west somethinghowled a rolling booming drone ricocheted off canyon walls and crawlednervously up and down a gorgon scale 
 the sandpeople remained poised a moment longer then they were utteringloud grunts and moans of fright as they rushed to get away from the highly visiblelandspeeder 
 the shivering howl sounded again nearer this time bu now the sandpeoplewere halfway to their waiting banthas that were likewise lowing tensely and tuggingat their tethers 
 although the sound held no meaning for artoo detoo the little droid tried tosqueeze himself even deeper into the the booming howl came by the way the sandpeople had reacted something monstrous beyondimagining had to be behind that rolling cry something monstrous and might not have the sense to distinguish between edible organics and inediblemachines 
 not even the dust of their passing remained to mark where the tusken raidershad only minutes before been dismembering the interior of the landspeeder artoodetoo shut down all but vital functions trying to minimize noise and light as aswishing sound grew gradually audible moving toward the landspeeder thecreature appeared above the top of a nearby dune

 a new hope 
 iv 
 
 aunt beru was filling a pitcher with blue liquid from a refrigerated her in the dining area a steady buzz of conversation reached to the kitchen 
 she sighed sadly the mealtime discussions between her husband and lukehad grown steadily more acrimonious as the restlessness pulled him indirections other than farming directions for which owen a stolid man of the soil ifthere ever was one had absolutely no sympathy 
 returning the bulk container to the refrigerator unit she placed the pitcher on atray and hurried back to the dining room beru was not a brilliant woman but shepossessed an instinctive understanding of her important position in this functioned like the damping rods in a nuclear reactor as long as she waspresent owen and luke would continue to generate a lot of heat but if she was out oftheir presence for too 
 condenser units built into the bottom of each plate kept the food on the table hot as she hurried in immediately both men lowered their voices tosomething civilized and shifted the subject beru pretended not to notice the change 
 i think that artoo unit might have been stolen uncle owen luke was if that had been the topic of conversation all along 
 his uncle helped himself to the milk pitcher mumbling his reply around amouthful of food the jawas have a tendency to pick up anything not tieddown luke but remember basically afraid of their own shadows to resortto outright theft have to have considered the consequences of being pursuedand punished theoretically their minds be capable of that what makesyou think the droid is stolen 
 for one thing in awfully good shape for a discard it generated ahologram recording while i was cleaning luke tried to conceal his horror at theslip he added hastily but not important the reason i think it might bestolen is because it claims to be the property of someone it calls kenobi 
 maybe something in the food or perhaps the milk caused uncle to again it might have been an expression of disgust which was way ofindicating his opinion of that peculiar personage in any case he continued eatingwithout looking up at his nephew 
 luke pretended the display of graphic dislike had never happened i continued determinedly it might have meant old ben the first name is the last is identical 
 when his uncle steadfastly maintained his silence luke prompted him you know who talking about uncle owen 
 surprisingly his uncle looked uncomfortable instead of angry mumbled still not meeting gaze a name from another time hesquirmed nervously in his seat a name that can only mean trouble 
 luke refused to heed the implied warning and pressed on is it someonerelated to old ben then i know he had any relatives 
 you stay away from that old wizard he hear me his uncle substituting threat for reason 
 owen aunt beru started to interject gently but the big farmer cut her offsternly 
 now this is important beru he turned his attention back to his told you about kenobi before a crazy old man dangerous and fullof mischief and the best left well along 
 pleading gaze caused him to quiet somewhat that droid has nothingto do with him have he grumbled half to himself tomorrow i want you to take the unit into anchorhead and have its memoryflushed 
 snorting owen bent to his meal with determination that will bethe end of this foolishness i care where that machine thinks it came from ipaid hard credit for it and it belongs to us now 
 but suppose it does belong to someone else luke wondered what if person comes looking for his droid 
 an expression between sorrow and a sneer crossed his seamed face at aremembrance he i think that man exists anymore he died aboutthe same time as your father a huge mouthful of hot food was shoveled forget about it 
 then it was a real person luke murmured staring down at his plate headded slowly did he know my father 
 i said forge about it owen snapped your only worry as far as thosetwo droids are concerned is having them ready for work tomorrow remember thelast of our saving is tied up in those two even have bought them if so near harvest he shook a spoon at his nephew in the morning i wantyou to have them working with the irrigation units up on the south ridge 
 you know luke replied distantly i think these droids are going to work outfine in fact i he hesitated shooting his uncle a surreptitious glare i wasthinking about our agreement about me staying on for another season 
 his uncle failed to react so luke rushed on before his nerve failed if thesenew droids do work out i want to transmit my application to enter the academy fornext year 
 owen scowled trying to hide his displeasure with food you mean you wantto transmit application next the harvest 
 you have more than enough droids now and in good last 
 droids yes his uncle agreed but droids replace a man luke youknow that the harvest is when i need you the most just for one more seasonafter this one he looked away bluster and anger gone now 
 luke toyed with his food not eating saying nothing 
 listen his uncle told him for the first time got a chance for a realfortune make enough to hire some extra hands for next time not then you can go to the academy he fumbled over words unaccustomedto pleading i need you here luke you understand that you 
 another year his nephew objected sullenly another year 
 how many times had he heard that before how many times had theyrepeated this identical charade with the same result 
 convinced once more that luke had come round to his way of thinking owenshrugged the objection off time will pass before you know it 
 abruptly luke rose shoving his barely touched plate of food aside you said last year when biggs left he spun and half ran from the room 
 where are you going luke his aunt yelled worriedly after him 
 reply was bleak bitter looks like going nowhere then headded out of consideration for his sensibilities i have to finish cleaningthose droids if going to be ready to work tomorrow 
 silence hung in the air of the dining room after luke departed husband andwife ate mechanically eventually aunt beru stopped shoving her food around herplate looked up and pointed out earnestly owen you keep him here of his friends are gone the people he grew up with the academy means somuch to him 
 listlessly her husband replied make it up to him next year i have maybe the year after that 
 just not a farmer owen she continued firmly he never will be nomatter how hard you try to make him one she shook her head slowly gottoo much of his father in him 
 for the first time all evening owen lars looked thoughtful as well as concernedas he gazed down the passage luke had taken what afraid of hewhispered 
 luke had gone topside he stood on the sand watching the double sunset asfirst one and then the other of twin suns sank slowly behind the distantrange of dunes in the fading light the sands turned gold russet and flaming before advancing night put the bright colors to sleep for another day the first time those sands would blossom with food plants this formerwasteland would see and eruption of green 
 the thought ought to have sent a thrill of anticipation through luke he shouldhave been as flushed with excitement as his uncle was whenever he described thecoming harvest instead luke felt nothing but a vast indifferent emptiness noteven the prospect of having a lot of money for the first time in his life excited was there to do with money in on tatooine for thatmatter

 that could be another attempt by artoo to distract them but luke takethe chance instantly he had his rifle off his shoulder and had activated the energycell he examined the horizon in the indicated direction and saw nothing but were experts at making themselves unseeable 
 luke suddenly realized exactly how far out they were how much ground thelandspeeder had covered that morning never been out in this direction this farfrom the farm before he informed threepio there are some awfully strangethings living out here not all of them have been classified better to treatanything as dangerous until determined otherwise of course if somethingutterly new his curiosity prodded him in any case this was probably justanother ruse of artoo take a look he decided 
 moving cautiously forward and keeping his rifle ready he led threepio towardthe crest of a nearby high dune at the same time he took care not to let artoo out ofhis sight 
 once at the top he lay flat and traded his rifle for the macrobinoculars canyon spread out before them rising to a wall of rust andocher advancing the binocs slowly across the canyon floor he settled unexpectedlyon two tethered shapes riderless 
 did you say something sir wheezed threepio struggling up behind locomotors were not designed for such outer climbing and scrambling 
 banthas all right luke whispered over his shoulder not considering in theexcitement of the moment that threepio might not know a bantha from a panda 
 he looked back into the eyepieces refocusing slightly i see one of them 
 something dark suddenly blocked his sight for a moment he thought that arock might have moved in front of them irritably he dropped the binoculars andreached out to move the blinding object aside his hand touched something like softmetal 
 it was a bandaged leg about as big around as both of together looked upand up the towering figure glaring down at him was no jawa ithad seemingly erupted straight from the sand 
 threepio took a startled step backward and found no footing as gyros whinedin protest the tall robot tumbled backward down the side of the dune frozen inplace luke heard steadily fading bangs and rattles as threepio bounced down thesteep slope behind him 
 as the moment of confrontation passed the tusken let out a terrifying grunt offury and pleasure and brought down his heavy gaderffii the axwould have cleaved skull neatly in two except that he threw the rifle up in agesture more instinctive than calculated his weapon deflected the blow but wouldnever do so again made from cannibalized freighter plating the huge ax shatteredthe barrel and made metallic confetti of the delicate insides 
 luke scrambled backward and found himself against a steep drop the raiderstalked him slowly weapon held high over its head it uttered agruesome chuckling laugh the sound made all the more inhuman by the distortioneffect of its sandfilter 
 luke tried to view his situation objectively as he had been instructed to do insurvival school trouble was his mouth was dry his hands were shaking and hewas paralyzed with fear with the raider in front of him and a probably fatal dropbehind something else in his mind took over and opted for the least painful fainted 
 none of the raiders notice artoo detoo as the tiny robot force himself into asmall alcove in the rocks near the landspeeder one of them was carrying the inertform of luke he dumped the unconscious youth in a heap next to the speeder thenjoined his fellows as they began swarming over the open craft 
 supplies and spare parts were thrown in all directions from time to time theplundering would be interrupted as several of them quibbled or fought over aparticularly choice bit of booty 
 unexpectedly distribution of the content ceased and withfrightening speed the raiders became part of the desertscape looking in all directions 
 a lost breeze idled absently down the canyon far off to the west somethinghowled a rolling booming drone ricocheted off canyon walls and crawlednervously up and down a gorgon scale 
 the sandpeople remained poised a moment longer then they were utteringloud grunts and moans of fright as they rushed to get away from the highly visiblelandspeeder 
 the shivering howl sounded again nearer this time bu now the sandpeoplewere halfway to their waiting banthas that were likewise lowing tensely and tuggingat their tethers 
 although the sound held no meaning for artoo detoo the little droid tried tosqueeze himself even deeper into the the booming howl came by the way the sandpeople had reacted something monstrous beyondimagining had to be behind that rolling cry something monstrous and might not have the sense to distinguish between edible organics and inediblemachines 
 not even the dust of their passing remained to mark where the tusken raidershad only minutes before been dismembering the interior of the landspeeder artoodetoo shut down all but vital functions trying to minimize noise and light as aswishing sound grew gradually audible moving toward the landspeeder thecreature appeared above the top of a nearby dune

 and what do you think of this latest comedy the coronation at milan asked anna pavlovna and of the comedy of the people of genoa and lucca laying their petitions before monsieur buonaparte and monsieur buonaparte sitting on a throne and granting the petitions of the nations adorable it is enough to make head whirl it is as if the whole world had gone crazy 
 prince andrew looked anna pavlovna straight in the face with a sarcastic smile 
 dieu me la donne gare a qui la touche they say he was very fine when he said that he remarked repeating the words in italian dio mi dato guai a chi la tocchi 
 god has given it to me let him who touches it beware 
 i hope this will prove the last drop that will make the glass run over anna pavlovna continued the sovereigns will not be able to endure this man who is a menace to everything 
 the sovereigns i do not speak of russia said the vicomte polite but hopeless the sovereigns madame what have they done for louis xvii for the queen or for madame elizabeth nothing and he became more animated and believe me they are reaping the reward of their betrayal of the bourbon cause the sovereigns why they are sending ambassadors to compliment the usurper 
 and sighing disdainfully he again changed his position 
 prince hippolyte who had been gazing at the vicomte for some time through his lorgnette suddenly turned completely round toward the little princess and having asked for a needle began tracing the conde coat of arms on the table he explained this to her with as much gravity as if she had asked him to do it 
 baton de gueules engrele de gueules d azur maison conde said he 
 the princess listened smiling 
 if buonaparte remains on the throne of france a year longer the vicomte continued with the air of a man who in a matter with which he is better acquainted than anyone else does not listen to others but follows the current of his own thoughts things will have gone too far by intrigues violence exile and executions french society i mean good french society will have been forever destroyed and then 
 he shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands pierre wished to make a remark for the conversation interested him but anna pavlovna who had him under observation interrupted 
 the emperor alexander said she with the melancholy which always accompanied any reference of hers to the imperial family has declared that he will leave it to the french people themselves to choose their own form of government and i believe that once free from the usurper the whole nation will certainly throw itself into the arms of its rightful king she concluded trying to be amiable to the royalist emigrant 
 that is doubtful said prince andrew monsieur le vicomte quite rightly supposes that matters have already gone too far i think it will be difficult to return to the old regime 
 from what i have heard said pierre blushing and breaking into the conversation almost all the aristocracy has already gone over to side 
 it is the buonapartists who say that replied the vicomte without looking at pierre at the present time it is difficult to know the real state of french public opinion 
 bonaparte has said so remarked prince andrew with a sarcastic smile 
 it was evident that he did not like the vicomte and was aiming his remarks at him though without looking at him 
 i showed them the path to glory but they did not follow it prince andrew continued after a short silence again quoting words i opened my antechambers and they crowded in i do not know how far he was justified in saying so 
 not in the least replied the vicomte after the murder of the duc even the most partial ceased to regard him as a hero if to some people he went on turning to anna pavlovna he ever was a hero after the murder of the duc there was one martyr more in heaven and one hero less on earth 
 before anna pavlovna and the others had time to smile their appreciation of the epigram pierre again broke into the conversation and though anna pavlovna felt sure he would say something inappropriate she was unable to stop him 
 the execution of the duc declared monsieur pierre was a political necessity and it seems to me that napoleon showed greatness of soul by not fearing to take on himself the whole responsibility of that deed 
 dieu mon dieu muttered anna pavlovna in a terrified whisper 
 what monsieur pierre do you consider that assassination shows greatness of soul said the little princess smiling and drawing her work nearer to her 
 oh oh exclaimed several voices 
 capital said prince hippolyte in english and began slapping his knee with the palm of his hand 
 the vicomte merely shrugged his shoulders pierre looked solemnly at his audience over his spectacles and continued 
 i say so he continued desperately because the bourbons fled from the revolution leaving the people to anarchy and napoleon alone understood the revolution and quelled it and so for the general good he could not stop short for the sake of one life 
 you come over to the other table suggested anna pavlovna 
 but pierre continued his speech without heeding her 
 no cried he becoming more and more eager napoleon is great because he rose superior to the revolution suppressed its abuses preserved all that was good in it equality of citizenship and freedom of speech and of the press and only for that reason did he obtain power 
 yes if having obtained power without availing himself of it to commit murder he had restored it to the rightful king i should have called him a great man remarked the vicomte 
 he could not do that the people only gave him power that he might rid them of the bourbons and because they saw that he was a great man the revolution was a grand thing continued monsieur pierre betraying by this desperate and provocative proposition his extreme youth and his wish to express all that was in his mind 
 what revolution and regicide a grand thing well after that but you come to this other table repeated anna pavlovna 
 contrat social said the vicomte with a tolerant smile 
 i am not speaking of regicide i am speaking about ideas 
 yes ideas of robbery murder and regicide again interjected an ironical voice 
 those were extremes no doubt but they are not what is most important what is important are the rights of man emancipation from prejudices and equality of citizenship and all these ideas napoleon has retained in full force 
 liberty and equality said the vicomte contemptuously as if at last deciding seriously to prove to this youth how foolish his words were words which have long been discredited who does not love liberty and equality even our saviour preached liberty and equality have people since the revolution become happier on the contrary we wanted liberty but buonaparte has destroyed it 
 prince andrew kept looking with an amused smile from pierre to the vicomte and from the vicomte to their hostess in the first moment of outburst anna pavlovna despite her social experience was but when she saw that sacrilegious words had not exasperated the vicomte and had convinced herself that it was impossible to stop him she rallied her forces and joined the vicomte in a vigorous attack on the orator 
 but my dear monsieur pierre said she how do you explain the fact of a great man executing a duc or even an ordinary man who is innocent and untried 
 i should like said the vicomte to ask how monsieur explains the th brumaire was not that an imposture it was a swindle and not at all like the conduct of a great man 
 and the prisoners he killed in africa that was horrible said the little princess shrugging her shoulders 
 a low fellow say what you will remarked prince hippolyte 
 pierre not knowing whom to answer looked at them all and smiled his smile was unlike the of other people when he smiled his grave even rather gloomy look was instantaneously replaced by another a childlike kindly even rather silly look which seemed to ask forgiveness 
 the vicomte who was meeting him for the first time saw clearly that this young jacobin was not so terrible as his words suggested all were silent 
 how do you expect him to answer you all at once said prince andrew besides in the actions of a statesman one has to distinguish between his acts as a private person as a general and as an emperor so it seems to me 
 yes yes of course pierre chimed in pleased at the arrival of this reinforcement 
 one must admit continued prince andrew that napoleon as a man was great on the bridge of arcola and in the hospital at jaffa where he gave his hand to the but but there are other acts which it is difficult to justify 
 prince andrew who had evidently wished to tone down the awkwardness of remarks rose and made a sign to his wife that it was time to go 
 suddenly prince hippolyte started up making signs to everyone to attend and asking them all to be seated began 
 i was told a charming moscow story today and must treat you to it excuse me vicomte i must tell it in russian or the point will be lost and prince hippolyte began to tell his story in such russian as a frenchman would speak after spending about a year in russia everyone waited so emphatically and eagerly did he demand their attention to his story 
 there is in moscow a lady une dame and she is very stingy she must have two footmen behind her carriage and very big ones that was her taste and she had a maid also big she said 
 here prince hippolyte paused evidently collecting his ideas with difficulty 
 she said oh yes she said girl to the maid put on a livery get up behind the carriage and come with me while i make some calls 
 here prince hippolyte spluttered and burst out laughing long before his audience which produced an effect unfavorable to the narrator several persons among them the elderly lady and anna pavlovna did however smile 
 she went suddenly there was a great wind the girl lost her hat and her long hair came down here he could contain himself no longer and went on between gasps of laughter and the whole world knew 
 and so the anecdote ended though it was unintelligible why he had told it or why it had to be told in russian still anna pavlovna and the others appreciated prince social tact in so agreeably ending unpleasant and unamiable outburst after the anecdote the conversation broke up into insignificant small talk about the last and next balls about theatricals and who would meet whom and when and where

 but the hour came at last that ended mr troubles on earth he died quietly in his chair one october evening seated by the fireside a high wind blustered round the house and roared in the chimney it sounded wild and stormy yet it was not cold and we were all a little removed from the hearth busy at my knitting and joseph reading his bible near the table for the servants generally sat in the house then after their work was done miss cathy had been sick and that made her still she leant against her knee and heathcliff was lying on the floor with his head in her lap i remember the master before he fell into a doze stroking her bonny hair it pleased him rarely to see her canst thou not always be a good lass cathy and she turned her face up to his and laughed and answered why cannot you always be a good man father but as soon as she saw him vexed again she kissed his hand and said she would sing him to sleep she began singing very low till his fingers dropped from hers and his head sank on his breast then i told her to hush and not stir for fear she should wake him we all kept as mute as mice a full and should have done longer only joseph having finished his chapter got up and said that he must rouse the master for prayers and bed he stepped forward and called him by name and touched his shoulder but he would not move so he took the candle and looked at him i thought there was something wrong as he set down the light and seizing the children each by an arm whispered them to frame upstairs and make little might pray alone that had summut to do 
 i shall bid father good night first said catherine putting her arms round his neck before we could hinder her the poor thing discovered her loss screamed dead heathcliff dead and they both set up a cry 
 i joined my wail to theirs loud and bitter but joseph asked what we could be thinking of to roar in that way over a saint in heaven he told me to put on my cloak and run to gimmerton for the doctor and the parson i could not guess the use that either would be of then however i went through wind and rain and brought one the doctor back with me the other said he would come in the morning leaving joseph to explain matters i ran to the room their door was ajar i saw they had never laid down though it was past midnight but they were calmer and did not need me to console them the little souls were comforting each other with better thoughts than i could have hit on no parson in the world ever pictured heaven so beautifully as they did in their innocent talk and while i sobbed and listened i could not help wishing we were all there safe together

 but the hour came at last that ended mr troubles on earth he died quietly in his chair one october evening seated by the fireside a high wind blustered round the house and roared in the chimney it sounded wild and stormy yet it was not cold and we were all a little removed from the hearth busy at my knitting and joseph reading his bible near the table for the servants generally sat in the house then after their work was done miss cathy had been sick and that made her still she leant against her knee and heathcliff was lying on the floor with his head in her lap i remember the master before he fell into a doze stroking her bonny hair it pleased him rarely to see her canst thou not always be a good lass cathy and she turned her face up to his and laughed and answered why cannot you always be a good man father but as soon as she saw him vexed again she kissed his hand and said she would sing him to sleep she began singing very low till his fingers dropped from hers and his head sank on his breast then i told her to hush and not stir for fear she should wake him we all kept as mute as mice a full and should have done longer only joseph having finished his chapter got up and said that he must rouse the master for prayers and bed he stepped forward and called him by name and touched his shoulder but he would not move so he took the candle and looked at him i thought there was something wrong as he set down the light and seizing the children each by an arm whispered them to frame upstairs and make little might pray alone that had summut to do 
 i shall bid father good night first said catherine putting her arms round his neck before we could hinder her the poor thing discovered her loss screamed dead heathcliff dead and they both set up a cry 
 i joined my wail to theirs loud and bitter but joseph asked what we could be thinking of to roar in that way over a saint in heaven he told me to put on my cloak and run to gimmerton for the doctor and the parson i could not guess the use that either would be of then however i went through wind and rain and brought one the doctor back with me the other said he would come in the morning leaving joseph to explain matters i ran to the room their door was ajar i saw they had never laid down though it was past midnight but they were calmer and did not need me to console them the little souls were comforting each other with better thoughts than i could have hit on no parson in the world ever pictured heaven so beautifully as they did in their innocent talk and while i sobbed and listened i could not help wishing we were all there safe together

 chapter five 
 
 what in the world are you going to do now jo asked 
 meg one snowy afternoon as her sister came tramping through the hall in rubber boots old sack and hood with a broom in one hand and a shovel in the other 
 going out for exercise answered jo with a mischievous twinkle in her eyes 
 i should think two long walks this morning would have been enough cold and dull out and i advise you to stay warm and dry by the fire as i do said meg with a shiver 
 never take advice keep still all day and not being a pussycat i like to doze by the fire i like adventures and going to find some 
 meg went back to toast her feet and read ivanhoe and jo began to dig paths with great energy the snow was light and with her broom she soon swept a path all round the garden for beth to walk in when the sun came out and the invalid dolls needed air now the garden separated the marches house from that of mr laurence both stood in a suburb of the city which was still countrylike with groves and lawns large gardens and quiet streets a low hedge parted the two estates on one side was an old brown house looking rather bare and shabby robbed of the vines that in summer covered its walls and the flowers which then surrounded it on the other side was a stately stone mansion plainly betokening every sort of comfort and luxury from the big coach house and grounds to the conservatory and the glimpses of lovely things one caught between the rich curtains 
 yet it seemed a lonely lifeless sort of house for no children frolicked on the lawn no motherly face ever smiled at the windows and few people went in and out except the old gentleman and his grandson 
 to lively fancy this fine house seemed a kind of enchanted palace full of splendors and delights which no one enjoyed she had long wanted to behold these hidden glories and to know the laurence boy who looked as if he would like to be known if he only knew how to begin since the party she had been more eager than ever and had planned many ways of making friends with him but he had not been seen lately and jo began to think he had gone away when she one day spied a brown face at an upper window looking wistfully down into their garden where beth and amy were one another 
 that boy is suffering for society and fun she said to herself his grandpa does not know good for him and keeps him shut up all alone he needs a party of jolly boys to play with or somebody young and lively a great mind to go over and tell the old gentleman so 
 the idea amused jo who liked to do daring things and was always scandalizing meg by her queer performances the plan of going over was not forgotten and when the snowy afternoon came jo resolved to try what could be done she saw mr lawrence drive off and then sallied out to dig her way down to the hedge where she paused and took a survey all quiet curtains down at the lower windows servants out of sight and nothing human visible but a curly black head leaning on a thin hand at the upper window 
 there he is thought jo poor boy all alone and sick this dismal day a shame toss up a snowball and make him look out and then say a kind word to him 
 up went a handful of soft snow and the head turned at once showing a face which lost its listless look in a minute as the big eyes brightened and the mouth began to smile jo nodded and laughed and flourished her broom as she called out 
 how do you do are you sick 
 laurie opened the window and croaked out as hoarsely as a raven 
 better thank you had a bad cold and been shut up a week 
 sorry what do you amuse yourself with 
 nothing dull as tombs up here 
 you read 
 not much they let me 
 somebody read to you 
 grandpa does sometimes but my books interest him and i hate to ask brooke all the time 
 have someone come and see you then 
 there anyone like to see boys make such a row and my head is weak 
 there some nice girl read and amuse you girls are quiet and like to play nurse 
 know any 
 you know us began jo then laughed and stopped 
 so i do will you come please cried laurie 
 not quiet and nice but come if mother will let me go ask her shut the window like a good boy and wait till i come 
 with that jo shouldered her broom and marched into the house wondering what they would all say to her laurie was in a flutter of excitement at the idea of having company and flew about to get ready for as mrs march said he was a little gentleman and did honor to the coming guest by brushing his curly pate putting on a fresh color and trying tidy up the room which in spite of half a dozen servants was anything but neat presently there came a loud ring than a decided voice asking for mr laurie and a surprised looking servant came running up to announce a young lady 
 all right show her up miss jo said laurie going to the door of his little parlor to meet jo who appeared looking rosy and quite at her ease with a covered dish in one hand and three kittens in the other 
 here i am bag and baggage she said briskly mother sent her love and was glad if i could do anything for you meg wanted me to bring some of her blancmange she makes it very nicely and beth thought her cats would be comforting i knew laugh at them but i refuse she was so anxious to do something 
 it so happened that funny loan was just the thing for in laughing over the kits laurie forgot his bashfulness and grew sociable at once 
 that looks too pretty to eat he said smiling with pleasure as jo uncovered the dish and showed the blancmange surrounded by a garland of green leaves and the scarlet flowers of pet geranium 
 it anything only they all felt kindly and wanted to show it tell the girl to put it away for your tea so simple you can eat it and being soft it will slip down without hurting your sore throat what a cozy room this is 
 it might be it it was kept nice but the maids are lazy and i know how to make them mind it worries me though 
 right it up in two minutes for it only needs to have the hearth brushed the things made straight on the mantelpiece the books put here and the bottles there and your sofa turned from the light and the pillows plumped up a bit now then fixed 
 and so he was for as she laughed and talked jo had whisked things into place and given quite a different air to the room laurie watched her in respectful silence and when she beckoned him to his sofa he sat down with a sigh of satisfaction saying gratefully 
 how kind you are yes what it wanted now please take the big chair and let me do something to amuse my company 
 no i came to amuse you shall i read aloud and jo looked affectionately toward some inviting books near by 
 thank you read all those and if you mind rather talk answered laurie 
 not a bit talk all day if only set me going beth says i never know when to stop 
 is beth the rosy one who stays at home good deal and sometimes goes out with a little basket asked laurie with interest 
 yes beth my girl and a regular good one she is too 
 the pretty one is meg and the one is amy i believe 
 laurie colored up but answered frankly why you see i often hear you calling to one another and when alone up here i help looking over at your house you always seem to be having such good times i beg your pardon for being so rude but sometimes you forget to put down the curtain at the window where the flowers are and when the lamps are lighted like looking at a picture to see the fire and you all around the table with your mother her face is right opposite and it looks so sweet behind the flowers i help watching it i got any mother you know and laurie poked the fire to hide a little twitching of the lips that he could not control 
 the solitary hungry look in his eyes went straight to warm heart she had been so simply taught that there was no nonsense in her head and at fifteen she was as innocent and frank as any child laurie was sick and lonely and feeling how rich she was in home and happiness she gladly tried to share it with him her face was very friendly and her sharp voice unusually gentle as she said 
 never draw that curtain any more and i give you leave to look as much as you like i just wish though instead of peeping come over and see us mother is so splendid do you heaps of good and beth would sing to you if i begged her to and amy would dance meg and i would make you laugh over our funny stage properties and have jolly times your grandpa let you 
 i think he would if your mother asked him very kind though he does not look so and he lets me do what i like pretty much only afraid i might be a bother to strangers began laurie brightening more and more 
 we are not strangers we are neighbors and you think be a bother we want to know you and been trying to do it this ever so long we been here a great while you know but we have got acquainted with all our neighbors but you 
 you see grandpa lives among his books and mind much what happens outside mr brooke my tutor stay here you know and i have no one to go about with me so i just stop at home and get on as i can 
 bad you ought to make an effort and go visiting everywhere you are asked then have plenty of friends andpleasant places to go to never mind being bashful it last long if you keep going 
 laurie turned red again but offended at being accused of bashfulness for there was so much good will in jo it was impossible not to take her blunt speeches as kindly as they were meant 
 do you like your school asked the boy changing the subject after a little pause during which he stared at the fire and jo looked about her well pleased 
 go to school a i mean i go to wait on my and a dear cross old soul she is too answered jo 
 laurie opened his mouth to ask another question but remembering just in time that it manners to make too many inquiries into affairs he shut it again and looked uncomfortable 
 jo liked his good breeding and mind having a laugh at aunt march so she gave him a lively description of the fidgety old lady her fat poodle the parrot that talked spanish and the library where she reveled 
 laurie enjoyed that immensely and when she told about the prim old gentleman who came once to woo aunt march and in the middle of a fine speech how poll had tweaked his wig off to his great dismay the boy lay back and laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks and a maid popped her head in to see what was the matter 
 oh that does me no end of good tell on please he said taking his face out of the sofa cushion red and shining with merriment 
 much elated with her success jo did tell on all about their plays and plans their hopes and fears for father and the most interesting events of the little world in which the sisters lived then they got to talking about books and to delight she found that laurie loved them as well as she did and had read even more than herself 
 if you like them so much come down and see ours grandfather is out so you be afraid said laurie getting up 
 not afraid of anything returned jo with a toss of the head 
 i believe you are exclaimed the boy looking at her with much admiration though he privately thought she would have good reason to be a trifle afraid of the old gentleman if she met hem in some of his moods 
 the atmosphere of the whole house being summerlike laurie led the way from room to room letting jo stop to examine whatever struck her fancy and so at last they came to the library where she clapped her hands and pranced as she always did when especially delighted it was lined with books and there were pictures and statues and distracting little cabinets full of coins and curiosities and sleepy hollow chairs and queer tables and bronzes and best of all a great open fireplace with quaint tiles all round it 
 what richness sighed jo sinking into the depth of a velour chair and gazing about her with an air of intense satisfaction theodore laurence you ought to be the happiest boy in the added impressively 
 a fellow live on books said laurie shaking his head as he perched on a table opposite 
 before he could more a bell rang and jo flew up exclaiming with alarm mercy me your grandpa 
 well what if it is you are not afraid of anything you know returned the boy looking wicked 
 i think i am a little bit afraid of him but i know why i should be marmee said i might come and i think any the worse for it said jo composing herself though she kept her eyes on the door 
 a great deal better for it and ever so much obliged only afraid you are very tired of talking to me it was so pleasant i bear to stop said laurie gratefully 
 the doctor to see you sir and the maid beckoned as she spoke 
 would you mind if i left you for a minute i suppose i must see him said laurie 
 mind me happy as a cricket here answered jo 
 laurie went away and his guest amused herself in her own way she was standing before a fine portrait of the old gentleman when the door opened again and without turning she said decidedly sure now that i be afraid of him for got kind eyes though his mouth is grim and he looks as if he had a tremendous will of hisown he as handsome as my grandfather but i like him 
 thank you said a gruff voice behind her and there to her great dismay stood old mr laurence 
 poor jo blushed till she blush any redder and her heart began to beat uncomfortably fast as she thought what she had said for a minute a wild desire to run away possessed her but that was cowardly and the girls would laugh at her so she resolved to stay and get out of the scrape as she could a second look showed her that the living eyes under the bushy eyebrows were kinder even than the painted ones and there was a sly twinkle in them which lessened her fear a good deal the gruff voice was gruffer than ever as the old gentleman said abruptly after the dreadful pause so not afraid of me hey 
 not much sir 
 and you think me as handsome as your grandfather 
 not quite sir 
 and got a tremendous will have i 
 i only said i thought so 
 but you like me in spite of it 
 yes i do sir 
 that answer pleased the old gentleman he gave a short laugh shook hands with her and putting his finger under her chin turned up her face examined it gravely and let it go saying with a nod got your spirit if you his face he was a fine man my dear but what is better he was a brave and an honest one and i was proud to be his friend 
 thank you sir and jo was quite comfortable after that for it suited her exactly 
 what have you been doing to this boy of mine hey was the next question sharply put 
 only trying to be neighborly sir and jo to how her visit came about 
 you think he needs cheering up a bit do you 
 yes sir he seems a little lonely and young folks would do him good perhaps we are only girls but we should be glad to help if we could for we forget the splendid christmas present you sent us said jo eagerly 
 tut tut tut that was the affair how is the poor woman 
 doing nicely sir and off went jo talking very fast as she told all about the hummels in whom her mother had interested richer friends than they were 
 just her way of doing good i shall come and see your mother some fine day tell her so the tea bell we have it early on the account come down and go on being neighborly 
 if like to have me sir 
 ask you if i and mr laurence offered her his arm with courtesy 
 what would meg say to this thought jo as she was marched away while her eyes danced with fun as she imagined herself telling the story at home 
 hey why what the dickens has come to the fellow said the old gentleman as laurie came running downstairs and brought up with a start of surprise at the astounding sight of jo arm in arm with his redoubtable grandfather 
 i know come sir he began as jo gave him a triumphant little glance 
 evident by the way you racket downstairs come to your tea sir and behave like a gentleman and having pulled the hair by way of a caress mr laurence walked on while laurie went through a series of comic evolutions behind their backs which nearly produced an explosion of laughter from jo 
 the old gentleman did not say much as he drank his four cups of tea but he watched the young people who soon chatted away like old friends and the change in his grandson did not escape him there was color light and life in the face now vivacity in his manner and genuine merriment in his laugh 
 right the lad is lonely see what these little girls can do for him thought mr laurence as he looked and listened he liked jo for her odd blunt ways suited him and she seemed to understand the boy almost as well as if she had been one herself 
 if the laurences had been what jo called prim and poky she would not have got on at all for such people always made her shy and awkward but finding them free and easy she was so herself and made a good impression when they rose she proposed to go but laurie said he had something more to show her and took her away to the conservatory which had been lighted for her benefit it seemed quite fairylike to jo as she went up and down the walks enjoying the blooming walls on either side the soft light the damp sweet air and the wonderful vines and trees that hung about her while her new friend cut the finest flowers till his hands were full then he tied them up saying with the happy look jo liked to see please give these to your mother and tell her i like the medicine she sent me very much 
 they found mr laurence standing before the fire in the great drawing room by attention was entirely absorbed by a grand piano which stood open 
 do you play she asked turning to laurie with a respectful expression 
 sometimes he answered modestly 
 please do now i want to hear it so i can tell beth 
 you first 
 know how too stupid to learn but i love music dearly 
 so laurie played and jo listened with her nose luxuriously buried in heliotrope and tea roses her respect and regard for the laurence boy increased very much for he played remarkably well and put on any airs she wished beth could hear him but she did not say so only praised him till he was quite abashed and his grandfather came to his rescue 
 that will do that will do young lady too many sugarplums are not good for him his music bad but i hope he will do as well in more important things going well much obliged to you and i hope come again my respects to your mother good night doctor jo 
 he shook hands kindly but looked as if something did not please him when they got into the hall jo asked laurie if she had said something amiss he shook his head 
 no it was me he like to hear me play 
 why not 
 tell you some day john is going home with you as i 
 no need of that i am not a young lady and only a step take care of yourself you 
 yes but you will come again i hope 
 if you promise to come and see us after you are well 
 i will 
 good night laurie 
 good night jo good night 
 when all the adventures had been told the family felt inclined to go visiting in a body for each found something very attractive in the big house on the other side of the hedge mrs march wanted to talk of her father with the old man who had not forgotten him meg longed to walk in the conservatory beth sighed for the grand piano and amy was eager to see the fine pictures and statues 
 mother why mr laurence like to have laurie play asked jo who was of an inquiring disposition 
 i am not sure but i think it was because his son father married an italian lady a musician which displeased the old man who is very proud the lady was good and lovely and accomplished but he did not like her and never saw his son after he married they both died when laurie was a little child and then his grandfather took him home i fancy the boy who was born in italy is not very strong and the old man is afraid of losing him which makes him so careful laurie comes naturally by his love of music for he is like his mother and i dare say his grandfather fears that he may want to be a musician at any rate his skill reminds him of the woman he did not like and so he glowered as jo said 
 dear me how romantic exclaimed meg 
 how silly said jo let him be a musician if he wants to and not plague his life out sending him to college when he hates to go 
 why he has such handsome black eyes and pretty manners i suppose italians are always nice said meg who was a little sentimental 
 what do you know about his eyes and his manners you never spoke to him hardly cried jo who was not sentimental 
 i saw him at the party and what you tell shows that he knows how to behave that was a nice little speech about the medicine mother sent him 
 he meant the blanc mange i suppose how stupid you are child he meant you of course 
 did he and jo opened her eyes as if it had never occurred to her before 
 i never saw such a girl you know a compliment when you get it said meg with the air of a young lady who knew all about the matter 
 i think they are great nonsense and thank you not to be silly and spoil my fun a nice boy and i like him and i have any sentimental stuff about compliments and such rubbish all be good to him because he got any mother and he may come over and see us he marmee 
 yes jo your little friend is very welcome and i hope meg will remember that children should be children as long as they can 
 i call myself a child and not in my teens yet observed amy what do you say beth 
 i was thinking about our progress answered beth who had not heard a word how we got out of the slough and through the wicket gate by resolving to be good and up the steep hill by trying and that maybe the house over there full of splendid things is going to be our palace beautiful 
 we have got to get by the lions first said jo as if she rather liked the prospect

 chapter five 
 
 what in the world are you going to do now jo asked 
 meg one snowy afternoon as her sister came tramping through the hall in rubber boots old sack and hood with a broom in one hand and a shovel in the other 
 going out for exercise answered jo with a mischievous twinkle in her eyes 
 i should think two long walks this morning would have been enough cold and dull out and i advise you to stay warm and dry by the fire as i do said meg with a shiver 
 never take advice keep still all day and not being a pussycat i like to doze by the fire i like adventures and going to find some 
 meg went back to toast her feet and read ivanhoe and jo began to dig paths with great energy the snow was light and with her broom she soon swept a path all round the garden for beth to walk in when the sun came out and the invalid dolls needed air now the garden separated the marches house from that of mr laurence both stood in a suburb of the city which was still countrylike with groves and lawns large gardens and quiet streets a low hedge parted the two estates on one side was an old brown house looking rather bare and shabby robbed of the vines that in summer covered its walls and the flowers which then surrounded it on the other side was a stately stone mansion plainly betokening every sort of comfort and luxury from the big coach house and grounds to the conservatory and the glimpses of lovely things one caught between the rich curtains

 that boy is suffering for society and fun she said to herself his grandpa does not know good for him and keeps him shut up all alone he needs a party of jolly boys to play with or somebody young and lively a great mind to go over and tell the old gentleman so 
 the idea amused jo who liked to do daring things and was always scandalizing meg by her queer performances the plan of going over was not forgotten and when the snowy afternoon came jo resolved to try what could be done she saw mr lawrence drive off and then sallied out to dig her way down to the hedge where she paused and took a survey all quiet curtains down at the lower windows servants out of sight and nothing human visible but a curly black head leaning on a thin hand at the upper window 
 there he is thought jo poor boy all alone and sick this dismal day a shame toss up a snowball and make him look out and then say a kind word to him 
 up went a handful of soft snow and the head turned at once showing a face which lost its listless look in a minute as the big eyes brightened and the mouth began to smile jo nodded and laughed and flourished her broom as she called out 
 how do you do are you sick 
 laurie opened the window and croaked out as hoarsely as a raven 
 better thank you had a bad cold and been shut up a week 
 sorry what do you amuse yourself with 
 nothing dull as tombs up here 
 you read 
 not much they let me 
 somebody read to you 
 grandpa does sometimes but my books interest him and i hate to ask brooke all the time 
 have someone come and see you then 
 there anyone like to see boys make such a row and my head is weak

 so i do will you come please cried laurie 
 not quiet and nice but come if mother will let me go ask her shut the window like a good boy and wait till i come 
 with that jo shouldered her broom and marched into the house wondering what they would all say to her laurie was in a flutter of excitement at the idea of having company and flew about to get ready for as mrs march said he was a little gentleman and did honor to the coming guest by brushing his curly pate putting on a fresh color and trying tidy up the room which in spite of half a dozen servants was anything but neat presently there came a loud ring than a decided voice asking for mr laurie and a surprised looking servant came running up to announce a young lady

 how kind you are yes what it wanted now please take the big chair and let me do something to amuse my company 
 no i came to amuse you shall i read aloud and jo looked affectionately toward some inviting books near by 
 thank you read all those and if you mind rather talk answered laurie 
 not a bit talk all day if only set me going beth says i never know when to stop 
 is beth the rosy one who stays at home good deal and sometimes goes out with a little basket asked laurie with interest 
 yes beth my girl and a regular good one she is too 
 the pretty one is meg and the one is amy i believe 
 laurie colored up but answered frankly why you see i often hear you calling to one another and when alone up here i help looking over at your house you always seem to be having such good times i beg your pardon for being so rude but sometimes you forget to put down the curtain at the window where the flowers are and when the lamps are lighted like looking at a picture to see the fire and you all around the table with your mother her face is right opposite and it looks so sweet behind the flowers i help watching it i got any mother you know and laurie poked the fire to hide a little twitching of the lips that he could not control

 never draw that curtain any more and i give you leave to look as much as you like i just wish though instead of peeping come over and see us mother is so splendid do you heaps of good and beth would sing to you if i begged her to and amy would dance meg and i would make you laugh over our funny stage properties and have jolly times your grandpa let you 
 i think he would if your mother asked him very kind though he does not look so and he lets me do what i like pretty much only afraid i might be a bother to strangers began laurie brightening more and more 
 we are not strangers we are neighbors and you think be a bother we want to know you and been trying to do it this ever so long we been here a great while you know but we have got acquainted with all our neighbors but you 
 you see grandpa lives among his books and mind much what happens outside mr brooke my tutor stay here you know and i have no one to go about with me so i just stop at home and get on as i can 
 bad you ought to make an effort and go visiting everywhere you are asked then have plenty of friends andpleasant places to go to never mind being bashful it last long if you keep going 
 laurie turned red again but offended at being accused of bashfulness for there was so much good will in jo it was impossible not to take her blunt speeches as kindly as they were meant 
 do you like your school asked the boy changing the subject after a little pause during which he stared at the fire and jo looked about her well pleased 
 go to school a i mean i go to wait on my and a dear cross old soul she is too answered jo 
 laurie opened his mouth to ask another question but remembering just in time that it manners to make too many inquiries into affairs he shut it again and looked uncomfortable 
 jo liked his good breeding and mind having a laugh at aunt march so she gave him a lively description of the fidgety old lady her fat poodle the parrot that talked spanish and the library where she reveled

 oh that does me no end of good tell on please he said taking his face out of the sofa cushion red and shining with merriment 
 much elated with her success jo did tell on all about their plays and plans their hopes and fears for father and the most interesting events of the little world in which the sisters lived then they got to talking about books and to delight she found that laurie loved them as well as she did and had read even more than herself 
 if you like them so much come down and see ours grandfather is out so you be afraid said laurie getting up 
 not afraid of anything returned jo with a toss of the head 
 i believe you are exclaimed the boy looking at her with much admiration though he privately thought she would have good reason to be a trifle afraid of the old gentleman if she met hem in some of his moods 
 the atmosphere of the whole house being summerlike laurie led the way from room to room letting jo stop to examine whatever struck her fancy and so at last they came to the library where she clapped her hands and pranced as she always did when especially delighted it was lined with books and there were pictures and statues and distracting little cabinets full of coins and curiosities and sleepy hollow chairs and queer tables and bronzes and best of all a great open fireplace with quaint tiles all round it 
 what richness sighed jo sinking into the depth of a velour chair and gazing about her with an air of intense satisfaction theodore laurence you ought to be the happiest boy in the added impressively 
 a fellow live on books said laurie shaking his head as he perched on a table opposite 
 before he could more a bell rang and jo flew up exclaiming with alarm mercy me your grandpa 
 well what if it is you are not afraid of anything you know returned the boy looking wicked 
 i think i am a little bit afraid of him but i know why i should be marmee said i might come and i think any the worse for it said jo composing herself though she kept her eyes on the door 
 a great deal better for it and ever so much obliged only afraid you are very tired of talking to me it was so pleasant i bear to stop said laurie gratefully 
 the doctor to see you sir and the maid beckoned as she spoke 
 would you mind if i left you for a minute i suppose i must see him said laurie 
 mind me happy as a cricket here answered jo 
 laurie went away and his guest amused herself in her own way she was standing before a fine portrait of the old gentleman when the door opened again and without turning she said decidedly sure now that i be afraid of him for got kind eyes though his mouth is grim and he looks as if he had a tremendous will of hisown he as handsome as my grandfather but i like him 
 thank you said a gruff voice behind her and there to her great dismay stood old mr laurence 
 poor jo blushed till she blush any redder and her heart began to beat uncomfortably fast as she thought what she had said for a minute a wild desire to run away possessed her but that was cowardly and the girls would laugh at her so she resolved to stay and get out of the scrape as she could a second look showed her that the living eyes under the bushy eyebrows were kinder even than the painted ones and there was a sly twinkle in them which lessened her fear a good deal the gruff voice was gruffer than ever as the old gentleman said abruptly after the dreadful pause so not afraid of me hey 
 not much sir 
 and you think me as handsome as your grandfather 
 not quite sir 
 and got a tremendous will have i 
 i only said i thought so 
 but you like me in spite of it 
 yes i do sir 
 that answer pleased the old gentleman he gave a short laugh shook hands with her and putting his finger under her chin turned up her face examined it gravely and let it go saying with a nod got your spirit if you his face he was a fine man my dear but what is better he was a brave and an honest one and i was proud to be his friend 
 thank you sir and jo was quite comfortable after that for it suited her exactly 
 what have you been doing to this boy of mine hey was the next question sharply put 
 only trying to be neighborly sir and jo to how her visit came about 
 you think he needs cheering up a bit do you 
 yes sir he seems a little lonely and young folks would do him good perhaps we are only girls but we should be glad to help if we could for we forget the splendid christmas present you sent us said jo eagerly 
 tut tut tut that was the affair how is the poor woman 
 doing nicely sir and off went jo talking very fast as she told all about the hummels in whom her mother had interested richer friends than they were 
 just her way of doing good i shall come and see your mother some fine day tell her so the tea bell we have it early on the account come down and go on being neighborly 
 if like to have me sir 
 ask you if i and mr laurence offered her his arm with courtesy 
 what would meg say to this thought jo as she was marched away while her eyes danced with fun as she imagined herself telling the story at home 
 hey why what the dickens has come to the fellow said the old gentleman as laurie came running downstairs and brought up with a start of surprise at the astounding sight of jo arm in arm with his redoubtable grandfather 
 i know come sir he began as jo gave him a triumphant little glance 
 evident by the way you racket downstairs come to your tea sir and behave like a gentleman and having pulled the hair by way of a caress mr laurence walked on while laurie went through a series of comic evolutions behind their backs which nearly produced an explosion of laughter from jo 
 the old gentleman did not say much as he drank his four cups of tea but he watched the young people who soon chatted away like old friends and the change in his grandson did not escape him there was color light and life in the face now vivacity in his manner and genuine merriment in his laugh 
 right the lad is lonely see what these little girls can do for him thought mr laurence as he looked and listened he liked jo for her odd blunt ways suited him and she seemed to understand the boy almost as well as if she had been one herself 
 if the laurences had been what jo called prim and poky she would not have got on at all for such people always made her shy and awkward but finding them free and easy she was so herself and made a good impression when they rose she proposed to go but laurie said he had something more to show her and took her away to the conservatory which had been lighted for her benefit it seemed quite fairylike to jo as she went up and down the walks enjoying the blooming walls on either side the soft light the damp sweet air and the wonderful vines and trees that hung about her while her new friend cut the finest flowers till his hands were full then he tied them up saying with the happy look jo liked to see please give these to your mother and tell her i like the medicine she sent me very much 
 they found mr laurence standing before the fire in the great drawing room by attention was entirely absorbed by a grand piano which stood open 
 do you play she asked turning to laurie with a respectful expression 
 sometimes he answered modestly 
 please do now i want to hear it so i can tell beth 
 you first 
 know how too stupid to learn but i love music dearly 
 so laurie played and jo listened with her nose luxuriously buried in heliotrope and tea roses her respect and regard for the laurence boy increased very much for he played remarkably well and put on any airs she wished beth could hear him but she did not say so only praised him till he was quite abashed and his grandfather came to his rescue 
 that will do that will do young lady too many sugarplums are not good for him his music bad but i hope he will do as well in more important things going well much obliged to you and i hope come again my respects to your mother good night doctor jo 
 he shook hands kindly but looked as if something did not please him when they got into the hall jo asked laurie if she had said something amiss he shook his head 
 no it was me he like to hear me play 
 why not 
 tell you some day john is going home with you as i 
 no need of that i am not a young lady and only a step take care of yourself you 
 yes but you will come again i hope 
 if you promise to come and see us after you are well 
 i will 
 good night laurie 
 good night jo good night 
 when all the adventures had been told the family felt inclined to go visiting in a body for each found something very attractive in the big house on the other side of the hedge mrs march wanted to talk of her father with the old man who had not forgotten him meg longed to walk in the conservatory beth sighed for the grand piano and amy was eager to see the fine pictures and statues 
 mother why mr laurence like to have laurie play asked jo who was of an inquiring disposition 
 i am not sure but i think it was because his son father married an italian lady a musician which displeased the old man who is very proud the lady was good and lovely and accomplished but he did not like her and never saw his son after he married they both died when laurie was a little child and then his grandfather took him home i fancy the boy who was born in italy is not very strong and the old man is afraid of losing him which makes him so careful laurie comes naturally by his love of music for he is like his mother and i dare say his grandfather fears that he may want to be a musician at any rate his skill reminds him of the woman he did not like and so he glowered as jo said 
 dear me how romantic exclaimed meg 
 how silly said jo let him be a musician if he wants to and not plague his life out sending him to college when he hates to go 
 why he has such handsome black eyes and pretty manners i suppose italians are always nice said meg who was a little sentimental 
 what do you know about his eyes and his manners you never spoke to him hardly cried jo who was not sentimental 
 i saw him at the party and what you tell shows that he knows how to behave that was a nice little speech about the medicine mother sent him 
 he meant the blanc mange i suppose how stupid you are child he meant you of course 
 did he and jo opened her eyes as if it had never occurred to her before 
 i never saw such a girl you know a compliment when you get it said meg with the air of a young lady who knew all about the matter 
 i think they are great nonsense and thank you not to be silly and spoil my fun a nice boy and i like him and i have any sentimental stuff about compliments and such rubbish all be good to him because he got any mother and he may come over and see us he marmee 
 yes jo your little friend is very welcome and i hope meg will remember that children should be children as long as they can 
 i call myself a child and not in my teens yet observed amy what do you say beth 
 i was thinking about our progress answered beth who had not heard a word how we got out of the slough and through the wicket gate by resolving to be good and up the steep hill by trying and that maybe the house over there full of splendid things is going to be our palace beautiful 
 we have got to get by the lions first said jo as if she rather liked the prospect

 jonathan and some diggers are holding their own near the 
 temple door four riders come charging right at them 
 jonathan takes a swig off the seagrams 
 jonathan 
 let em have it boys 
 jonathan and the diggers open fire when the smoke clears 
 the riders are either dead or gone jonathan grins 
 jonathan 
 i say bloody good show 
 and then several more mumia leap off the temple and land 
 behind them jonathan and the remaining diggers spin around 
 and suddenly find themselves in combat 
 is quickly loading his pistol he hears something 
 thundering up behind him he spins around just as ardeth bay 
 on a horse swings his scimitar instinctively 
 raises his hands to protect his face the scimitar strikes 
 hits his gun ching gun flips away disarmed 
 dives and rolls and suddenly comes up with a stick 
 of dynamite in his hand he shoves the fuse into a fire it 
 ignites he faces ardeth bay towering above him the two men 
 lock eyes the fuse continues to burn down ardeth bay points 
 his scimitar at head 
 ardeth bay 
 leave this place leave this 
 place or die 
 ardeth bay gallops off the remaining mumia riders race after 
 him vanishing into the night watches them leave 
 then turns to the burning fuse and blows it out evelyn 
 staggers up looking very shaken gently takes her 
 and holds her close 
 
 you alright 
 evelyn looks up into his strong eyes the first time 
 shown genuine concern for her and she likes it 
 also holding her a little too close and she likes that too 
 evelyn 
 yes fine thank you 
 beni crawls out from under some pillars as henderson and 
 burns help daniels to his feet 
 daniels 
 see that proves it old 
 gotta be under this sand 
 henderson 
 for them to protect it like this 
 you just know got to be 
 treasure down there 
 looks up into the surrounding ridges unsatisfied 
 
 these men are a desert people 
 they value water not gold 
 evelyn looks at suddenly very worried
