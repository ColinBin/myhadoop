 the dominant primordial beast 
 
 
 the dominant primordial beast was strong in buck and under the fierce conditions of trail life it grew and grew yet it was a secret growth his newborn cunning gave him poise and control he was too busy adjusting himself to the new life to feel at ease and not only did he not pick fights but he avoided them whenever possible a certain deliberateness characterized his attitude he was not prone to rashness and precipitate action and in the bitter hatred between him and spitz he betrayed no impatience shunned all offensive acts 
 on the other hand possibly because he divined in buck a dangerous rival spitz never lost an opportunity of showing his teeth he even went out of his way to bully buck striving constantly to start the fight which could end only in the death of one or the other 
 early in the trip this might have taken place had it not been for an unwonted accident at the end of this day they made a bleak and miserable camp on the shore of lake le barge driving snow a wind that cut like a knife and darkness had forced them to grope for a camping place they could hardly have fared worse at their backs rose a perpendicular wall of rock and perrault and francois were compelled to make their fire and spread their sleeping robes on the ice of the lake itself the tent they had discarded at yea in order to travel light a few sticks of driftwood furnished them with a fire that thawed down through the ice and left them to eat supper in the dark 
 close in under the sheltering rock buck made his nest so snug and warm was it that he was loath to leave it when francois distributed the fish which he had first thawed over the fire but when buck finished his ration and returned he found his nest occupied a warning snarl told him that the trespasser was spitz till now buck had avoided trouble with his enemy but this was too much the beast in him roared he sprang upon spitz with a fury which surprised them both and spitz particularly for his whole experience with buck had gone to teach him that his rival was an unusually timid dog who managed to hold his own only because of his great weight and size 
 francois was surprised too when they shot out in a tangle from the disrupted nest and he divined the cause of the trouble he cried to buck give it to him by gar give it to him the dirty thief 
 spitz was equally willing he was crying with sheer rage and eagerness as he circled back and forth for a chance to spring in buck was no less eager and no less cautious as he likewise circled back and forth for the advantage but it was then that the unexpected happened the thing which projected their struggle for supremacy far into the future past many a weary mile of trail and toil 
 an oath from perrault the resounding impact of a club upon a bony frame and a shrill yelp of pain heralded the breaking forth of pandemonium the camp was suddenly discovered to be alive with skulking furry huskies four or five score of them who had scented the camp from some indian village they had crept in while buck and spitz were fighting and when the two men sprang among them with stout clubs they showed their teeth and fought back they were crazed by the smell of the food perrault found one with head buried in the his club landed heavily on the gaunt ribs and the was capsized on the ground on the instant a score of the famished brutes were scrambling for the bread and bacon the clubs fell upon them unheeded they yelped and howled under the rain of blows but struggled none the less madly till the last crumb had been devoured 
 in the meantime the astonished had burst out of their nests only to be set upon by the fierce invaders never had buck seen such dogs it seemed as though their bones would burst through their skins they were mere skeletons draped loosely in draggled hides with blazing eyes and slavered fangs but the made them terrifying irresistible there was no opposing them the were swept back against the cliff at the first onset buck was beset by three huskies and in a trice his head and shoulders were ripped and slashed the din was frightful billee was crying as usual dave and dripping blood from a score of wounds were fighting bravely side by side joe was snapping like a demon once his teeth closed on the fore leg of a husky and he crunched down through the bone pike the malingerer leaped upon the crippled animal breaking its neck with a quick flash of teeth and a jerk buck got a frothing adversary by the throat and was sprayed with blood when his teeth sank through the jugular the warm taste of it in his mouth goaded him to greater fierceness he flung himself upon another and at the same time felt teeth sink into his own throat it was spitz treacherously attacking from the side 
 perrault and francois having cleaned out their part of the camp hurried to save their the wild wave of famished beasts rolled back before them and buck shook himself free but is was only for a moment the two men were compelled to run back to save the grub upon which the huskies returned to the attack on the team billee terrified into bravery sprang through the savage circle and fled away over the ice pike and dub followed on his heels with the rest of the team behind as buck drew himself together to spring after them out of the tail of his eye he saw spitz rush upon him with the evident intention of overthrowing him once off his feet and under that mass of huskies there was no hope for him but he braced himself to the shock of charge then joined the flight out on the lake 
 later the nine gathered together and sought shelter in the forest though unpursued they were in a sorry plight there was not one who was not wounded in four or five places while some were wounded grievously dub was badly injured in a hind leg dolly the last husky added to the team at yea had a badly torn throat joe had lost an eye while billee the with an ear chewed and rent to ribbons cried and whimpered throughout the night at daybreak they limped warily back to camp to find the marauders gone and the two men in bad tempers fully half their grub supply was gone the huskies had chewed through the sled lashings and canvas coverings in fact nothing no matter how remotely eatable had escaped them they had eaten a pair of moccasins chunks out of the leather traces and even two feet of lash from the end of whip he broke from a mournful contemplation of it to look over his wounded dogs 
 ah my friends he said softly mebbe it make you mad dog those many bites mebbe all mad dog sacredam what you think eh perrault 
 the courier shook his head dubiously with four hundred miles of trail still between him and dawson he could ill afford to have madness break out among his dogs two hours of cursing and exertion got the harnesses into shape and the team was under way struggling painfully over the hardest part of the trail they had yet encountered and for that matter the hardest between them and dawson 
 the thirty mile river was wide open its wild water defied the frost and it was in the eddies only and in the quiet places that the ice held at all six days of exhausting toil were required to cover those thirty terrible miles and terrible they were for every foot of them was accomplished at the risk of life to dog and man a dozen times perrault nosing the way broke through the ice bridges being saved by the long pole he carried which he so held that it fell each time across the hole made by his body but a cold snap was on the thermometer registering fifty below zero and each time he broke through he was compelled for very life to build a fire and dry his garments 
 nothing daunted him it was because nothing daunted him that he had been chosen for government courier he took all manner of risks resolutely thrusting his little weazened face into the frost and struggling on from dim dawn to dark he skirted the frowning shores on rim ice that bent and crackled under foot and upon which they dared not halt once the sled broke through with dave and buck and they were and all but drowned by the time they were dragged out the usual fire was necessary to save them they were coated solidly with ice and the two men kept them on the run around the fire sweating and thawing so close that they were singed by the flames 
 at another time spitz went through dragging the whole team after him up to buck who strained backward with all his strength his fore paws on the slippery edge and the ice quivering and snapping all around but behind him was dave likewise straining backward and behind the sled was francois pulling till his tendons cracked 
 again the rim ice broke away before and behind and there was no escape except up the cliff perrault scaled it by a miracle while francois prayed for just that miracle and with every thong and sled lashing and the last bit of harness rove into a long rope the dogs were hoisted one by one to the cliff crest francois came up last after the sled and load then came the search for a place to descend which descent was ultimately made by the aid of the rope and night found them back on the river with a quarter of a mile to the credit 
 by the time they made the hootalinqua and good ice buck was played out the rest of the dogs were in like condition but perrault to make up lost time pushed them late and early the first day they covered miles to the big salmon the next day more to the little salmon the third day forty miles which brought them well up toward the five fingers 
 feet were not so compact and hard as the feet of the huskies his had softened during the many generations since the day his last wild ancestor was tamed by a cave dweller or river man all day long he limped in agony and camp once made lay down like a dead dog hungry as he was he would not move to receive his ration of fish which francois had to bring to him also the rubbed feet for half an hour each night after supper and sacrificed the tops of his own moccasins to make four moccasins for buck this was a great relief and buck caused even the weazened face of perrault to twist itself into a grin one morning when francois forgot the moccasins and buck lay on his back his four feet waving appealingly in the air and refused to budge without them later his feet grew hard to the trail and the footgear was thrown away 
 at the pelly one morning as they were harnessing up dolly who had never been conspicuous for anything went suddenly mad she announced her condition by a long wolf howl that sent every dog bristling with fear then sprang straight for buck he had never seen a dog go mad nor did he have any reason to fear madness yet he knew that here was horror and fled away from it in a panic straight away he raced with dolly panting and frothing one leap behind nor could she gain on him so great was his terror nor could he leave her so great was her madness he plunged through the wooded breast of the island flew down to the lower end crossed a back channel filled with rough ice to another island gained a third island curved back to the main river and in desperation started to cross it and all the time though he did not look he could hear her snarling just one leap behind francois called to him a quarter of a mile away and he doubled back still one leap ahead gasping painfully for air and putting all his faith in that francois would save him the held the axe poised in his hand and as buck shot past him the axe crashed down upon mad head 
 buck staggered over against the sled exhausted sobbing for breath helpless this was opportunity he sprang upon buck and twice his teeth sank into his unresisting foe and ripped and tore the flesh to the bone then francois lash descended and buck had the satisfaction of watching spitz receive the worst whipping as yet administered to any of the team 
 one devil dat spitz remarked perrault some dam day him kill dat buck 
 dat buck two devils was rejoinder all de time i watch dat buck i know for sure lissen some dam fine day him get mad like hell and den him chew dat spitz all up and spit him out on de snow sure i know 
 from then on it was war between them spitz as and acknowledged master of the team felt his supremacy threatened by this strange southland and strange buck was to him for of the many southland dogs he had known not one had shown up worthily in camp and on trail they were all too soft dying under the toil the frost and starvation buck was the exception he alone endured and prospered matching the husky in strength savagery and then he was a masterful dog and what made him dangerous was the fact that the club of the man in the red sweater had knocked all blind pluck and rashness out of his desire for mastery he was preeminently cunning and could bide his time with a patience that was nothing less than primitive 
 it was inevitable that the clash for leadership should come buck wanted it he wanted it because it was his nature because he had been gripped tight by that nameless incomprehensible pride of the trail and pride which holds dogs in the toil to the last gasp which lures them to die joyfully in the harness and breaks their hearts if they are cut out of the harness this was the pride of dave as of as he pulled with all his strength the pride that laid hold of them at break of camp transforming them from sour and sullen brutes into straining eager ambitious creatures the pride that spurred them on all day and dropped them at pitch of camp at night letting them fall back into gloomy unrest and discontent this was the pride that bore up spitz and made him thrash the who blundered and shirked in the traces or hid away at time in the morning likewise it was this pride that made him fear buck as a possible and this was pride too 
 he openly threatened the leadership he came between him and the shirks he should have punished and he did it deliberately one night there was a heavy snowfall and in the morning pike the malingerer did not appear he was securely hidden in his nest under a foot of snow francois called him and sought him in vain spitz was wild with wrath he raged through the camp smelling and digging in every likely place snarling so frightfully that pike heard and shivered in his 
 but when he was at last unearthed and spitz flew at him to punish him buck flew with equal rage in between so unexpected was it and so shrewdly managed that spitz was hurled backward and off his feet pike who had been trembling abjectly took heart at this open mutiny and sprang upon his overthrown leader buck to whom fair play was a forgotten code likewise sprang upon spitz but francois chuckling at the incident while unswerving in the administration of justice brought his lash down upon buck with all his might this failed to drive buck from his prostrate rival and the butt of the whip was brought into play by the blow buck was knocked backward and the lash laid upon him again and again while spitz soundly punished the many times offending pike 
 in the days that followed as dawson grew closer and closer buck still continued to interfere between spitz and the culprits but he did it craftily when francois was not around with the covert mutiny of buck a general insubordination sprang up and increased dave and were unaffected but the rest of the team went from bad to worse things no longer went right there was continual bickering and jangling trouble was always afoot and at the bottom of it was buck he kept francois busy for the was in constant apprehension of the struggle between the two which he knew must take place sooner or later and on more than one night the sounds of quarreling and strife among the other dogs turned him out of his sleeping robe fearful that buck and spitz were at it 
 but the opportunity did not present itself and they pulled into dawson one dreary afternoon with the great fight still to come here were many men and countless dogs and buck found them all at work it seemed the ordained order of things that dogs should work all day they swung up and down the main street in long teams and in the night their jingling bells still went by they hauled cabin logs and firewood freighted up to the mines and did all manner of work that horses did in the santa clara valley here and there buck met southland dogs but in the main they were the wild wolf husky breed every night regularly at nine at twelve and three they lifted a nocturnal song a weird and eerie chant in which it was delight to join 
 with the aurora borealis flaming coldly overhead or the stars leaping in the frost dance and the land numb and frozen under its pall of snow this song of the huskies might have been the defiance of life only it was pitched in minor key with wailings and and was more the pleading of life the articulate travail of existence it was an old song old as the breed of the first songs of the younger world in a day when songs were sad it was invested with the woe of unnumbered generations this plaint by which buck was so strangely stirred when he moaned and sobbed it was with the pain of living that was of old the pain of his wild fathers and the fear and mystery of the cold and dark that was to them fear and mystery and that he should be stirred by it marked the completeness with which he harked back through the ages of fire and roof to the raw beginnings of life in the howling ages 
 seven days from the time they pulled into dawson they dropped down the steep bank by the barracks to the yukon trail and pulled for yea and salt water perrault was carrying dispatches if anything more urgent than those he had brought in also the travel pride had gripped him and he purposed to make the record trip of the year several things favored him in this the rest had recuperated the dogs and put them in thorough trim the trail they had broken into the country was packed hard by later journeyers and further the police had arranged in two or three places deposits of grub for dog and man and he was traveling light 
 they made sixty mile which is a run on the first day and the second day saw them booming up the yukon well on their way to pelly but such splendid running was achieved not without great trouble and vexation on the part of francois the insidious revolt led by buck had destroyed the solidarity of the team it no longer was as one dog leaping in the traces the encouragement buck gave the rebels led them into all kinds of petty misdemeanors no more was spitz a leader greatly to be feared the old awe departed and they grew equal to challenging his authority pike robbed him of half a fish one night and gulped it down under the protection of buck another night dub and joe fought spitz and made him forego the punishment they deserved and even billee the was less and whined not half so placatingly as in former days buck never came near spitz without snarling and bristling menacingly in fact his conduct approached that of a bully and he was given to swaggering up and down before very nose 
 the breaking down of discipline likewise affected the dogs in their relations with one another they quarreled and bickered more than ever among themselves till at times the camp was a howling bedlam dave and alone were unaltered though they were made irritable by the unending squabbling francois swore strange barbarous oaths and stamped the snow in futile rage and tore his hair his lash was always singing among the dogs but it was of small avail directly his back was turned they were at it again he backed up spitz with his whip while buck backed up the remainder of the team francois knew he was behind all the trouble and buck knew he knew but buck was too clever ever again to be caught he worked faithfully in the harness for the toil had become a delight to him yet it was a greater delight slyly to precipitate a fight amongst his mates and tangle the traces 
 at the mouth of the tahkeena one night after supper dub turned up a snowshoe rabbit blundered it and missed in a second the whole team was in full cry a hundred yards away was a camp of the northwest police with fifty dogs huskies all who joined the chase the rabbit sped down the river turned off into a small creek up the frozen bed of which it held steadily it ran lightly on the surface of the snow while the dogs plowed through by main strength buck led the pack sixty strong around bend after bend but he could not gain he lay down low to the race whining eagerly his splendid body flashing forward leap by leap in the wan white moonlight and leap by leap like some pale frost wraith the snowshoe rabbit flashed on ahead 
 all that stirring of old instincts which at stated periods drives men out from the sounding cities to forest and plain to kill things by chemically propelled leaden pellets the bloodlust the joy to this was only it was infinitely more intimate he was ranging at the head of the pack running the wild thing down the living meat to kill with his own teeth and wash his muzzle to the eyes in warm blood 
 there is an ecstasy that marks the summit of life and beyond which life cannot rise and such is the paradox of living this ecstasy comes when one is most alive and it comes as a complete forgetfulness that one is alive this ecstasy this forgetfulness of living comes to the artist caught up and out of himself in a sheet of flame it comes to the soldier on a stricken field and refusing quarter and it came to buck leading the pack sounding the old straining after the food that was alive and that fled swiftly before him through the moonlight he was sounding the deeps of his nature and of the parts of his nature that were deeper than he going back into the womb of time he was mastered by the sheer surging of life the tidal wave of being the perfect joy of each separate muscle joint and sinew in that it was everything that was not death that it was aglow and rampant expressing itself in movement flying exultantly under the stars and over the face of dead matter that did not move 
 but spitz cold and calculating even in his supreme moods left the pack and cut across a narrow neck of land where the creek made a long bend around buck did not know of this and as he rounded the bend the frost wraith of a rabbit still flitting before him he saw another and larger frost wraith leap from the overhanging bank into the immediate path of the rabbit it was spitz the rabbit could not turn and as the white teeth broke its back in mid air it shrieked as loudly as a stricken man may shriek at sound of this the cry of life plunging down from apex in the grip of death the full pack at heels raised a chorus of delight 
 buck did not cry out he did not check himself but drove in upon spitz shoulder to shoulder so hard that he missed the throat they rolled over and over in the powdery snow spitz gained his feet almost as though he had not been overthrown slashing buck down the shoulder and leaping clear twice his teeth clipped together like the steel jaws of a trap as he backed away for better footing with lean and lifting lips that writhed and snarled 
 in a flash buck knew it the time had come it was to the death as they circled about snarling ears laid back keenly watchful for the advantage the scene came to buck with a sense of familiarity he seemed to remember it white woods and earth and moonlight and the thrill of battle over the whiteness and silence brooded a ghostly calm there was not the faintest whisper of moved not a leaf quivered the visible breaths of the dogs rising slowly and lingering in the frosty air they had made short work of the snowshoe rabbit these dogs that were wolves and they were now drawn up in an expectant circle they too were silent their eyes only gleaming and their breaths drifting slowly upward to buck it was nothing new or strange this scene of old time it was as though it had always been the wonted way of things 
 spitz was a practiced fighter from spitzbergen through the arctic and across canada and the barrens he had held his own with all manner of dogs and achieved to mastery over them bitter rage was his but never blind rage in passion to rend and destroy he never forgot that his enemy was in like passion to rend and destroy he never rushed till he was prepared to receive a rush never attacked till he had first defended that attack 
 in vain buck strove to sink his teeth in the neck of the big white dog wherever his fangs struck for the softer flesh they were countered by the fangs of spitz fang clashed fang and lips were cut and bleeding but buck could not penetrate his guard then he warmed up and enveloped spitz in a whirlwind of rushes time and time again he tried for the throat where life bubbled near to the surface and each time and every time spitz slashed him and got away then buck took to rushing as though for the throat when suddenly drawing back his head and curving in from the side he would drive his shoulder at the shoulder of spitz as a ram by which to overthrow him but instead shoulder was slashed down each time as spitz leaped lightly away 
 spitz was untouched while buck was streaming with blood and panting hard the fight was growing desperate and all the while the silent and wolfish circle waited to finish off whichever dog went down as buck grew winded spitz took to rushing and he kept him staggering for footing once buck went over and the whole circle of sixty dogs started up but he recovered himself almost in mid air and the circle sank down again and waited 
 but buck possessed a quality that made for he fought by instinct but he could fight by head as well he rushed as though attempting the old shoulder trick but at the last instant swept low to the snow and in his teeth closed on left fore leg there was a crunch of breaking bone and the white dog faced him on three legs thrice he tried to knock him over then repeated the trick and broke the right fore leg despite the pain and helplessness spitz struggled madly to keep up he saw the silent circle with gleaming eyes lolling tongues and silvery breaths drifting upward closing in upon him as he had seen similar circles close in upon beaten antagonists in the past only this time he was the one who was beaten 
 there was no hope for him buck was inexorable mercy was a thing reserved for gentler climes he maneuvered for the final rush the circle had tightened till he could feel the breaths of the huskies on his flanks he could see them beyond spitz and to either side for the spring their eyes fixed upon him a pause seemed to fall every animal was motionless as though turned to stone only spitz quivered and bristled as he staggered back and forth snarling with horrible menace as though to frighten off impending death then buck sprang in and out but while he was in shoulder had at last squarely met shoulder the dark circle became a dot on the moon flooded snow as spitz disappeared from view buck stood and looked on the successful champion the dominant primordial beast who had made his kill and found it good

 nothing daunted him it was because nothing daunted him that he had been chosen for government courier he took all manner of risks resolutely thrusting his little weazened face into the frost and struggling on from dim dawn to dark he skirted the frowning shores on rim ice that bent and crackled under foot and upon which they dared not halt once the sled broke through with dave and buck and they were and all but drowned by the time they were dragged out the usual fire was necessary to save them they were coated solidly with ice and the two men kept them on the run around the fire sweating and thawing so close that they were singed by the flames 
 at another time spitz went through dragging the whole team after him up to buck who strained backward with all his strength his fore paws on the slippery edge and the ice quivering and snapping all around but behind him was dave likewise straining backward and behind the sled was francois pulling till his tendons cracked 
 again the rim ice broke away before and behind and there was no escape except up the cliff perrault scaled it by a miracle while francois prayed for just that miracle and with every thong and sled lashing and the last bit of harness rove into a long rope the dogs were hoisted one by one to the cliff crest francois came up last after the sled and load then came the search for a place to descend which descent was ultimately made by the aid of the rope and night found them back on the river with a quarter of a mile to the credit 
 by the time they made the hootalinqua and good ice buck was played out the rest of the dogs were in like condition but perrault to make up lost time pushed them late and early the first day they covered miles to the big salmon the next day more to the little salmon the third day forty miles which brought them well up toward the five fingers 
 feet were not so compact and hard as the feet of the huskies his had softened during the many generations since the day his last wild ancestor was tamed by a cave dweller or river man all day long he limped in agony and camp once made lay down like a dead dog hungry as he was he would not move to receive his ration of fish which francois had to bring to him also the rubbed feet for half an hour each night after supper and sacrificed the tops of his own moccasins to make four moccasins for buck this was a great relief and buck caused even the weazened face of perrault to twist itself into a grin one morning when francois forgot the moccasins and buck lay on his back his four feet waving appealingly in the air and refused to budge without them later his feet grew hard to the trail and the footgear was thrown away 
 at the pelly one morning as they were harnessing up dolly who had never been conspicuous for anything went suddenly mad she announced her condition by a long wolf howl that sent every dog bristling with fear then sprang straight for buck he had never seen a dog go mad nor did he have any reason to fear madness yet he knew that here was horror and fled away from it in a panic straight away he raced with dolly panting and frothing one leap behind nor could she gain on him so great was his terror nor could he leave her so great was her madness he plunged through the wooded breast of the island flew down to the lower end crossed a back channel filled with rough ice to another island gained a third island curved back to the main river and in desperation started to cross it and all the time though he did not look he could hear her snarling just one leap behind francois called to him a quarter of a mile away and he doubled back still one leap ahead gasping painfully for air and putting all his faith in that francois would save him the held the axe poised in his hand and as buck shot past him the axe crashed down upon mad head 
 buck staggered over against the sled exhausted sobbing for breath helpless this was opportunity he sprang upon buck and twice his teeth sank into his unresisting foe and ripped and tore the flesh to the bone then francois lash descended and buck had the satisfaction of watching spitz receive the worst whipping as yet administered to any of the team 
 one devil dat spitz remarked perrault some dam day him kill dat buck 
 dat buck two devils was rejoinder all de time i watch dat buck i know for sure lissen some dam fine day him get mad like hell and den him chew dat spitz all up and spit him out on de snow sure i know 
 from then on it was war between them spitz as and acknowledged master of the team felt his supremacy threatened by this strange southland and strange buck was to him for of the many southland dogs he had known not one had shown up worthily in camp and on trail they were all too soft dying under the toil the frost and starvation buck was the exception he alone endured and prospered matching the husky in strength savagery and then he was a masterful dog and what made him dangerous was the fact that the club of the man in the red sweater had knocked all blind pluck and rashness out of his desire for mastery he was preeminently cunning and could bide his time with a patience that was nothing less than primitive 
 it was inevitable that the clash for leadership should come buck wanted it he wanted it because it was his nature because he had been gripped tight by that nameless incomprehensible pride of the trail and pride which holds dogs in the toil to the last gasp which lures them to die joyfully in the harness and breaks their hearts if they are cut out of the harness this was the pride of dave as of as he pulled with all his strength the pride that laid hold of them at break of camp transforming them from sour and sullen brutes into straining eager ambitious creatures the pride that spurred them on all day and dropped them at pitch of camp at night letting them fall back into gloomy unrest and discontent this was the pride that bore up spitz and made him thrash the who blundered and shirked in the traces or hid away at time in the morning likewise it was this pride that made him fear buck as a possible and this was pride too 
 he openly threatened the leadership he came between him and the shirks he should have punished and he did it deliberately one night there was a heavy snowfall and in the morning pike the malingerer did not appear he was securely hidden in his nest under a foot of snow francois called him and sought him in vain spitz was wild with wrath he raged through the camp smelling and digging in every likely place snarling so frightfully that pike heard and shivered in his 
 but when he was at last unearthed and spitz flew at him to punish him buck flew with equal rage in between so unexpected was it and so shrewdly managed that spitz was hurled backward and off his feet pike who had been trembling abjectly took heart at this open mutiny and sprang upon his overthrown leader buck to whom fair play was a forgotten code likewise sprang upon spitz but francois chuckling at the incident while unswerving in the administration of justice brought his lash down upon buck with all his might this failed to drive buck from his prostrate rival and the butt of the whip was brought into play by the blow buck was knocked backward and the lash laid upon him again and again while spitz soundly punished the many times offending pike 
 in the days that followed as dawson grew closer and closer buck still continued to interfere between spitz and the culprits but he did it craftily when francois was not around with the covert mutiny of buck a general insubordination sprang up and increased dave and were unaffected but the rest of the team went from bad to worse things no longer went right there was continual bickering and jangling trouble was always afoot and at the bottom of it was buck he kept francois busy for the was in constant apprehension of the struggle between the two which he knew must take place sooner or later and on more than one night the sounds of quarreling and strife among the other dogs turned him out of his sleeping robe fearful that buck and spitz were at it 
 but the opportunity did not present itself and they pulled into dawson one dreary afternoon with the great fight still to come here were many men and countless dogs and buck found them all at work it seemed the ordained order of things that dogs should work all day they swung up and down the main street in long teams and in the night their jingling bells still went by they hauled cabin logs and firewood freighted up to the mines and did all manner of work that horses did in the santa clara valley here and there buck met southland dogs but in the main they were the wild wolf husky breed every night regularly at nine at twelve and three they lifted a nocturnal song a weird and eerie chant in which it was delight to join 
 with the aurora borealis flaming coldly overhead or the stars leaping in the frost dance and the land numb and frozen under its pall of snow this song of the huskies might have been the defiance of life only it was pitched in minor key with wailings and and was more the pleading of life the articulate travail of existence it was an old song old as the breed of the first songs of the younger world in a day when songs were sad it was invested with the woe of unnumbered generations this plaint by which buck was so strangely stirred when he moaned and sobbed it was with the pain of living that was of old the pain of his wild fathers and the fear and mystery of the cold and dark that was to them fear and mystery and that he should be stirred by it marked the completeness with which he harked back through the ages of fire and roof to the raw beginnings of life in the howling ages 
 seven days from the time they pulled into dawson they dropped down the steep bank by the barracks to the yukon trail and pulled for yea and salt water perrault was carrying dispatches if anything more urgent than those he had brought in also the travel pride had gripped him and he purposed to make the record trip of the year several things favored him in this the rest had recuperated the dogs and put them in thorough trim the trail they had broken into the country was packed hard by later journeyers and further the police had arranged in two or three places deposits of grub for dog and man and he was traveling light 
 they made sixty mile which is a run on the first day and the second day saw them booming up the yukon well on their way to pelly but such splendid running was achieved not without great trouble and vexation on the part of francois the insidious revolt led by buck had destroyed the solidarity of the team it no longer was as one dog leaping in the traces the encouragement buck gave the rebels led them into all kinds of petty misdemeanors no more was spitz a leader greatly to be feared the old awe departed and they grew equal to challenging his authority pike robbed him of half a fish one night and gulped it down under the protection of buck another night dub and joe fought spitz and made him forego the punishment they deserved and even billee the was less and whined not half so placatingly as in former days buck never came near spitz without snarling and bristling menacingly in fact his conduct approached that of a bully and he was given to swaggering up and down before very nose 
 the breaking down of discipline likewise affected the dogs in their relations with one another they quarreled and bickered more than ever among themselves till at times the camp was a howling bedlam dave and alone were unaltered though they were made irritable by the unending squabbling francois swore strange barbarous oaths and stamped the snow in futile rage and tore his hair his lash was always singing among the dogs but it was of small avail directly his back was turned they were at it again he backed up spitz with his whip while buck backed up the remainder of the team francois knew he was behind all the trouble and buck knew he knew but buck was too clever ever again to be caught he worked faithfully in the harness for the toil had become a delight to him yet it was a greater delight slyly to precipitate a fight amongst his mates and tangle the traces 
 at the mouth of the tahkeena one night after supper dub turned up a snowshoe rabbit blundered it and missed in a second the whole team was in full cry a hundred yards away was a camp of the northwest police with fifty dogs huskies all who joined the chase the rabbit sped down the river turned off into a small creek up the frozen bed of which it held steadily it ran lightly on the surface of the snow while the dogs plowed through by main strength buck led the pack sixty strong around bend after bend but he could not gain he lay down low to the race whining eagerly his splendid body flashing forward leap by leap in the wan white moonlight and leap by leap like some pale frost wraith the snowshoe rabbit flashed on ahead 
 all that stirring of old instincts which at stated periods drives men out from the sounding cities to forest and plain to kill things by chemically propelled leaden pellets the bloodlust the joy to this was only it was infinitely more intimate he was ranging at the head of the pack running the wild thing down the living meat to kill with his own teeth and wash his muzzle to the eyes in warm blood 
 there is an ecstasy that marks the summit of life and beyond which life cannot rise and such is the paradox of living this ecstasy comes when one is most alive and it comes as a complete forgetfulness that one is alive this ecstasy this forgetfulness of living comes to the artist caught up and out of himself in a sheet of flame it comes to the soldier on a stricken field and refusing quarter and it came to buck leading the pack sounding the old straining after the food that was alive and that fled swiftly before him through the moonlight he was sounding the deeps of his nature and of the parts of his nature that were deeper than he going back into the womb of time he was mastered by the sheer surging of life the tidal wave of being the perfect joy of each separate muscle joint and sinew in that it was everything that was not death that it was aglow and rampant expressing itself in movement flying exultantly under the stars and over the face of dead matter that did not move 
 but spitz cold and calculating even in his supreme moods left the pack and cut across a narrow neck of land where the creek made a long bend around buck did not know of this and as he rounded the bend the frost wraith of a rabbit still flitting before him he saw another and larger frost wraith leap from the overhanging bank into the immediate path of the rabbit it was spitz the rabbit could not turn and as the white teeth broke its back in mid air it shrieked as loudly as a stricken man may shriek at sound of this the cry of life plunging down from apex in the grip of death the full pack at heels raised a chorus of delight 
 buck did not cry out he did not check himself but drove in upon spitz shoulder to shoulder so hard that he missed the throat they rolled over and over in the powdery snow spitz gained his feet almost as though he had not been overthrown slashing buck down the shoulder and leaping clear twice his teeth clipped together like the steel jaws of a trap as he backed away for better footing with lean and lifting lips that writhed and snarled 
 in a flash buck knew it the time had come it was to the death as they circled about snarling ears laid back keenly watchful for the advantage the scene came to buck with a sense of familiarity he seemed to remember it white woods and earth and moonlight and the thrill of battle over the whiteness and silence brooded a ghostly calm there was not the faintest whisper of moved not a leaf quivered the visible breaths of the dogs rising slowly and lingering in the frosty air they had made short work of the snowshoe rabbit these dogs that were wolves and they were now drawn up in an expectant circle they too were silent their eyes only gleaming and their breaths drifting slowly upward to buck it was nothing new or strange this scene of old time it was as though it had always been the wonted way of things 
 spitz was a practiced fighter from spitzbergen through the arctic and across canada and the barrens he had held his own with all manner of dogs and achieved to mastery over them bitter rage was his but never blind rage in passion to rend and destroy he never forgot that his enemy was in like passion to rend and destroy he never rushed till he was prepared to receive a rush never attacked till he had first defended that attack 
 in vain buck strove to sink his teeth in the neck of the big white dog wherever his fangs struck for the softer flesh they were countered by the fangs of spitz fang clashed fang and lips were cut and bleeding but buck could not penetrate his guard then he warmed up and enveloped spitz in a whirlwind of rushes time and time again he tried for the throat where life bubbled near to the surface and each time and every time spitz slashed him and got away then buck took to rushing as though for the throat when suddenly drawing back his head and curving in from the side he would drive his shoulder at the shoulder of spitz as a ram by which to overthrow him but instead shoulder was slashed down each time as spitz leaped lightly away 
 spitz was untouched while buck was streaming with blood and panting hard the fight was growing desperate and all the while the silent and wolfish circle waited to finish off whichever dog went down as buck grew winded spitz took to rushing and he kept him staggering for footing once buck went over and the whole circle of sixty dogs started up but he recovered himself almost in mid air and the circle sank down again and waited 
 but buck possessed a quality that made for he fought by instinct but he could fight by head as well he rushed as though attempting the old shoulder trick but at the last instant swept low to the snow and in his teeth closed on left fore leg there was a crunch of breaking bone and the white dog faced him on three legs thrice he tried to knock him over then repeated the trick and broke the right fore leg despite the pain and helplessness spitz struggled madly to keep up he saw the silent circle with gleaming eyes lolling tongues and silvery breaths drifting upward closing in upon him as he had seen similar circles close in upon beaten antagonists in the past only this time he was the one who was beaten 
 there was no hope for him buck was inexorable mercy was a thing reserved for gentler climes he maneuvered for the final rush the circle had tightened till he could feel the breaths of the huskies on his flanks he could see them beyond spitz and to either side for the spring their eyes fixed upon him a pause seemed to fall every animal was motionless as though turned to stone only spitz quivered and bristled as he staggered back and forth snarling with horrible menace as though to frighten off impending death then buck sprang in and out but while he was in shoulder had at last squarely met shoulder the dark circle became a dot on the moon flooded snow as spitz disappeared from view buck stood and looked on the successful champion the dominant primordial beast who had made his kill and found it good

 harry moved back into the shadows next to hedwig who seemed to have realized how important this was and kept still and silent the car revved louder and louder and suddenly with a crunching noise the bars were pulled clean out of the window as fred drove straight up in the air harry ran back to the window to see the bars dangling a few feet above the ground panting ron hoisted them up into the car harry listened anxiously but there was no sound from the 
 
 when the bars were safely in the back seat with ron fred reversed as close as possible to window 
 
 get in ron said 
 
 but all my hogwarts stuff my wand my broomstick 
 
 where is it 
 
 locked in the cupboard under the stairs and i get out of this room 
 
 no problem said george from the front passenger seat out of the way harry 
 
 fred and george climbed catlike through the window into room you had to hand it to them thought harry as george took an ordinary hairpin from his pocket and started to pick the lock 
 
 a lot of wizards think a waste of time knowing this sort of muggle trick said fred but we feel skills worth learning even if they are a bit slow 
 
 there was a small click and the door swung open 
 
 so get your trunk you grab anything you need from your room and hand it out to ron whispered george 
 
 watch out for the bottom stair it creaks harry whispered back as the twins disappeared onto the dark landing 
 
 harry dashed around his room collecting his things and passing them out of the window to ron then he went to help fred and george heave his trunk up the stairs harry heard uncle vernon cough 
 
 at last panting they reached the landing then carried the trunk through room to the open window fred climbed back into the car to pull with ron and harry and george pushed from the bedroom side inch by inch the trunk slid through the window 
 
 uncle vernon coughed again 
 
 a bit more panted fred who was pulling from inside the car one good push 
 
 harry and george threw their shoulders against the trunk and it slid out of the window into the back seat of the car 
 
 okay go george whispered 
 
 but as harry climbed onto the windowsill there came a sudden loud screech from behind him followed immediately by the thunder of uncle voice 
 
 that ruddy owl 
 
 forgotten hedwig 
 
 harry tore back across the room as the landing light clicked on he snatched up cage dashed to the window and passed it out to ron he was scrambling back onto the chest of drawers when uncle vernon hammered on the unlocked door and it crashed open 
 
 for a split second uncle vernon stood framed in the doorway then he let out a bellow like an angry bull and dived at harry grabbing him by the ankle 
 
 ron fred and george seized arms and pulled as hard as they could 
 
 petunia roared uncle vernon getting away getting away 
 
 but the weasleys gave a gigantic tug and leg slid out of uncle grasp harry was in the car slammed the door shut 
 
 put your foot down fred yelled ron and the car shot suddenly toward the moon 
 
 harry believe it he was free he rolled down the window the night air whipping his hair and looked back at the shrinking rooftops of privet drive uncle vernon aunt petunia and dudley were all hanging dumbstruck out of window 
 
 see you next summer harry yelled 
 
 the weasleys roared with laughter and harry settled back in his seat grinning from ear to ear 
 
 let hedwig out he told ron she can fly behind us she had a chance to stretch her wings for ages 
 
 george handed the hairpin to ron and a moment later hedwig soared joyfully out of the window to glide alongside them like a ghost 
 
 so the story harry said ron impatiently been happening 
 
 harry told them all about dobby the warning given harry and the fiasco of the violet pudding there was a long shocked silence when he had finished 
 
 very fishy said fred finally 
 
 definitely dodgy agreed george so he even tell you supposed to be plotting all this stuff 
 
 i think he could said harry i told you every time he got close to letting something slip he started banging his head against the wall 
 
 he saw fred and george look at each other 
 
 what you think he was lying to me said harry 
 
 well said fred put it this way have got powerful magic of their own but they usually use it without their permission i reckon old dobby was sent to stop you coming back to hogwarts idea of a joke can you think of anyone at school with a grudge against you 
 
 yes said harry and ron together instantly 
 
 draco malfoy harry explained he hates me 
 
 draco malfoy said george turning around not lucius son 
 
 must be not a very common name is it said harry 
 
 heard dad talking about him said george he was a big supporter of 
 
 and when disappeared said fred craning around to look at harry lucius malfoy came back saying never meant any of it load of dung dad reckons he was right in you inner circle 
 
 harry had heard these rumors about family before and they surprise him at all malfoy made dudley dursley look like a kind thoughtful and sensitive boy 
 
 i know whether the malfoys own a said harry 
 
 well whoever owns him will be an old wizarding family and be rich said fred 
 
 yeah always wishing we had a to do the ironing said george but all got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all over the garden come with big old manors and castles and places like that you catch one in our house 
 
 harry was silent judging by the fact that draco malfoy usually had the best of everything his family was rolling in wizard gold he could just see malfoy strutting around a large manor house sending the family servant to stop harry from going back to hogwarts also sounded exactly like the sort of thing malfoy would do had harry been stupid to take dobby seriously 
 
 glad we came to get you anyway said ron i was getting really worried when you answer any of my letters i thought it was fault at first 
 
 errol 
 
 our owl ancient it be the first time collapsed on a delivery so then i tried to borrow hermes 
 
 who 
 
 the owl mum and dad bought percy when he was made prefect said fred from the front 
 
 but percy lend him to me said ron said he needed him 
 
 been acting very oddly this summer said george frowning and he has been sending a lot of letters and spending a load of time shut up in his room i mean only so many times you can polish a prefect badge driving too far west fred he added pointing at a compass on the dashboard fred twiddled the steering wheel 
 
 so does your dad know got the car said harry guessing the answer 
 
 er no said ron he had to work tonight hopefully be able to get it back in the garage without mum noticing we flew it 
 
 what does your dad do at the ministry of magic anyway 
 
 he works in the most boring department said ron the misuse of muggle artifacts office 
 
 the what 
 
 all to do with bewitching things that are you know in case they end up back in a muggle shop or house like last year some old witch died and her tea set was sold to an antiques shop this muggle woman bought it took it home and tried to serve her friends tea in it it was a nightmare dad was working overtime for weeks 
 
 what happened 
 
 the teapot went berserk and squirted boiling tea all over the place and one man ended up in the hospital with the sugar tongs clamped to his nose dad was going frantic only him and an old warlock called perkins in the office and they had to do memory charms and all sorts of stuff to cover it up 
 
 but your dad this car 
 
 fred laughed yeah crazy about everything to do with muggles our full of muggle stuff he takes it apart puts spells on it and puts it back together again if he raided our house have to put himself under arrest it drives mum mad 
 
 the main road said george peering down through the windshield be there in ten minutes just as well getting light 
 
 a faint pinkish glow was visible along the horizon to the east 
 
 fred brought the car lower and harry saw a dark patchwork of fields and clumps of trees 
 
 a little way outside the village said george ottery st catchpole 
 
 lower and lower went the flying car the edge of a brilliant red sun was now gleaming through the trees 
 
 touchdown said fred as with a slight bump they hit the ground they had landed next to a tumbledown garage in a small yard and harry looked out for the first time at house 
 
 it looked as though it had once been a large stone pigpen but extra rooms had been added here and there until it was several stories high and so crooked it looked as though it were held up by magic which harry reminded himself it probably was four or five chimneys were perched on top of the red roof a lopsided sign stuck in the ground near the entrance read the burrow around the front door lay a jumble of rubber boots and a very rusty cauldron several fat brown chickens were pecking their way around the yard 
 
 not much said ron 
 
 wonderful said harry happily thinking of privet drive 
 
 they got out of the car 
 
 now go upstairs really quietly said fred and wait for mum to call us for breakfast then ron you come bounding downstairs going mum look who turned up in the be all pleased to see harry and no one need ever know we flew the car 
 
 right said ron come on harry i sleep at the at the top 
 
 ron had gone a nasty greenish color his eyes fixed on the house the other three wheeled around 
 
 mrs weasley was marching across the yard scattering chickens and for a short plump woman it was remarkable how much she looked like a tiger 
 
 ah said fred 
 
 oh dear said george 
 
 mrs weasley came to a halt in front of them her hands on her hips staring from one guilty face to the next she was wearing a flowered apron with a wand sticking out of the pocket 
 
 so she said 
 
 morning mum said george in what he clearly thought was a jaunty winning voice 
 
 have you any idea how worried been said mrs weasley in a deadly whisper 
 
 sorry mum but see we had to 
 
 all three of mrs sons were taller than she was but they cowered as her rage broke over them 
 
 beds empty no note car gone could have crashed out of my mind with worry did you care never as long as lived you wait until your father gets home we never had trouble like this from bill or charlie or percy 
 
 perfect percy muttered fred 
 
 you could do with taking a leaf out of book yelled mrs weasley prodding a finger in chest you could have died you could have been seen you could have lost your father his job 
 
 it seemed to go on for hours mrs weasley had shouted herself hoarse before she turned on harry who backed away 
 
 very pleased to see you harry dear she said come in and have some breakfast 
 
 she turned and walked back into the house and harry after a nervous glance at ron who nodded encouragingly followed her 
 
 the kitchen was small and rather cramped there was a scrubbed wooden table and chairs in the middle and harry sat down on the edge of his seat looking around he had never been in a wizard house before 
 
 the clock on the wall opposite him had only one hand and no numbers at all written around the edge were things like time to make tea time to feed the chickens and late books were stacked three deep on the mantelpiece books with titles like charm your own cheese enchantment in baking and one minute feasts magic and unless ears were deceiving him the old radio next to the sink had just announced that coming up was witching hour with the popular singing sorceress celestina warbeck 
 
 mrs weasley was clattering around cooking breakfast a little haphazardly throwing dirty looks at her sons as she threw sausages into the frying pan every now and then she muttered things like know what you were thinking of and never would have believed it 
 
 i blame you dear she assured harry tipping eight or nine sausages onto his plate arthur and i have been worried about you too just last night we were saying come and get you ourselves if you written back to ron by friday but really she was now adding three fried eggs to his plate flying an illegal car halfway across the country anyone could have seen you 
 
 she flicked her wand casually at the dishes in the sink which began to clean themselves clinking gently in the background 
 
 it was cloudy mum said fred 
 
 you keep your mouth closed while eating mrs weasley snapped 
 
 they were starving him mum said george 
 
 and you said mrs weasley but it was with a slightly softened expression that she started cutting harry bread and buttering it for him 
 
 at that moment there was a diversion in the form of a small redheaded figure in a long nightdress who appeared in the kitchen gave a small squeal and ran out again 
 
 ginny said ron in an undertone to harry my sister been talking about you all summer 
 
 yeah be wanting your autograph harry fred said with a grin but he caught his eye and bent his face over his plate without another word nothing more was said until all four plates were clean which took a surprisingly short time 
 
 blimey tired yawned fred setting down his knife and fork at last i think go to bed and 
 
 you will not snapped mrs weasley your own fault been up all night going to the garden for me getting completely out of hand again 
 
 oh mum 
 
 and you two she said glaring at ron and fred you can go up to bed dear she added to harry you ask them to fly that wretched car 
 
 but harry who felt wide awake said quickly help ron never seen a 
 
 very sweet of you dear but dull work said mrs weasley now see what got to say on the subject 
 
 and she pulled a heavy book from the stack on the mantelpiece george groaned 
 
 mum we know how to a garden 
 
 harry looked at the cover of mrs book written across it in fancy gold letters were the words gilderoy guide to household pests there was a big photograph on the front of a very wizard with wavy blond hair and bright blue eyes as always in the wizarding world the photograph was moving the wizard who harry supposed was gilderoy lockhart kept winking cheekily up at them all mrs weasley beamed down at him 
 
 oh he is marvelous she said he knows his household pests all right a wonderful book 
 
 mum fancies him said fred in a very audible whisper 
 
 be so ridiculous fred said mrs weasley her cheeks rather pink all right if you think you know better than lockhart you can go and get on with it and woe betide you if a single gnome in that garden when i come out to inspect it 
 
 yawning and grumbling the weasleys slouched outside with harry behind them the garden was large and in eyes exactly what a garden should be the dursleys have liked it there were plenty of weeds and the grass needed cutting but there were gnarled trees all around the walls plants harry had never seen spilling from every flower bed and a big green pond full of frogs 
 
 muggles have garden gnomes too you know harry told ron they crossed the lawn 
 
 yeah seen those things they think are gnomes said ron bent double with his head in a peony bush like fat little santa clauses with fishing rods 
 
 there was a violent scuffling noise the peony bush shuddered and ron straightened up this is a gnome he said grimly 
 
 gerroff me gerroff me squealed the gnome 
 
 it was certainly nothing like santa claus it was small and leathery looking with a large knobby bald head exactly like a potato ron held it at length as it kicked out at him with its horny little feet he grasped it around the ankles and turned it upside down 
 
 this is what you have to do he said he raised the gnome above his head gerroff me and started to swing it in great circles like a lasso seeing the shocked look on face ron added it hurt them just got to make them really dizzy so they find their way back to the gnome holes 
 
 he let go of the ankles it flew twenty feet into the air and landed with a thud in the field over the hedge 
 
 pitiful said fred i bet i can get mine beyond that stump 
 
 harry learned quickly not to feel too sorry for the gnomes he decided just to drop the first one he caught over the hedge but the gnome sensing weakness sank its teeth into finger and he had a hard job shaking it off until 
 
 wow harry that been fifty feet 
 
 the air was soon thick with flying gnomes 
 
 see not too bright said george seizing five or six gnomes at once the moment they know the going on they storm up to have a look think have learned by now just to stay put 
 
 soon the crowd of gnomes in the field started walking away in a straggling line their little shoulders hunched 
 
 be back said ron as they watched the gnomes disappear into the hedge on the other side of the field they love it here too soft with them he thinks funny 
 
 just then the front door slammed 
 
 back said george home 
 
 they hurried through the garden and back into the house 
 
 mr weasley was slumped in a kitchen chair with his glasses off and his eyes closed he was a thin man going bald but the little hair he had was as red as any of his he was wearing long green robes which were dusty and 
 
 what a night he mumbled groping for the teapot as they all sat down around him nine raids nine and old mundungus fletcher tried to put a hex on me when i had my back turned 
 
 mr weasley took a long gulp of tea and sighed 
 
 find anything dad said fred eagerly 
 
 all i got were a few shrinking door keys and a biting kettle yawned mr weasley there was some pretty nasty stuff that my department though mortlake was taken away for questioning about some extremely odd ferrets but the committee on experimental charms thank goodness 
 
 why would anyone bother making door keys shrink said george 
 
 just sighed mr weasley sell them a key that keeps shrinking to nothing so they can never find it when they need it of course very hard to convict anyone because no muggle would admit their key keeps shrinking insist they just keep losing it bless them go to any lengths to ignore magic even if staring them in the face but the things our lot have taken to enchanting you believe 
 
 like cars for instance 
 
 mrs weasley had appeared holding a long poker like a sword mr eyes jerked open he stared guiltily at his wife 
 
 molly dear 
 
 yes arthur cars said mrs weasley her eyes flashing imagine a wizard buying a rusty old car and telling his wife all he wanted to do with it was take it apart to see how it worked while really he was enchanting it to make it fly 
 
 mr weasley blinked 
 
 well dear i think find that he would be quite within the law to do that even if er he maybe would have done better to um tell his wife the truth a loophole in the law find as long as he intending to fly the car the fact that the car could fly 
 
 arthur weasley you made sure there was a loophole when you wrote that law shouted mrs weasley just so you could carry on tinkering with all that muggle rubbish in your shed and for your information harry arrived this morning in the car you intending to fly 
 
 harry said mr weasley blankly harry who 
 
 he looked around saw harry and jumped 
 
 good lord is it harry potter very pleased to meet you told us so much about 
 
 your sons flew that car to house and back last night shouted mrs weasley what have you got to say about that eh 
 
 did you really said mr weasley eagerly did it go all right i i mean he faltered as sparks flew from mrs eyes that that was very wrong boys very wrong indeed 
 
 leave them to it ron muttered to harry as mrs weasley swelled like a bullfrog come on show you my bedroom 
 
 they slipped out of the kitchen and down a narrow passageway to an uneven staircase which wound its way zigzagging up through the house on the third landing a door stood ajar harry just caught sight of a pair of bright brown eyes staring at him before it closed with a snap 
 
 ginny said ron you know how weird it is for her to be this shy she never shuts up normally 
 
 they climbed two more flights until they reached a door with peeling paint and a small plaque on it saying room 
 
 harry stepped in his head almost touching the sloping ceiling and blinked it was like walking into a furnace nearly everything in room seemed to be a violent shade of orange the bedspread the walls even the ceiling then harry realized that ron had covered nearly every inch of the shabby wallpaper with posters of the same seven witches and wizards all wearing bright orange robes carrying broomsticks and waving energetically 
 
 your quidditch team said harry 
 
 the chudley cannons said ron pointing at the orange bedspread which was emblazoned with two giant black and a speeding cannonball ninth in the league 
 
 school spellbooks were stacked untidily in a corner next to a pile of comics that all seemed to feature the adventures of martin miggs the mad muggle magic wand was lying on top of a fish tank full of frog spawn on the windowsill next to his fat gray rat scabbers who was snoozing in a patch of sun 
 
 harry stepped over a pack of playing cards on the floor and looked out of the tiny window in the field far below he could see a gang of gnomes sneaking one by one back through the then he turned to look at ron who was watching him almost nervously as though waiting for his opinion 
 
 a bit small said ron quickly not like that room you had with the muggles and right underneath the ghoul in the attic always banging on the pipes and groaning 
 
 but harry grinning widely said this is the best house ever been in 
 
 ears went pink 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the chamber of secrets 
 

lionfish nov chapter three the burrowcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 ron breathed harry creeping to the window and pushing it up so they could talk through the bars ron how did you what the 
 
 mouth fell open as the full impact of what he was seeing hit him ron was leaning out of the back window of an old turquoise car which was parked in midair grinning at harry from the front seats were fred and george elder twin brothers 
 
 all right harry asked george 
 
 been going on said ron why you been answering my letters asked you to stay about twelve times and then dad came home and said got an official warning for using magic in front of muggles 
 
 it me and how did he know 
 
 he works for the ministry said ron you know not supposed to do spells outside school 
 
 you should talk said harry staring at the floating car 
 
 oh this count said ron only borrowing this we enchant it but doing magic in front of those muggles you live with 
 
 i told you i but take too long to explain now look can you tell them at hogwarts that the dursleys have locked me up and let me come back and obviously i magic myself out because the think the second spell done in three days so 
 
 stop gibbering said ron come to take you home with us 
 
 but you magic me out either 
 
 we need to said ron jerking his head toward the front seat and grinning you forget who got with me 
 
 tie that around the bars said fred throwing the end of a rope to harry 
 
 if the dursleys wake up dead said harry as he tied the rope tightly around a bar and fred revved up the car 
 
 worry said fred and stand back 
 
 harry moved back into the shadows next to hedwig who seemed to have realized how important this was and kept still and silent the car revved louder and louder and suddenly with a crunching noise the bars were pulled clean out of the window as fred drove straight up in the air harry ran back to the window to see the bars dangling a few feet above the ground panting ron hoisted them up into the car harry listened anxiously but there was no sound from the 
 
 when the bars were safely in the back seat with ron fred reversed as close as possible to window 
 
 get in ron said 
 
 but all my hogwarts stuff my wand my broomstick 
 
 where is it 
 
 locked in the cupboard under the stairs and i get out of this room 
 
 no problem said george from the front passenger seat out of the way harry 
 
 fred and george climbed catlike through the window into room you had to hand it to them thought harry as george took an ordinary hairpin from his pocket and started to pick the lock 
 
 a lot of wizards think a waste of time knowing this sort of muggle trick said fred but we feel skills worth learning even if they are a bit slow 
 
 there was a small click and the door swung open 
 
 so get your trunk you grab anything you need from your room and hand it out to ron whispered george 
 
 watch out for the bottom stair it creaks harry whispered back as the twins disappeared onto the dark landing 
 
 harry dashed around his room collecting his things and passing them out of the window to ron then he went to help fred and george heave his trunk up the stairs harry heard uncle vernon cough

 but as harry climbed onto the windowsill there came a sudden loud screech from behind him followed immediately by the thunder of uncle voice

 forgotten hedwig 
 
 harry tore back across the room as the landing light clicked on he snatched up cage dashed to the window and passed it out to ron he was scrambling back onto the chest of drawers when uncle vernon hammered on the unlocked door and it crashed open 
 
 for a split second uncle vernon stood framed in the doorway then he let out a bellow like an angry bull and dived at harry grabbing him by the ankle 
 
 ron fred and george seized arms and pulled as hard as they could 
 
 petunia roared uncle vernon getting away getting away 
 
 but the weasleys gave a gigantic tug and leg slid out of uncle grasp harry was in the car slammed the door shut 
 
 put your foot down fred yelled ron and the car shot suddenly toward the moon 
 
 harry believe it he was free he rolled down the window the night air whipping his hair and looked back at the shrinking rooftops of privet drive uncle vernon aunt petunia and dudley were all hanging dumbstruck out of window 
 
 see you next summer harry yelled 
 
 the weasleys roared with laughter and harry settled back in his seat grinning from ear to ear 
 
 let hedwig out he told ron she can fly behind us she had a chance to stretch her wings for ages 
 
 george handed the hairpin to ron and a moment later hedwig soared joyfully out of the window to glide alongside them like a ghost 
 
 so the story harry said ron impatiently been happening

 the clock on the wall opposite him had only one hand and no numbers at all written around the edge were things like time to make tea time to feed the chickens and late books were stacked three deep on the mantelpiece books with titles like charm your own cheese enchantment in baking and one minute feasts magic and unless ears were deceiving him the old radio next to the sink had just announced that coming up was witching hour with the popular singing sorceress celestina warbeck 
 
 mrs weasley was clattering around cooking breakfast a little haphazardly throwing dirty looks at her sons as she threw sausages into the frying pan every now and then she muttered things like know what you were thinking of and never would have believed it 
 
 i blame you dear she assured harry tipping eight or nine sausages onto his plate arthur and i have been worried about you too just last night we were saying come and get you ourselves if you written back to ron by friday but really she was now adding three fried eggs to his plate flying an illegal car halfway across the country anyone could have seen you 
 
 she flicked her wand casually at the dishes in the sink which began to clean themselves clinking gently in the background 
 
 it was cloudy mum said fred 
 
 you keep your mouth closed while eating mrs weasley snapped 
 
 they were starving him mum said george 
 
 and you said mrs weasley but it was with a slightly softened expression that she started cutting harry bread and buttering it for him 
 
 at that moment there was a diversion in the form of a small redheaded figure in a long nightdress who appeared in the kitchen gave a small squeal and ran out again 
 
 ginny said ron in an undertone to harry my sister been talking about you all summer 
 
 yeah be wanting your autograph harry fred said with a grin but he caught his eye and bent his face over his plate without another word nothing more was said until all four plates were clean which took a surprisingly short time 
 
 blimey tired yawned fred setting down his knife and fork at last i think go to bed and 
 
 you will not snapped mrs weasley your own fault been up all night going to the garden for me getting completely out of hand again 
 
 oh mum 
 
 and you two she said glaring at ron and fred you can go up to bed dear she added to harry you ask them to fly that wretched car 
 
 but harry who felt wide awake said quickly help ron never seen a 
 
 very sweet of you dear but dull work said mrs weasley now see what got to say on the subject 
 
 and she pulled a heavy book from the stack on the mantelpiece george groaned 
 
 mum we know how to a garden 
 
 harry looked at the cover of mrs book written across it in fancy gold letters were the words gilderoy guide to household pests there was a big photograph on the front of a very wizard with wavy blond hair and bright blue eyes as always in the wizarding world the photograph was moving the wizard who harry supposed was gilderoy lockhart kept winking cheekily up at them all mrs weasley beamed down at him 
 
 oh he is marvelous she said he knows his household pests all right a wonderful book 
 
 mum fancies him said fred in a very audible whisper 
 
 be so ridiculous fred said mrs weasley her cheeks rather pink all right if you think you know better than lockhart you can go and get on with it and woe betide you if a single gnome in that garden when i come out to inspect it 
 
 yawning and grumbling the weasleys slouched outside with harry behind them the garden was large and in eyes exactly what a garden should be the dursleys have liked it there were plenty of weeds and the grass needed cutting but there were gnarled trees all around the walls plants harry had never seen spilling from every flower bed and a big green pond full of frogs 
 
 muggles have garden gnomes too you know harry told ron they crossed the lawn 
 
 yeah seen those things they think are gnomes said ron bent double with his head in a peony bush like fat little santa clauses with fishing rods 
 
 there was a violent scuffling noise the peony bush shuddered and ron straightened up this is a gnome he said grimly 
 
 gerroff me gerroff me squealed the gnome 
 
 it was certainly nothing like santa claus it was small and leathery looking with a large knobby bald head exactly like a potato ron held it at length as it kicked out at him with its horny little feet he grasped it around the ankles and turned it upside down 
 
 this is what you have to do he said he raised the gnome above his head gerroff me and started to swing it in great circles like a lasso seeing the shocked look on face ron added it hurt them just got to make them really dizzy so they find their way back to the gnome holes 
 
 he let go of the ankles it flew twenty feet into the air and landed with a thud in the field over the hedge 
 
 pitiful said fred i bet i can get mine beyond that stump 
 
 harry learned quickly not to feel too sorry for the gnomes he decided just to drop the first one he caught over the hedge but the gnome sensing weakness sank its teeth into finger and he had a hard job shaking it off until 
 
 wow harry that been fifty feet 
 
 the air was soon thick with flying gnomes 
 
 see not too bright said george seizing five or six gnomes at once the moment they know the going on they storm up to have a look think have learned by now just to stay put 
 
 soon the crowd of gnomes in the field started walking away in a straggling line their little shoulders hunched 
 
 be back said ron as they watched the gnomes disappear into the hedge on the other side of the field they love it here too soft with them he thinks funny 
 
 just then the front door slammed 
 
 back said george home 
 
 they hurried through the garden and back into the house 
 
 mr weasley was slumped in a kitchen chair with his glasses off and his eyes closed he was a thin man going bald but the little hair he had was as red as any of his he was wearing long green robes which were dusty and 
 
 what a night he mumbled groping for the teapot as they all sat down around him nine raids nine and old mundungus fletcher tried to put a hex on me when i had my back turned 
 
 mr weasley took a long gulp of tea and sighed 
 
 find anything dad said fred eagerly 
 
 all i got were a few shrinking door keys and a biting kettle yawned mr weasley there was some pretty nasty stuff that my department though mortlake was taken away for questioning about some extremely odd ferrets but the committee on experimental charms thank goodness 
 
 why would anyone bother making door keys shrink said george 
 
 just sighed mr weasley sell them a key that keeps shrinking to nothing so they can never find it when they need it of course very hard to convict anyone because no muggle would admit their key keeps shrinking insist they just keep losing it bless them go to any lengths to ignore magic even if staring them in the face but the things our lot have taken to enchanting you believe 
 
 like cars for instance 
 
 mrs weasley had appeared holding a long poker like a sword mr eyes jerked open he stared guiltily at his wife 
 
 molly dear 
 
 yes arthur cars said mrs weasley her eyes flashing imagine a wizard buying a rusty old car and telling his wife all he wanted to do with it was take it apart to see how it worked while really he was enchanting it to make it fly 
 
 mr weasley blinked 
 
 well dear i think find that he would be quite within the law to do that even if er he maybe would have done better to um tell his wife the truth a loophole in the law find as long as he intending to fly the car the fact that the car could fly 
 
 arthur weasley you made sure there was a loophole when you wrote that law shouted mrs weasley just so you could carry on tinkering with all that muggle rubbish in your shed and for your information harry arrived this morning in the car you intending to fly 
 
 harry said mr weasley blankly harry who 
 
 he looked around saw harry and jumped 
 
 good lord is it harry potter very pleased to meet you told us so much about 
 
 your sons flew that car to house and back last night shouted mrs weasley what have you got to say about that eh 
 
 did you really said mr weasley eagerly did it go all right i i mean he faltered as sparks flew from mrs eyes that that was very wrong boys very wrong indeed 
 
 leave them to it ron muttered to harry as mrs weasley swelled like a bullfrog come on show you my bedroom 
 
 they slipped out of the kitchen and down a narrow passageway to an uneven staircase which wound its way zigzagging up through the house on the third landing a door stood ajar harry just caught sight of a pair of bright brown eyes staring at him before it closed with a snap 
 
 ginny said ron you know how weird it is for her to be this shy she never shuts up normally 
 
 they climbed two more flights until they reached a door with peeling paint and a small plaque on it saying room 
 
 harry stepped in his head almost touching the sloping ceiling and blinked it was like walking into a furnace nearly everything in room seemed to be a violent shade of orange the bedspread the walls even the ceiling then harry realized that ron had covered nearly every inch of the shabby wallpaper with posters of the same seven witches and wizards all wearing bright orange robes carrying broomsticks and waving energetically 
 
 your quidditch team said harry 
 
 the chudley cannons said ron pointing at the orange bedspread which was emblazoned with two giant black and a speeding cannonball ninth in the league 
 
 school spellbooks were stacked untidily in a corner next to a pile of comics that all seemed to feature the adventures of martin miggs the mad muggle magic wand was lying on top of a fish tank full of frog spawn on the windowsill next to his fat gray rat scabbers who was snoozing in a patch of sun 
 
 harry stepped over a pack of playing cards on the floor and looked out of the tiny window in the field far below he could see a gang of gnomes sneaking one by one back through the then he turned to look at ron who was watching him almost nervously as though waiting for his opinion 
 
 a bit small said ron quickly not like that room you had with the muggles and right underneath the ghoul in the attic always banging on the pipes and groaning 
 
 but harry grinning widely said this is the best house ever been in 
 
 ears went pink 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the chamber of secrets 
 

lionfish nov chapter three the knight buscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry was several streets away before he collapsed onto a low wall in magnolia crescent panting from the effort of dragging his trunk he sat quite still anger still surging through him listening to the frantic thumping of his heart 
 
 but after ten minutes alone in the dark street a new emotion overtook him panic whichever way he looked at it he had never been in a worse fix he was stranded quite alone in the dark muggle world with absolutely nowhere to go and the worst of it was he had just done serious magic which meant that he was almost certainly expelled from hogwarts he had broken the decree for the restriction of underage wizardry so badly he was surprised ministry of magic representatives swooping down on him where he sat 
 
 harry shivered and looked up and down magnolia crescent 
 
 what was going to happen to him would he be arrested or would he simply be outlawed from the wizarding world he thought of ron and hermione and his heart sank even lower harry was sure that criminal or not ron and hermione would want to help him now but they were both abroad and with hedwig gone he had no means of contacting them 
 
 he have any muggle money either there was a little wizard gold in the money bag at the bottom of his trunk but the rest of the fortune his parents had left him was stored in a vault at gringotts wizarding bank in london never be able to drag his trunk all the way to london unless 
 
 he looked down at his wand which he was still clutching in his hand if he was already expelled his heart was now thumping painfully fast a bit more magic hurt he had the invisibility cloak he had inherited from his father what if he bewitched the trunk to make it tied it to his broomstick covered himself in the cloak and flew to london then he could get the rest of his money out of his vault andbegin his life as an outcast it was a horrible prospect but he sit on this wall forever or find himself trying to explain to muggle police why he was out in the dead of night with a trunk full of spell books and a broomstick 
 
 harry opened his trunk again and pushed the contents aside looking for the invisibility cloak but before he had found it he straightened up suddenly looking around him once more 
 
 a funny prickling on the back of his neck had made harry feel he was being watched but the street appeared to be deserted and no lights shone from any of the large square houses 
 
 he bent over his trunk again but almost immediately stood up once more his hand clenched on his wand he had sensed rather than heard it someone or something was standing in the narrow gap between the garage and the fence behind him harry squinted at the black alleyway if only it would move then know whether it was just a stray cat or something else 
 
 lumos harry muttered and a light appeared at the end of his wand almost dazzling him he held it high over his head and the walls of number two suddenly sparkled the garage door gleamed and between them harry saw quite distinctly the hulking outline of something very big with wide gleaming eyes 
 
 harry stepped backward his legs hit his trunk and he tripped his wand flew out of his hand as he flung out an arm to break his fall and he landed hard in the gutter 
 
 there was a deafening bang and harry threw up his hands to shield his eyes against a sudden blinding light 
 
 with a yell he rolled back onto the pavement just in time a second later a gigantic pair of wheels and headlights screeched to a halt exactly where harry had just been lying they belonged as harry saw when he raised his head to a violently purple bus which had appeared out of thin air gold lettering over the windshield spelled the knight bus 
 
 for a split second harry wondered if he had been knocked silly by his fall then a conductor in a purple uniform leapt out of the bus and began to speak loudly to the night 
 
 welcome to the knight bus emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard just stick out your wand hand step on board and we can take you anywhere you want to go my name is stan shunpike and i will be your conductor this eve 
 
 the conductor stopped abruptly he had just caught sight of harry who was still sitting on the ground harry snatched up his wand again and scrambled to his feet close up he saw that stan shunpike was only a few years older than he was eighteen or nineteen at most with large protruding ears and quite a few pimples 
 
 what were you doin down there said stan dropping his professional manner 
 
 fell over said harry 
 
 choo fall over for sniggered stan 
 
 i do it on purpose said harry annoyed one of the knees in his jeans was torn and the hand he had thrown out to break his fall was bleeding he suddenly remembered why he had fallen over and turned around quickly to stare at the alleyway between the garage and fence the knight headlamps were flooding it with light and it was empty 
 
 choo lookin at said stan 
 
 there was a big black thing said harry pointing uncertainly into the gap like a dogbut massive 
 
 he looked around at stan whose mouth was slightly open with a feeling of unease harry saw eyes move to the scar on forehead 
 
 woss that on your ead said stan abruptly 
 
 nothing said harry quickly flattening his hair over his scar if the ministry of magic was looking for him he want to make it too easy for them 
 
 woss your name stan persisted 
 
 neville longbottom said harry saying the first name that came into his head so so this bus he went on quickly hoping to distract stan did you say it goes anywhere 
 
 yep said stan proudly anywhere you like long on land do nuffink underwater 
 
 ere he said looking suspicious again you did flag us down dincha stuck out your wand and dincha 
 
 yes said harry quickly listen how much would it be to get to london 
 
 eleven sickles said stan but for firteen you get ot chocolate and for fifteen you get an bottle an a toofbrush in the color of your choice 
 
 harry rummaged once more in his trunk extracted his money bag and shoved some gold into hand he and stan then lifted his trunk with cage balanced on top up the steps of the bus 
 
 there were no seats instead half a dozen brass bedsteads stood beside the curtained windows candles were burning in brackets beside each bed illuminating the walls a tiny wizard in a nightcap at the rear of the bus muttered not now thanks pickling some slugs and rolled over in his sleep 
 
 you ave this one stan whispered shoving trunk under the bed right behind the driver who was sitting in an armchair in front of the steering wheel this is our driver ernie prang this is neville longbottom ern 
 
 ernie prang an elderly wizard wearing very thick glasses nodded to harry who nervously flattened his bangs again and sat down on his bed 
 
 take er away ern said stan sitting down in the armchair next to 
 
 there was another tremendous bang and the next moment harry found himself flat on his bed thrown backward by the speed of the knight bus pulling himself up harry stared out of the dark window and saw that they were now bowling along a completely different street stan was watching stunned face with great enjoyment 
 
 this is where we was before you flagged us down he said where are we ern somewhere in wales 
 
 ar said ernie 
 
 how come the muggles hear the bus said harry 
 
 them said stan contemptuously don listen properly do they don look properly either never notice nuffink they don 
 
 best go wake up madam marsh stan said ern be in abergavenny in a minute 
 
 stan passed bed and disappeared up a narrow wooden staircase harry was still looking out of the window feeling increasingly nervous ernie seem to have mastered the use of a steering wheel the knight bus kept mounting the pavement but it hit anything lines of lampposts mailboxes and trash cans jumped out of its way as it approached and back into position once it had passed 
 
 stan came back downstairs followed by a faintly green witch wrapped in a traveling cloak 
 
 ere you go madam marsh said stan happily as ern stamped on the brake and the beds slid a foot or so toward the front of the bus madam marsh clamped a handkerchief to her mouth and tottered down the steps stan threw her bag out after her and rammed the doors shut there was another loud bang and they were thundering down a narrow country lane trees leaping out of the way 
 
 harry have been able to sleep even if he had been traveling on a bus that keep banging loudly and jumping a hundred miles at a time his stomach churned as he fell back to wondering what was going to happen to him and whether the dursleys had managed to get aunt marge off the ceiling yet 
 
 stan had unfurled a copy of the daily prophet and was now reading with his tongue between his teeth a large photograph of a man with long matted hair blinked slowly at harry from the front page he looked strangely familiar 
 
 that man harry said forgetting his troubles for a moment he was on the muggle news 
 
 stanley turned to the front page and chuckled 
 
 sirius black he said nodding course e was on the muggle news neville where you been 
 
 he gave a superior sort of chuckle at the blank look on face removed the front page and handed it to harry 
 
 you oughta read the papers more neville 
 
 harry held the paper up to the candlelight and read 
 
 black still at large 
 sirius black possibly the most infamous prisoner ever to be held in azkaban fortress is still eluding capture the ministry of magic confirmed today 
 we are doing all we can to recapture black said the minister of magic cornelius fudge this morning and we beg the magical community to remain calm 
 fudge has been criticized by some members of the international federation of warlocks for informing the muggle prime minister of the crisis 
 well really i had to you know said an irritable fudge black is mad a danger to anyone who crosses him magic or muggle i have the prime assurance that he will not breathe a word of true identity to anyone and face it believe him if he did 
 while muggles have been told that black is carrying a gun a kind of metal wand that muggles use to kill each other the magical community lives in fear of a massacre like that of twelve years ago when black murdered thirteen people with a single curse 
 harry looked into the shadowed eyes of sirius black the only part of the sunken face that seemed alive harry had never met a vampire but he had seen pictures of them in his defense against the dark arts classes and black with his waxy white skin looked just like one 
 
 fing inee said stan who had been watching harry read 
 
 he murdered thirteen people said harry handing the page back to stan with one curse 
 
 yep said stan in front of witnesses an all broad daylight big trouble it caused dinnit ern 
 
 ar said ern darkly 
 
 stan swiveled in his armchair his hands on the back the better to look at harry 
 
 black woz a big supporter of he said 
 
 what voldemort said harry without thinking 
 
 even pimples went white ern jerked the steering wheel so hard that a whole farmhouse had to jump aside to avoid the bus 
 
 you outta your tree yelped stan choo say is name for 
 
 sorry said harry hastily sorry i i forgot 
 
 forgot said stan weakly blimey my goin that fast 
 
 so so black was a supporter of harry prompted apologetically 
 
 yeah said stan still rubbing his chest yeah right very close to they sayanyway when little arry potter got the better of harry nervously flattened his bangs down again all supporters was tracked down they ern most of em knew it was all over wiv gone and they came quiet but not sirius black i eard he thought be once ad taken over 
 
 anyway they cornered black in the middle of a street full of muggles an black took out is wand and e blasted alf the street apart an a wizard got it an so did a dozen muggles what got in the way orrible eh an you know what black did then stan continued in a dramatic whisper 
 
 what said harry 
 
 laughed said stan jus stood there an laughed an when reinforcements from the ministry of magic got there e went wiv em quiet as anyfink still laughing is ead off cos mad inee ern inee mad 
 
 if he when he went to azkaban he will be now said ern in his slow voice blow meself up before i set foot in that place serves him right mind youafter what he did 
 
 they ad a job coverin it up din they ern stan said ole street blown up an all them muggles dead what was it they said ad appened ern 
 
 gas explosion grunted ernie 
 
 an now out said stan examining the newspaper picture of gaunt face again never been a breakout from azkaban before as there ern beats me ow e did it frightenin eh mind i fancy is chances against them azkaban guards eh ern 
 
 ernie suddenly shivered talk about summat else stan a good lad them azkaban guards give me the collywobbles 
 
 stan put the paper away reluctantly and harry leaned against the window of the knight bus feeling worse than ever he help imagining what stan might be telling his passengers in a few nights time 
 
 ear about that arry potter blew up is aunt we ad im ere on the knight bus we ern e was tryin to run for it 
 
 he harry had broken wizard law just like sirius black was inflating aunt marge bad enough to land him in azkaban harry know anything about the wizard prison though everyone ever heard speak of it did so in the same fearful tone hagrid the hogwarts gamekeeper had spent two months there only last year harry soon forget the look of terror on face when he had been told where he was going and hagrid was one of the bravest people harry knew 
 
 the knight bus rolled through the darkness scattering bushes and wastebaskets telephone booths and trees and harry lay restless and miserable on his feather bed after a while stan remembered that harry had paid for hot chocolate but poured it all over pillow when the bus moved abruptly from anglesea to aberdeen one by one wizards and witches in dressing gowns and slippers descended from the upper floors to leave the bus they all looked very pleased to go 
 
 finally harry was the only passenger left 
 
 right then neville said stan clapping his hands whereabouts in london 
 
 diagon alley said harry 
 
 righto said stan old tight then 
 
 bang 
 
 they were thundering along charing cross road harry sat up and watched buildings and benches squeezing themselves out of the knight way the sky was getting a little lighter he would lie low for a couple of hours go to gringotts the moment it opened then set off where he know 
 
 ern slammed on the brakes and the knight bus skidded to a halt in front of a small and pub the leaky cauldron behind which lay the magical entrance to diagon alley 
 
 thanks harry said to ern 
 
 he jumped down the steps and helped stan lower his trunk and cage onto the pavement 
 
 well said harry bye then 
 
 but stan paying attention still standing in the doorway to the bus he was goggling at the shadowy entrance to the leaky cauldron 
 
 there you are harry said a voice 
 
 before harry could turn he felt a hand on his shoulder at the same time stan shouted blimey ern come ere come ere 
 
 harry looked up at the owner of the hand on his shoulder and felt a bucketful of ice cascade into his stomach he had walked right into cornelius fudge the minister of magic himself 
 
 stan leapt onto the pavement beside them 
 
 what didja call neville minister he said excitedly 
 
 fudge a portly little man in a long pinstriped cloak looked cold and exhausted 
 
 neville he repeated frowning this is harry potter 
 
 i knew it stan shouted gleefully ern ern guess oo neville is ern arry potter i can see is scar 
 
 yes said fudge testily well very glad the knight bus picked harry up but he and i need to step inside the leaky cauldron now 
 
 fudge increased the pressure on shoulder and harry found himself being steered inside the pub a stooping figure bearing a lantern appeared through the door behind the bar it was tom the wizened toothless landlord 
 
 got him minister said tom will you be wanting anything beer brandy 
 
 perhaps a pot of tea said fudge who still let go of harry 
 
 there was a loud scraping and puffing from behind them and stan and ern appeared carrying trunk and cage and looking around excitedly 
 
 ow come you tell us oo you are eh neville said stan beaming at harry while owlish face peered interestedly over shoulder 
 
 and a private parlor please tom said fudge pointedly 
 
 bye harry said miserably to stan and ern as tom beckoned fudge toward the passage that led from the bar 
 
 bye neville called stan 
 
 fudge marched harry along the narrow passage after lantern and then into a small parlor tom clicked his fingers a fire burst into life in the grate and he bowed himself out of the room 
 
 sit down harry said fudge indicating a chair by the fire 
 
 harry sat down feeling goose bumps rising up his arms despite the glow of the fire fudge took off his pinstriped cloak and tossed it aside then hitched up the trousers of his suit and sat down opposite harry 
 
 i am cornelius fudge harry the minister of magic 
 
 harry already knew this of course he had seen fudge once before but as he had been wearing his invisibility cloak at the time fudge to know that 
 
 tom the innkeeper reappeared wearing an apron over his nightshirt and bearing a tray of tea and crumpets he placed the tray on a table between fudge and harry and left the parlor closing the door behind him 
 
 well harry said fudge pouring out tea had us all in a right flap i mind telling you running away from your aunt and house like that started to thinkbut safe and what matters 
 
 fudge buttered himself a crumpet and pushed the plate toward harry 
 
 eat harry you look dead on your feet now thenyou will be pleased to hear that we have dealt with the unfortunate of miss marjorie dursley two members of the accidental magic reversal department were dispatched to privet drive a few hours ago miss dursley has been punctured and her memory has been modified she has no recollection of the incident at all so that and no harm done 
 
 fudge smiled at harry over the rim of his teacup rather like an uncle surveying a favorite nephew harry who believe his ears opened his mouth to speak think of anything to say and closed it again 
 
 ah worrying about the reaction of your aunt and uncle said fudge well i deny that they are extremely angry harry but they are prepared to take you back next summer as long as you stay at hogwarts for the christmas and easter holidays 
 
 harry unstuck his throat 
 
 i always stay at hogwarts for the christmas and easter holidays he said and i ever want to go back to privet drive 
 
 now now sure feel differently once calmed down said fudge in a worried tone they are your family after all and sure you are fond of each other er very deep down 
 
 it occur to harry to put fudge right he was still waiting to hear what was going to happen to him now 
 
 so all that remains said fudge now buttering himself a second crumpet is to decide where going to spend the last two weeks of your vacation i suggest you take a room here at the leaky cauldron and 
 
 hang on blurted harry what about my punishment 
 
 fudge blinked punishment 
 
 i broke the law harry said the decree for the restriction of underage wizardry 
 
 oh my dear boy not going to punish you for a little thing like that cried fudge waving his crumpet impatiently it was an accident we send people to azkaban just for blowing up their aunts 
 
 but this tally at all with past dealings with the ministry of magic 
 
 last year i got an official warning just because a smashed a pudding in my house he told fudge frowning the ministry of magic said be expelled from hogwarts if there was any more magic there 
 
 unless eyes were deceiving him fudge was suddenly looking awkward 
 
 circumstances change harrywe have to take into accountin the present climatesurely you want to be expelled 
 
 of course i said harry 
 
 well then all the fuss about laughed fudge now have a crumpet harry while i go and see if got a room for you 
 
 fudge strode out of the parlor and harry stared after him there was something extremely odd going on why had fudge been waiting for him at the leaky cauldron if not to punish him for what done and now harry came to think of it surely it usual for the minister of magic himself to get involved in matters of underage magic 
 
 fudge came back accompanied by tom the innkeeper 
 
 room free harry said fudge i think be very comfortable just one thing and sure understandi want you wandering off into muggle london all right keep to diagon alley and to be back here before dark each night sure understand tom will be keeping an eye on you for me 
 
 okay said harry slowly but why 
 
 want to lose you again do we said fudge with a hearty laugh no nobest we know where you arei mean 
 
 fudge cleared his throat loudly and picked up his pinstriped cloak 
 
 well be off plenty to do you know 
 
 have you had any luck with black yet harry asked 
 
 finger slipped on the silver fastenings of his cloak 
 
 that oh heard well no not yet but only a matter of time the azkaban guards have never yet failedand they are angrier than ever seen them 
 
 fudge shuddered slightly 
 
 so say 
 
 he held out his hand and harry shaking it had a sudden idea 
 
 er minister can i ask you something 
 
 certainly said fudge with a smile 
 
 well third years at hogwarts are allowed to visit hogsmeade but my aunt and uncle sign the permission form think you could 
 
 fudge was looking uncomfortable 
 
 ah he said no no very sorry harry but as not your parent or guardian 
 
 but the minister of magic said harry eagerly if you gave me permission 
 
 no sorry harry but rules are rules said fudge flatly 
 
 perhaps be able to visit hogsmeade next year in fact i think best if you be off enjoy your stay harry 
 
 and with a last smile and shake of hand fudge left the room tom now moved forward beaming at harry 
 
 if follow me mr potter he said already taken your things up 
 
 harry followed tom up a handsome wooden staircase to a door with a brass number eleven on it which tom unlocked and opened for him 
 
 inside was a very bed some highly polished oak furniture a cheerfully crackling fire and perched on top of the wardrobe 
 
 hedwig harry gasped 
 
 the snowy owl clicked her beak and fluttered down onto arm 
 
 very smart owl got there chuckled tom arrived about five minutes after you did if anything you need mr potter hesitate to ask 
 
 he gave another bow and left 
 
 harry sat on his bed for a long time absentmindedly stroking hedwig the sky outside the window was changing rapidly from deep velvety blue to cold steely gray and then slowly to pink shot with gold harry could hardly believe that left privet drive only a few hours ago that he expelled and that he was now facing two completely weeks 
 
 been a very weird night hedwig he yawned 
 
 and without even removing his glasses he slumped back onto his pillows and fell asleep 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the prisoner of azkaban

 he looked down at his wand which he was still clutching in his hand if he was already expelled his heart was now thumping painfully fast a bit more magic hurt he had the invisibility cloak he had inherited from his father what if he bewitched the trunk to make it tied it to his broomstick covered himself in the cloak and flew to london then he could get the rest of his money out of his vault andbegin his life as an outcast it was a horrible prospect but he sit on this wall forever or find himself trying to explain to muggle police why he was out in the dead of night with a trunk full of spell books and a broomstick 
 
 harry opened his trunk again and pushed the contents aside looking for the invisibility cloak but before he had found it he straightened up suddenly looking around him once more 
 
 a funny prickling on the back of his neck had made harry feel he was being watched but the street appeared to be deserted and no lights shone from any of the large square houses 
 
 he bent over his trunk again but almost immediately stood up once more his hand clenched on his wand he had sensed rather than heard it someone or something was standing in the narrow gap between the garage and the fence behind him harry squinted at the black alleyway if only it would move then know whether it was just a stray cat or something else 
 
 lumos harry muttered and a light appeared at the end of his wand almost dazzling him he held it high over his head and the walls of number two suddenly sparkled the garage door gleamed and between them harry saw quite distinctly the hulking outline of something very big with wide gleaming eyes 
 
 harry stepped backward his legs hit his trunk and he tripped his wand flew out of his hand as he flung out an arm to break his fall and he landed hard in the gutter 
 
 there was a deafening bang and harry threw up his hands to shield his eyes against a sudden blinding light 
 
 with a yell he rolled back onto the pavement just in time a second later a gigantic pair of wheels and headlights screeched to a halt exactly where harry had just been lying they belonged as harry saw when he raised his head to a violently purple bus which had appeared out of thin air gold lettering over the windshield spelled the knight bus 
 
 for a split second harry wondered if he had been knocked silly by his fall then a conductor in a purple uniform leapt out of the bus and began to speak loudly to the night 
 
 welcome to the knight bus emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard just stick out your wand hand step on board and we can take you anywhere you want to go my name is stan shunpike and i will be your conductor this eve 
 
 the conductor stopped abruptly he had just caught sight of harry who was still sitting on the ground harry snatched up his wand again and scrambled to his feet close up he saw that stan shunpike was only a few years older than he was eighteen or nineteen at most with large protruding ears and quite a few pimples 
 
 what were you doin down there said stan dropping his professional manner 
 
 fell over said harry 
 
 choo fall over for sniggered stan 
 
 i do it on purpose said harry annoyed one of the knees in his jeans was torn and the hand he had thrown out to break his fall was bleeding he suddenly remembered why he had fallen over and turned around quickly to stare at the alleyway between the garage and fence the knight headlamps were flooding it with light and it was empty 
 
 choo lookin at said stan 
 
 there was a big black thing said harry pointing uncertainly into the gap like a dogbut massive 
 
 he looked around at stan whose mouth was slightly open with a feeling of unease harry saw eyes move to the scar on forehead 
 
 woss that on your ead said stan abruptly 
 
 nothing said harry quickly flattening his hair over his scar if the ministry of magic was looking for him he want to make it too easy for them 
 
 woss your name stan persisted 
 
 neville longbottom said harry saying the first name that came into his head so so this bus he went on quickly hoping to distract stan did you say it goes anywhere 
 
 yep said stan proudly anywhere you like long on land do nuffink underwater 
 
 ere he said looking suspicious again you did flag us down dincha stuck out your wand and dincha 
 
 yes said harry quickly listen how much would it be to get to london 
 
 eleven sickles said stan but for firteen you get ot chocolate and for fifteen you get an bottle an a toofbrush in the color of your choice 
 
 harry rummaged once more in his trunk extracted his money bag and shoved some gold into hand he and stan then lifted his trunk with cage balanced on top up the steps of the bus 
 
 there were no seats instead half a dozen brass bedsteads stood beside the curtained windows candles were burning in brackets beside each bed illuminating the walls a tiny wizard in a nightcap at the rear of the bus muttered not now thanks pickling some slugs and rolled over in his sleep 
 
 you ave this one stan whispered shoving trunk under the bed right behind the driver who was sitting in an armchair in front of the steering wheel this is our driver ernie prang this is neville longbottom ern 
 
 ernie prang an elderly wizard wearing very thick glasses nodded to harry who nervously flattened his bangs again and sat down on his bed 
 
 take er away ern said stan sitting down in the armchair next to 
 
 there was another tremendous bang and the next moment harry found himself flat on his bed thrown backward by the speed of the knight bus pulling himself up harry stared out of the dark window and saw that they were now bowling along a completely different street stan was watching stunned face with great enjoyment 
 
 this is where we was before you flagged us down he said where are we ern somewhere in wales 
 
 ar said ernie 
 
 how come the muggles hear the bus said harry 
 
 them said stan contemptuously don listen properly do they don look properly either never notice nuffink they don 
 
 best go wake up madam marsh stan said ern be in abergavenny in a minute 
 
 stan passed bed and disappeared up a narrow wooden staircase harry was still looking out of the window feeling increasingly nervous ernie seem to have mastered the use of a steering wheel the knight bus kept mounting the pavement but it hit anything lines of lampposts mailboxes and trash cans jumped out of its way as it approached and back into position once it had passed 
 
 stan came back downstairs followed by a faintly green witch wrapped in a traveling cloak 
 
 ere you go madam marsh said stan happily as ern stamped on the brake and the beds slid a foot or so toward the front of the bus madam marsh clamped a handkerchief to her mouth and tottered down the steps stan threw her bag out after her and rammed the doors shut there was another loud bang and they were thundering down a narrow country lane trees leaping out of the way 
 
 harry have been able to sleep even if he had been traveling on a bus that keep banging loudly and jumping a hundred miles at a time his stomach churned as he fell back to wondering what was going to happen to him and whether the dursleys had managed to get aunt marge off the ceiling yet 
 
 stan had unfurled a copy of the daily prophet and was now reading with his tongue between his teeth a large photograph of a man with long matted hair blinked slowly at harry from the front page he looked strangely familiar 
 
 that man harry said forgetting his troubles for a moment he was on the muggle news 
 
 stanley turned to the front page and chuckled 
 
 sirius black he said nodding course e was on the muggle news neville where you been 
 
 he gave a superior sort of chuckle at the blank look on face removed the front page and handed it to harry 
 
 you oughta read the papers more neville 
 
 harry held the paper up to the candlelight and read 
 
 black still at large 
 sirius black possibly the most infamous prisoner ever to be held in azkaban fortress is still eluding capture the ministry of magic confirmed today 
 we are doing all we can to recapture black said the minister of magic cornelius fudge this morning and we beg the magical community to remain calm 
 fudge has been criticized by some members of the international federation of warlocks for informing the muggle prime minister of the crisis 
 well really i had to you know said an irritable fudge black is mad a danger to anyone who crosses him magic or muggle i have the prime assurance that he will not breathe a word of true identity to anyone and face it believe him if he did 
 while muggles have been told that black is carrying a gun a kind of metal wand that muggles use to kill each other the magical community lives in fear of a massacre like that of twelve years ago when black murdered thirteen people with a single curse 
 harry looked into the shadowed eyes of sirius black the only part of the sunken face that seemed alive harry had never met a vampire but he had seen pictures of them in his defense against the dark arts classes and black with his waxy white skin looked just like one 
 
 fing inee said stan who had been watching harry read 
 
 he murdered thirteen people said harry handing the page back to stan with one curse 
 
 yep said stan in front of witnesses an all broad daylight big trouble it caused dinnit ern 
 
 ar said ern darkly 
 
 stan swiveled in his armchair his hands on the back the better to look at harry 
 
 black woz a big supporter of he said 
 
 what voldemort said harry without thinking 
 
 even pimples went white ern jerked the steering wheel so hard that a whole farmhouse had to jump aside to avoid the bus 
 
 you outta your tree yelped stan choo say is name for 
 
 sorry said harry hastily sorry i i forgot 
 
 forgot said stan weakly blimey my goin that fast 
 
 so so black was a supporter of harry prompted apologetically 
 
 yeah said stan still rubbing his chest yeah right very close to they sayanyway when little arry potter got the better of harry nervously flattened his bangs down again all supporters was tracked down they ern most of em knew it was all over wiv gone and they came quiet but not sirius black i eard he thought be once ad taken over 
 
 anyway they cornered black in the middle of a street full of muggles an black took out is wand and e blasted alf the street apart an a wizard got it an so did a dozen muggles what got in the way orrible eh an you know what black did then stan continued in a dramatic whisper 
 
 what said harry

 gas explosion grunted ernie 
 
 an now out said stan examining the newspaper picture of gaunt face again never been a breakout from azkaban before as there ern beats me ow e did it frightenin eh mind i fancy is chances against them azkaban guards eh ern 
 
 ernie suddenly shivered talk about summat else stan a good lad them azkaban guards give me the collywobbles 
 
 stan put the paper away reluctantly and harry leaned against the window of the knight bus feeling worse than ever he help imagining what stan might be telling his passengers in a few nights time 
 
 ear about that arry potter blew up is aunt we ad im ere on the knight bus we ern e was tryin to run for it 
 
 he harry had broken wizard law just like sirius black was inflating aunt marge bad enough to land him in azkaban harry know anything about the wizard prison though everyone ever heard speak of it did so in the same fearful tone hagrid the hogwarts gamekeeper had spent two months there only last year harry soon forget the look of terror on face when he had been told where he was going and hagrid was one of the bravest people harry knew 
 
 the knight bus rolled through the darkness scattering bushes and wastebaskets telephone booths and trees and harry lay restless and miserable on his feather bed after a while stan remembered that harry had paid for hot chocolate but poured it all over pillow when the bus moved abruptly from anglesea to aberdeen one by one wizards and witches in dressing gowns and slippers descended from the upper floors to leave the bus they all looked very pleased to go 
 
 finally harry was the only passenger left 
 
 right then neville said stan clapping his hands whereabouts in london 
 
 diagon alley said harry 
 
 righto said stan old tight then 
 
 bang 
 
 they were thundering along charing cross road harry sat up and watched buildings and benches squeezing themselves out of the knight way the sky was getting a little lighter he would lie low for a couple of hours go to gringotts the moment it opened then set off where he know 
 
 ern slammed on the brakes and the knight bus skidded to a halt in front of a small and pub the leaky cauldron behind which lay the magical entrance to diagon alley 
 
 thanks harry said to ern 
 
 he jumped down the steps and helped stan lower his trunk and cage onto the pavement 
 
 well said harry bye then 
 
 but stan paying attention still standing in the doorway to the bus he was goggling at the shadowy entrance to the leaky cauldron 
 
 there you are harry said a voice 
 
 before harry could turn he felt a hand on his shoulder at the same time stan shouted blimey ern come ere come ere 
 
 harry looked up at the owner of the hand on his shoulder and felt a bucketful of ice cascade into his stomach he had walked right into cornelius fudge the minister of magic himself 
 
 stan leapt onto the pavement beside them 
 
 what didja call neville minister he said excitedly 
 
 fudge a portly little man in a long pinstriped cloak looked cold and exhausted 
 
 neville he repeated frowning this is harry potter 
 
 i knew it stan shouted gleefully ern ern guess oo neville is ern arry potter i can see is scar 
 
 yes said fudge testily well very glad the knight bus picked harry up but he and i need to step inside the leaky cauldron now 
 
 fudge increased the pressure on shoulder and harry found himself being steered inside the pub a stooping figure bearing a lantern appeared through the door behind the bar it was tom the wizened toothless landlord 
 
 got him minister said tom will you be wanting anything beer brandy 
 
 perhaps a pot of tea said fudge who still let go of harry 
 
 there was a loud scraping and puffing from behind them and stan and ern appeared carrying trunk and cage and looking around excitedly 
 
 ow come you tell us oo you are eh neville said stan beaming at harry while owlish face peered interestedly over shoulder 
 
 and a private parlor please tom said fudge pointedly 
 
 bye harry said miserably to stan and ern as tom beckoned fudge toward the passage that led from the bar 
 
 bye neville called stan 
 
 fudge marched harry along the narrow passage after lantern and then into a small parlor tom clicked his fingers a fire burst into life in the grate and he bowed himself out of the room 
 
 sit down harry said fudge indicating a chair by the fire 
 
 harry sat down feeling goose bumps rising up his arms despite the glow of the fire fudge took off his pinstriped cloak and tossed it aside then hitched up the trousers of his suit and sat down opposite harry 
 
 i am cornelius fudge harry the minister of magic 
 
 harry already knew this of course he had seen fudge once before but as he had been wearing his invisibility cloak at the time fudge to know that 
 
 tom the innkeeper reappeared wearing an apron over his nightshirt and bearing a tray of tea and crumpets he placed the tray on a table between fudge and harry and left the parlor closing the door behind him 
 
 well harry said fudge pouring out tea had us all in a right flap i mind telling you running away from your aunt and house like that started to thinkbut safe and what matters 
 
 fudge buttered himself a crumpet and pushed the plate toward harry 
 
 eat harry you look dead on your feet now thenyou will be pleased to hear that we have dealt with the unfortunate of miss marjorie dursley two members of the accidental magic reversal department were dispatched to privet drive a few hours ago miss dursley has been punctured and her memory has been modified she has no recollection of the incident at all so that and no harm done 
 
 fudge smiled at harry over the rim of his teacup rather like an uncle surveying a favorite nephew harry who believe his ears opened his mouth to speak think of anything to say and closed it again 
 
 ah worrying about the reaction of your aunt and uncle said fudge well i deny that they are extremely angry harry but they are prepared to take you back next summer as long as you stay at hogwarts for the christmas and easter holidays 
 
 harry unstuck his throat 
 
 i always stay at hogwarts for the christmas and easter holidays he said and i ever want to go back to privet drive 
 
 now now sure feel differently once calmed down said fudge in a worried tone they are your family after all and sure you are fond of each other er very deep down 
 
 it occur to harry to put fudge right he was still waiting to hear what was going to happen to him now 
 
 so all that remains said fudge now buttering himself a second crumpet is to decide where going to spend the last two weeks of your vacation i suggest you take a room here at the leaky cauldron and 
 
 hang on blurted harry what about my punishment 
 
 fudge blinked punishment 
 
 i broke the law harry said the decree for the restriction of underage wizardry 
 
 oh my dear boy not going to punish you for a little thing like that cried fudge waving his crumpet impatiently it was an accident we send people to azkaban just for blowing up their aunts 
 
 but this tally at all with past dealings with the ministry of magic 
 
 last year i got an official warning just because a smashed a pudding in my house he told fudge frowning the ministry of magic said be expelled from hogwarts if there was any more magic there 
 
 unless eyes were deceiving him fudge was suddenly looking awkward 
 
 circumstances change harrywe have to take into accountin the present climatesurely you want to be expelled 
 
 of course i said harry 
 
 well then all the fuss about laughed fudge now have a crumpet harry while i go and see if got a room for you 
 
 fudge strode out of the parlor and harry stared after him there was something extremely odd going on why had fudge been waiting for him at the leaky cauldron if not to punish him for what done and now harry came to think of it surely it usual for the minister of magic himself to get involved in matters of underage magic 
 
 fudge came back accompanied by tom the innkeeper 
 
 room free harry said fudge i think be very comfortable just one thing and sure understandi want you wandering off into muggle london all right keep to diagon alley and to be back here before dark each night sure understand tom will be keeping an eye on you for me 
 
 okay said harry slowly but why 
 
 want to lose you again do we said fudge with a hearty laugh no nobest we know where you arei mean 
 
 fudge cleared his throat loudly and picked up his pinstriped cloak 
 
 well be off plenty to do you know 
 
 have you had any luck with black yet harry asked 
 
 finger slipped on the silver fastenings of his cloak 
 
 that oh heard well no not yet but only a matter of time the azkaban guards have never yet failedand they are angrier than ever seen them 
 
 fudge shuddered slightly 
 
 so say 
 
 he held out his hand and harry shaking it had a sudden idea 
 
 er minister can i ask you something 
 
 certainly said fudge with a smile 
 
 well third years at hogwarts are allowed to visit hogsmeade but my aunt and uncle sign the permission form think you could 
 
 fudge was looking uncomfortable 
 
 ah he said no no very sorry harry but as not your parent or guardian 
 
 but the minister of magic said harry eagerly if you gave me permission 
 
 no sorry harry but rules are rules said fudge flatly 
 
 perhaps be able to visit hogsmeade next year in fact i think best if you be off enjoy your stay harry 
 
 and with a last smile and shake of hand fudge left the room tom now moved forward beaming at harry 
 
 if follow me mr potter he said already taken your things up 
 
 harry followed tom up a handsome wooden staircase to a door with a brass number eleven on it which tom unlocked and opened for him 
 
 inside was a very bed some highly polished oak furniture a cheerfully crackling fire and perched on top of the wardrobe 
 
 hedwig harry gasped 
 
 the snowy owl clicked her beak and fluttered down onto arm 
 
 very smart owl got there chuckled tom arrived about five minutes after you did if anything you need mr potter hesitate to ask 
 
 he gave another bow and left 
 
 harry sat on his bed for a long time absentmindedly stroking hedwig the sky outside the window was changing rapidly from deep velvety blue to cold steely gray and then slowly to pink shot with gold harry could hardly believe that left privet drive only a few hours ago that he expelled and that he was now facing two completely weeks 
 
 been a very weird night hedwig he yawned 
 
 and without even removing his glasses he slumped back onto his pillows and fell asleep 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the prisoner of azkaban 
 

lionfish nov chapter three the invitationcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 by the time harry arrived in the kitchen the three dursleys were already seated around the table none of them looked up as he entered or sat down uncle large red face was hidden behind the daily mail and aunt petunia was cutting a grapefruit into quarters her lips pursed over her teeth 
 
 dudley looked furious and sulky and somehow seemed to be taking up even more space than usual this was saying something as he always took up an entire side of the square table by himself when aunt petunia put a quarter of unsweetened grapefruit onto plate with a tremulous there you are diddy darling dudley glowered at her his life had taken a most unpleasant turn since he had come home for the summer with his report 
 
 uncle vernon and aunt petunia had managed to find excuses for his bad marks as usual aunt petunia always insisted that dudley was a very gifted boy whose teachers understand him while uncle vernon maintained that he want some swotty little nancy boy for a son anyway they also skated over the accusations of bullying in the report a boisterous little boy but he hurt a fly aunt petunia had said tearfully 
 
 however at the bottom of the report there were a few comments from the school nurse that not even uncle vernon and aunt petunia could explain away no matter how much aunt petunia wailed that dudley was and that his poundage was really puppy fat and that he was a growing boy who needed plenty of food the fact remained that the school outfitters stock knickerbockers big enough for him anymore the school nurse had seen what aunt eyes so sharp when it came to spotting fingerprints on her gleaming walls and in observing the comings and goings of the neighbors simply refused to see that far from needing extra nourishment dudley had reached roughly the size and weight of a young killer whale 
 
 so after many tantrums after arguments that shook bedroom floor and many tears from aunt petunia the new regime had begun the diet sheet that had been sent by the smeltings school nurse had been taped to the fridge which had been emptied of all favorite things fizzy drinks and cakes chocolate bars and burgers and filled instead with fruit and vegetables and the sorts of things that uncle vernon called rabbit food to make dudley feel better about it all aunt petunia had insisted that the whole family follow the diet too she now passed a grapefruit quarter to harry he noticed that it was a lot smaller than aunt petunia seemed to feet that the best way to keep up morale was to make sure that he did at least get more to eat than harry 
 
 but aunt petunia know what was hidden under the loose floorboard upstairs she had no idea that harry was not following the diet at all the moment he had got wind of the fact that he was expected to survive the summer on carrot sticks harry had sent hedwig to his friends with pleas for help and they had risen to the occasion magnificently hedwig had returned from house with a large box stuffed full of snacks parents were dentists hagrid the hogwarts gamekeeper had obliged with a sack full of his own homemade rock cakes harry touched these he had had too much experience of cooking mrs weasley however had sent the family owl errol with an enormous fruitcake and assorted meat pies poor errol who was elderly and feeble had needed a full five days to recover from the journey and then on birthday which the dursleys had completely ignored he had received four superb birthday cakes one each from ron hermione hagrid and sirius harry still had two of them left and so looking forward to a real breakfast when he got back upstairs he ate his grapefruit without complaint 
 
 uncle vernon laid aside his paper with a deep sniff of disapproval and looked down at his own grapefruit quarter 
 
 is this it he said grumpily to aunt petunia 
 
 aunt petunia gave him a severe look and then nodded pointedly at dudley who had already finished his own grapefruit quarter and was eyeing with a very sour look in his piggy little eyes 
 
 uncle vernon gave a great sigh which ruffled his large bushy mustache and picked up his spoon 
 
 the doorbell rang uncle vernon heaved himself out of his chair and set off down the hall quick as a flash while his mother was occupied with the kettle dudley stole the rest of uncle grapefruit 
 
 harry heard talking at the door and someone laughing and uncle vernon answering curtly then the front door closed and the sound of ripping paper came from the hall 
 
 aunt petunia set the teapot down on the table and looked curiously around to see where uncle vernon had got to she have to wait long to find out after about a minute he was back he looked livid 
 
 you he barked at harry in the living room now 
 
 bewildered wondering what on earth he was supposed to have done this time harry got up and followed uncle vernon out of the kitchen and into the next room uncle vernon closed the door sharply behind both of them 
 
 so he said marching over to the fireplace and turning to face harry as though he were about to pronounce him under arrest so 
 
 harry would have dearly loved to have said so what but he feel that uncle temper should be tested this early in the morning especially when it was already under severe strain from lack of food he therefore settled for looking politely puzzled 
 
 this just arrived said uncle vernon he brandished a piece of purple writing paper at harry a letter about you 
 
 confusion increased who would be writing to uncle vernon about him who did he know who sent letters by the postman 
 
 uncle vernon glared at harry then looked down at the letter and began to read aloud 
 
 dear mr and mrs dursley 
 we have never been introduced but i am sure you have heard a great deal from harry about my son ron 
 as harry might have told you the final of the quidditch world cup takes place this monday night and my husband arthur has just managed to get prime tickets through his connections at the department of magical games and sports 
 i do hope you will allow us to take harry to the match as this really is a opportunity britain hosted the cup for thirty years and tickets are extremely hard to come by we would of course be glad to have harry stay for the remainder of the summer holidays and to see him safely onto the train back to school 
 it would be best for harry to send us your answer as quickly as possible in the normal way because the muggle postman has never delivered to our house and i am not sure he even knows where it is 
 hoping to see harry soon 
 yours sincerely 
 molly weasley 
 i do hope put enough stamps on 
 uncle vernon finished reading put his hand back into his breast pocket and drew out something else 
 
 look at this he growled 
 
 he held up the envelope in which mrs letter had come and harry had to fight down a laugh every bit of it was covered in stamps except for a square inch on the front into which mrs weasley had squeezed the dursleys address in minute writing 
 
 she did put enough stamps on then said harry trying to sound as though mrs was a mistake anyone could make his eyes flashed 
 
 the postman noticed he said through gritted teeth very interested to know where this letter came from he was why he rang the doorbell seemed to think it was funny 
 
 harry say anything other people might not understand why uncle vernon was making a fuss about too many stamps but harry had lived with the dursleys too long not to know how touchy they were about anything even slightly out of the ordinary their worst fear was that someone would find out that they were connected however distantly with people like mrs weasley 
 
 uncle vernon was still glaring at harry who tried to keep his expression neutral if he do or say anything stupid he might just be in for the treat of a lifetime he waited for uncle vernon to say something but he merely continued to glare harry decided to break the silence 
 
 so can i go then he asked 
 
 a slight spasm crossed uncle large purple face the mustache bristled harry thought he knew what was going on behind the mustache a furious battle as two of uncle most fundamental instincts came into conflict allowing harry to go would make harry happy something uncle vernon had struggled against for thirteen years on the other hand allowing harry to disappear to the weasleys for the rest of the summer would get rid of him two weeks earlier than anyone could have hoped and uncle vernon hated having harry in the house to give himself thinking time it seemed he looked down at mrs letter again 
 
 who is this woman he said staring at the signature with distaste 
 
 seen her said harry my friend mother she was meeting him off the hog off the school train at the end of last term 
 
 he had almost said hogwarts express and that was a sure way to get his temper up nobody ever mentioned the name of school aloud in the dursley household 
 
 uncle vernon screwed up his enormous face as though trying to remember something very unpleasant 
 
 dumpy sort of woman he growled finally load of children with red hair 
 
 harry frowned he thought it was a bit rich of uncle vernon to call anyone dumpy when his own son dudley had finally achieved what been threatening to do since the age of three and become wider than he was tall 
 
 uncle vernon was perusing the letter again 
 
 quidditch he muttered under his breath quidditch what is this rubbish 
 
 harry felt a second stab of annoyance 
 
 a sport he said shortly played on broom 
 
 all right all right said uncle vernon loudly harry saw with some satisfaction that his uncle looked vaguely panicky apparently his nerves stand the sound of the word broomsticks in his living room he took refuge in perusing the letter again harry saw his lips form the words send us your answerin the normal way he scowled 
 
 what does she mean the normal way he spat 
 
 normal for us said harry and before his uncle could stop him he added you know owl post normal for wizards 
 
 uncle vernon looked as outraged as if harry had just uttered a disgusting swearword shaking with anger he shot a nervous look through the window as though expecting to see some of the neighbors with their ears pressed against the glass 
 
 how many times do i have to tell you not to mention that unnaturalness under my roof he hissed his face now a rich plum color you stand there in the clothes petunia and i have put on your ungrateful back 
 
 only after dudley finished with them said harry coldly and indeed he was dressed in a sweatshirt so large for him that he had had to roll back the sleeves five times so as to be able to use his hands and which fell past the knees of his extremely baggy jeans 
 
 i will not be spoken to like that said uncle vernon trembling with rage 
 
 but harry going to stand for this gone were the days when he had been forced to take every single one of the dursleys stupid rules he following diet and he going to let uncle vernon stop him from going to the quidditch world cup not if he could help it harry took a deep steadying breath and then said okay i see the world cup can i go now then only got a letter to sirius i want to finish you know my godfather 
 
 he had done it he had said the magic words now he watched the purple recede blotchily from uncle face making it look like badly mixed black currant ice cream 
 
 writing to him are you said uncle vernon in a calm voice but harry had seen the pupils of his tiny eyes contract with sudden fear 
 
 well yeah said harry casually been a while since he heard from me and you know if he he might start thinking wrong 
 
 he stopped there to enjoy the effect of these words he could almost see the cogs working under uncle thick dark neatly parted hair if he tried to stop harry writing to sirius sirius would think harry was being mistreated if he told harry he go to the quidditch world cup harry would write and tell sirius who would know harry was being mistreated there was only one thing for uncle vernon to do harry could see the conclusion forming in his mind as though the great mustached face were transparent harry tried not to smile to keep his own face as blank as possible and then 
 
 well all right then you can go to this ruddythis stupidthis world cup thing you write and tell these these weasleys to pick you up mind i got time to go dropping you off all over the country and you can spend the rest of the summer there and you can tell your your godfathertell himtell him going 
 
 okay then said harry brightly 
 
 he turned and walked toward the living room door fighting the urge to jump into the air and whoop he was goinghe was going to the weasleys he was going to watch the quidditch world cup 
 
 outside in the hall he nearly ran into dudley who had been lurking behind the door clearly hoping to overhear harry being told off he looked shocked to see the broad grin on face 
 
 that was an excellent breakfast it said harry i feel really full you 
 
 laughing at the astonished look on face harry took the stairs three at a time and hurled himself back into his bedroom 
 
 the first thing he saw was that hedwig was back she was sitting in her cage staring at harry with her enormous amber eyes and clicking her beak in the way that meant she was annoyed about something exactly what was annoying her became apparent almost at once 
 
 ouch said harry as what appeared to be a small gray feathery tennis ball collided with the side of his head harry massaged the spot furiously looking up to see what had hit him and saw a minute owl small enough to fit into the palm of his hand whizzing excitedly around the room like a loose firework harry then realized that the owl had dropped a letter at his feet harry bent down recognized handwriting then tore open the envelope inside was a hastily scribbled note 
 
 harry dad got the tickets ireland versus bulgaria monday night writing to the muggles to ask you to stay they might already have the letter i know how fast muggle post is thought send this with pig anyway 
 harry stared at the word pig then looked up at the tiny owl now zooming around the light fixture on the ceiling he had never seen anything that looked less like a pig maybe he read writing he went back to the letter 
 
 coming for you whether the muggles like it or not you miss the world cup only mum and dad reckon better if we pretend to ask their permission first if they say yes send pig back with your answer pronto and come and get you at five on sunday if they say no send pig back pronto and come and get you at five on sunday anyway

 ron 
 calm down harry said as the small owl flew low over his head twittering madly with what harry could only assume was pride at having delivered the letter to the right person come here i need you to take my answer back 
 
 the owl fluttered down on top of cage hedwig looked coldly up at it as though daring it to try and come any closer 
 
 harry seized his quill once more grabbed a fresh piece of parchment and wrote 
 
 ron all okay the muggles say i can come see you five tomorrow wait 
 harry 
 he folded this note up very small and with immense difficulty tied it to the tiny leg as it hopped on the spot with excitement the moment the note was secure the owl was off again it zoomed out of the window and out of sight 
 
 harry turned to hedwig 
 
 feeling up to a long journey he asked her 
 
 hedwig hooted in a dignified sort of a way 
 
 can you take this to sirius for me he said picking up his letter hang oni just want to finish it 
 
 he unfolded the parchment and hastily added a postscript 
 
 if you want to contact me be at my friend ron for the rest of the summer his got us tickets for the quidditch world cup 
 the letter finished he tied it to leg she kept unusually still as though determined to show him how a real post owl should behave 
 
 be at when you get back all right harry told her 
 
 she nipped his finger affectionately then with a soft swooshing noise spread her enormous wings and soared out of the open window 
 
 harry watched her out of sight then crawled under his bed wrenched up the loose floorboard and pulled out a large chunk of birthday cake he sat there on the floor eating it savoring the happiness that was flooding through him he had cake and dudley had nothing but grapefruit it was a bright day he would be leaving privet drive tomorrow his scar felt perfectly normal again and he was going to watch the quidditch world cup it was hard just now to feel worried about anything even lord voldemort

 by the time harry arrived in the kitchen the three dursleys were already seated around the table none of them looked up as he entered or sat down uncle large red face was hidden behind the daily mail and aunt petunia was cutting a grapefruit into quarters her lips pursed over her teeth 
 
 dudley looked furious and sulky and somehow seemed to be taking up even more space than usual this was saying something as he always took up an entire side of the square table by himself when aunt petunia put a quarter of unsweetened grapefruit onto plate with a tremulous there you are diddy darling dudley glowered at her his life had taken a most unpleasant turn since he had come home for the summer with his report 
 
 uncle vernon and aunt petunia had managed to find excuses for his bad marks as usual aunt petunia always insisted that dudley was a very gifted boy whose teachers understand him while uncle vernon maintained that he want some swotty little nancy boy for a son anyway they also skated over the accusations of bullying in the report a boisterous little boy but he hurt a fly aunt petunia had said tearfully 
 
 however at the bottom of the report there were a few comments from the school nurse that not even uncle vernon and aunt petunia could explain away no matter how much aunt petunia wailed that dudley was and that his poundage was really puppy fat and that he was a growing boy who needed plenty of food the fact remained that the school outfitters stock knickerbockers big enough for him anymore the school nurse had seen what aunt eyes so sharp when it came to spotting fingerprints on her gleaming walls and in observing the comings and goings of the neighbors simply refused to see that far from needing extra nourishment dudley had reached roughly the size and weight of a young killer whale 
 
 so after many tantrums after arguments that shook bedroom floor and many tears from aunt petunia the new regime had begun the diet sheet that had been sent by the smeltings school nurse had been taped to the fridge which had been emptied of all favorite things fizzy drinks and cakes chocolate bars and burgers and filled instead with fruit and vegetables and the sorts of things that uncle vernon called rabbit food to make dudley feel better about it all aunt petunia had insisted that the whole family follow the diet too she now passed a grapefruit quarter to harry he noticed that it was a lot smaller than aunt petunia seemed to feet that the best way to keep up morale was to make sure that he did at least get more to eat than harry 
 
 but aunt petunia know what was hidden under the loose floorboard upstairs she had no idea that harry was not following the diet at all the moment he had got wind of the fact that he was expected to survive the summer on carrot sticks harry had sent hedwig to his friends with pleas for help and they had risen to the occasion magnificently hedwig had returned from house with a large box stuffed full of snacks parents were dentists hagrid the hogwarts gamekeeper had obliged with a sack full of his own homemade rock cakes harry touched these he had had too much experience of cooking mrs weasley however had sent the family owl errol with an enormous fruitcake and assorted meat pies poor errol who was elderly and feeble had needed a full five days to recover from the journey and then on birthday which the dursleys had completely ignored he had received four superb birthday cakes one each from ron hermione hagrid and sirius harry still had two of them left and so looking forward to a real breakfast when he got back upstairs he ate his grapefruit without complaint 
 
 uncle vernon laid aside his paper with a deep sniff of disapproval and looked down at his own grapefruit quarter 
 
 is this it he said grumpily to aunt petunia 
 
 aunt petunia gave him a severe look and then nodded pointedly at dudley who had already finished his own grapefruit quarter and was eyeing with a very sour look in his piggy little eyes 
 
 uncle vernon gave a great sigh which ruffled his large bushy mustache and picked up his spoon 
 
 the doorbell rang uncle vernon heaved himself out of his chair and set off down the hall quick as a flash while his mother was occupied with the kettle dudley stole the rest of uncle grapefruit 
 
 harry heard talking at the door and someone laughing and uncle vernon answering curtly then the front door closed and the sound of ripping paper came from the hall 
 
 aunt petunia set the teapot down on the table and looked curiously around to see where uncle vernon had got to she have to wait long to find out after about a minute he was back he looked livid 
 
 you he barked at harry in the living room now 
 
 bewildered wondering what on earth he was supposed to have done this time harry got up and followed uncle vernon out of the kitchen and into the next room uncle vernon closed the door sharply behind both of them 
 
 so he said marching over to the fireplace and turning to face harry as though he were about to pronounce him under arrest so 
 
 harry would have dearly loved to have said so what but he feel that uncle temper should be tested this early in the morning especially when it was already under severe strain from lack of food he therefore settled for looking politely puzzled 
 
 this just arrived said uncle vernon he brandished a piece of purple writing paper at harry a letter about you 
 
 confusion increased who would be writing to uncle vernon about him who did he know who sent letters by the postman 
 
 uncle vernon glared at harry then looked down at the letter and began to read aloud 
 
 dear mr and mrs dursley 
 we have never been introduced but i am sure you have heard a great deal from harry about my son ron 
 as harry might have told you the final of the quidditch world cup takes place this monday night and my husband arthur has just managed to get prime tickets through his connections at the department of magical games and sports 
 i do hope you will allow us to take harry to the match as this really is a opportunity britain hosted the cup for thirty years and tickets are extremely hard to come by we would of course be glad to have harry stay for the remainder of the summer holidays and to see him safely onto the train back to school 
 it would be best for harry to send us your answer as quickly as possible in the normal way because the muggle postman has never delivered to our house and i am not sure he even knows where it is 
 hoping to see harry soon 
 yours sincerely 
 molly weasley 
 i do hope put enough stamps on 
 uncle vernon finished reading put his hand back into his breast pocket and drew out something else 
 
 look at this he growled 
 
 he held up the envelope in which mrs letter had come and harry had to fight down a laugh every bit of it was covered in stamps except for a square inch on the front into which mrs weasley had squeezed the dursleys address in minute writing 
 
 she did put enough stamps on then said harry trying to sound as though mrs was a mistake anyone could make his eyes flashed 
 
 the postman noticed he said through gritted teeth very interested to know where this letter came from he was why he rang the doorbell seemed to think it was funny 
 
 harry say anything other people might not understand why uncle vernon was making a fuss about too many stamps but harry had lived with the dursleys too long not to know how touchy they were about anything even slightly out of the ordinary their worst fear was that someone would find out that they were connected however distantly with people like mrs weasley 
 
 uncle vernon was still glaring at harry who tried to keep his expression neutral if he do or say anything stupid he might just be in for the treat of a lifetime he waited for uncle vernon to say something but he merely continued to glare harry decided to break the silence 
 
 so can i go then he asked 
 
 a slight spasm crossed uncle large purple face the mustache bristled harry thought he knew what was going on behind the mustache a furious battle as two of uncle most fundamental instincts came into conflict allowing harry to go would make harry happy something uncle vernon had struggled against for thirteen years on the other hand allowing harry to disappear to the weasleys for the rest of the summer would get rid of him two weeks earlier than anyone could have hoped and uncle vernon hated having harry in the house to give himself thinking time it seemed he looked down at mrs letter again 
 
 who is this woman he said staring at the signature with distaste 
 
 seen her said harry my friend mother she was meeting him off the hog off the school train at the end of last term 
 
 he had almost said hogwarts express and that was a sure way to get his temper up nobody ever mentioned the name of school aloud in the dursley household 
 
 uncle vernon screwed up his enormous face as though trying to remember something very unpleasant 
 
 dumpy sort of woman he growled finally load of children with red hair 
 
 harry frowned he thought it was a bit rich of uncle vernon to call anyone dumpy when his own son dudley had finally achieved what been threatening to do since the age of three and become wider than he was tall 
 
 uncle vernon was perusing the letter again 
 
 quidditch he muttered under his breath quidditch what is this rubbish 
 
 harry felt a second stab of annoyance 
 
 a sport he said shortly played on broom 
 
 all right all right said uncle vernon loudly harry saw with some satisfaction that his uncle looked vaguely panicky apparently his nerves stand the sound of the word broomsticks in his living room he took refuge in perusing the letter again harry saw his lips form the words send us your answerin the normal way he scowled 
 
 what does she mean the normal way he spat 
 
 normal for us said harry and before his uncle could stop him he added you know owl post normal for wizards 
 
 uncle vernon looked as outraged as if harry had just uttered a disgusting swearword shaking with anger he shot a nervous look through the window as though expecting to see some of the neighbors with their ears pressed against the glass 
 
 how many times do i have to tell you not to mention that unnaturalness under my roof he hissed his face now a rich plum color you stand there in the clothes petunia and i have put on your ungrateful back 
 
 only after dudley finished with them said harry coldly and indeed he was dressed in a sweatshirt so large for him that he had had to roll back the sleeves five times so as to be able to use his hands and which fell past the knees of his extremely baggy jeans 
 
 i will not be spoken to like that said uncle vernon trembling with rage 
 
 but harry going to stand for this gone were the days when he had been forced to take every single one of the dursleys stupid rules he following diet and he going to let uncle vernon stop him from going to the quidditch world cup not if he could help it harry took a deep steadying breath and then said okay i see the world cup can i go now then only got a letter to sirius i want to finish you know my godfather 
 
 he had done it he had said the magic words now he watched the purple recede blotchily from uncle face making it look like badly mixed black currant ice cream 
 
 writing to him are you said uncle vernon in a calm voice but harry had seen the pupils of his tiny eyes contract with sudden fear 
 
 well yeah said harry casually been a while since he heard from me and you know if he he might start thinking wrong 
 
 he stopped there to enjoy the effect of these words he could almost see the cogs working under uncle thick dark neatly parted hair if he tried to stop harry writing to sirius sirius would think harry was being mistreated if he told harry he go to the quidditch world cup harry would write and tell sirius who would know harry was being mistreated there was only one thing for uncle vernon to do harry could see the conclusion forming in his mind as though the great mustached face were transparent harry tried not to smile to keep his own face as blank as possible and then 
 
 well all right then you can go to this ruddythis stupidthis world cup thing you write and tell these these weasleys to pick you up mind i got time to go dropping you off all over the country and you can spend the rest of the summer there and you can tell your your godfathertell himtell him going 
 
 okay then said harry brightly 
 
 he turned and walked toward the living room door fighting the urge to jump into the air and whoop he was goinghe was going to the weasleys he was going to watch the quidditch world cup 
 
 outside in the hall he nearly ran into dudley who had been lurking behind the door clearly hoping to overhear harry being told off he looked shocked to see the broad grin on face 
 
 that was an excellent breakfast it said harry i feel really full you 
 
 laughing at the astonished look on face harry took the stairs three at a time and hurled himself back into his bedroom 
 
 the first thing he saw was that hedwig was back she was sitting in her cage staring at harry with her enormous amber eyes and clicking her beak in the way that meant she was annoyed about something exactly what was annoying her became apparent almost at once 
 
 ouch said harry as what appeared to be a small gray feathery tennis ball collided with the side of his head harry massaged the spot furiously looking up to see what had hit him and saw a minute owl small enough to fit into the palm of his hand whizzing excitedly around the room like a loose firework harry then realized that the owl had dropped a letter at his feet harry bent down recognized handwriting then tore open the envelope inside was a hastily scribbled note

lionfish nov chapter three the advance guardcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 just been attacked by dementors and i might be expelled from hogwarts i want to know going on and when going to get out of here 
 
 harry copied these words on to three separate pieces of parchment the moment he reached the desk in his dark bedroom he addressed the first to sirius the second to ron and the third to hermione his owl hedwig was off hunting her cage stood empty on the desk harry paced the bedroom waiting for her to come back his head pounding his brain too busy for sleep even though his eyes stung and itched with tiredness his back ached from hauling dudley home and the two lumps on his head where the window and dudley had hit him were throbbing painfully 
 
 up and down he paced consumed with anger and frustration grinding his teeth and clenching his fists casting angry looks out at the empty sky every time he passed the window dementors sent to get him mrs figg and mundungus fletcher tailing him in secret then suspension from hogwarts and a hearing at the ministry of magicand still no one was telling him what was going on 
 
 and what what had that howler been about whose voice had echoed so horribly so menacingly through the kitchen 
 
 why was he still trapped here without information why was everyone treating him like some naughty kid do any more magic stay in the house 
 
 he kicked his school trunk as he passed it but far from relieving his anger he felt worse as he now had a sharp pain in his toe to deal with in addition to the pain in the rest of his body 
 
 just as he limped past the window hedwig soared through it with a soft rustle of wings like a small ghost 
 
 about time harry snarled as she landed lightly on top of her cage you can put that down got work for you 
 
 large round amber eyes gazed at him reproachfully over the dead frog clamped in her beak 
 
 come here said harry picking up the three small rolls of parchment and a leather thong and tying the scrolls to her scaly leg take these straight to sirius ron and hermione and come back here without good long replies keep pecking them till written answers if got to understand 
 
 hedwig gave a muffled hooting noise her beak still full of frog 
 
 get going then said harry 
 
 she took off immediately the moment gone harry threw himself down on his bed without undressing and stared at the dark ceiling in addition to every other miserable feeling he now felt guilty that been irritable with hedwig she was the only friend he had at number four privet drive but make it up to her when she came back with the answers from sirius ron and hermione 
 
 they were bound to write back quickly they possibly ignore a dementor attack probably wake up tomorrow to three fat letters full of sympathy and plans for his immediate removal to the burrow and with that comforting idea sleep rolled over him stifling all further thought 
 
 
 
 
 but hedwig return next morning harry spent the day in his bedroom leaving it only to go to the bathroom three times that day aunt petunia shoved food into his room through the uncle vernon had installed three summers ago every time harry heard her approaching he tried to question her about the howler but he might as well have interrogated the doorknob for all the answers he got otherwise the dursleys kept well clear of his bedroom harry see the point of forcing his company on them another row would achieve nothing except perhaps make him so angry perform more illegal magic 
 
 so it went on for three whole days harry was alternately filled with restless energy that made him unable to settle to anything during which time he paced his bedroom furious at the whole lot of them for leaving him to stew in this mess and with a lethargy so complete that he could lie on his bed for an hour at a time staring dazedly into space aching with dread at the thought of the ministry hearing 
 
 what if they ruled against him what if he was expelled and his wand was snapped in half what would he do where would he go he could not return to living with the dursleys not now he knew the other world the one to which he really belonged might he be able to move into house as sirius had suggested a year ago before he had been forced to flee from the ministry would harry be allowed to live there alone given that he was still underage or would the matter of where he went next be decided for him had his breach of the international statute of secrecy been severe enough to land him in a cell in azkaban whenever this thought occurred harry invariably slid off his bed and began pacing again 
 
 on the fourth night after departure harry was lying in one of his apathetic phases staring at the ceiling his exhausted mind quite blank when his uncle entered his bedroom harry looked slowly around at him uncle vernon was wearing his best suit and an expression of enormous smugness 
 
 going out he said 
 
 sorry 
 
 wethat is to say your aunt dudley and iare going out 
 
 fine said harry dully looking back at the ceiling 
 
 you are not to leave your bedroom while we are away 
 
 ok 
 
 you are not to touch the television the stereo or any of our possessions 
 
 right 
 
 you are not to steal food from the fridge 
 
 ok 
 
 i am going to lock your door 
 
 you do that 
 
 uncle vernon glared at harry clearly suspicious of this lack of argument then stomped out of the room and closed the door behind him harry heard the key turn in the lock and uncle footsteps walking heavily down the stairs a few minutes later he heard the slamming of car doors the rumble of an engine and the unmistakeable sound of the car sweeping out of the drive 
 
 harry had no particular feeling about the dursleys leaving it made no difference to him whether they were in the house or not he could not even summon the energy to get up and turn on his bedroom light the room grew steadily darker around him as he lay listening to the night sounds through the window he kept open all the time waiting for the blessed moment when hedwig returned 
 
 the empty house creaked around him the pipes gurgled harry lay there in a kind of stupor thinking of nothing suspended in misery 
 
 then quite distinctly he heard a crash in the kitchen below 
 
 he sat bolt upright listening intently the dursleys be back it was much too soon and in any case he heard their car 
 
 there was silence for a few seconds then voices 
 
 burglars he thought sliding off the bed on to his feetbut a split second later it occurred to him that burglars would keep their voices down and whoever was moving around in the kitchen was certainly not troubling to do so 
 
 he snatched up his wand from the bedside table and stood facing his bedroom door listening with all his might next moment he jumped as the lock gave a loud click and his door swung open 
 
 harry stood motionless staring through the open doorway at the dark upstairs landing straining his ears for further sounds but none came he hesitated for a moment then moved swiftly and silently out of his room to the head of the stairs 
 
 his heart shot upwards into his throat there were people standing in the shadowy hall below silhouetted against the streetlight glowing through the glass door eight or nine of them all as far as he could see looking up at him 
 
 lower your wand boy before you take eye out said a low growling voice 
 
 heart was thumping uncontrollably he knew that voice but he did not lower his wand 
 
 professor moody he said uncertainly 
 
 i know so much about professor growled the voice never got round to much teaching did i get down here we want to see you properly 
 
 harry lowered his wand slightly but did not relax his grip on it nor did he move he had very good reason to be suspicious he had recently spent nine months in what he had thought was company only to find out that it moody at all but an impostor an impostor moreover who 
 
 all right harry come to take you away 
 
 heart leapt he knew that voice too though he heard it for over a year 
 
 lupin he said disbelievingly is that you 
 
 why are we all standing in the dark said a third voice this one completely unfamiliar a lumos 
 
 a flared illuminating the hall with magical light harry blinked the people below were crowded around the foot of the stairs gazing up at him intently some craning their heads for a better look 
 
 remus lupin stood nearest to him though still quite young lupin looked tired and rather ill he had more grey hairs than when harry had last said to him and his robes were more patched and shabbier than ever nevertheless he was smiling broadly at harry who tried to smile back despite his state of shock 
 
 oooh he looks just like i thought he would said the witch who was holding her lit wand aloft she looked the youngest there she had a pale face dark twinkling eyes and short spiky hair that was a violent shade of violet wotcher harry 
 
 yeah i see what you mean remus said a bald black wizard standing furthest back he had a deep slow voice and wore a single gold hoop in his ear he looks exactly like james 
 
 except the eyes said a wizard at the back eyes 
 
 moody who had long grizzled grey hair and a large chunk missing from his nose was squinting suspiciously at harry through his mismatched eyes one eye was small dark and beady the other large round and electric bluethe magical eye that could see through walls doors and the back of own head 
 
 are you quite sure him lupin he growled be a nice lookout if we bring back some death eater impersonating him we ought to ask him something only the real potter would know unless anyone brought any veritaserum 
 
 harry what form does your patronus take lupin asked 
 
 a stag said harry nervously 
 
 him said lupin 
 
 very conscious of everybody still staring at him harry descended the stairs stowing his wand in the back pocket of his jeans as he came 
 
 put your wand there boy roared moody what if it ignited better wizards than you have lost buttocks you know 
 
 who know lost a buttock the woman asked interestedly 
 
 never you mind you just keep your wand out of your back pocket growled elementary nobody bothers about it any more he stumped off towards the kitchen and i saw that he added irritably as the woman rolled her eyes towards the ceiling 
 
 lupin held out his hand and shook 
 
 how are you he asked looking closely at harry 
 
 
 
 harry could hardly believe this was real four weeks with nothing not the tiniest hint of a plan to remove him from privet drive and suddenly a whole bunch of wizards was standing in the house as though this was a arrangement he glanced at the people surrounding lupin they were still gazing avidly at him he felt very conscious of the fact that he had not combed his hair for four days 
 
 really lucky the dursleys are out he mumbled 
 
 lucky ha said the woman it was me who lured them out of the way sent a letter by muggle post telling them been for the best kept suburban lawn competition heading off to the right now or they think they are 
 
 harry had a fleeting vision of uncle face when he realised there was no best kept suburban lawn competition 
 
 we are leaving we he asked soon 
 
 almost at once said lupin just waiting for the 
 
 where are we going the burrow harry asked hopefully 
 
 not the burrow no said lupin motioning harry towards the kitchen the little knot of wizards followed all still eyeing harry curiously too risky set up headquarters somewhere taken a while 
 
 moody was now sitting at the kitchen table swigging from a hip flask his magical eye spinning in all directions taking in the dursleys many appliances 
 
 this is alastor moody harry lupin continued pointing towards moody 
 
 yeah i know said harry uncomfortably it felt odd to be introduced to somebody thought known for a year 
 
 and this is nymphadora 
 
 call me nymphadora remus said the young witch with a shudder tonks 
 
 nymphadora tonks who prefers to be known by her surname only finished lupin 
 
 so would you if your fool of a mother had called you nymphadora muttered tonks 
 
 and this is kingsley indicated the tall black wizard who wizard diggle 
 
 met before squeaked the excitable diggle dropping his top hat 
 
 emmeline witch in an emerald green shawl inclined her wizard with thick hair hestia jones a witch waved from next to the toaster 
 
 harry inclined his head awkwardly at each of them as they were introduced he wished they would look at something other than him it was as though he had suddenly been ushered he also wondered why so many of them were there 
 
 a surprising number of people volunteered to come and get you said lupin as though he had read mind the corners of his mouth twitched slightly 
 
 yeah well the more the better said moody darkly your guard potter 
 
 just waiting for the signal to tell us safe to set off said lupin glancing out of the kitchen window got about fifteen minutes 
 
 very clean they these muggles said the witch called tonks who was looking around the kitchen with great interest my and a right old slob i suppose it varies just as it does with wizards 
 
 eryeah said harry turned back to going on i heard anything from anyone vol 
 
 several of the witches and wizards made odd hissing noises dedalus diggle dropped his hat again and moody growled shut up 
 
 what said harry 
 
 not discussing anything here too risky said moody turning his normal eye on harry his magical eye remained focused on the ceiling damn it he added angrily putting a hand up to the magical eye it keeps getting stuckever since that scum wore it 
 
 and with a nasty squelching sound much like a plunger being pulled from a sink he popped out his eye 
 
 you do know disgusting you said tonks conversationally 
 
 get me a glass of water would you harry requested moody 
 
 harry crossed to the dishwasher took out a clean glass and filled it with water at the sink still watched eagerly by the band of wizards their relentless staring was starting to annoy him 
 
 cheers said moody when harry handed him the glass he dropped the magical eyeball into the water and prodded it up and down the eye whizzed around staring at them all in turn i want three hundred and sixty degrees visibility on the return journey 
 
 we gettingwherever going harry asked 
 
 brooms said lupin only way too young to apparate be watching the floo network and more than our worth to set up an unauthorised portkey 
 
 remus says a good flier said kingsley shacklebolt in his deep voice 
 
 excellent said lupin who was checking his watch anyway better go and get packed harry we want to be ready to go when the signal comes 
 
 come and help you said tonks brightly 
 
 she followed harry back into the hall and up the stairs looking around with much curiosity and interest 
 
 funny place she said a bit too clean know what i mean bit unnatural oh this is better she added as they entered bedroom and he turned on the light 
 
 his room was certainly much messier than the rest of the house confined to it for four days in a very bad mood harry had not bothered tidying up after himself most of the books he owned were strewn over the floor where tried to distract himself with each in turn and thrown it aside cage needed cleaning out and was starting to smell and his trunk lay open revealing a jumbled mixture of muggle clothes and wizards robes that had spilled on to the floor around it 
 
 harry started picking up books and throwing them hastily into his trunk tonks paused at his open wardrobe to look critically at her reflection in the mirror on the inside of the door 
 
 you know i think really my colour she said pensively tugging at a lock of spiky hair think it makes me look a bit peaky 
 
 er said harry looking up at her over the top of quidditch teams of britain and ireland 
 
 yeah it does said tonks decisively she screwed up her eyes in a strained expression as though she was struggling to remember something a second later her hair had turned pink 
 
 how did you do that said harry gaping at her as she opened her eyes again 
 
 a metamorphmagus she said looking back at her reflection and turning her head so that she could see her hair from all directions it means i can change my appearance at will she added spotting puzzled expression in the mirror behind her i was born one i got top marks in concealment and disguise during auror training without any study at all it was great 
 
 an auror said harry impressed being a was the only career ever considered after hogwarts 
 
 yeah said tonks looking proud kingsley is as well a bit higher up than me though i only qualified a year ago nearly failed on stealth and tracking dead clumsy did you hear me break that plate when we arrived downstairs 
 
 can you learn how to be a metamorphmagus harry asked her straightening up completely forgetting about packing 
 
 tonks chuckled 
 
 bet you mind hiding that scar sometimes eh 
 
 her eyes found the scar on forehead 
 
 no i mind harry mumbled turning away he did not like people staring at his scar 
 
 well have to learn the hard way afraid said tonks metamorphmagi are really rare born not made most wizards need to use a wand or potions to change their appearance but got to get going harry supposed to be packing she added guiltily looking around at all the mess on the floor 
 
 ohyeah said harry grabbing a few more books 
 
 be stupid be much quicker if ipack cried tonks waving her wand in a long sweeping movement over the floor 
 
 books clothes telescope and scales all soared into the air and flew into the trunk 
 
 not very neat said tonks walking over to the trunk and looking down at the jumble inside my got this knack of getting stuff to fit itself in neatlyshe even gets the socks to fold themselvesbut never mastered how she does a kind of flick she flicked her wand hopefully 
 
 one of socks gave a feeble sort of wiggle and flopped back on top of the mess in the trunk 
 
 ah well said tonks slamming the lid shut at least all in that could do with a bit of cleaning too she pointed her wand at cage scourgify a few feathers and droppings vanished well a bit better never quite got the hang of these householdy sort of spells rightgot everything cauldron broom wow a firebolt 
 
 her eyes widened as they fell on the broomstick in right hand it was his pride and joy a gift from sirius an broomstick 
 
 and still riding a comet two sixty said tonks enviously ah well wand still in your jeans both buttocks still on ok go locomotor trunk 
 
 trunk rose a few inches into the air holding her wand like a conductors baton tonks made the trunk hover across the room and out of the door ahead of them cage in her left hand harry followed her down the stairs carrying his broomstick 
 
 back in the kitchen moody had replaced his eye which was spinning so fast after its cleaning it made harry feel sick to look at it kingsley shacklebolt and sturgis podmore were examining the microwave and hestia jones was laughing at a potato peeler she had come across while rummaging in the drawers lupin was sealing a letter addressed to the dursleys 
 
 excellent said lupin looking up as tonks and harry entered got about a minute i think we should probably get out into the garden so ready harry left a letter telling your aunt and uncle not to worry 
 
 they said harry 
 
 that safe 
 
 just depress them 
 
 and see them next summer 
 
 do i have to 
 
 lupin smiled but made no answer 
 
 come here boy said moody gruffly beckoning harry towards him with his wand i need to disillusion you 
 
 you need to what said harry nervously 
 
 disillusionment charm said moody raising his wand lupin says got an invisibility cloak but it stay on while flying disguise you better here you go 
 
 he rapped him hard on the top of the head and harry felt a curious sensation as though moody had just smashed an egg there cold trickles seemed to be running down his body from the point the wand had struck 
 
 nice one said tonks appreciatively staring at midriff 
 
 harry looked down at his body or rather what had been his body for it look anything like his any more it was not invisible it had simply taken on the exact colour and texture of the kitchen unit behind him he seemed to have become a human chameleon 
 
 come on said moody unlocking the back door with his wand 
 
 they all stepped outside on to uncle beautifully kept lawn 
 
 clear night grunted moody his magical eye scanning the heavens done with a bit more cloud cover right you he barked at harry going to be flying in close formation be right in front of you keep close on her tail be covering you from below going to be behind you the be circling us we break ranks for anything got me if one of us is killed 
 
 is that likely harry asked apprehensively but moody ignored him 
 
 the others keep flying stop break ranks if they take out all of us and you survive harry the rear guard are standing by to take over keep flying east and join you 
 
 stop being so cheerful think not taking this seriously said tonks as she strapped trunk and cage into a harness hanging from her broom 
 
 just telling the boy the plan growled moody our to deliver him safely to headquarters and if we die in the attempt 
 
 no going to die said kingsley shacklebolt in his deep calming voice 
 
 mount your brooms the first signal said lupin sharply pointing into the sky 
 
 far far above them a shower of bright red sparks had flared among the stars harry recognised them at once as wand sparks he swung his right leg over his firebolt gripped its handle tightly and felt it vibrating very slightly as though it was as keen as he was to be up in the air once more 
 
 second signal go said lupin loudly as more sparks green this time exploded high above them 
 
 harry kicked off hard from the ground the cool night air rushed through his hair as the neat square gardens of privet drive fell away shrinking rapidly into a patchwork of dark greens and blacks and every thought of the ministry hearing was swept from his mind as though the rush of air had blown it out of his head he felt as though his heart was going to explode with pleasure he was flying again flying away from privet drive as been fantasising about all summer he was going home for a few glorious moments all his problems seemed to recede to nothing insignificant in the vast starry sky 
 
 hard left hard left a muggle looking up shouted moody from behind him tonks swerved and harry followed her watching his trunk swinging wildly beneath her broom we need more height give it another quarter of a mile 
 
 eyes watered in the chill as they soared upwards he could see nothing below now but tiny pinpricks of light that were car headlights and streetlamps two of those tiny lights might belong to uncle car the dursleys would be heading back to their empty house right now full of rage about the nonexistent lawn competition and harry laughed aloud at the thought though his voice was drowned by the flapping robes of the others the creaking of the harness holding his trunk and the cage and the whoosh of the wind in their ears as they sped through the air he had not felt this alive in a month or this happy 
 
 bearing south shouted town ahead 
 
 they soared right to avoid passing directly over the glittering spiderweb of lights below 
 
 bear southeast and keep climbing some low cloud ahead we can lose ourselves in called moody 
 
 not going through clouds shouted tonks angrily get soaked 
 
 harry was relieved to hear her say this his hands were growing numb on the handle he wished he had thought to put on a coat he was starting to shiver 
 
 they altered their course every now and then according to instructions eyes were screwed up against the rush of icy wind that was starting to make his ears ache he could remember being this cold on a broom only once before during the quidditch match against hufflepuff in his third year which had taken place in a storm the guard around him was circling continuously like giant birds of prey harry lost track of time he wondered how long they had been flying it felt like an hour at least 
 
 turning southwest yelled moody we want to avoid the motorway 
 
 harry was now so chilled he thought longingly of the snug dry interiors of the cars streaming along below then even more longingly of travelling by floo powder it might be uncomfortable to spin around in fireplaces but it was at least warm in the flames kingsley shacklebolt swooped around him bald pate and earring gleaming slightly in the moonlight now emmeline vance was on his right her wand out her head turning left and right then she too swooped over him to be replaced by sturgis podmore 
 
 we ought to double back for a bit just to make sure not being followed moody shouted 
 
 are you mad tonks screamed from the front all frozen to our brooms if we keep going not going to get there until next week besides nearly there now 
 
 time to start the descent came voice follow tonks harry 
 
 harry followed tonks into a dive they were heading for the largest collection of lights he had yet seen a huge sprawling crisscrossing mass glittering in lines and grids interspersed with patches of deepest black lower and lower they flew until harry could see individual headlights and streetlamps chimneys and television aerials he wanted to reach the ground very much though he felt sure someone would have to unfreeze him from his broom 
 
 here we go called tonks and a few seconds later she had landed 
 
 harry touched down right behind her and dismounted on a patch of unkempt grass in the middle of a small square tonks was already unbuckling trunk shivering harry looked around the grimy fronts of the surrounding houses were not welcoming some of them had broken windows glimmering dully in the light from the streetlamps paint was peeling from many of the doors and heaps of rubbish lay outside several sets of front steps 
 
 where are we harry asked but lupin said quietly in a minute 
 
 moody was rummaging in his cloak his gnarled hands clumsy with cold 
 
 got it he muttered raising what looked like a silver cigarette lighter into the air and clicking it 
 
 the nearest streetlamp went out with a pop he clicked the unlighter again the next lamp went out he kept clicking until every lamp in the square was extinguished and the only remaining light came from curtained windows and the sickle moon overhead 
 
 borrowed it from dumbledore growled moody pocketing the take care of any muggles looking out of the window see now come on quick 
 
 he took harry by the arm and led him from the patch of grass across the road and on to the pavement lupin and tonks followed carrying trunk between them the rest of the guard all with their wands out flanking them 
 
 the muffled pounding of a stereo was coming from an upper window in the nearest house a pungent smell of rotting rubbish came from the pile of bulging just inside the broken gate 
 
 here moody muttered thrusting a piece of parchment towards disillusioned hand and holding his lit wand close to it so as to illuminate the writing read quickly and memorise 
 
 harry looked down at the piece of paper the narrow handwriting was vaguely familiar it said 
 
 the headquarters of the order of the phoenix may be found at number twelve grimmauld place london 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter three the advance guardcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 just been attacked by dementors and i might be expelled from hogwarts i want to know going on and when going to get out of here 
 
 harry copied these words on to three separate pieces of parchment the moment he reached the desk in his dark bedroom he addressed the first to sirius the second to ron and the third to hermione his owl hedwig was off hunting her cage stood empty on the desk harry paced the bedroom waiting for her to come back his head pounding his brain too busy for sleep even though his eyes stung and itched with tiredness his back ached from hauling dudley home and the two lumps on his head where the window and dudley had hit him were throbbing painfully 
 
 up and down he paced consumed with anger and frustration grinding his teeth and clenching his fists casting angry looks out at the empty sky every time he passed the window dementors sent to get him mrs figg and mundungus fletcher tailing him in secret then suspension from hogwarts and a hearing at the ministry of magicand still no one was telling him what was going on 
 
 and what what had that howler been about whose voice had echoed so horribly so menacingly through the kitchen 
 
 why was he still trapped here without information why was everyone treating him like some naughty kid do any more magic stay in the house 
 
 he kicked his school trunk as he passed it but far from relieving his anger he felt worse as he now had a sharp pain in his toe to deal with in addition to the pain in the rest of his body 
 
 just as he limped past the window hedwig soared through it with a soft rustle of wings like a small ghost 
 
 about time harry snarled as she landed lightly on top of her cage you can put that down got work for you 
 
 large round amber eyes gazed at him reproachfully over the dead frog clamped in her beak 
 
 come here said harry picking up the three small rolls of parchment and a leather thong and tying the scrolls to her scaly leg take these straight to sirius ron and hermione and come back here without good long replies keep pecking them till written answers if got to understand 
 
 hedwig gave a muffled hooting noise her beak still full of frog 
 
 get going then said harry 
 
 she took off immediately the moment gone harry threw himself down on his bed without undressing and stared at the dark ceiling in addition to every other miserable feeling he now felt guilty that been irritable with hedwig she was the only friend he had at number four privet drive but make it up to her when she came back with the answers from sirius ron and hermione 
 
 they were bound to write back quickly they possibly ignore a dementor attack probably wake up tomorrow to three fat letters full of sympathy and plans for his immediate removal to the burrow and with that comforting idea sleep rolled over him stifling all further thought 
 
 
 
 
 but hedwig return next morning harry spent the day in his bedroom leaving it only to go to the bathroom three times that day aunt petunia shoved food into his room through the uncle vernon had installed three summers ago every time harry heard her approaching he tried to question her about the howler but he might as well have interrogated the doorknob for all the answers he got otherwise the dursleys kept well clear of his bedroom harry see the point of forcing his company on them another row would achieve nothing except perhaps make him so angry perform more illegal magic 
 
 so it went on for three whole days harry was alternately filled with restless energy that made him unable to settle to anything during which time he paced his bedroom furious at the whole lot of them for leaving him to stew in this mess and with a lethargy so complete that he could lie on his bed for an hour at a time staring dazedly into space aching with dread at the thought of the ministry hearing 
 
 what if they ruled against him what if he was expelled and his wand was snapped in half what would he do where would he go he could not return to living with the dursleys not now he knew the other world the one to which he really belonged might he be able to move into house as sirius had suggested a year ago before he had been forced to flee from the ministry would harry be allowed to live there alone given that he was still underage or would the matter of where he went next be decided for him had his breach of the international statute of secrecy been severe enough to land him in a cell in azkaban whenever this thought occurred harry invariably slid off his bed and began pacing again 
 
 on the fourth night after departure harry was lying in one of his apathetic phases staring at the ceiling his exhausted mind quite blank when his uncle entered his bedroom harry looked slowly around at him uncle vernon was wearing his best suit and an expression of enormous smugness 
 
 going out he said 
 
 sorry 
 
 wethat is to say your aunt dudley and iare going out 
 
 fine said harry dully looking back at the ceiling 
 
 you are not to leave your bedroom while we are away 
 
 ok 
 
 you are not to touch the television the stereo or any of our possessions 
 
 right 
 
 you are not to steal food from the fridge 
 
 ok 
 
 i am going to lock your door 
 
 you do that 
 
 uncle vernon glared at harry clearly suspicious of this lack of argument then stomped out of the room and closed the door behind him harry heard the key turn in the lock and uncle footsteps walking heavily down the stairs a few minutes later he heard the slamming of car doors the rumble of an engine and the unmistakeable sound of the car sweeping out of the drive 
 
 harry had no particular feeling about the dursleys leaving it made no difference to him whether they were in the house or not he could not even summon the energy to get up and turn on his bedroom light the room grew steadily darker around him as he lay listening to the night sounds through the window he kept open all the time waiting for the blessed moment when hedwig returned 
 
 the empty house creaked around him the pipes gurgled harry lay there in a kind of stupor thinking of nothing suspended in misery 
 
 then quite distinctly he heard a crash in the kitchen below 
 
 he sat bolt upright listening intently the dursleys be back it was much too soon and in any case he heard their car 
 
 there was silence for a few seconds then voices 
 
 burglars he thought sliding off the bed on to his feetbut a split second later it occurred to him that burglars would keep their voices down and whoever was moving around in the kitchen was certainly not troubling to do so 
 
 he snatched up his wand from the bedside table and stood facing his bedroom door listening with all his might next moment he jumped as the lock gave a loud click and his door swung open 
 
 harry stood motionless staring through the open doorway at the dark upstairs landing straining his ears for further sounds but none came he hesitated for a moment then moved swiftly and silently out of his room to the head of the stairs 
 
 his heart shot upwards into his throat there were people standing in the shadowy hall below silhouetted against the streetlight glowing through the glass door eight or nine of them all as far as he could see looking up at him 
 
 lower your wand boy before you take eye out said a low growling voice 
 
 heart was thumping uncontrollably he knew that voice but he did not lower his wand 
 
 professor moody he said uncertainly 
 
 i know so much about professor growled the voice never got round to much teaching did i get down here we want to see you properly 
 
 harry lowered his wand slightly but did not relax his grip on it nor did he move he had very good reason to be suspicious he had recently spent nine months in what he had thought was company only to find out that it moody at all but an impostor an impostor moreover who 
 
 all right harry come to take you away 
 
 heart leapt he knew that voice too though he heard it for over a year 
 
 lupin he said disbelievingly is that you 
 
 why are we all standing in the dark said a third voice this one completely unfamiliar a lumos 
 
 a flared illuminating the hall with magical light harry blinked the people below were crowded around the foot of the stairs gazing up at him intently some craning their heads for a better look 
 
 remus lupin stood nearest to him though still quite young lupin looked tired and rather ill he had more grey hairs than when harry had last said to him and his robes were more patched and shabbier than ever nevertheless he was smiling broadly at harry who tried to smile back despite his state of shock 
 
 oooh he looks just like i thought he would said the witch who was holding her lit wand aloft she looked the youngest there she had a pale face dark twinkling eyes and short spiky hair that was a violent shade of violet wotcher harry 
 
 yeah i see what you mean remus said a bald black wizard standing furthest back he had a deep slow voice and wore a single gold hoop in his ear he looks exactly like james 
 
 except the eyes said a wizard at the back eyes 
 
 moody who had long grizzled grey hair and a large chunk missing from his nose was squinting suspiciously at harry through his mismatched eyes one eye was small dark and beady the other large round and electric bluethe magical eye that could see through walls doors and the back of own head 
 
 are you quite sure him lupin he growled be a nice lookout if we bring back some death eater impersonating him we ought to ask him something only the real potter would know unless anyone brought any veritaserum 
 
 harry what form does your patronus take lupin asked 
 
 a stag said harry nervously 
 
 him said lupin 
 
 very conscious of everybody still staring at him harry descended the stairs stowing his wand in the back pocket of his jeans as he came 
 
 put your wand there boy roared moody what if it ignited better wizards than you have lost buttocks you know 
 
 who know lost a buttock the woman asked interestedly 
 
 never you mind you just keep your wand out of your back pocket growled elementary nobody bothers about it any more he stumped off towards the kitchen and i saw that he added irritably as the woman rolled her eyes towards the ceiling 
 
 lupin held out his hand and shook 
 
 how are you he asked looking closely at harry 
 
 
 
 harry could hardly believe this was real four weeks with nothing not the tiniest hint of a plan to remove him from privet drive and suddenly a whole bunch of wizards was standing in the house as though this was a arrangement he glanced at the people surrounding lupin they were still gazing avidly at him he felt very conscious of the fact that he had not combed his hair for four days 
 
 really lucky the dursleys are out he mumbled 
 
 lucky ha said the woman it was me who lured them out of the way sent a letter by muggle post telling them been for the best kept suburban lawn competition heading off to the right now or they think they are 
 
 harry had a fleeting vision of uncle face when he realised there was no best kept suburban lawn competition 
 
 we are leaving we he asked soon 
 
 almost at once said lupin just waiting for the 
 
 where are we going the burrow harry asked hopefully 
 
 not the burrow no said lupin motioning harry towards the kitchen the little knot of wizards followed all still eyeing harry curiously too risky set up headquarters somewhere taken a while 
 
 moody was now sitting at the kitchen table swigging from a hip flask his magical eye spinning in all directions taking in the dursleys many appliances 
 
 this is alastor moody harry lupin continued pointing towards moody 
 
 yeah i know said harry uncomfortably it felt odd to be introduced to somebody thought known for a year 
 
 and this is nymphadora 
 
 call me nymphadora remus said the young witch with a shudder tonks 
 
 nymphadora tonks who prefers to be known by her surname only finished lupin 
 
 so would you if your fool of a mother had called you nymphadora muttered tonks 
 
 and this is kingsley indicated the tall black wizard who wizard diggle 
 
 met before squeaked the excitable diggle dropping his top hat 
 
 emmeline witch in an emerald green shawl inclined her wizard with thick hair hestia jones a witch waved from next to the toaster 
 
 harry inclined his head awkwardly at each of them as they were introduced he wished they would look at something other than him it was as though he had suddenly been ushered he also wondered why so many of them were there 
 
 a surprising number of people volunteered to come and get you said lupin as though he had read mind the corners of his mouth twitched slightly 
 
 yeah well the more the better said moody darkly your guard potter 
 
 just waiting for the signal to tell us safe to set off said lupin glancing out of the kitchen window got about fifteen minutes 
 
 very clean they these muggles said the witch called tonks who was looking around the kitchen with great interest my and a right old slob i suppose it varies just as it does with wizards 
 
 eryeah said harry turned back to going on i heard anything from anyone vol 
 
 several of the witches and wizards made odd hissing noises dedalus diggle dropped his hat again and moody growled shut up 
 
 what said harry 
 
 not discussing anything here too risky said moody turning his normal eye on harry his magical eye remained focused on the ceiling damn it he added angrily putting a hand up to the magical eye it keeps getting stuckever since that scum wore it 
 
 and with a nasty squelching sound much like a plunger being pulled from a sink he popped out his eye 
 
 you do know disgusting you said tonks conversationally 
 
 get me a glass of water would you harry requested moody 
 
 harry crossed to the dishwasher took out a clean glass and filled it with water at the sink still watched eagerly by the band of wizards their relentless staring was starting to annoy him 
 
 cheers said moody when harry handed him the glass he dropped the magical eyeball into the water and prodded it up and down the eye whizzed around staring at them all in turn i want three hundred and sixty degrees visibility on the return journey 
 
 we gettingwherever going harry asked 
 
 brooms said lupin only way too young to apparate be watching the floo network and more than our worth to set up an unauthorised portkey 
 
 remus says a good flier said kingsley shacklebolt in his deep voice 
 
 excellent said lupin who was checking his watch anyway better go and get packed harry we want to be ready to go when the signal comes 
 
 come and help you said tonks brightly 
 
 she followed harry back into the hall and up the stairs looking around with much curiosity and interest 
 
 funny place she said a bit too clean know what i mean bit unnatural oh this is better she added as they entered bedroom and he turned on the light 
 
 his room was certainly much messier than the rest of the house confined to it for four days in a very bad mood harry had not bothered tidying up after himself most of the books he owned were strewn over the floor where tried to distract himself with each in turn and thrown it aside cage needed cleaning out and was starting to smell and his trunk lay open revealing a jumbled mixture of muggle clothes and wizards robes that had spilled on to the floor around it 
 
 harry started picking up books and throwing them hastily into his trunk tonks paused at his open wardrobe to look critically at her reflection in the mirror on the inside of the door 
 
 you know i think really my colour she said pensively tugging at a lock of spiky hair think it makes me look a bit peaky 
 
 er said harry looking up at her over the top of quidditch teams of britain and ireland 
 
 yeah it does said tonks decisively she screwed up her eyes in a strained expression as though she was struggling to remember something a second later her hair had turned pink 
 
 how did you do that said harry gaping at her as she opened her eyes again 
 
 a metamorphmagus she said looking back at her reflection and turning her head so that she could see her hair from all directions it means i can change my appearance at will she added spotting puzzled expression in the mirror behind her i was born one i got top marks in concealment and disguise during auror training without any study at all it was great 
 
 an auror said harry impressed being a was the only career ever considered after hogwarts 
 
 yeah said tonks looking proud kingsley is as well a bit higher up than me though i only qualified a year ago nearly failed on stealth and tracking dead clumsy did you hear me break that plate when we arrived downstairs 
 
 can you learn how to be a metamorphmagus harry asked her straightening up completely forgetting about packing 
 
 tonks chuckled 
 
 bet you mind hiding that scar sometimes eh 
 
 her eyes found the scar on forehead 
 
 no i mind harry mumbled turning away he did not like people staring at his scar 
 
 well have to learn the hard way afraid said tonks metamorphmagi are really rare born not made most wizards need to use a wand or potions to change their appearance but got to get going harry supposed to be packing she added guiltily looking around at all the mess on the floor 
 
 ohyeah said harry grabbing a few more books 
 
 be stupid be much quicker if ipack cried tonks waving her wand in a long sweeping movement over the floor 
 
 books clothes telescope and scales all soared into the air and flew into the trunk 
 
 not very neat said tonks walking over to the trunk and looking down at the jumble inside my got this knack of getting stuff to fit itself in neatlyshe even gets the socks to fold themselvesbut never mastered how she does a kind of flick she flicked her wand hopefully 
 
 one of socks gave a feeble sort of wiggle and flopped back on top of the mess in the trunk 
 
 ah well said tonks slamming the lid shut at least all in that could do with a bit of cleaning too she pointed her wand at cage scourgify a few feathers and droppings vanished well a bit better never quite got the hang of these householdy sort of spells rightgot everything cauldron broom wow a firebolt 
 
 her eyes widened as they fell on the broomstick in right hand it was his pride and joy a gift from sirius an broomstick 
 
 and still riding a comet two sixty said tonks enviously ah well wand still in your jeans both buttocks still on ok go locomotor trunk 
 
 trunk rose a few inches into the air holding her wand like a conductors baton tonks made the trunk hover across the room and out of the door ahead of them cage in her left hand harry followed her down the stairs carrying his broomstick 
 
 back in the kitchen moody had replaced his eye which was spinning so fast after its cleaning it made harry feel sick to look at it kingsley shacklebolt and sturgis podmore were examining the microwave and hestia jones was laughing at a potato peeler she had come across while rummaging in the drawers lupin was sealing a letter addressed to the dursleys 
 
 excellent said lupin looking up as tonks and harry entered got about a minute i think we should probably get out into the garden so ready harry left a letter telling your aunt and uncle not to worry

 lupin smiled but made no answer

 disillusionment charm said moody raising his wand lupin says got an invisibility cloak but it stay on while flying disguise you better here you go 
 
 he rapped him hard on the top of the head and harry felt a curious sensation as though moody had just smashed an egg there cold trickles seemed to be running down his body from the point the wand had struck 
 
 nice one said tonks appreciatively staring at midriff 
 
 harry looked down at his body or rather what had been his body for it look anything like his any more it was not invisible it had simply taken on the exact colour and texture of the kitchen unit behind him he seemed to have become a human chameleon 
 
 come on said moody unlocking the back door with his wand 
 
 they all stepped outside on to uncle beautifully kept lawn

 turning southwest yelled moody we want to avoid the motorway 
 
 harry was now so chilled he thought longingly of the snug dry interiors of the cars streaming along below then even more longingly of travelling by floo powder it might be uncomfortable to spin around in fireplaces but it was at least warm in the flames kingsley shacklebolt swooped around him bald pate and earring gleaming slightly in the moonlight now emmeline vance was on his right her wand out her head turning left and right then she too swooped over him to be replaced by sturgis podmore 
 
 we ought to double back for a bit just to make sure not being followed moody shouted 
 
 are you mad tonks screamed from the front all frozen to our brooms if we keep going not going to get there until next week besides nearly there now 
 
 time to start the descent came voice follow tonks harry 
 
 harry followed tonks into a dive they were heading for the largest collection of lights he had yet seen a huge sprawling crisscrossing mass glittering in lines and grids interspersed with patches of deepest black lower and lower they flew until harry could see individual headlights and streetlamps chimneys and television aerials he wanted to reach the ground very much though he felt sure someone would have to unfreeze him from his broom 
 
 here we go called tonks and a few seconds later she had landed 
 
 harry touched down right behind her and dismounted on a patch of unkempt grass in the middle of a small square tonks was already unbuckling trunk shivering harry looked around the grimy fronts of the surrounding houses were not welcoming some of them had broken windows glimmering dully in the light from the streetlamps paint was peeling from many of the doors and heaps of rubbish lay outside several sets of front steps 
 
 where are we harry asked but lupin said quietly in a minute 
 
 moody was rummaging in his cloak his gnarled hands clumsy with cold 
 
 got it he muttered raising what looked like a silver cigarette lighter into the air and clicking it 
 
 the nearest streetlamp went out with a pop he clicked the unlighter again the next lamp went out he kept clicking until every lamp in the square was extinguished and the only remaining light came from curtained windows and the sickle moon overhead 
 
 borrowed it from dumbledore growled moody pocketing the take care of any muggles looking out of the window see now come on quick 
 
 he took harry by the arm and led him from the patch of grass across the road and on to the pavement lupin and tonks followed carrying trunk between them the rest of the guard all with their wands out flanking them 
 
 the muffled pounding of a stereo was coming from an upper window in the nearest house a pungent smell of rotting rubbish came from the pile of bulging just inside the broken gate 
 
 here moody muttered thrusting a piece of parchment towards disillusioned hand and holding his lit wand close to it so as to illuminate the writing read quickly and memorise 
 
 harry looked down at the piece of paper the narrow handwriting was vaguely familiar it said
