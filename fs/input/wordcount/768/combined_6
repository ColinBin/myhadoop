 the republic 
 by plato 
 translated by benjamin jowett 
 the introduction 
 
 the republic of plato is the longest of his works with the exceptionof the laws and is certainly the greatest of them there are nearerapproaches to modern metaphysics in the philebus and in the politicus or statesman is more ideal the form and institutions ofthe state are more clearly drawn out in the laws as works of art thesymposium and the protagoras are of higher excellence but no otherdialogue of plato has the same largeness of view and the sameperfection of style no other shows an equal knowledge of the contains more of those thoughts which are new as well as old andnot of one age only but of all nowhere in plato is there a deeperirony or a greater wealth of humor or imagery or more dramatic in any other of his writings is the attempt made to interweavelife and speculation or to connect politics with philosophy therepublic is the centre around which the other dialogues may begrouped here philosophy reaches the highest point to which ancientthinkers ever attained plato among the greeks like bacon among themoderns was the first who conceived a method of knowledge althoughneither of them always distinguished the bare outline or form from thesubstance of truth and both of them had to be content with anabstraction of science which was not yet realized he was the greatestmetaphysical genius whom the world has seen and in him more thanin any other ancient thinker the germs of future knowledge arecontained the sciences of logic and psychology which have suppliedso many instruments of thought to are based upon theanalyses of socrates and plato the principles of definition thelaw of contradiction the fallacy of arguing in a circle thedistinction between the essence and accidents of a thing or means and ends between causes and conditions also thedivision of the mind into the rational concupiscent and irascibleelements or of pleasures and desires into necessary and and other great forms of thought are all of them to be foundin the republic and were probably first invented by plato thegreatest of all logical truths and the one of which writers onphilosophy are most apt to lose sight the difference between wordsand things has been most strenuously insisted on by him althoughhe has not always avoided the confusion of them in his own he does not bind up truth in logical formulae logic is stillveiled in metaphysics and the science which he imagines all truth and all existence is very unlike thedoctrine of the syllogism which aristotle claims to have discovered 
 neither must we forget that the republic is but the third part ofa still larger design which was to have included an ideal history ofathens as well as a political and physical philosophy the fragmentof the critias has given birth to a fiction secondonly in importance to the tale of troy and the legend of arthur andis said as a fact to have inspired some of the early navigators of thesixteenth century this mythical tale of which the subject was ahistory of the wars of the athenians against the island of supposed to be founded upon an unfinished poem of solon to whichit would have stood in the same relation as the writings of thelogographers to the poems of homer it would have told of a strugglefor liberty intended to represent the conflict of persia andhellas we may judge from the noble commencement of the the fragment of the critias itself and from the third book ofthe laws in what manner plato would have treated this highargument we can only guess why the great design was because plato became sensible of some incongruity in afictitious history or because he had lost his interest in it orbecause advancing years forbade the completion of it and we mayplease ourselves with the fancy that had this imaginary narrative everbeen finished we should have found plato himself sympathizing withthe struggle for hellenic independence singing a hymn of triumph overmarathon and salamis perhaps making the reflection of herodotus wherehe contemplates the growth of the athenian brave athing is freedom of speech which has made the athenians so far exceedevery other state of hellas in greatness or more the victory to the ancient good order of athens and to thefavor of apollo and athene 
 again plato may be regarded as the captain arhchegoz orleader of a goodly band of followers for in the republic is to befound the original of de republica of st cityof god of the utopia of sir thomas more and of the numerous otherimaginary states which are framed upon the same model the extent towhich aristotle or the aristotelian school were indebted to him in thepolitics has been little recognized and the recognition is the morenecessary because it is not made by aristotle himself the twophilosophers had more in common than they were conscious of andprobably some elements of plato remain still undetected inaristotle in english philosophy too many affinities may be only in the works of the cambridge platonists but in greatoriginal writers like berkeley or coleridge to plato and his there is a truth higher than experience of which the mindbears witness to herself is a conviction which in our owngeneration has been enthusiastically asserted and is perhapsgaining ground of the greek authors who at the renaissance broughta new life into the world plato has had the greatest influence therepublic of plato is also the first treatise upon education ofwhich the writings of milton and locke rousseau jean paul andgoethe are the legitimate descendants like dante or bunyan he hasa revelation of another life like bacon he is profoundly impressedwith the un unity of knowledge in the early church he exercised areal influence on theology and at the revival of literature onpolitics even the fragments of his words when repeated have in all ages ravished the hearts of men who haveseen reflected in them their own higher nature he is the father ofidealism in philosophy in politics in literature and many of thelatest conceptions of modern thinkers and statesmen such as the unityof knowledge the reign of law and the equality of the sexes havebeen anticipated in a dream by him 
 argument

 the division into books like all similar divisions is probablylater than the age of plato the natural divisions are five in number book i and the first half of book ii down to the paragraphbeginning i had always admired the genius of glaucon andadeimantus which is introductory the first book containing arefutation of the popular and sophistical notions of justice andconcluding like some of the earlier dialogues without arriving atany definite result to this is appended a restatement of the natureof justice according to common opinion and an answer is demanded tothe question what is justice stripped of appearances the seconddivision includes the remainder of the second and the whole of thethird and fourth books which are mainly occupied with theconstruction of the first state and the first education the thirddivision consists of the fifth sixth and seventh books in whichphilosophy rather than justice is the subject of inquiry and thesecond state is constructed on principles of communism and ruled byphilosophers and the contemplation of the idea of good takes theplace of the social and political virtues in the eighth and ninthbooks the perversions of states and of the individuals whocorrespond to them are reviewed in succession and the nature ofpleasure and the principle of tyranny are further analyzed in theindividual man the tenth book is the conclusion of the which the relations of philosophy to poetry are finally the happiness of the citizens in this life which has now beenassured is crowned by the vision of another 
 or a more general division into two parts may be adopted thefirst books i iv containing the description of a state framedgenerally in accordance with hellenic notions of religion andmorality while in the second books v x the hellenic state istransformed into an ideal kingdom of philosophy of which all othergovernments are the perversions these two points of view are reallyopposed and the opposition is only veiled by the genius of plato therepublic like the phaedrus is an imperfect whole the higher lightof philosophy breaks through the regularity of the hellenic at last fades away into the heavens whether this imperfectionof structure arises from an enlargement of the plan or from theimperfect reconcilement in the own mind of the strugglingelements of thought which are now first brought together by him from the composition of the work at different times arequestions like the similar question about the iliad and theodyssey which are worth asking but which cannot have a distinctanswer in the age of plato there was no regular mode ofpublication and an author would have the less scruple in alteringor adding to a work which was known only to a few of his is no absurdity in supposing that he may have laid his laborsaside for a time or turned from one work to another and suchinterruptions would be more likely to occur in the case of a long thanof a short writing in all attempts to determine the chronologicalhe order of the platonic writings on internal evidence thisuncertainty about any single dialogue being composed at one time isa disturbing element which must be admitted to affect longer as the republic and the laws more than shorter ones but on theother hand the seeming discrepancies of the republic may only ariseout of the discordant elements which the philosopher has attemptedto unite in a single whole perhaps without being himself able torecognize the inconsistency which is obvious to us for there is ajudgment of after ages which few great writers have ever been ableto anticipate for themselves they do not perceive the want ofconnection in their own writings or the gaps in their systems whichare visible enough to those who come after them in the beginningsof literature and philosophy amid the first efforts of thought andlanguage more inconsistencies occur than now when the paths ofspeculation are well worn and the meaning of words preciselydefined for consistency too is the growth of time and some ofthe greatest creations of the human mind have been wanting in by this test several of the platonic dialogues according toour modern ideas appear to be defective but the deficiency is noproof that they were composed at different times or by differenthands and the supposition that the republic was writtenuninterruptedly and by a continuous effort is in some degree confirmedby the numerous references from one part of the work to another 
 the second title concerning justice is not the one by whichthe republic is quoted either by aristotle or generally in like the other second titles of the platonic dialogues maytherefore be assumed to be of later date morgenstern and othershave asked whether the definition of justice which is the professedaim or the construction of the state is the principal argument of thework the answer is that the two blend in one and are two faces ofthe same truth for justice is the order of the state and the stateis the visible embodiment of justice under the conditions of humansociety the one is the soul and the other is the body and thegreek ideal of the state as of the individual is a fair mind in afair body in hegelian phraseology the state is the reality of whichjustice is the ideal or described in christian language the kingdomof god is within and yet develops into a church or externalkingdom the house not made with hands eternal in the heavens isreduced to the proportions of an earthly building or to use aplatonic image justice and the state are the warp and the woofwhich run through the whole texture and when the constitution ofthe state is completed the conception of justice is not reappears under the same or different names throughout the as the inner law of the individual soul and finally as theprinciple of rewards and punishments in another life the virtuesare based on justice of which common honesty in buying and selling isthe shadow and justice is based on the idea of good which is theharmony of the world and is reflected both in the institutions ofstates and in motions of the heavenly bodies the timaeus which takesup the political rather than the ethical side of the republic andis chiefly occupied with hypotheses concerning the outward contains many indications that the same law is supposed to reignover the state over nature and over man 
 too much however has been made of this question both in ancientand in modern times there is a stage of criticism in which all of nature or of art are referred to design now in ancientwritings and indeed in literature generally there remains often alarge element which was not comprehended in the original design forthe plan grows under the hand new thoughts occur to him inthe act of writing he has not worked out the argument to the endbefore he begins the reader who seeks to find some one idea underwhich the whole may be conceived must necessarily seize on thevaguest and most general thus stallbaum who is dissatisfied with theordinary explanations of the argument of the republic imagineshimself to have found the true argument in the representation ofhuman life in a state perfected by justice and governed according tothe idea of good there may be some use in such general they can hardly be said to express the design of the writer thetruth is that we may as well speak of many designs as of one norneed anything be excluded from the plan of a great work to which themind is naturally led by the association of ideas and which doesnot interfere with the general purpose what kind or degree of unityis to be sought after in a building in the plastic arts in prose is a problem which has to be determined relatively to to plato himself the inquiry what was theintention of the writer or what was the principal argument of therepublic would have been hardly intelligible and therefore hadbetter be at once dismissed 
 is not the republic the vehicle of three or four great truths own mind are most naturally represented in the form of thestate just as in the jewish prophets the reign of messiah or theday of the lord or the suffering servant or people of god or of righteousness with healing in his wings only convey to us atleast their great spiritual ideals so through the greek stateplato reveals to us his own thoughts about divine perfection which isthe idea of good like the sun in the visible world about humanperfection which is justice about education beginning in youthand continuing in later years about poets and sophists and tyrantswho are the false teachers and evil rulers of mankind about theworld which is the embodiment of them about a kingdom whichexists nowhere upon earth but is laid up in heaven to be the patternand rule of human life no such inspired creation is at unity withitself any more than the clouds of heaven when the sun piercesthrough them every shade of light and dark of truth and offiction which is the veil of truth is allowable in a work ofphilosophical imagination it is not all on the same plane iteasily passes from ideas to myths and fancies from facts to figuresof speech it is not prose but poetry at least a great part of ought not to be judged by the rules of logic or theprobabilities of history the writer is not fashioning his ideasinto an artistic whole they take possession of him and are too muchfor him we have no need therefore to discuss whether a state suchas plato has conceived is practicable or not or whether the outwardform or the inward life came first into the mind of the writer forthe practicability of his ideas has nothing to do with their the highest thoughts to which he attains may be truly said to bearthe greatest marks of design justice more than the of the state the idea of good more than justice the greatscience of dialectic or the organization of ideas has no real is only a type of the method or spirit in which the higherknowledge is to be pursued by the spectator of all time and allexistence it is in the fifth sixth and seventh books that platoreaches the summit of speculation and these although they failto satisfy the requirements of a modern thinker may therefore beregarded as the most important as they are also the most of the work 
 it is not necessary to discuss at length a minor question whichhas been raised by boeckh respecting the imaginary date at whichthe conversation was held the year b c which is proposed by himwill do as well as any other for a writer of fiction and especiallya writer who like plato is notoriously careless of aims at general probability whether all the persons mentioned inthe republic could ever have met at any one time is not a difficultywhich would have occurred to an athenian reading the work fortyyears later or to plato himself at the time of writing any more thanto shakespeare respecting one of his own dramas and need not greatlytrouble us now yet this may be a question having no answer whichis still worth asking because the investigation shows that we cannot argue historically from the dates in plato it would be uselesstherefore to waste time in inventing reconcilements ofthem in order avoid chronological difficulties such for the conjecture of c f hermann that glaucon and adeimantus arenot the brothers but the uncles of plato or the fancy of stallbaumthat plato intentionally left anachronisms indicating the dates atwhich some of his dialogues were written 
 characters 
 the principal characters in the republic are thrasymachus socrates glaucon and adeimantus cephalusappears in the introduction only polemarchus drops at the end ofthe first argument and thrasymachus is reduced to silence at theclose of the first book the main discussion is carried on bysocrates glaucon and adeimantus among the company are lysias theorator and euthydemus the sons of cephalus and brothers ofpolemarchus an unknown charmantides these are mute auditors alsothere is cleitophon who once interrupts where as in the dialoguewhich bears his name he appears as the friend and ally ofthrasymachus 
 cephalus the patriarch of house has been appropriately engagedin offering a sacrifice he is the pattern of an old man who hasalmost done with life and is at peace with himself and with allmankind he feels that he is drawing nearer to the world below andseems to linger around the memory of the past he is eager thatsocrates should come to visit him fond of the poetry of the lastgeneration happy in the consciousness of a life glad athaving escaped from the tyranny of youthful lusts his love ofconversation his affection his indifference to riches even hisgarrulity are interesting traits of character he is not one of thosewho have nothing to say because their whole mind has been absorbed inmaking money yet he acknowledges that riches have the advantage ofplacing men above the temptation to dishonesty or falsehood therespectful attention shown to him by socrates whose love ofconversation no less than the mission imposed upon him by the him to ask questions of all men young and old alike shouldalso be noted who better suited to raise the question of justice thancephalus whose life might seem to be the expression of it themoderation with which old age is pictured by cephalus as a verytolerable portion of existence is characteristic not only of him butof greek feeling generally and contrasts with the exaggeration ofcicero in the de senectute the evening of life is described byplato in the most expressive manner yet with the fewest possibletouches as cicero remarks ep ad attic iv the aged cephaluswould have been out of place in the discussion which follows andwhich he could neither have understood nor taken part in without aviolation of dramatic propriety 
 his son and heir polemarchus has the frankness and impetuousnessof youth he is for detaining socrates by force in the openingscene and will not let him off on the subject of women andchildren like cephalus he is limited in his point of view andrepresents the proverbial stage of morality which has rules of liferather than principles and he quotes simonides as his father hadquoted pindar but after this he has no more to say the answers whichhe makes are only elicited from him by the dialectic of socrates hehas not yet experienced the influence of the sophists like glaucon andadeimantus nor is he sensible of the necessity of refuting them hebelongs to the or age he is incapable ofarguing and is bewildered by socrates to such a degree that he doesnot know what he is saying he is made to admit that justice is athief and that the virtues follow the analogy of the arts from hisbrother lysias we learn that he fell a victim to the thirty no allusion is here made to his fate nor to the circumstance thatcephalus and his family were of syracusan origin and had migratedfrom thurii to athens 
 the chalcedonian giant thrasymachus of whom we have alreadyheard in the phaedrus is the personification of the to conception of them in some of their worstcharacteristics he is vain and blustering refusing to discourseunless he is paid fond of making an oration and hoping thereby toescape the inevitable socrates but a mere child in argument andunable to foresee that the next move to use a platonicexpression will shut him up he has reached the stage of framinggeneral notions and in this respect is in advance of cephalus andpolemarchus but he is incapable of defending them in a vainly tries to cover his confusion in banter and such doctrines as are attributed to him by plato were reallyheld either by him or by any other sophist is uncertain in theinfancy of philosophy serious errors about morality might easilygrow up they are certainly put into the mouths of speakers inthucydides but we are concerned at present with descriptionof him and not with the historical reality the inequality of thecontest adds greatly to the humor of the scene the pompous andempty sophist is utterly helpless in the hands of the great masterof dialectic who knows how to touch all the springs of vanity andweakness in him he is greatly irritated by the irony of socrates buthis noisy and imbecile rage only lays him more and more open to thethrusts of his assailant his determination to cram down theirthroats or put bodily into their souls his own words elicits a cryof horror from socrates the state of his temper is quite as worthy ofremark as the process of the argument nothing is more amusing thanhis complete submission when he has been once thoroughly beaten atfirst he seems to continue the discussion with reluctance but soonwith apparent and he even testifies his interest at a laterstage by one or two occasional remarks when attacked by glaucon he ishumorously protected by socrates as one who has never been hisenemy and is now his friend from cicero and quintilian and rhetoric we learn that the sophist whom plato has madeso ridiculous was a man of note whose writings were preserved in laterages the play on his name which was made by his contemporaryherodicus thou wast ever bold in battle seems to show that thedescription of him is not devoid of verisimilitude 
 when thrasymachus has been silenced the two principalrespondents glaucon and adeimantus appear on the scene here asin greek tragedy three actors are introduced at first sight thetwo sons of ariston may seem to wear a family likeness like the twofriends simmias and cebes in the phaedo but on a nearer examinationof them the similarity vanishes and they are seen to be distinctcharacters glaucon is the impetuous youth who can just never haveenough of fechting cf the character of him in xen mem iii the man of pleasure who is acquainted with the mysteries of juvenis qui gaudet canibus and who improves the breed ofanimals the lover of art and music who has all the experiences ofyouthful life he is full of quickness and penetration piercingeasily below the clumsy platitudes of thrasymachus to the realdifficulty he turns out to the light the seamy side of human yet does not lose faith in the just and true it is glaucon whoseizes what may be termed the ludicrous relation of the philosopher tothe world to whom a state of simplicity is a city of pigs who isalways prepared with a jest when the argument offers him anopportunity and who is ever ready to second the humor of socrates andto appreciate the ridiculous whether in the connoisseurs of music orin the lovers of theatricals or in the fantastic behavior of thecitizens of democracy his weaknesses are several times alluded toby socrates who however will not allow him to be attacked by hisbrother adeimantus he is a soldier and like adeimantus has beendistinguished at the battle of megara 
 the character of adeimantus is deeper and graver and the profounderobjections are commonly put into his mouth glaucon is moredemonstrative and generally opens the game adeimantus pursues theargument further glaucon has more of the liveliness and quicksympathy of youth adeimantus has the maturer judgment of a of the world in the second book when glaucon insists thatjustice and injustice shall be considered without regard to theirconsequences adeimantus remarks that they are regarded by mankindin general only for the sake of their consequences and in a similarvein of reflection he urges at the beginning of the fourth book thatsocrates falls in making his citizens happy and is answered thathappiness is not the first but the second thing not the direct aimbut the indirect consequence of the good government of a state in thediscussion about religion and mythology adeimantus is the glaucon breaks in with a slight jest and carries on theconversation in a lighter tone about music and gymnastic to the end ofthe book it is adeimantus again who volunteers the criticism ofcommon sense on the socratic method of argument and who refuses tolet socrates pass lightly over the question of women and is adeimantus who is the respondent in the more argumentative asglaucon in the lighter and more imaginative portions of thedialogue for example throughout the greater part of the sixthbook the causes of the corruption of philosophy and the conception ofthe idea of good are discussed with adeimantus then glaucon resumeshis place of principal respondent but he has a difficulty inapprehending the higher education of socrates and makes some falsehits in the course of the discussion once more adeimantus returnswith the allusion to his brother glaucon whom he compares to thecontentious state in the next book he is again superseded andglaucon continues to the end 
 thus in a succession of characters plato represents the successivestages of morality beginning with the athenian gentleman of the oldentime who is followed by the practical man of that day regulatinghis life by proverbs and saws to him succeeds the wild generalizationof the sophists and lastly come the young disciples of the greatteacher who know the sophistical arguments but will not beconvinced by them and desire to go deeper into the nature ofthings these too like cephalus polemarchus thrasymachus areclearly distinguished from one another neither in the republic norin any other dialogue of plato is a single character repeated 
 the delineation of socrates in the republic is not whollyconsistent in the first book we have more of the real as he is depicted in the memorabilia of xenophon in the earliestdialogues of plato and in the apology he is ironical the old enemy of the sophists ready to put on the maskof silenus as well as to argue seriously but in the sixth book hisenmity towards the sophists abates he acknowledges that they arethe representatives rather than the corrupters of the world he alsobecomes more dogmatic and constructive passing beyond the rangeeither of the political or the speculative ideas of the real one passage plato himself seems to intimate that the time had nowcome for socrates who had passed his whole life in philosophy togive his own opinion and not to be always repeating the notions ofother men there is no evidence that either the idea of good or theconception of a perfect state were comprehended in the socraticteaching though he certainly dwelt on the nature of the universal andof final causes cp xen mem i phaedo and a deep thinkerlike him in his thirty or forty years of public teaching could hardlyhave falled to touch on the nature of family relations for whichthere is also some positive evidence in the memorabilia mem i foll the socratic method is nominally retained and everyinference is either put into the mouth of the respondent orrepresented as the common discovery of him and socrates but any onecan see that this is a mere form of which the affectation growswearisome as the work advances the method of inquiry has passedinto a method of teaching in which by the help of interlocutors thesame thesis is looked at from various points of view 
 the nature of the process is truly characterized by glaucon when hedescribes himself as a companion who is not good for much in aninvestigation but can see what he is shown and may perhaps givethe answer to a question more fluently than another 
 neither can we be absolutely certain that socrates himself taughtthe immortality of the soul which is unknown to his discipleglaucon in the republic nor is there any reason to suppose that heused myths or revelations of another world as a vehicle ofinstruction or that he would have banished poetry or have denouncedthe greek mythology his favorite oath is retained and a slightmention is made of the daemonium or internal sign which is alludedto by socrates as a phenomenon peculiar to himself a real elementof socratic teaching which is more prominent in the republic thanin any of the other dialogues of plato is the use of example andillustration taphorhtika auto prhospherhontez let us apply thetest of common instances you says adeimantus ironically inthe sixth book are so unaccustomed to speak in images and this useof examples or images though truly socratic in origin is enlarged bythe genius of plato into the form of an allegory or parable whichembodies in the concrete what has been already described or isabout to be described in the abstract thus the figure of the cave inbook vii is a recapitulation of the divisions of knowledge in book composite animal in book ix is an allegory of the parts of thesoul the noble captain and the ship and the true pilot in book vi area figure of the relation of the people to the philosophers in thestate which has been described other figures such as the dog inthe second third and fourth books or the marriage of theportionless maiden in the sixth book or the drones and wasps in theeighth and ninth books also form links of connection in longpassages or are used to recall previous discussions 
 plato is most true to the character of his master when hedescribes him as not of this world and with this representationof him the ideal state and the other paradoxes of the republic arequite in accordance though they can not be shown to have beenspeculations of socrates to him as to other great teachers bothphilosophical and religious when they looked upward the world seemedto be the embodiment of error and evil the common sense of mankindhas revolted against this view or has only partially admitted it andeven in socrates himself the sterner judgment of the multitude attimes passes into a sort of ironical pity or love men in generalare incapable of philosophy and are therefore at enmity with thephilosopher but their misunderstanding of him is unavoidable forthey have never seen him as he truly is in his own image they areonly acquainted with artificial systems possessing no native forceof truth words which admit of many applications their leadershave nothing to measure with and are therefore ignorant of theirown stature but they are to be pitied or laughed at not to bequarrelled with they mean well with their nostrums if they couldonly learn that they are cutting off a head this moderationtowards those who are in error is one of the most characteristicfeatures of socrates in the republic in all the differentrepresentations of socrates whether of xenophon or plato and thedifferences of the earlier or later dialogues he always retains thecharacter of the unwearied and disinterested seeker after which he would have ceased to be socrates 
 leaving the characters we may now analyze the contents of therepublic and then proceed to consider 
 the general aspects of thishellenic ideal of the state 
 the modern lights in which thethoughts of plato may be read

 the republic 
 by plato 
 translated by benjamin jowett 
 the introduction 
 
 the republic of plato is the longest of his works with the exceptionof the laws and is certainly the greatest of them there are nearerapproaches to modern metaphysics in the philebus and in the politicus or statesman is more ideal the form and institutions ofthe state are more clearly drawn out in the laws as works of art thesymposium and the protagoras are of higher excellence but no otherdialogue of plato has the same largeness of view and the sameperfection of style no other shows an equal knowledge of the contains more of those thoughts which are new as well as old andnot of one age only but of all nowhere in plato is there a deeperirony or a greater wealth of humor or imagery or more dramatic in any other of his writings is the attempt made to interweavelife and speculation or to connect politics with philosophy therepublic is the centre around which the other dialogues may begrouped here philosophy reaches the highest point to which ancientthinkers ever attained plato among the greeks like bacon among themoderns was the first who conceived a method of knowledge althoughneither of them always distinguished the bare outline or form from thesubstance of truth and both of them had to be content with anabstraction of science which was not yet realized he was the greatestmetaphysical genius whom the world has seen and in him more thanin any other ancient thinker the germs of future knowledge arecontained the sciences of logic and psychology which have suppliedso many instruments of thought to are based upon theanalyses of socrates and plato the principles of definition thelaw of contradiction the fallacy of arguing in a circle thedistinction between the essence and accidents of a thing or means and ends between causes and conditions also thedivision of the mind into the rational concupiscent and irascibleelements or of pleasures and desires into necessary and and other great forms of thought are all of them to be foundin the republic and were probably first invented by plato thegreatest of all logical truths and the one of which writers onphilosophy are most apt to lose sight the difference between wordsand things has been most strenuously insisted on by him althoughhe has not always avoided the confusion of them in his own he does not bind up truth in logical formulae logic is stillveiled in metaphysics and the science which he imagines all truth and all existence is very unlike thedoctrine of the syllogism which aristotle claims to have discovered 
 neither must we forget that the republic is but the third part ofa still larger design which was to have included an ideal history ofathens as well as a political and physical philosophy the fragmentof the critias has given birth to a fiction secondonly in importance to the tale of troy and the legend of arthur andis said as a fact to have inspired some of the early navigators of thesixteenth century this mythical tale of which the subject was ahistory of the wars of the athenians against the island of supposed to be founded upon an unfinished poem of solon to whichit would have stood in the same relation as the writings of thelogographers to the poems of homer it would have told of a strugglefor liberty intended to represent the conflict of persia andhellas we may judge from the noble commencement of the the fragment of the critias itself and from the third book ofthe laws in what manner plato would have treated this highargument we can only guess why the great design was because plato became sensible of some incongruity in afictitious history or because he had lost his interest in it orbecause advancing years forbade the completion of it and we mayplease ourselves with the fancy that had this imaginary narrative everbeen finished we should have found plato himself sympathizing withthe struggle for hellenic independence singing a hymn of triumph overmarathon and salamis perhaps making the reflection of herodotus wherehe contemplates the growth of the athenian brave athing is freedom of speech which has made the athenians so far exceedevery other state of hellas in greatness or more the victory to the ancient good order of athens and to thefavor of apollo and athene 
 again plato may be regarded as the captain arhchegoz orleader of a goodly band of followers for in the republic is to befound the original of de republica of st cityof god of the utopia of sir thomas more and of the numerous otherimaginary states which are framed upon the same model the extent towhich aristotle or the aristotelian school were indebted to him in thepolitics has been little recognized and the recognition is the morenecessary because it is not made by aristotle himself the twophilosophers had more in common than they were conscious of andprobably some elements of plato remain still undetected inaristotle in english philosophy too many affinities may be only in the works of the cambridge platonists but in greatoriginal writers like berkeley or coleridge to plato and his there is a truth higher than experience of which the mindbears witness to herself is a conviction which in our owngeneration has been enthusiastically asserted and is perhapsgaining ground of the greek authors who at the renaissance broughta new life into the world plato has had the greatest influence therepublic of plato is also the first treatise upon education ofwhich the writings of milton and locke rousseau jean paul andgoethe are the legitimate descendants like dante or bunyan he hasa revelation of another life like bacon he is profoundly impressedwith the un unity of knowledge in the early church he exercised areal influence on theology and at the revival of literature onpolitics even the fragments of his words when repeated have in all ages ravished the hearts of men who haveseen reflected in them their own higher nature he is the father ofidealism in philosophy in politics in literature and many of thelatest conceptions of modern thinkers and statesmen such as the unityof knowledge the reign of law and the equality of the sexes havebeen anticipated in a dream by him 
 argument 
 the argument of the republic is the search after justice the natureof which is first hinted at by cephalus the just and blameless oldman then discussed on the basis of proverbial morality by socratesand polemarchus then caricatured by thrasymachus and partiallyexplained by socrates reduced to an abstraction by glaucon andadeimantus and having become invisible in the individual reappears atlength in the ideal state which is constructed by socrates thefirst care of the rulers is to be education of which an outline isdrawn after the old hellenic model providing only for an improvedreligion and morality and more simplicity in music and gymnastic amanlier strain of poetry and greater harmony of the individual andthe state we are thus led on to the conception of a higher which no man calls anything his own and in which there isneither marrying nor giving in marriage and kings arephilosophers and philosophers are kings and there is another andhigher education intellectual as well as moral and religious ofscience as well as of art and not of youth only but of the whole oflife such a state is hardly to be realized in this world and wouldquickly degenerate to the perfect ideal succeeds the government ofthe soldier and the lover of honor this again declining intodemocracy and democracy into tyranny in an imaginary but regularorder having not much resemblance to the actual facts when the wheelhas come full circle we do not begin again with a new period of humanlife but we have passed from the best to the worst and there we subject is then changed and the old quarrel of poetry andphilosophy which had been more lightly treated in the earlier books ofthe republic is now resumed and fought out to a conclusion poetryis discovered to be an imitation thrice removed from the truth andhomer as well as the dramatic poets having been condemned as animitator is sent into banishment along with them and the idea of thestate is supplemented by the revelation of a future life 
 the division into books like all similar divisions is probablylater than the age of plato the natural divisions are five in number book i and the first half of book ii down to the paragraphbeginning i had always admired the genius of glaucon andadeimantus which is introductory the first book containing arefutation of the popular and sophistical notions of justice andconcluding like some of the earlier dialogues without arriving atany definite result to this is appended a restatement of the natureof justice according to common opinion and an answer is demanded tothe question what is justice stripped of appearances the seconddivision includes the remainder of the second and the whole of thethird and fourth books which are mainly occupied with theconstruction of the first state and the first education the thirddivision consists of the fifth sixth and seventh books in whichphilosophy rather than justice is the subject of inquiry and thesecond state is constructed on principles of communism and ruled byphilosophers and the contemplation of the idea of good takes theplace of the social and political virtues in the eighth and ninthbooks the perversions of states and of the individuals whocorrespond to them are reviewed in succession and the nature ofpleasure and the principle of tyranny are further analyzed in theindividual man the tenth book is the conclusion of the which the relations of philosophy to poetry are finally the happiness of the citizens in this life which has now beenassured is crowned by the vision of another 
 or a more general division into two parts may be adopted thefirst books i iv containing the description of a state framedgenerally in accordance with hellenic notions of religion andmorality while in the second books v x the hellenic state istransformed into an ideal kingdom of philosophy of which all othergovernments are the perversions these two points of view are reallyopposed and the opposition is only veiled by the genius of plato therepublic like the phaedrus is an imperfect whole the higher lightof philosophy breaks through the regularity of the hellenic at last fades away into the heavens whether this imperfectionof structure arises from an enlargement of the plan or from theimperfect reconcilement in the own mind of the strugglingelements of thought which are now first brought together by him from the composition of the work at different times arequestions like the similar question about the iliad and theodyssey which are worth asking but which cannot have a distinctanswer in the age of plato there was no regular mode ofpublication and an author would have the less scruple in alteringor adding to a work which was known only to a few of his is no absurdity in supposing that he may have laid his laborsaside for a time or turned from one work to another and suchinterruptions would be more likely to occur in the case of a long thanof a short writing in all attempts to determine the chronologicalhe order of the platonic writings on internal evidence thisuncertainty about any single dialogue being composed at one time isa disturbing element which must be admitted to affect longer as the republic and the laws more than shorter ones but on theother hand the seeming discrepancies of the republic may only ariseout of the discordant elements which the philosopher has attemptedto unite in a single whole perhaps without being himself able torecognize the inconsistency which is obvious to us for there is ajudgment of after ages which few great writers have ever been ableto anticipate for themselves they do not perceive the want ofconnection in their own writings or the gaps in their systems whichare visible enough to those who come after them in the beginningsof literature and philosophy amid the first efforts of thought andlanguage more inconsistencies occur than now when the paths ofspeculation are well worn and the meaning of words preciselydefined for consistency too is the growth of time and some ofthe greatest creations of the human mind have been wanting in by this test several of the platonic dialogues according toour modern ideas appear to be defective but the deficiency is noproof that they were composed at different times or by differenthands and the supposition that the republic was writtenuninterruptedly and by a continuous effort is in some degree confirmedby the numerous references from one part of the work to another 
 the second title concerning justice is not the one by whichthe republic is quoted either by aristotle or generally in like the other second titles of the platonic dialogues maytherefore be assumed to be of later date morgenstern and othershave asked whether the definition of justice which is the professedaim or the construction of the state is the principal argument of thework the answer is that the two blend in one and are two faces ofthe same truth for justice is the order of the state and the stateis the visible embodiment of justice under the conditions of humansociety the one is the soul and the other is the body and thegreek ideal of the state as of the individual is a fair mind in afair body in hegelian phraseology the state is the reality of whichjustice is the ideal or described in christian language the kingdomof god is within and yet develops into a church or externalkingdom the house not made with hands eternal in the heavens isreduced to the proportions of an earthly building or to use aplatonic image justice and the state are the warp and the woofwhich run through the whole texture and when the constitution ofthe state is completed the conception of justice is not reappears under the same or different names throughout the as the inner law of the individual soul and finally as theprinciple of rewards and punishments in another life the virtuesare based on justice of which common honesty in buying and selling isthe shadow and justice is based on the idea of good which is theharmony of the world and is reflected both in the institutions ofstates and in motions of the heavenly bodies the timaeus which takesup the political rather than the ethical side of the republic andis chiefly occupied with hypotheses concerning the outward contains many indications that the same law is supposed to reignover the state over nature and over man 
 too much however has been made of this question both in ancientand in modern times there is a stage of criticism in which all of nature or of art are referred to design now in ancientwritings and indeed in literature generally there remains often alarge element which was not comprehended in the original design forthe plan grows under the hand new thoughts occur to him inthe act of writing he has not worked out the argument to the endbefore he begins the reader who seeks to find some one idea underwhich the whole may be conceived must necessarily seize on thevaguest and most general thus stallbaum who is dissatisfied with theordinary explanations of the argument of the republic imagineshimself to have found the true argument in the representation ofhuman life in a state perfected by justice and governed according tothe idea of good there may be some use in such general they can hardly be said to express the design of the writer thetruth is that we may as well speak of many designs as of one norneed anything be excluded from the plan of a great work to which themind is naturally led by the association of ideas and which doesnot interfere with the general purpose what kind or degree of unityis to be sought after in a building in the plastic arts in prose is a problem which has to be determined relatively to to plato himself the inquiry what was theintention of the writer or what was the principal argument of therepublic would have been hardly intelligible and therefore hadbetter be at once dismissed 
 is not the republic the vehicle of three or four great truths own mind are most naturally represented in the form of thestate just as in the jewish prophets the reign of messiah or theday of the lord or the suffering servant or people of god or of righteousness with healing in his wings only convey to us atleast their great spiritual ideals so through the greek stateplato reveals to us his own thoughts about divine perfection which isthe idea of good like the sun in the visible world about humanperfection which is justice about education beginning in youthand continuing in later years about poets and sophists and tyrantswho are the false teachers and evil rulers of mankind about theworld which is the embodiment of them about a kingdom whichexists nowhere upon earth but is laid up in heaven to be the patternand rule of human life no such inspired creation is at unity withitself any more than the clouds of heaven when the sun piercesthrough them every shade of light and dark of truth and offiction which is the veil of truth is allowable in a work ofphilosophical imagination it is not all on the same plane iteasily passes from ideas to myths and fancies from facts to figuresof speech it is not prose but poetry at least a great part of ought not to be judged by the rules of logic or theprobabilities of history the writer is not fashioning his ideasinto an artistic whole they take possession of him and are too muchfor him we have no need therefore to discuss whether a state suchas plato has conceived is practicable or not or whether the outwardform or the inward life came first into the mind of the writer forthe practicability of his ideas has nothing to do with their the highest thoughts to which he attains may be truly said to bearthe greatest marks of design justice more than the of the state the idea of good more than justice the greatscience of dialectic or the organization of ideas has no real is only a type of the method or spirit in which the higherknowledge is to be pursued by the spectator of all time and allexistence it is in the fifth sixth and seventh books that platoreaches the summit of speculation and these although they failto satisfy the requirements of a modern thinker may therefore beregarded as the most important as they are also the most of the work 
 it is not necessary to discuss at length a minor question whichhas been raised by boeckh respecting the imaginary date at whichthe conversation was held the year b c which is proposed by himwill do as well as any other for a writer of fiction and especiallya writer who like plato is notoriously careless of aims at general probability whether all the persons mentioned inthe republic could ever have met at any one time is not a difficultywhich would have occurred to an athenian reading the work fortyyears later or to plato himself at the time of writing any more thanto shakespeare respecting one of his own dramas and need not greatlytrouble us now yet this may be a question having no answer whichis still worth asking because the investigation shows that we cannot argue historically from the dates in plato it would be uselesstherefore to waste time in inventing reconcilements ofthem in order avoid chronological difficulties such for the conjecture of c f hermann that glaucon and adeimantus arenot the brothers but the uncles of plato or the fancy of stallbaumthat plato intentionally left anachronisms indicating the dates atwhich some of his dialogues were written 
 characters 
 the principal characters in the republic are thrasymachus socrates glaucon and adeimantus cephalusappears in the introduction only polemarchus drops at the end ofthe first argument and thrasymachus is reduced to silence at theclose of the first book the main discussion is carried on bysocrates glaucon and adeimantus among the company are lysias theorator and euthydemus the sons of cephalus and brothers ofpolemarchus an unknown charmantides these are mute auditors alsothere is cleitophon who once interrupts where as in the dialoguewhich bears his name he appears as the friend and ally ofthrasymachus 
 cephalus the patriarch of house has been appropriately engagedin offering a sacrifice he is the pattern of an old man who hasalmost done with life and is at peace with himself and with allmankind he feels that he is drawing nearer to the world below andseems to linger around the memory of the past he is eager thatsocrates should come to visit him fond of the poetry of the lastgeneration happy in the consciousness of a life glad athaving escaped from the tyranny of youthful lusts his love ofconversation his affection his indifference to riches even hisgarrulity are interesting traits of character he is not one of thosewho have nothing to say because their whole mind has been absorbed inmaking money yet he acknowledges that riches have the advantage ofplacing men above the temptation to dishonesty or falsehood therespectful attention shown to him by socrates whose love ofconversation no less than the mission imposed upon him by the him to ask questions of all men young and old alike shouldalso be noted who better suited to raise the question of justice thancephalus whose life might seem to be the expression of it themoderation with which old age is pictured by cephalus as a verytolerable portion of existence is characteristic not only of him butof greek feeling generally and contrasts with the exaggeration ofcicero in the de senectute the evening of life is described byplato in the most expressive manner yet with the fewest possibletouches as cicero remarks ep ad attic iv the aged cephaluswould have been out of place in the discussion which follows andwhich he could neither have understood nor taken part in without aviolation of dramatic propriety 
 his son and heir polemarchus has the frankness and impetuousnessof youth he is for detaining socrates by force in the openingscene and will not let him off on the subject of women andchildren like cephalus he is limited in his point of view andrepresents the proverbial stage of morality which has rules of liferather than principles and he quotes simonides as his father hadquoted pindar but after this he has no more to say the answers whichhe makes are only elicited from him by the dialectic of socrates hehas not yet experienced the influence of the sophists like glaucon andadeimantus nor is he sensible of the necessity of refuting them hebelongs to the or age he is incapable ofarguing and is bewildered by socrates to such a degree that he doesnot know what he is saying he is made to admit that justice is athief and that the virtues follow the analogy of the arts from hisbrother lysias we learn that he fell a victim to the thirty no allusion is here made to his fate nor to the circumstance thatcephalus and his family were of syracusan origin and had migratedfrom thurii to athens 
 the chalcedonian giant thrasymachus of whom we have alreadyheard in the phaedrus is the personification of the to conception of them in some of their worstcharacteristics he is vain and blustering refusing to discourseunless he is paid fond of making an oration and hoping thereby toescape the inevitable socrates but a mere child in argument andunable to foresee that the next move to use a platonicexpression will shut him up he has reached the stage of framinggeneral notions and in this respect is in advance of cephalus andpolemarchus but he is incapable of defending them in a vainly tries to cover his confusion in banter and such doctrines as are attributed to him by plato were reallyheld either by him or by any other sophist is uncertain in theinfancy of philosophy serious errors about morality might easilygrow up they are certainly put into the mouths of speakers inthucydides but we are concerned at present with descriptionof him and not with the historical reality the inequality of thecontest adds greatly to the humor of the scene the pompous andempty sophist is utterly helpless in the hands of the great masterof dialectic who knows how to touch all the springs of vanity andweakness in him he is greatly irritated by the irony of socrates buthis noisy and imbecile rage only lays him more and more open to thethrusts of his assailant his determination to cram down theirthroats or put bodily into their souls his own words elicits a cryof horror from socrates the state of his temper is quite as worthy ofremark as the process of the argument nothing is more amusing thanhis complete submission when he has been once thoroughly beaten atfirst he seems to continue the discussion with reluctance but soonwith apparent and he even testifies his interest at a laterstage by one or two occasional remarks when attacked by glaucon he ishumorously protected by socrates as one who has never been hisenemy and is now his friend from cicero and quintilian and rhetoric we learn that the sophist whom plato has madeso ridiculous was a man of note whose writings were preserved in laterages the play on his name which was made by his contemporaryherodicus thou wast ever bold in battle seems to show that thedescription of him is not devoid of verisimilitude 
 when thrasymachus has been silenced the two principalrespondents glaucon and adeimantus appear on the scene here asin greek tragedy three actors are introduced at first sight thetwo sons of ariston may seem to wear a family likeness like the twofriends simmias and cebes in the phaedo but on a nearer examinationof them the similarity vanishes and they are seen to be distinctcharacters glaucon is the impetuous youth who can just never haveenough of fechting cf the character of him in xen mem iii the man of pleasure who is acquainted with the mysteries of juvenis qui gaudet canibus and who improves the breed ofanimals the lover of art and music who has all the experiences ofyouthful life he is full of quickness and penetration piercingeasily below the clumsy platitudes of thrasymachus to the realdifficulty he turns out to the light the seamy side of human yet does not lose faith in the just and true it is glaucon whoseizes what may be termed the ludicrous relation of the philosopher tothe world to whom a state of simplicity is a city of pigs who isalways prepared with a jest when the argument offers him anopportunity and who is ever ready to second the humor of socrates andto appreciate the ridiculous whether in the connoisseurs of music orin the lovers of theatricals or in the fantastic behavior of thecitizens of democracy his weaknesses are several times alluded toby socrates who however will not allow him to be attacked by hisbrother adeimantus he is a soldier and like adeimantus has beendistinguished at the battle of megara 
 the character of adeimantus is deeper and graver and the profounderobjections are commonly put into his mouth glaucon is moredemonstrative and generally opens the game adeimantus pursues theargument further glaucon has more of the liveliness and quicksympathy of youth adeimantus has the maturer judgment of a of the world in the second book when glaucon insists thatjustice and injustice shall be considered without regard to theirconsequences adeimantus remarks that they are regarded by mankindin general only for the sake of their consequences and in a similarvein of reflection he urges at the beginning of the fourth book thatsocrates falls in making his citizens happy and is answered thathappiness is not the first but the second thing not the direct aimbut the indirect consequence of the good government of a state in thediscussion about religion and mythology adeimantus is the glaucon breaks in with a slight jest and carries on theconversation in a lighter tone about music and gymnastic to the end ofthe book it is adeimantus again who volunteers the criticism ofcommon sense on the socratic method of argument and who refuses tolet socrates pass lightly over the question of women and is adeimantus who is the respondent in the more argumentative asglaucon in the lighter and more imaginative portions of thedialogue for example throughout the greater part of the sixthbook the causes of the corruption of philosophy and the conception ofthe idea of good are discussed with adeimantus then glaucon resumeshis place of principal respondent but he has a difficulty inapprehending the higher education of socrates and makes some falsehits in the course of the discussion once more adeimantus returnswith the allusion to his brother glaucon whom he compares to thecontentious state in the next book he is again superseded andglaucon continues to the end 
 thus in a succession of characters plato represents the successivestages of morality beginning with the athenian gentleman of the oldentime who is followed by the practical man of that day regulatinghis life by proverbs and saws to him succeeds the wild generalizationof the sophists and lastly come the young disciples of the greatteacher who know the sophistical arguments but will not beconvinced by them and desire to go deeper into the nature ofthings these too like cephalus polemarchus thrasymachus areclearly distinguished from one another neither in the republic norin any other dialogue of plato is a single character repeated 
 the delineation of socrates in the republic is not whollyconsistent in the first book we have more of the real as he is depicted in the memorabilia of xenophon in the earliestdialogues of plato and in the apology he is ironical the old enemy of the sophists ready to put on the maskof silenus as well as to argue seriously but in the sixth book hisenmity towards the sophists abates he acknowledges that they arethe representatives rather than the corrupters of the world he alsobecomes more dogmatic and constructive passing beyond the rangeeither of the political or the speculative ideas of the real one passage plato himself seems to intimate that the time had nowcome for socrates who had passed his whole life in philosophy togive his own opinion and not to be always repeating the notions ofother men there is no evidence that either the idea of good or theconception of a perfect state were comprehended in the socraticteaching though he certainly dwelt on the nature of the universal andof final causes cp xen mem i phaedo and a deep thinkerlike him in his thirty or forty years of public teaching could hardlyhave falled to touch on the nature of family relations for whichthere is also some positive evidence in the memorabilia mem i foll the socratic method is nominally retained and everyinference is either put into the mouth of the respondent orrepresented as the common discovery of him and socrates but any onecan see that this is a mere form of which the affectation growswearisome as the work advances the method of inquiry has passedinto a method of teaching in which by the help of interlocutors thesame thesis is looked at from various points of view 
 the nature of the process is truly characterized by glaucon when hedescribes himself as a companion who is not good for much in aninvestigation but can see what he is shown and may perhaps givethe answer to a question more fluently than another 
 neither can we be absolutely certain that socrates himself taughtthe immortality of the soul which is unknown to his discipleglaucon in the republic nor is there any reason to suppose that heused myths or revelations of another world as a vehicle ofinstruction or that he would have banished poetry or have denouncedthe greek mythology his favorite oath is retained and a slightmention is made of the daemonium or internal sign which is alludedto by socrates as a phenomenon peculiar to himself a real elementof socratic teaching which is more prominent in the republic thanin any of the other dialogues of plato is the use of example andillustration taphorhtika auto prhospherhontez let us apply thetest of common instances you says adeimantus ironically inthe sixth book are so unaccustomed to speak in images and this useof examples or images though truly socratic in origin is enlarged bythe genius of plato into the form of an allegory or parable whichembodies in the concrete what has been already described or isabout to be described in the abstract thus the figure of the cave inbook vii is a recapitulation of the divisions of knowledge in book composite animal in book ix is an allegory of the parts of thesoul the noble captain and the ship and the true pilot in book vi area figure of the relation of the people to the philosophers in thestate which has been described other figures such as the dog inthe second third and fourth books or the marriage of theportionless maiden in the sixth book or the drones and wasps in theeighth and ninth books also form links of connection in longpassages or are used to recall previous discussions 
 plato is most true to the character of his master when hedescribes him as not of this world and with this representationof him the ideal state and the other paradoxes of the republic arequite in accordance though they can not be shown to have beenspeculations of socrates to him as to other great teachers bothphilosophical and religious when they looked upward the world seemedto be the embodiment of error and evil the common sense of mankindhas revolted against this view or has only partially admitted it andeven in socrates himself the sterner judgment of the multitude attimes passes into a sort of ironical pity or love men in generalare incapable of philosophy and are therefore at enmity with thephilosopher but their misunderstanding of him is unavoidable forthey have never seen him as he truly is in his own image they areonly acquainted with artificial systems possessing no native forceof truth words which admit of many applications their leadershave nothing to measure with and are therefore ignorant of theirown stature but they are to be pitied or laughed at not to bequarrelled with they mean well with their nostrums if they couldonly learn that they are cutting off a head this moderationtowards those who are in error is one of the most characteristicfeatures of socrates in the republic in all the differentrepresentations of socrates whether of xenophon or plato and thedifferences of the earlier or later dialogues he always retains thecharacter of the unwearied and disinterested seeker after which he would have ceased to be socrates 
 leaving the characters we may now analyze the contents of therepublic and then proceed to consider 
 the general aspects of thishellenic ideal of the state 
 the modern lights in which thethoughts of plato may be read

 book i 
 
 socrates glaucon 
 i went down yesterday to the piraeus with glaucon the son ofariston that i might offer up my prayers to the goddess and alsobecause i wanted to see in what manner they would celebrate thefestival which was a new thing i was delighted with the processionof the inhabitants but that of the thracians was equally if notmore beautiful when we had finished our prayers and viewed thespectacle we turned in the direction of the city and at that instantpolemarchus the son of cephalus chanced to catch sight of us from adistance as we were starting on our way home and told his servantto run and bid us wait for him the servant took hold of me by thecloak behind and said polemarchus desires you to wait 
 i turned round and asked him where his master was 
 there he is said the youth coming after you if you will onlywait 
 certainly we will said glaucon and in a few minutes polemarchusappeared and with him adeimantus brother niceratus theson of nicias and several others who had been at the procession 
 socrates polemarchus glaucon adeimantus 
 polemarchus said to me i perceive socrates that you and ourcompanion are already on your way to the city 
 you are not far wrong i said 
 but do you see he rejoined how many we are 
 of course 
 and are you stronger than all these for if not you will have toremain where you are 
 may there not be the alternative i said that we may persuade youto let us go 
 but can you persuade us if we refuse to listen to you he said 
 certainly not replied glaucon 
 then we are not going to listen of that you may be assured 
 adeimantus added has no one told you of the on horsebackin honour of the goddess which will take place in the evening 
 with horses i replied that is a novelty will horsemen carrytorches and pass them one to another during the race 
 yes said polemarchus and not only so but a festival will hecelebrated at night which you certainly ought to see let us risesoon after supper and see this festival there will be a gatheringof young men and we will have a good talk stay then and do not beperverse 
 glaucon said i suppose since you insist that we must 
 very good i replied 
 glaucon cephalus socrates 
 accordingly we went with polemarchus to his house and there wefound his brothers lysias and euthydemus and with them thrasymachusthe chalcedonian charmantides the paeanian and cleitophon the son ofaristonymus there too was cephalus the father of polemarchus whomi had not seen for a long time and i thought him very much aged hewas seated on a cushioned chair and had a garland on his head for hehad been sacrificing in the court and there were some other chairs inthe room arranged in a semicircle upon which we sat down by him hesaluted me eagerly and then he said 
 you come to see me socrates as often as you ought if i werestill able to go and see you i would not ask you to come to me but atmy age i can hardly get to the city and therefore you should comeoftener to the piraeus for let me tell you that the more thepleasures of the body fade away the greater to me is the pleasure andcharm of conversation do not then deny my request but make our houseyour resort and keep company with these young men we are old you will be quite at home with us 
 i replied there is nothing which for my part i like than conversing with aged men for i regard them astravellers who have gone a journey which i too may have to go andof whom i ought to enquire whether the way is smooth and easy orrugged and difficult and this is a question which i should like toask of you who have arrived at that time which the poets call of old age is life harder towards the end or whatreport do you give of it 
 i will tell you socrates he said what my own feeling is men ofmy age flock together we are birds of a feather as the old proverbsays and at our meetings the tale of my acquaintance commonly cannot eat i cannot drink the pleasures of youth and love arefled away there was a good time once but now that is gone andlife is no longer life some complain of the slights which are putupon them by relations and they will tell you sadly of how many evilstheir old age is the cause but to me socrates these complainersseem to blame that which is not really in fault for if old age werethe cause i too being old and every other old man would have feltas they do but this is not my own experience nor that of others whomi have known how well i remember the aged poet sophocles when inanswer to the question how does love suit with age you still the man you were peace he replied most gladlyhave i escaped the thing of which you speak i feel as if i hadescaped from a mad and furious master his words have often occurredto my mind since and they seem as good to me now as at the timewhen he uttered them for certainly old age has a great sense ofcalm and freedom when the passions relax their hold then assophocles says we are freed from the grasp not of one mad masteronly but of many the truth is socrates that these regrets andalso the complaints about relations are to be attributed to thesame cause which is not old age but characters and he who is of a calm and happy nature will hardly feel the pressureof age but to him who is of an opposite disposition youth and age areequally a burden 
 i listened in admiration and wanting to draw him out that he mightgo on yes cephalus i said but i rather suspect that people ingeneral are not convinced by you when you speak thus they thinkthat old age sits lightly upon you not because of your happydisposition but because you are rich and wealth is well known tobe a great comforter 
 you are right he replied they are not convinced and there issomething in what they say not however so much as they imagine imight answer them as themistocles answered the seriphian who wasabusing him and saying that he was famous not for his own meritsbut because he was an athenian if you had been a native of mycountry or i of yours neither of us would have been famous and tothose who are not rich and are impatient of old age the same replymay be made for to the good poor man old age cannot be a lightburden nor can a bad rich man ever have peace with himself 
 may i ask cephalus whether your fortune was for the most partinherited or acquired by you 
 acquired socrates do you want to know how much i acquired inthe art of making money i have been midway between my father andgrandfather for my grandfather whose name i bear doubled andtrebled the value of his patrimony that which he inherited being muchwhat i possess now but my father lysanias reduced the propertybelow what it is at present and i shall be satisfied if i leave tothese my sons not less but a little more than i received 
 that was why i asked you the question i replied because i see thatyou are indifferent about money which is a characteristic rather ofthose who have inherited their fortunes than of those who haveacquired them the makers of fortunes have a second love of money as acreation of their own resembling the affection of authors for theirown poems or of parents for their children besides that natural loveof it for the sake of use and profit which is common to them and allmen and hence they are very bad company for they can talk aboutnothing but the praises of wealth that is true he said 
 yes that is very true but may i ask another question what doyou consider to be the greatest blessing which you have reaped fromyour wealth 
 one he said of which i could not expect easily to convince let me tell you socrates that when a man thinks himself to benear death fears and cares enter into his mind which he never hadbefore the tales of a world below and the punishment which is exactedthere of deeds done here were once a laughing matter to him but nowhe is tormented with the thought that they may be true either fromthe weakness of age or because he is now drawing nearer to that otherplace he has a clearer view of these things suspicions and alarmscrowd thickly upon him and he begins to reflect and consider whatwrongs he has done to others and when he finds that the sum of histransgressions is great he will many a time like a child start up inhis sleep for fear and he is filled with dark forebodings but to himwho is conscious of no sin sweet hope as pindar charmingly the kind nurse of his age 
 hope he says cherishes the soul of him who lives in justice andholiness and is the nurse of his age and the companion of his which is mightiest to sway the restless soul of man 
 how admirable are his words and the great blessing of riches ido not say to every man but to a good man is that he has had nooccasion to deceive or to defraud others either intentionally orunintentionally and when he departs to the world below he is not inany apprehension about offerings due to the gods or debts which heowes to men now to this peace of mind the possession of wealthgreatly contributes and therefore i say that setting one thingagainst another of the many advantages which wealth has to give to aman of sense this is in my opinion the greatest 
 well said cephalus i replied but as concerning justice what isit to speak the truth and to pay your debts no more than even to this are there not exceptions suppose that a friendwhen in his right mind has deposited arms with me and he asks for themwhen he is not in his right mind ought i to give them back to him noone would say that i ought or that i should be right in doing more than they would say that i ought always to speak the truth toone who is in his condition 
 you are quite right he replied 
 but then i said speaking the truth and paying your debts is nota correct definition of justice 
 cephalus socrates polemarchus 
 quite correct socrates if simonides is to be believed saidpolemarchus interposing 
 i fear said cephalus that i must go now for i have to lookafter the sacrifices and i hand over the argument to polemarchusand the company 
 is not polemarchus your heir i said 
 to be sure he answered and went away laughing to the sacrifices 
 socrates polemarchus 
 tell me then o thou heir of the argument what did simonides according to you truly say about justice 
 he said that the repayment of a debt is just and in saying so heappears to me to be right 
 i should be sorry to doubt the word of such a wise and inspired his meaning though probably clear to you is the reverse of clearto me for he certainly does not mean as we were now saying that iought to return a return a deposit of arms or of anything else toone who asks for it when he is not in his right senses and yet adeposit cannot be denied to be a debt 
 true 
 then when the person who asks me is not in his right mind i am by nomeans to make the return 
 certainly not 
 when simonides said that the repayment of a debt was justice he didnot mean to include that case 
 certainly not for he thinks that a friend ought always to do goodto a friend and never evil 
 you mean that the return of a deposit of gold which is to the injuryof the receiver if the two parties are friends is not therepayment of a debt that is what you would imagine him to say 
 yes 
 and are enemies also to receive what we owe to them 
 to be sure he said they are to receive what we owe them and anenemy as i take it owes to an enemy that which is due or proper tohim that is to say evil 
 simonides then after the manner of poets would seem to havespoken darkly of the nature of justice for he really meant to saythat justice is the giving to each man what is proper to him and thishe termed a debt 
 that must have been his meaning he said 
 by heaven i replied and if we asked him what due or proper thingis given by medicine and to whom what answer do you think that hewould make to us 
 he would surely reply that medicine gives drugs and meat and drinkto human bodies 
 and what due or proper thing is given by cookery and to what 
 seasoning to food 
 and what is that which justice gives and to whom 
 if socrates we are to be guided at all by the analogy of thepreceding instances then justice is the art which gives good tofriends and evil to enemies 
 that is his meaning then 
 i think so 
 and who is best able to do good to his friends and evil to hisenemies in time of sickness 
 the physician 
 or when they are on a voyage amid the perils of the sea 
 the pilot 
 and in what sort of actions or with a view to what result is thejust man most able to do harm to his enemy and good to his friends 
 in going to war against the one and in making alliances with theother 
 but when a man is well my dear polemarchus there is no need of aphysician 
 no 
 and he who is not on a voyage has no need of a pilot 
 no 
 then in time of peace justice will be of no use 
 i am very far from thinking so 
 you think that justice may be of use in peace as well as in war 
 yes 
 like husbandry for the acquisition of corn 
 yes 
 or like shoemaking for the acquisition of shoes that is whatyou mean 
 yes 
 and what similar use or power of acquisition has justice in timeof peace 
 in contracts socrates justice is of use 
 and by contracts you mean partnerships 
 exactly 
 but is the just man or the skilful player a more useful and betterpartner at a game of draughts 
 the skilful player 
 and in the laying of bricks and stones is the just man a more usefulor better partner than the builder 
 quite the reverse 
 then in what sort of partnership is the just man a better partnerthan the as in playing the harp the iscertainly a better partner than the just man 
 in a money partnership 
 yes polemarchus but surely not in the use of money for you do notwant a just man to be your counsellor the purchase or sale of a man who is knowing about horses would be better for that would henot 
 certainly 
 and when you want to buy a ship the shipwright or the pilot wouldbe better 
 true 
 then what is that joint use of silver or gold in which the justman is to be preferred 
 when you want a deposit to be kept safely 
 you mean when money is not wanted but allowed to lie 
 precisely 
 that is to say justice is useful when money is useless 
 that is the inference 
 and when you want to keep a safe then justice isuseful to the individual and to the state but when you want to useit then the art of the 
 clearly 
 and when you want to keep a shield or a lyre and not to use would say that justice is useful but when you want to use the art of the soldier or of the musician 
 certainly 
 and so of all the other things justice is useful when they areuseless and useless when they are useful 
 that is the inference 
 then justice is not good for much but let us consider thisfurther point is not he who can best strike a blow in a boxingmatch or in any kind of fighting best able to ward off a blow 
 certainly 
 and he who is most skilful in preventing or escaping from adisease is best able to create one 
 true 
 and he is the best guard of a camp who is best able to steal a marchupon the enemy 
 certainly 
 then he who is a good keeper of anything is also a good thief 
 that i suppose is to be inferred 
 then if the just man is good at keeping money he is good atstealing it 
 that is implied in the argument 
 then after all the just man has turned out to be a thief and thisis a lesson which i suspect you must have learnt out of homer for of autolycus the maternal grandfather of odysseus who isa favourite of his affirms that 
 he was excellent above all men in theft and so you and homer and simonides are agreed that justice is anart of theft to be practised however for the good of friends and forthe harm of enemies that was what you were saying 
 no certainly not that though i do not now know what i did say buti still stand by the latter words 
 well there is another question by friends and enemies do we meanthose who are so really or only in seeming 
 surely he said a man may be expected to love those whom hethinks good and to hate those whom he thinks evil 
 yes but do not persons often err about good and evil many whoare not good seem to be so and conversely 
 that is true 
 then to them the good will be enemies and the evil will be theirfriends true 
 and in that case they will be right in doing good to the evil andevil to the good 
 clearly 
 but the good are just and would not do an injustice 
 true 
 then according to your argument it is just to injure those who do nowrong 
 nay socrates the doctrine is immoral 
 then i suppose that we ought to do good to the just and harm tothe unjust 
 i like that better 
 but see the consequence many a man who is ignorant of humannature has friends who are bad friends and in that case he ought todo harm to them and he has good enemies whom he ought to if so we shall be saying the very opposite of that which weaffirmed to be the meaning of simonides 
 very true he said and i think that we had better correct anerror into which we seem to have fallen in the use of the and enemy 
 what was the error polemarchus i asked 
 we assumed that he is a friend who seems to be or who is thoughtgood 
 and how is the error to be corrected 
 we should rather say that he is a friend who is as well as and that he who seems only and is not good only seems to beand is not a friend and of an enemy the same may be said 
 you would argue that the good are our friends and the bad ourenemies 
 yes 
 and instead of saying simply as we did at first that it is justto do good to our friends and harm to our enemies we should furthersay it is just to do good to our friends when they are good andharm to our enemies when they are evil 
 yes that appears to me to be the truth 
 but ought the just to injure any one at all 
 undoubtedly he ought to injure those who are both wicked and hisenemies 
 when horses are injured are they improved or deteriorated 
 the latter 
 deteriorated that is to say in the good qualities of horses notof dogs 
 yes of horses 
 and dogs are deteriorated in the good qualities of dogs and notof horses 
 of course 
 and will not men who are injured be deteriorated in that which isthe proper virtue of man 
 certainly 
 and that human virtue is justice 
 to be sure 
 then men who are injured are of necessity made unjust 
 that is the result 
 but can the musician by his art make men unmusical 
 certainly not 
 or the horseman by his art make them bad horsemen 
 impossible 
 and can the just by justice make men unjust or speaking general canthe good by virtue make them bad 
 assuredly not 
 any more than heat can produce cold 
 it cannot 
 or drought moisture 
 clearly not 
 nor can the good harm any one 
 impossible 
 and the just is the good 
 certainly 
 then to injure a friend or any one else is not the act of a justman but of the opposite who is the unjust 
 i think that what you say is quite true socrates 
 then if a man says that justice consists in the repayment ofdebts and that good is the debt which a man owes to his evil the debt which he owes to his enemies to say this is notwise for it is not true if as has been clearly shown theinjuring of another can be in no case just 
 i agree with you said polemarchus 
 then you and i are prepared to take up arms against any one whoattributes such a saying to simonides or bias or pittacus or anyother wise man or seer 
 i am quite ready to do battle at your side he said 
 shall i tell you whose i believe the saying to be 
 whose 
 i believe that periander or perdiccas or xerxes or ismenias thetheban or some other rich and mighty man who had a great opinionof his own power was the first to say that justice is doing goodto your friends and harm to your enemies 
 most true he said 
 yes i said but if this definition of justice also breaks other can be offered 
 several times in the course of the discussion thrasymachus hadmade an attempt to get the argument into his own hands and had beenput down by the rest of the company who wanted to hear the end butwhen polemarchus and i had done speaking and there was a pause hecould no longer hold his peace and gathering himself up he cameat us like a wild beast seeking to devour us we were at the sight of him 
 socrates polemarchus thrasymachus 
 he roared out to the whole company what folly socrates hastaken possession of you all and why sillybillies do you knock underto one another i say that if you want really to know what justice should not only ask but answer and you should not seek honourto yourself from the refutation of an opponent but have your ownanswer for there is many a one who can ask and cannot answer and nowi will not have you say that justice is duty or advantage or profit orgain or interest for this sort of nonsense will not do for me i musthave clearness and accuracy 
 i was at his words and could not look at him withouttrembling indeed i believe that if i had not fixed my eye upon him ishould have been struck dumb but when i saw his fury rising i lookedat him first and was therefore able to reply to him 
 thrasymachus i said with a quiver be hard upon and i may have been guilty of a little mistake in theargument but i can assure you that the error was not we were seeking for a piece of gold you would not imagine thatwe were knocking under to one another and so losing our chance offinding it and why when we are seeking for justice a thing moreprecious than many pieces of gold do you say that we are weaklyyielding to one another and not doing our utmost to get at thetruth nay my good friend we are most willing and anxious to doso but the fact is that we cannot and if so you people who know allthings should pity us and not be angry with us 
 how characteristic of socrates he replied with a bitter your ironical style did i not foresee have i not alreadytold you that whatever he was asked he would refuse to answer andtry irony or any other shuffle in order that he might avoidanswering 
 you are a philosopher thrasymachus i replied and well know thatif you ask a person what numbers make up twelve taking care toprohibit him whom you ask from answering twice six or three timesfour or six times two or four times three for this sort ofnonsense will not do for me then obviously that is your way ofputting the question no one can answer you but suppose that hewere to retort thrasymachus what do you mean if one of thesenumbers which you interdict be the true answer to the question am ifalsely to say some other number which is not the right one is thatyour meaning how would you answer him 
 just as if the two cases were at all alike he said 
 why should they not be i replied and even if they are not butonly appear to be so to the person who is asked ought he not to saywhat he thinks whether you and i forbid him or not 
 i presume then that you are going to make one of the interdictedanswers 
 i dare say that i may notwithstanding the danger if uponreflection i approve of any of them 
 but what if i give you an answer about justice other and said than any of these what do you deserve to have done to you 
 done to me as becomes the ignorant i must learn from the is what i deserve to have done to me 
 what and no payment a pleasant notion 
 i will pay when i have the money i replied 
 socrates thrasymachus glaucon 
 but you have socrates said glaucon and you thrasymachus need beunder no anxiety about money for we will all make a contributionfor socrates 
 yes he replied and then socrates will do as he always to answer himself but take and pull to pieces the answerof some one else 
 why my good friend i said how can any one answer who knows andsays that he knows just nothing and who even if he has some faintnotions of his own is told by a man of authority not to utter natural thing is that the speaker should be some one likeyourself who professes to know and can tell what he knows will youthen kindly answer for the edification of the company and of myself 
 glaucon and the rest of the company joined in my request andthrasymachus as any one might see was in reality eager to speak forhe thought that he had an excellent answer and would distinguishhimself but at first he to insist on my answering at length heconsented to begin behold he said the wisdom of socrates herefuses to teach himself and goes about learning of others to whomhe never even says thank you 
 that i learn of others i replied is quite true but that i amungrateful i wholly deny money i have none and therefore i pay inpraise which is all i have and how ready i am to praise any onewho appears to me to speak well you will very soon find out when youanswer for i expect that you will answer well 
 listen then he said i proclaim that justice is nothing elsethan the interest of the stronger and now why do you not me but ofcourse you 
 let me first understand you i replied justice as you say isthe interest of the stronger what thrasymachus is the meaning ofthis you cannot mean to say that because polydamas thepancratiast is stronger than we are and finds the eating of beefconducive to his bodily strength that to eat beef is thereforeequally for our good who are weaker than he is and right and just forus 
 abominable of you socrates you take the words in thesense which is most damaging to the argument 
 not at all my good sir i said i am trying to understand them andi wish that you would be a little clearer 
 well he said have you never heard that forms of government are tyrannies and there are democracies and there arearistocracies 
 yes i know 
 and the government is the ruling power in each state 
 certainly 
 and the different forms of government make laws tyrannical with a view to their several these laws which are made by them for their own interests arethe justice which they deliver to their subjects and him whotransgresses them they punish as a breaker of the law and unjust andthat is what i mean when i say that in all states there is the sameprinciple of justice which is the interest of the government andas the government must be supposed to have power the onlyreasonable conclusion is that everywhere there is one principle ofjustice which is the interest of the stronger 
 now i understand you i said and whether you are right or not iwill try to discover but let me remark that in defining justiceyou have yourself used the word interest which you forbade me touse it is true however that in your definition the words of thestronger are added 
 a small addition you must allow he said 
 great or small never mind about that we must first enquire whetherwhat you are saying is the truth now we are both agreed thatjustice is interest of some sort but you go on to say of thestronger about this addition i am not so sure and must thereforeconsider further 
 proceed 
 i will and first tell me do you admit that it is just orsubjects to obey their rulers 
 i do 
 but are the rulers of states absolutely infallible or are theysometimes liable to err 
 to be sure he replied they are liable to err 
 then in making their laws they may sometimes make them sometimes not 
 true 
 when they make them rightly they make them agreeably to theirinterest when they are mistaken contrary to their interest youadmit that 
 yes 
 and the laws which they make must be obeyed by their subjects andthat is what you call justice 
 doubtless 
 then justice according to your argument is not only obedience tothe interest of the stronger but the reverse 
 what is that you are saying he asked 
 i am only repeating what you are saying i believe but let usconsider have we not admitted that the rulers may be mistaken abouttheir own interest in what they command and also that to obey them isjustice has not that been admitted 
 yes 
 then you must also have acknowledged justice not to be for theinterest of the stronger when the rulers unintentionally commandthings to be done which are to their own injury for if as you is the obedience which the subject renders to theircommands in that case o wisest of men is there any escape fromthe conclusion that the weaker are commanded to do not what is forthe interest but what is for the injury of the stronger 
 nothing can be clearer socrates said polemarchus 
 socrates cleitophon polemarchus thrasymachus 
 yes said cleitophon interposing if you are allowed to be hiswitness 
 but there is no need of any witness said polemarchus forthrasymachus himself acknowledges that rulers may sometimes commandwhat is not for their own interest and that for subjects to obey themis justice 
 yes polemarchus thrasymachus said that for subjects to do whatwas commanded by their rulers is just 
 yes cleitophon but he also said that justice is the interest ofthe stronger and while admitting both these propositions he furtheracknowledged that the stronger may command the weaker who are hissubjects to do what is not for his own interest whence follows thatjustice is the injury quite as much as the interest of the stronger 
 but said cleitophon he meant by the interest of the strongerwhat the stronger thought to be his interest this was what theweaker had to do and this was affirmed by him to be justice 
 those were not his words rejoined polemarchus 
 socrates thrasymachus 
 never mind i replied if he now says that they are let us accepthis statement tell me thrasymachus i said did you mean byjustice what the stronger thought to be his interest whether reallyso or not 
 certainly not he said do you suppose that i call him who ismistaken the stronger at the time when he is mistaken 
 yes i said my impression was that you did so when you admittedthat the ruler was not infallible but might be sometimes mistaken 
 you argue like an informer socrates do you mean for example thathe who is mistaken about the sick is a physician in that he ismistaken or that he who errs in arithmetic or grammar is anarithmetician or grammarian at the me when he is making the respect of the mistake true we say that the physician orarithmetician or grammarian has made a mistake but this is only a wayof speaking for the fact is that neither the grammarian nor any otherperson of skill ever makes a mistake in so far as he is what hisname implies they none of them err unless their skill fails them andthen they cease to be skilled artists no artist or sage or ruler errsat the time when he is what his name implies though he is commonlysaid to err and i adopted the common mode of speaking but to beperfectly accurate since you are such a lover of accuracy weshould say that the ruler in so far as he is the ruler isunerring and being unerring always commands that which is for hisown interest and the subject is required to execute his commands andtherefore as i said at first and now repeat justice is theinterest of the stronger 
 indeed thrasymachus and do i really appear to you to argue like aninformer 
 certainly he replied 
 and you suppose that i ask these questions with any design ofinjuring you in the argument 
 nay he replied suppose is not the word i know it but you willbe found out and by sheer force of argument you will never prevail 
 i shall not make the attempt my dear man but to avoid anymisunderstanding occurring between us in future let me ask in whatsense do you speak of a ruler or stronger whose interest as youwere saying he being the superior it is just that the inferiorshould execute is he a ruler in the popular or in the strict senseof the term 
 in the strictest of all senses he said and now cheat and playthe informer if you can i ask no quarter at your hands but you neverwill be able never 
 and do you imagine i said that i am such a madman as to try andcheat thrasymachus i might as well shave a lion 
 why he said you made the attempt a minute ago and you failed 
 enough i said of these civilities it will be better that i shouldask you a question is the physician taken in that strict sense ofwhich you are speaking a healer of the sick or a maker of remember that i am now speaking of the true physician 
 a healer of the sick he replied 
 and the pilot that is to say the true pilot is he a captainof sailors or a mere sailor 
 a captain of sailors 
 the circumstance that he sails in the ship is not to be taken intoaccount neither is he to be called a sailor the name pilot bywhich he is distinguished has nothing to do with sailing but issignificant of his skill and of his authority over the sailors 
 very true he said 
 now i said every art has an interest 
 certainly 
 for which the art has to consider and provide 
 yes that is the aim of art 
 and the interest of any art is the perfection of it this andnothing else 
 what do you mean 
 i mean what i may illustrate negatively by the example of thebody suppose you were to ask me whether the body is orhas wants i should reply certainly the body has wants for thebody may be ill and require to be cured and has therefore intereststo which the art of medicine ministers and this is the origin andintention of medicine as you will acknowledge am i not right 
 quite right he replied 
 but is the art of medicine or any other art faulty or deficient inany quality in the same way that the eye may be deficient in sightor the ear fail of hearing and therefore requires another art toprovide for the interests of seeing and hearing has art in itself isay any similar liability to fault or defect and does every artrequire another supplementary art to provide for its interests andthat another and another without end or have the arts to look onlyafter their own interests or have they no need either of themselvesor of another having no faults or defects they have no need tocorrect them either by the exercise of their own art or of any have only to consider the interest of their forevery art remains pure and faultless while remaining true that is tosay while perfect and unimpaired take the words in your precisesense and tell me whether i am not right 
 yes clearly 
 then medicine does not consider the interest of medicine but theinterest of the body 
 true he said 
 nor does the art of horsemanship consider the interests of the artof horsemanship but the interests of the horse neither do anyother arts care for themselves for they have no needs they care onlyfor that which is the subject of their art 
 true he said 
 but surely thrasymachus the arts are the superiors and rulers oftheir own subjects 
 to this he assented with a good deal of reluctance 
 then i said no science or art considers or enjoins the interest ofthe stronger or superior but only the interest of the subject andweaker 
 he made an attempt to contest this proposition also but finallyacquiesced 
 then i continued no physician in so far as he is a his own good in what he prescribes but the good of hispatient for the true physician is also a ruler having the humanbody as a subject and is not a mere that has beenadmitted 
 yes 
 and the pilot likewise in the strict sense of the term is aruler of sailors and not a mere sailor 
 that has been admitted 
 and such a pilot and ruler will provide and prescribe for theinterest of the sailor who is under him and not for his own or interest 
 he gave a reluctant yes 
 then i said thrasymachus there is no one in any rule who in sofar as he is a ruler considers or enjoins what is for his owninterest but always what is for the interest of his subject orsuitable to his art to that he looks and that alone he considersin everything which he says and does 
 when we had got to this point in the argument and every one sawthat the definition of justice had been completely instead of replying to me said tell me socrates haveyou got a nurse 
 why do you ask such a question i said when you ought rather tobe answering 
 because she leaves you to snivel and never wipes your nose she hasnot even taught you to know the shepherd from the sheep 
 what makes you say that i replied 
 because you fancy that the shepherd or neatherd fattens of tends thesheep or oxen with a view to their own good and not to the good ofhimself or his master and you further imagine that the rulers ofstates if they are true rulers never think of their subjects assheep and that they are not studying their own advantage day andnight oh no and so entirely astray are you in your ideas aboutthe just and unjust as not even to know that justice and the justare in reality good that is to say the interest of theruler and stronger and the loss of the subject and servant andinjustice the opposite for the unjust is lord over the truly simpleand just he is the stronger and his subjects do what is for hisinterest and minister to his happiness which is very far frombeing their own consider further most foolish socrates that thejust is always a loser in comparison with the unjust first of all inprivate contracts wherever the unjust is the partner of the justyou will find that when the partnership is dissolved the unjustman has always more and the just less secondly in their dealingswith the state when there is an income tax the just man will paymore and the unjust less on the same amount of income and whenthere is anything to be received the one gains nothing and the othermuch observe also what happens when they take an office there is thejust man neglecting his affairs and perhaps suffering other getting nothing out of the public because he is just moreover heis hated by his friends and acquaintance for refusing to serve them inunlawful ways but all this is reversed in the case of the unjust am speaking as before of injustice on a large scale in which theadvantage of the unjust is more apparent and my meaning will bemost clearly seen if we turn to that highest form of injustice inwhich the criminal is the happiest of men and the sufferers orthose who refuse to do injustice are the most miserable that is tosay tyranny which by fraud and force takes away the property ofothers not little by little but wholesale comprehending in sacred as well as profane private and public for which actsof wrong if he were detected perpetrating any one of them would be punished and incur great disgrace they who do such wrongin particular cases are called robbers of temples and burglars and swindlers and thieves but when a man besidestaking away the money of the citizens has made slaves of them of these names of reproach he is termed happy and only by the citizens but by all who hear of his having achievedthe consummation of injustice for mankind censure that they may be the victims of it and not because they shrinkfrom committing it and thus as i have shown socrates on a sufficient scale has more strength and freedom andmastery than justice and as i said at first justice is the interestof the stronger whereas injustice is a own profit and interest 
 thrasymachus when he had thus spoken having like a our ears with his words had a mind to go away but thecompany would not let him they insisted that he should remain anddefend his position and i myself added my own humble request thathe would not leave us thrasymachus i said to him excellent man howsuggestive are your remarks and are you going to run away beforeyou have fairly taught or learned whether they are true or not is theattempt to determine the way of life so small a matter in youreyes to determine how life may be passed by each one of us to thegreatest advantage 
 and do i differ from you he said as to the importance of theenquiry 
 you appear rather i replied to have no care or thought about whether we live better or worse from not knowing whatyou say you know is to you a matter of indifference prithee not keep your knowledge to yourself we are a large party andany benefit which you confer upon us will be amply rewarded for myown part i openly declare that i am not convinced and that i do notbelieve injustice to be more gainful than justice even ifuncontrolled and allowed to have free play for granting that theremay be an unjust man who is able to commit injustice either by fraudor force still this does not convince me of the superior advantage ofinjustice and there may be others who are in the same predicamentwith myself perhaps we may be wrong if so you in your wisdom shouldconvince us that we are mistaken in preferring justice to injustice 
 and how am i to convince you he said if you are not alreadyconvinced by what i have just said what more can i do for you have me put the proof bodily into your souls 
 heaven forbid i said i would only ask you to be consistent or ifyou change change openly and let there be no deception for i mustremark thrasymachus if you will recall what was previously although you began by defining the true physician in an exactsense you did not observe a like exactness when speaking of theshepherd you thought that the shepherd as a shepherd tends thesheep not with a view to their own good but like a mere diner orbanqueter with a view to the pleasures of the table or again as atrader for sale in the market and not as a shepherd yet surely theart of the shepherd is concerned only with the good of his has only to provide the best for them since the perfection ofthe art is already ensured whenever all the requirements of it aresatisfied and that was what i was saying just now about the conceived that the art of the ruler considered as ruler whether ina state or in private life could only regard the good of his flock orsubjects whereas you seem to think that the rulers in states that isto say the true rulers like being in authority 
 think nay i am sure of it 
 then why in the case of lesser offices do men never take themwillingly without payment unless under the idea that they governfor the advantage not of themselves but of others let me ask you aquestion are not the several arts different by reason of theireach having a separate function and my dear illustrious friend dosay what you think that we may make a little progress 
 yes that is the difference he replied 
 and each art gives us a particular good and not merely a general for example gives us health navigation safety at so on 
 yes he said 
 and the art of payment has the special function of giving pay butwe do not confuse this with other arts any more than the art of thepilot is to be confused with the art of medicine because the healthof the pilot may be improved by a sea voyage you would not beinclined to say would you that navigation is the art of medicine atleast if we are to adopt your exact use of language 
 certainly not 
 or because a man is in good health when he receives pay you wouldnot say that the art of payment is medicine 
 i should say not 
 nor would you say that medicine is the art of receiving paybecause a man takes fees when he is engaged in healing 
 certainly not 
 and we have admitted i said that the good of each art is speciallyconfined to the art 
 yes 
 then if there be any good which all artists have in common that isto be attributed to something of which they all have the common use 
 true he replied 
 and when the artist is benefited by receiving pay the advantage isgained by an additional use of the art of pay which is not the artprofessed by him 
 he gave a reluctant assent to this 
 then the pay is not derived by the several artists from theirrespective arts but the truth is that while the art of medicinegives health and the art of the builder builds a house another artattends them which is the art of pay the various arts may be doingtheir own business and benefiting that over which they preside butwould the artist receive any benefit from his art unless he werepaid as well 
 i suppose not 
 but does he therefore confer no benefit when he works for nothing 
 certainly he confers a benefit 
 then now thrasymachus there is no longer any doubt that neitherarts nor governments provide for their own interests but as wewere before saying they rule and provide for the interests of theirsubjects who are the weaker and not the stronger to their goodthey attend and not to the good of the superior 
 and this is the reason my dear thrasymachus why as i was just nowsaying no one is willing to govern because no one likes to take inhand the reformation of evils which are not his concern withoutremuneration for in the execution of his work and in giving hisorders to another the true artist does not regard his own always that of his subjects and therefore in order that rulersmay be willing to rule they must be paid in one of three modes ofpayment money or honour or a penalty for refusing 
 socrates glaucon 
 what do you mean socrates said glaucon the first two modes ofpayment are intelligible enough but what the penalty is i do notunderstand or how a penalty can be a payment 
 you mean that you do not understand the nature of this payment whichto the best men is the great inducement to rule of course you knowthat ambition and avarice are held to be as indeed they are adisgrace 
 very true 
 and for this reason i said money and honour have no attraction forthem good men do not wish to be openly demanding payment forgoverning and so to get the name of hirelings nor by secretly helpingthemselves out of the public revenues to get the name of not being ambitious they do not care about honour whereforenecessity must be laid upon them and they must be induced to servefrom the fear of punishment and this as i imagine is the reason whythe forwardness to take office instead of waiting to be been deemed dishonourable now the worst part of the punishment isthat he who refuses to rule is liable to be ruled by one who isworse than himself and the fear of this as i conceive induces thegood to take office not because they would but because they cannothelp not under the idea that they are going to have any benefit orenjoyment themselves but as a necessity and because they are notable to commit the task of ruling to any one who is better thanthemselves or indeed as good for there is reason to think that ifa city were composed entirely of good men then to avoid officewould be as much an object of contention as to obtain office is atpresent then we should have plain proof that the true ruler is notmeant by nature to regard his own interest but that of hissubjects and every one who knew this would choose rather to receive abenefit from another than to have the trouble of conferring one sofar am i from agreeing with thrasymachus that justice is theinterest of the stronger this latter question need not be furtherdiscussed at present but when thrasymachus says that the life ofthe unjust is more advantageous than that of the just his newstatement appears to me to be of a far more serious character whichof us has spoken truly and which sort of life glaucon do youprefer 
 i for my part deem the life of the just to be the more answered 
 did you hear all the advantages of the unjust which thrasymachus wasrehearsing 
 yes i heard him he replied but he has not convinced me 
 then shall we try to find some way of convincing him if we he is saying what is not true 
 most certainly he replied 
 if i said he makes a set speech and we make another recounting allthe advantages of being just and he answers and we rejoin there mustbe a numbering and measuring of the goods which are claimed oneither side and in the end we shall want judges to decide but ifwe proceed in our enquiry as we lately did by making admissions toone another we shall unite the offices of judge and advocate in ourown persons 
 very good he said 
 and which method do i understand you to prefer i said 
 that which you propose 
 well then thrasymachus i said suppose you begin at the beginningand answer me you say that perfect injustice is more gainful thanperfect justice 
 socrates glaucon thrasymachus 
 yes that is what i say and i have given you my reasons 
 and what is your view about them would you call one of themvirtue and the other vice 
 certainly 
 i suppose that you would call justice virtue and injustice vice 
 what a charming notion so likely too seeing that i affirminjustice to be profitable and justice not 
 what else then would you say 
 the opposite he replied 
 and would you call justice vice 
 no i would rather say sublime simplicity 
 then would you call injustice malignity 
 no i would rather say discretion 
 and do the unjust appear to you to be wise and good 
 yes he said at any rate those of them who are able to be perfectlyunjust and who have the power of subduing states and nations butperhaps you imagine me to be talking of cutpurses 
 even this profession if undetected has advantages though they arenot to be compared with those of which i was just now speaking 
 i do not think that i misapprehend your meaning thrasymachus ireplied but still i cannot hear without amazement that you classinjustice with wisdom and virtue and justice with the opposite 
 certainly i do so class them 
 now i said you are on more substantial and almost unanswerableground for if the injustice which you were maintaining to beprofitable had been admitted by you as by others to be vice anddeformity an answer might have been given to you on receivedprinciples but now i perceive that you will call injustice honourableand strong and to the unjust you will attribute all the qualitieswhich were attributed by us before to the just seeing that you do nothesitate to rank injustice with wisdom and virtue 
 you have guessed most infallibly he replied 
 then i certainly ought not to shrink from going through with theargument so long as i have reason to think that you thrasymachus arespeaking your real mind for i do believe that you are now inearnest and are not amusing yourself at our expense 
 i may be in earnest or not but what is that to you to refute theargument is your business 
 very true i said that is what i have to do but will you be sogood as answer yet one more question does the just man try to gainany advantage over the just 
 far otherwise if he did would not be the simple amusing creaturewhich he is 
 and would he try to go beyond just action 
 he would not 
 and how would he regard the attempt to gain an advantage over theunjust would that be considered by him as just or unjust 
 he would think it just and would try to gain the advantage buthe would not be able 
 whether he would or would not be able i said is not to thepoint my question is only whether the just man while refusing tohave more than another just man would wish and claim to have morethan the unjust 
 yes he would 
 and what of the unjust does he claim to have more than the justman and to do more than is just 
 of course he said for he claims to have more than all men 
 and the unjust man will strive and struggle to obtain more thanthe unjust man or action in order that he may have more than all 
 true 
 we may put the matter thus i said the just does not desire morethan his like but more than his unlike whereas the unjust desiresmore than both his like and his unlike 
 nothing he said can be better than that statement 
 and the unjust is good and wise and the just is neither 
 good again he said 
 and is not the unjust like the wise and good and the just unlikethem 
 of course he said he who is of a certain nature is like those whoare of a certain nature he who is not not 
 each of them i said is such as his like is 
 certainly he replied 
 very good thrasymachus i said and now to take the case of thearts you would admit that one man is a musician and another not amusician 
 yes 
 and which is wise and which is foolish 
 clearly the musician is wise and he who is not a musician isfoolish 
 and he is good in as far as he is wise and bad in as far as he isfoolish 
 yes 
 and you would say the same sort of thing of the physician 
 yes 
 and do you think my excellent friend that a musician when headjusts the lyre would desire or claim to exceed or go beyond amusician in the tightening and loosening the strings 
 i do not think that he would 
 but he would claim to exceed the 
 of course 
 and what would you say of the physician in prescribing meats anddrinks would he wish to go beyond another physician or beyond thepractice of medicine 
 he would not 
 but he would wish to go beyond the 
 yes 
 and about knowledge and ignorance in general see whether youthink that any man who has knowledge ever would wish to have thechoice of saying or doing more than another man who has he not rather say or do the same as his like in the same case 
 that i suppose can hardly be denied 
 and what of the ignorant would he not desire to have more thaneither the knowing or the ignorant 
 i dare say 
 and the knowing is wise 
 yes 
 and the wise is good 
 true 
 then the wise and good will not desire to gain more than his more than his unlike and opposite 
 i suppose so 
 whereas the bad and ignorant will desire to gain more than both 
 yes 
 but did we not say thrasymachus that the unjust goes beyond bothhis like and unlike were not these your words they were 
 they were 
 and you also said that the lust will not go beyond his like buthis unlike 
 yes 
 then the just is like the wise and good and the unjust like theevil and ignorant 
 that is the inference 
 and each of them is such as his like is 
 that was admitted 
 then the just has turned out to be wise and good and the unjust eviland ignorant 
 thrasymachus made all these admissions not fluently as i repeatthem but with extreme reluctance it was a hot day andthe perspiration poured from him in torrents and then i saw what ihad never seen before thrasymachus blushing as we were now agreedthat justice was virtue and wisdom and injustice vice andignorance i proceeded to another point 
 well i said thrasymachus that matter is now settled but werewe not also saying that injustice had strength do you remember 
 yes i remember he said but do not suppose that i approve ofwhat you are saying or have no answer if however i were to would be quite certain to accuse me of haranguing thereforeeither permit me to have my say out or if you would rather ask doso and i will answer very good as they say to oldwomen and will nod yes and no 
 certainly not i said if contrary to your real opinion 
 yes he said i will to please you since you will not let mespeak what else would you have 
 nothing in the world i said and if you are so disposed i willask and you shall answer 
 proceed 
 then i will repeat the question which i asked before in orderthat our examination of the relative nature of justice and injusticemay be carried on regularly a statement was made that injustice isstronger and more powerful than justice but now justice havingbeen identified with wisdom and virtue is easily shown to be strongerthan injustice if injustice is ignorance this can no longer bequestioned by any one but i want to view the matter thrasymachus ina different way you would not deny that a state may be unjust and maybe unjustly attempting to enslave other states or may have alreadyenslaved them and may be holding many of them in subjection 
 true he replied and i will add the best and perfectly unjust statewill be most likely to do so 
 i know i said that such was your position but what i wouldfurther consider is whether this power which is possessed by thesuperior state can exist or be exercised without justice 
 if you are right in you view and justice is wisdom then onlywith justice but if i am right then without justice 
 i am delighted thrasymachus to see you not only nodding assent anddissent but making answers which are quite excellent 
 that is out of civility to you he replied 
 you are very kind i said and would you have the goodness also toinform me whether you think that a state or an army or a band ofrobbers and thieves or any other gang of could act atall if they injured one another 
 no indeed he said they could not 
 but if they abstained from injuring one another then they might acttogether better 
 yes 
 and this is because injustice creates divisions and hatreds andfighting and justice imparts harmony and friendship is not thattrue thrasymachus 
 i agree he said because i do not wish to quarrel with you 
 how good of you i said but i should like to know also whetherinjustice having this tendency to arouse hatred wherever slaves or among freemen will not make them hate one another andset them at variance and render them incapable of common action 
 certainly 
 and even if injustice be found in two only will they not quarreland fight and become enemies to one another and to the just 
 they will 
 and suppose injustice abiding in a single person would yourwisdom say that she loses or that she retains her natural power 
 let us assume that she retains her power 
 yet is not the power which injustice exercises of such a nature thatwherever she takes up her abode whether in a city in an army in afamily or in any other body that body is to begin with renderedincapable of united action by reason of sedition and does it not become its own enemy and at variance with all thatopposes it and with the just is not this the case 
 yes certainly 
 and is not injustice equally fatal when existing in a single the first place rendering him incapable of action because he is notat unity with himself and in the second place making him an enemyto himself and the just is not that true thrasymachus 
 yes 
 and o my friend i said surely the gods are just 
 granted that they are 
 but if so the unjust will be the enemy of the gods and the justwill be their friend 
 feast away in triumph and take your fill of the argument i willnot oppose you lest i should displease the company 
 well then proceed with your answers and let me have theremainder of my repast for we have already shown that the just areclearly wiser and better and abler than the unjust and that theunjust are incapable of common action nay ing at more that tospeak as we did of men who are evil acting at any time vigorouslytogether is not strictly true for if they had been perfectly would have laid hands upon one another but it is evident thatthere must have been some remnant of justice in them which enabledthem to combine if there had not been they would have injured oneanother as well as their victims they were but half villains intheir enterprises for had they been whole villains and utterlyunjust they would have been utterly incapable of action that as ibelieve is the truth of the matter and not what you said at whether the just have a better and happier life than the unjust isa further question which we also proposed to consider i think thatthey have and for the reasons which to have given but still i shouldlike to examine further for no light matter is at stake nothing lessthan the rule of human life 
 proceed 
 i will proceed by asking a question would you not say that ahorse has some end 
 i should 
 and the end or use of a horse or of anything would be that whichcould not be accomplished or not so well accomplished by any otherthing 
 i do not understand he said 
 let me explain can you see except with the eye 
 certainly not 
 or hear except with the ear 
 no 
 these then may be truly said to be the ends of these organs 
 they may 
 but you can cut off a with a dagger or with a in many other ways 
 of course 
 and yet not so well as with a made for the purpose 
 true 
 may we not say that this is the end of a 
 we may 
 then now i think you will have no difficulty in understanding mymeaning when i asked the question whether the end of anything would bethat which could not be accomplished or not so well any other thing 
 i understand your meaning he said and assent 
 and that to which an end is appointed has also an excellence need iask again whether the eye has an end 
 it has 
 and has not the eye an excellence 
 yes 
 and the ear has an end and an excellence also 
 true 
 and the same is true of all other things they have each of theman end and a special excellence 
 that is so 
 well and can the eyes fulfil their end if they are wanting in theirown proper excellence and have a defect instead 
 how can they he said if they are blind and cannot see 
 you mean to say if they have lost their proper excellence which issight but i have not arrived at that point yet i would rather askthe question more generally and only enquire whether the things whichfulfil their ends fulfil them by their own proper excellence and fallof fulfilling them by their own defect 
 certainly he replied 
 i might say the same of the ears when deprived of their ownproper excellence they cannot fulfil their end 
 true 
 and the same observation will apply to all other things 
 i agree 
 well and has not the soul an end which nothing else can fulfil forexample to superintend and command and deliberate and the like arenot these functions proper to the soul and can they rightly beassigned to any other 
 to no other 
 and is not life to be reckoned among the ends of the soul 
 assuredly he said 
 and has not the soul an excellence also 
 yes 
 and can she or can she not fulfil her own ends when deprived of thatexcellence 
 she cannot 
 then an evil soul must necessarily be an evil ruler andsuperintendent and the good soul a good ruler 
 yes necessarily 
 and we have admitted that justice is the excellence of the soul andinjustice the defect of the soul 
 that has been admitted 
 then the just soul and the just man will live well and the unjustman will live ill 
 that is what your argument proves 
 and he who lives well is blessed and happy and he who lives ill thereverse of happy 
 certainly 
 then the just is happy and the unjust miserable 
 so be it 
 but happiness and not misery is profitable 
 of course 
 then my blessed thrasymachus injustice can never be moreprofitable than justice 
 let this socrates he said be your entertainment at the bendidea 
 for which i am indebted to you i said now that you have growngentle towards me and have left off scolding nevertheless i have notbeen well entertained but that was my own fault and not yours asan epicure snatches a taste of every dish which is successivelybrought to table he not having allowed himself time to enjoy theone before so have i gone from one subject to another withouthaving discovered what i sought at first the nature of justice ileft that enquiry and turned away to consider whether justice isvirtue and wisdom or evil and folly and when there arose a furtherquestion about the comparative advantages of justice and could not refrain from passing on to that and the result of thewhole discussion has been that i know nothing at all for i know notwhat justice is and therefore i am not likely to know whether it isor is not a virtue nor can i say whether the just man is happy or unhappy

 book i 
 
 socrates glaucon 
 i went down yesterday to the piraeus with glaucon the son ofariston that i might offer up my prayers to the goddess and alsobecause i wanted to see in what manner they would celebrate thefestival which was a new thing i was delighted with the processionof the inhabitants but that of the thracians was equally if notmore beautiful when we had finished our prayers and viewed thespectacle we turned in the direction of the city and at that instantpolemarchus the son of cephalus chanced to catch sight of us from adistance as we were starting on our way home and told his servantto run and bid us wait for him the servant took hold of me by thecloak behind and said polemarchus desires you to wait 
 i turned round and asked him where his master was 
 there he is said the youth coming after you if you will onlywait 
 certainly we will said glaucon and in a few minutes polemarchusappeared and with him adeimantus brother niceratus theson of nicias and several others who had been at the procession 
 socrates polemarchus glaucon adeimantus 
 polemarchus said to me i perceive socrates that you and ourcompanion are already on your way to the city 
 you are not far wrong i said 
 but do you see he rejoined how many we are 
 of course 
 and are you stronger than all these for if not you will have toremain where you are 
 may there not be the alternative i said that we may persuade youto let us go 
 but can you persuade us if we refuse to listen to you he said 
 certainly not replied glaucon 
 then we are not going to listen of that you may be assured 
 adeimantus added has no one told you of the on horsebackin honour of the goddess which will take place in the evening 
 with horses i replied that is a novelty will horsemen carrytorches and pass them one to another during the race 
 yes said polemarchus and not only so but a festival will hecelebrated at night which you certainly ought to see let us risesoon after supper and see this festival there will be a gatheringof young men and we will have a good talk stay then and do not beperverse 
 glaucon said i suppose since you insist that we must 
 very good i replied 
 glaucon cephalus socrates 
 accordingly we went with polemarchus to his house and there wefound his brothers lysias and euthydemus and with them thrasymachusthe chalcedonian charmantides the paeanian and cleitophon the son ofaristonymus there too was cephalus the father of polemarchus whomi had not seen for a long time and i thought him very much aged hewas seated on a cushioned chair and had a garland on his head for hehad been sacrificing in the court and there were some other chairs inthe room arranged in a semicircle upon which we sat down by him hesaluted me eagerly and then he said 
 you come to see me socrates as often as you ought if i werestill able to go and see you i would not ask you to come to me but atmy age i can hardly get to the city and therefore you should comeoftener to the piraeus for let me tell you that the more thepleasures of the body fade away the greater to me is the pleasure andcharm of conversation do not then deny my request but make our houseyour resort and keep company with these young men we are old you will be quite at home with us 
 i replied there is nothing which for my part i like than conversing with aged men for i regard them astravellers who have gone a journey which i too may have to go andof whom i ought to enquire whether the way is smooth and easy orrugged and difficult and this is a question which i should like toask of you who have arrived at that time which the poets call of old age is life harder towards the end or whatreport do you give of it 
 i will tell you socrates he said what my own feeling is men ofmy age flock together we are birds of a feather as the old proverbsays and at our meetings the tale of my acquaintance commonly cannot eat i cannot drink the pleasures of youth and love arefled away there was a good time once but now that is gone andlife is no longer life some complain of the slights which are putupon them by relations and they will tell you sadly of how many evilstheir old age is the cause but to me socrates these complainersseem to blame that which is not really in fault for if old age werethe cause i too being old and every other old man would have feltas they do but this is not my own experience nor that of others whomi have known how well i remember the aged poet sophocles when inanswer to the question how does love suit with age you still the man you were peace he replied most gladlyhave i escaped the thing of which you speak i feel as if i hadescaped from a mad and furious master his words have often occurredto my mind since and they seem as good to me now as at the timewhen he uttered them for certainly old age has a great sense ofcalm and freedom when the passions relax their hold then assophocles says we are freed from the grasp not of one mad masteronly but of many the truth is socrates that these regrets andalso the complaints about relations are to be attributed to thesame cause which is not old age but characters and he who is of a calm and happy nature will hardly feel the pressureof age but to him who is of an opposite disposition youth and age areequally a burden 
 i listened in admiration and wanting to draw him out that he mightgo on yes cephalus i said but i rather suspect that people ingeneral are not convinced by you when you speak thus they thinkthat old age sits lightly upon you not because of your happydisposition but because you are rich and wealth is well known tobe a great comforter 
 you are right he replied they are not convinced and there issomething in what they say not however so much as they imagine imight answer them as themistocles answered the seriphian who wasabusing him and saying that he was famous not for his own meritsbut because he was an athenian if you had been a native of mycountry or i of yours neither of us would have been famous and tothose who are not rich and are impatient of old age the same replymay be made for to the good poor man old age cannot be a lightburden nor can a bad rich man ever have peace with himself 
 may i ask cephalus whether your fortune was for the most partinherited or acquired by you 
 acquired socrates do you want to know how much i acquired inthe art of making money i have been midway between my father andgrandfather for my grandfather whose name i bear doubled andtrebled the value of his patrimony that which he inherited being muchwhat i possess now but my father lysanias reduced the propertybelow what it is at present and i shall be satisfied if i leave tothese my sons not less but a little more than i received 
 that was why i asked you the question i replied because i see thatyou are indifferent about money which is a characteristic rather ofthose who have inherited their fortunes than of those who haveacquired them the makers of fortunes have a second love of money as acreation of their own resembling the affection of authors for theirown poems or of parents for their children besides that natural loveof it for the sake of use and profit which is common to them and allmen and hence they are very bad company for they can talk aboutnothing but the praises of wealth that is true he said 
 yes that is very true but may i ask another question what doyou consider to be the greatest blessing which you have reaped fromyour wealth 
 one he said of which i could not expect easily to convince let me tell you socrates that when a man thinks himself to benear death fears and cares enter into his mind which he never hadbefore the tales of a world below and the punishment which is exactedthere of deeds done here were once a laughing matter to him but nowhe is tormented with the thought that they may be true either fromthe weakness of age or because he is now drawing nearer to that otherplace he has a clearer view of these things suspicions and alarmscrowd thickly upon him and he begins to reflect and consider whatwrongs he has done to others and when he finds that the sum of histransgressions is great he will many a time like a child start up inhis sleep for fear and he is filled with dark forebodings but to himwho is conscious of no sin sweet hope as pindar charmingly the kind nurse of his age 
 hope he says cherishes the soul of him who lives in justice andholiness and is the nurse of his age and the companion of his which is mightiest to sway the restless soul of man 
 how admirable are his words and the great blessing of riches ido not say to every man but to a good man is that he has had nooccasion to deceive or to defraud others either intentionally orunintentionally and when he departs to the world below he is not inany apprehension about offerings due to the gods or debts which heowes to men now to this peace of mind the possession of wealthgreatly contributes and therefore i say that setting one thingagainst another of the many advantages which wealth has to give to aman of sense this is in my opinion the greatest 
 well said cephalus i replied but as concerning justice what isit to speak the truth and to pay your debts no more than even to this are there not exceptions suppose that a friendwhen in his right mind has deposited arms with me and he asks for themwhen he is not in his right mind ought i to give them back to him noone would say that i ought or that i should be right in doing more than they would say that i ought always to speak the truth toone who is in his condition 
 you are quite right he replied 
 but then i said speaking the truth and paying your debts is nota correct definition of justice 
 cephalus socrates polemarchus 
 quite correct socrates if simonides is to be believed saidpolemarchus interposing 
 i fear said cephalus that i must go now for i have to lookafter the sacrifices and i hand over the argument to polemarchusand the company 
 is not polemarchus your heir i said 
 to be sure he answered and went away laughing to the sacrifices 
 socrates polemarchus 
 tell me then o thou heir of the argument what did simonides according to you truly say about justice 
 he said that the repayment of a debt is just and in saying so heappears to me to be right 
 i should be sorry to doubt the word of such a wise and inspired his meaning though probably clear to you is the reverse of clearto me for he certainly does not mean as we were now saying that iought to return a return a deposit of arms or of anything else toone who asks for it when he is not in his right senses and yet adeposit cannot be denied to be a debt 
 true 
 then when the person who asks me is not in his right mind i am by nomeans to make the return 
 certainly not 
 when simonides said that the repayment of a debt was justice he didnot mean to include that case 
 certainly not for he thinks that a friend ought always to do goodto a friend and never evil 
 you mean that the return of a deposit of gold which is to the injuryof the receiver if the two parties are friends is not therepayment of a debt that is what you would imagine him to say 
 yes 
 and are enemies also to receive what we owe to them 
 to be sure he said they are to receive what we owe them and anenemy as i take it owes to an enemy that which is due or proper tohim that is to say evil 
 simonides then after the manner of poets would seem to havespoken darkly of the nature of justice for he really meant to saythat justice is the giving to each man what is proper to him and thishe termed a debt 
 that must have been his meaning he said 
 by heaven i replied and if we asked him what due or proper thingis given by medicine and to whom what answer do you think that hewould make to us 
 he would surely reply that medicine gives drugs and meat and drinkto human bodies 
 and what due or proper thing is given by cookery and to what 
 seasoning to food 
 and what is that which justice gives and to whom 
 if socrates we are to be guided at all by the analogy of thepreceding instances then justice is the art which gives good tofriends and evil to enemies 
 that is his meaning then 
 i think so 
 and who is best able to do good to his friends and evil to hisenemies in time of sickness 
 the physician 
 or when they are on a voyage amid the perils of the sea 
 the pilot 
 and in what sort of actions or with a view to what result is thejust man most able to do harm to his enemy and good to his friends 
 in going to war against the one and in making alliances with theother 
 but when a man is well my dear polemarchus there is no need of aphysician 
 no 
 and he who is not on a voyage has no need of a pilot 
 no 
 then in time of peace justice will be of no use 
 i am very far from thinking so 
 you think that justice may be of use in peace as well as in war 
 yes 
 like husbandry for the acquisition of corn 
 yes 
 or like shoemaking for the acquisition of shoes that is whatyou mean 
 yes 
 and what similar use or power of acquisition has justice in timeof peace 
 in contracts socrates justice is of use 
 and by contracts you mean partnerships 
 exactly 
 but is the just man or the skilful player a more useful and betterpartner at a game of draughts 
 the skilful player 
 and in the laying of bricks and stones is the just man a more usefulor better partner than the builder 
 quite the reverse 
 then in what sort of partnership is the just man a better partnerthan the as in playing the harp the iscertainly a better partner than the just man 
 in a money partnership 
 yes polemarchus but surely not in the use of money for you do notwant a just man to be your counsellor the purchase or sale of a man who is knowing about horses would be better for that would henot 
 certainly 
 and when you want to buy a ship the shipwright or the pilot wouldbe better 
 true 
 then what is that joint use of silver or gold in which the justman is to be preferred 
 when you want a deposit to be kept safely 
 you mean when money is not wanted but allowed to lie 
 precisely 
 that is to say justice is useful when money is useless 
 that is the inference 
 and when you want to keep a safe then justice isuseful to the individual and to the state but when you want to useit then the art of the 
 clearly 
 and when you want to keep a shield or a lyre and not to use would say that justice is useful but when you want to use the art of the soldier or of the musician 
 certainly 
 and so of all the other things justice is useful when they areuseless and useless when they are useful 
 that is the inference 
 then justice is not good for much but let us consider thisfurther point is not he who can best strike a blow in a boxingmatch or in any kind of fighting best able to ward off a blow 
 certainly 
 and he who is most skilful in preventing or escaping from adisease is best able to create one 
 true 
 and he is the best guard of a camp who is best able to steal a marchupon the enemy 
 certainly 
 then he who is a good keeper of anything is also a good thief 
 that i suppose is to be inferred 
 then if the just man is good at keeping money he is good atstealing it 
 that is implied in the argument 
 then after all the just man has turned out to be a thief and thisis a lesson which i suspect you must have learnt out of homer for of autolycus the maternal grandfather of odysseus who isa favourite of his affirms that 
 he was excellent above all men in theft and so you and homer and simonides are agreed that justice is anart of theft to be practised however for the good of friends and forthe harm of enemies that was what you were saying 
 no certainly not that though i do not now know what i did say buti still stand by the latter words 
 well there is another question by friends and enemies do we meanthose who are so really or only in seeming 
 surely he said a man may be expected to love those whom hethinks good and to hate those whom he thinks evil 
 yes but do not persons often err about good and evil many whoare not good seem to be so and conversely 
 that is true 
 then to them the good will be enemies and the evil will be theirfriends true 
 and in that case they will be right in doing good to the evil andevil to the good 
 clearly 
 but the good are just and would not do an injustice 
 true 
 then according to your argument it is just to injure those who do nowrong 
 nay socrates the doctrine is immoral 
 then i suppose that we ought to do good to the just and harm tothe unjust 
 i like that better 
 but see the consequence many a man who is ignorant of humannature has friends who are bad friends and in that case he ought todo harm to them and he has good enemies whom he ought to if so we shall be saying the very opposite of that which weaffirmed to be the meaning of simonides 
 very true he said and i think that we had better correct anerror into which we seem to have fallen in the use of the and enemy 
 what was the error polemarchus i asked 
 we assumed that he is a friend who seems to be or who is thoughtgood 
 and how is the error to be corrected 
 we should rather say that he is a friend who is as well as and that he who seems only and is not good only seems to beand is not a friend and of an enemy the same may be said 
 you would argue that the good are our friends and the bad ourenemies 
 yes 
 and instead of saying simply as we did at first that it is justto do good to our friends and harm to our enemies we should furthersay it is just to do good to our friends when they are good andharm to our enemies when they are evil 
 yes that appears to me to be the truth 
 but ought the just to injure any one at all 
 undoubtedly he ought to injure those who are both wicked and hisenemies 
 when horses are injured are they improved or deteriorated 
 the latter 
 deteriorated that is to say in the good qualities of horses notof dogs 
 yes of horses 
 and dogs are deteriorated in the good qualities of dogs and notof horses 
 of course 
 and will not men who are injured be deteriorated in that which isthe proper virtue of man 
 certainly 
 and that human virtue is justice 
 to be sure 
 then men who are injured are of necessity made unjust 
 that is the result 
 but can the musician by his art make men unmusical 
 certainly not 
 or the horseman by his art make them bad horsemen 
 impossible 
 and can the just by justice make men unjust or speaking general canthe good by virtue make them bad 
 assuredly not 
 any more than heat can produce cold 
 it cannot 
 or drought moisture 
 clearly not 
 nor can the good harm any one 
 impossible 
 and the just is the good 
 certainly 
 then to injure a friend or any one else is not the act of a justman but of the opposite who is the unjust 
 i think that what you say is quite true socrates 
 then if a man says that justice consists in the repayment ofdebts and that good is the debt which a man owes to his evil the debt which he owes to his enemies to say this is notwise for it is not true if as has been clearly shown theinjuring of another can be in no case just 
 i agree with you said polemarchus 
 then you and i are prepared to take up arms against any one whoattributes such a saying to simonides or bias or pittacus or anyother wise man or seer 
 i am quite ready to do battle at your side he said 
 shall i tell you whose i believe the saying to be 
 whose 
 i believe that periander or perdiccas or xerxes or ismenias thetheban or some other rich and mighty man who had a great opinionof his own power was the first to say that justice is doing goodto your friends and harm to your enemies 
 most true he said 
 yes i said but if this definition of justice also breaks other can be offered 
 several times in the course of the discussion thrasymachus hadmade an attempt to get the argument into his own hands and had beenput down by the rest of the company who wanted to hear the end butwhen polemarchus and i had done speaking and there was a pause hecould no longer hold his peace and gathering himself up he cameat us like a wild beast seeking to devour us we were at the sight of him 
 socrates polemarchus thrasymachus 
 he roared out to the whole company what folly socrates hastaken possession of you all and why sillybillies do you knock underto one another i say that if you want really to know what justice should not only ask but answer and you should not seek honourto yourself from the refutation of an opponent but have your ownanswer for there is many a one who can ask and cannot answer and nowi will not have you say that justice is duty or advantage or profit orgain or interest for this sort of nonsense will not do for me i musthave clearness and accuracy 
 i was at his words and could not look at him withouttrembling indeed i believe that if i had not fixed my eye upon him ishould have been struck dumb but when i saw his fury rising i lookedat him first and was therefore able to reply to him 
 thrasymachus i said with a quiver be hard upon and i may have been guilty of a little mistake in theargument but i can assure you that the error was not we were seeking for a piece of gold you would not imagine thatwe were knocking under to one another and so losing our chance offinding it and why when we are seeking for justice a thing moreprecious than many pieces of gold do you say that we are weaklyyielding to one another and not doing our utmost to get at thetruth nay my good friend we are most willing and anxious to doso but the fact is that we cannot and if so you people who know allthings should pity us and not be angry with us 
 how characteristic of socrates he replied with a bitter your ironical style did i not foresee have i not alreadytold you that whatever he was asked he would refuse to answer andtry irony or any other shuffle in order that he might avoidanswering 
 you are a philosopher thrasymachus i replied and well know thatif you ask a person what numbers make up twelve taking care toprohibit him whom you ask from answering twice six or three timesfour or six times two or four times three for this sort ofnonsense will not do for me then obviously that is your way ofputting the question no one can answer you but suppose that hewere to retort thrasymachus what do you mean if one of thesenumbers which you interdict be the true answer to the question am ifalsely to say some other number which is not the right one is thatyour meaning how would you answer him 
 just as if the two cases were at all alike he said 
 why should they not be i replied and even if they are not butonly appear to be so to the person who is asked ought he not to saywhat he thinks whether you and i forbid him or not 
 i presume then that you are going to make one of the interdictedanswers 
 i dare say that i may notwithstanding the danger if uponreflection i approve of any of them 
 but what if i give you an answer about justice other and said than any of these what do you deserve to have done to you 
 done to me as becomes the ignorant i must learn from the is what i deserve to have done to me 
 what and no payment a pleasant notion 
 i will pay when i have the money i replied 
 socrates thrasymachus glaucon 
 but you have socrates said glaucon and you thrasymachus need beunder no anxiety about money for we will all make a contributionfor socrates 
 yes he replied and then socrates will do as he always to answer himself but take and pull to pieces the answerof some one else 
 why my good friend i said how can any one answer who knows andsays that he knows just nothing and who even if he has some faintnotions of his own is told by a man of authority not to utter natural thing is that the speaker should be some one likeyourself who professes to know and can tell what he knows will youthen kindly answer for the edification of the company and of myself 
 glaucon and the rest of the company joined in my request andthrasymachus as any one might see was in reality eager to speak forhe thought that he had an excellent answer and would distinguishhimself but at first he to insist on my answering at length heconsented to begin behold he said the wisdom of socrates herefuses to teach himself and goes about learning of others to whomhe never even says thank you 
 that i learn of others i replied is quite true but that i amungrateful i wholly deny money i have none and therefore i pay inpraise which is all i have and how ready i am to praise any onewho appears to me to speak well you will very soon find out when youanswer for i expect that you will answer well 
 listen then he said i proclaim that justice is nothing elsethan the interest of the stronger and now why do you not me but ofcourse you 
 let me first understand you i replied justice as you say isthe interest of the stronger what thrasymachus is the meaning ofthis you cannot mean to say that because polydamas thepancratiast is stronger than we are and finds the eating of beefconducive to his bodily strength that to eat beef is thereforeequally for our good who are weaker than he is and right and just forus 
 abominable of you socrates you take the words in thesense which is most damaging to the argument 
 not at all my good sir i said i am trying to understand them andi wish that you would be a little clearer 
 well he said have you never heard that forms of government are tyrannies and there are democracies and there arearistocracies 
 yes i know 
 and the government is the ruling power in each state 
 certainly 
 and the different forms of government make laws tyrannical with a view to their several these laws which are made by them for their own interests arethe justice which they deliver to their subjects and him whotransgresses them they punish as a breaker of the law and unjust andthat is what i mean when i say that in all states there is the sameprinciple of justice which is the interest of the government andas the government must be supposed to have power the onlyreasonable conclusion is that everywhere there is one principle ofjustice which is the interest of the stronger 
 now i understand you i said and whether you are right or not iwill try to discover but let me remark that in defining justiceyou have yourself used the word interest which you forbade me touse it is true however that in your definition the words of thestronger are added 
 a small addition you must allow he said 
 great or small never mind about that we must first enquire whetherwhat you are saying is the truth now we are both agreed thatjustice is interest of some sort but you go on to say of thestronger about this addition i am not so sure and must thereforeconsider further 
 proceed 
 i will and first tell me do you admit that it is just orsubjects to obey their rulers 
 i do 
 but are the rulers of states absolutely infallible or are theysometimes liable to err 
 to be sure he replied they are liable to err 
 then in making their laws they may sometimes make them sometimes not 
 true 
 when they make them rightly they make them agreeably to theirinterest when they are mistaken contrary to their interest youadmit that 
 yes 
 and the laws which they make must be obeyed by their subjects andthat is what you call justice 
 doubtless 
 then justice according to your argument is not only obedience tothe interest of the stronger but the reverse 
 what is that you are saying he asked 
 i am only repeating what you are saying i believe but let usconsider have we not admitted that the rulers may be mistaken abouttheir own interest in what they command and also that to obey them isjustice has not that been admitted 
 yes 
 then you must also have acknowledged justice not to be for theinterest of the stronger when the rulers unintentionally commandthings to be done which are to their own injury for if as you is the obedience which the subject renders to theircommands in that case o wisest of men is there any escape fromthe conclusion that the weaker are commanded to do not what is forthe interest but what is for the injury of the stronger 
 nothing can be clearer socrates said polemarchus 
 socrates cleitophon polemarchus thrasymachus 
 yes said cleitophon interposing if you are allowed to be hiswitness 
 but there is no need of any witness said polemarchus forthrasymachus himself acknowledges that rulers may sometimes commandwhat is not for their own interest and that for subjects to obey themis justice 
 yes polemarchus thrasymachus said that for subjects to do whatwas commanded by their rulers is just 
 yes cleitophon but he also said that justice is the interest ofthe stronger and while admitting both these propositions he furtheracknowledged that the stronger may command the weaker who are hissubjects to do what is not for his own interest whence follows thatjustice is the injury quite as much as the interest of the stronger 
 but said cleitophon he meant by the interest of the strongerwhat the stronger thought to be his interest this was what theweaker had to do and this was affirmed by him to be justice 
 those were not his words rejoined polemarchus 
 socrates thrasymachus 
 never mind i replied if he now says that they are let us accepthis statement tell me thrasymachus i said did you mean byjustice what the stronger thought to be his interest whether reallyso or not 
 certainly not he said do you suppose that i call him who ismistaken the stronger at the time when he is mistaken 
 yes i said my impression was that you did so when you admittedthat the ruler was not infallible but might be sometimes mistaken 
 you argue like an informer socrates do you mean for example thathe who is mistaken about the sick is a physician in that he ismistaken or that he who errs in arithmetic or grammar is anarithmetician or grammarian at the me when he is making the respect of the mistake true we say that the physician orarithmetician or grammarian has made a mistake but this is only a wayof speaking for the fact is that neither the grammarian nor any otherperson of skill ever makes a mistake in so far as he is what hisname implies they none of them err unless their skill fails them andthen they cease to be skilled artists no artist or sage or ruler errsat the time when he is what his name implies though he is commonlysaid to err and i adopted the common mode of speaking but to beperfectly accurate since you are such a lover of accuracy weshould say that the ruler in so far as he is the ruler isunerring and being unerring always commands that which is for hisown interest and the subject is required to execute his commands andtherefore as i said at first and now repeat justice is theinterest of the stronger 
 indeed thrasymachus and do i really appear to you to argue like aninformer 
 certainly he replied 
 and you suppose that i ask these questions with any design ofinjuring you in the argument 
 nay he replied suppose is not the word i know it but you willbe found out and by sheer force of argument you will never prevail 
 i shall not make the attempt my dear man but to avoid anymisunderstanding occurring between us in future let me ask in whatsense do you speak of a ruler or stronger whose interest as youwere saying he being the superior it is just that the inferiorshould execute is he a ruler in the popular or in the strict senseof the term 
 in the strictest of all senses he said and now cheat and playthe informer if you can i ask no quarter at your hands but you neverwill be able never 
 and do you imagine i said that i am such a madman as to try andcheat thrasymachus i might as well shave a lion 
 why he said you made the attempt a minute ago and you failed 
 enough i said of these civilities it will be better that i shouldask you a question is the physician taken in that strict sense ofwhich you are speaking a healer of the sick or a maker of remember that i am now speaking of the true physician 
 a healer of the sick he replied 
 and the pilot that is to say the true pilot is he a captainof sailors or a mere sailor 
 a captain of sailors 
 the circumstance that he sails in the ship is not to be taken intoaccount neither is he to be called a sailor the name pilot bywhich he is distinguished has nothing to do with sailing but issignificant of his skill and of his authority over the sailors 
 very true he said 
 now i said every art has an interest 
 certainly 
 for which the art has to consider and provide 
 yes that is the aim of art 
 and the interest of any art is the perfection of it this andnothing else 
 what do you mean 
 i mean what i may illustrate negatively by the example of thebody suppose you were to ask me whether the body is orhas wants i should reply certainly the body has wants for thebody may be ill and require to be cured and has therefore intereststo which the art of medicine ministers and this is the origin andintention of medicine as you will acknowledge am i not right 
 quite right he replied 
 but is the art of medicine or any other art faulty or deficient inany quality in the same way that the eye may be deficient in sightor the ear fail of hearing and therefore requires another art toprovide for the interests of seeing and hearing has art in itself isay any similar liability to fault or defect and does every artrequire another supplementary art to provide for its interests andthat another and another without end or have the arts to look onlyafter their own interests or have they no need either of themselvesor of another having no faults or defects they have no need tocorrect them either by the exercise of their own art or of any have only to consider the interest of their forevery art remains pure and faultless while remaining true that is tosay while perfect and unimpaired take the words in your precisesense and tell me whether i am not right 
 yes clearly 
 then medicine does not consider the interest of medicine but theinterest of the body 
 true he said 
 nor does the art of horsemanship consider the interests of the artof horsemanship but the interests of the horse neither do anyother arts care for themselves for they have no needs they care onlyfor that which is the subject of their art 
 true he said 
 but surely thrasymachus the arts are the superiors and rulers oftheir own subjects 
 to this he assented with a good deal of reluctance 
 then i said no science or art considers or enjoins the interest ofthe stronger or superior but only the interest of the subject andweaker 
 he made an attempt to contest this proposition also but finallyacquiesced 
 then i continued no physician in so far as he is a his own good in what he prescribes but the good of hispatient for the true physician is also a ruler having the humanbody as a subject and is not a mere that has beenadmitted 
 yes 
 and the pilot likewise in the strict sense of the term is aruler of sailors and not a mere sailor 
 that has been admitted 
 and such a pilot and ruler will provide and prescribe for theinterest of the sailor who is under him and not for his own or interest 
 he gave a reluctant yes 
 then i said thrasymachus there is no one in any rule who in sofar as he is a ruler considers or enjoins what is for his owninterest but always what is for the interest of his subject orsuitable to his art to that he looks and that alone he considersin everything which he says and does 
 when we had got to this point in the argument and every one sawthat the definition of justice had been completely instead of replying to me said tell me socrates haveyou got a nurse 
 why do you ask such a question i said when you ought rather tobe answering 
 because she leaves you to snivel and never wipes your nose she hasnot even taught you to know the shepherd from the sheep 
 what makes you say that i replied 
 because you fancy that the shepherd or neatherd fattens of tends thesheep or oxen with a view to their own good and not to the good ofhimself or his master and you further imagine that the rulers ofstates if they are true rulers never think of their subjects assheep and that they are not studying their own advantage day andnight oh no and so entirely astray are you in your ideas aboutthe just and unjust as not even to know that justice and the justare in reality good that is to say the interest of theruler and stronger and the loss of the subject and servant andinjustice the opposite for the unjust is lord over the truly simpleand just he is the stronger and his subjects do what is for hisinterest and minister to his happiness which is very far frombeing their own consider further most foolish socrates that thejust is always a loser in comparison with the unjust first of all inprivate contracts wherever the unjust is the partner of the justyou will find that when the partnership is dissolved the unjustman has always more and the just less secondly in their dealingswith the state when there is an income tax the just man will paymore and the unjust less on the same amount of income and whenthere is anything to be received the one gains nothing and the othermuch observe also what happens when they take an office there is thejust man neglecting his affairs and perhaps suffering other getting nothing out of the public because he is just moreover heis hated by his friends and acquaintance for refusing to serve them inunlawful ways but all this is reversed in the case of the unjust am speaking as before of injustice on a large scale in which theadvantage of the unjust is more apparent and my meaning will bemost clearly seen if we turn to that highest form of injustice inwhich the criminal is the happiest of men and the sufferers orthose who refuse to do injustice are the most miserable that is tosay tyranny which by fraud and force takes away the property ofothers not little by little but wholesale comprehending in sacred as well as profane private and public for which actsof wrong if he were detected perpetrating any one of them would be punished and incur great disgrace they who do such wrongin particular cases are called robbers of temples and burglars and swindlers and thieves but when a man besidestaking away the money of the citizens has made slaves of them of these names of reproach he is termed happy and only by the citizens but by all who hear of his having achievedthe consummation of injustice for mankind censure that they may be the victims of it and not because they shrinkfrom committing it and thus as i have shown socrates on a sufficient scale has more strength and freedom andmastery than justice and as i said at first justice is the interestof the stronger whereas injustice is a own profit and interest 
 thrasymachus when he had thus spoken having like a our ears with his words had a mind to go away but thecompany would not let him they insisted that he should remain anddefend his position and i myself added my own humble request thathe would not leave us thrasymachus i said to him excellent man howsuggestive are your remarks and are you going to run away beforeyou have fairly taught or learned whether they are true or not is theattempt to determine the way of life so small a matter in youreyes to determine how life may be passed by each one of us to thegreatest advantage 
 and do i differ from you he said as to the importance of theenquiry 
 you appear rather i replied to have no care or thought about whether we live better or worse from not knowing whatyou say you know is to you a matter of indifference prithee not keep your knowledge to yourself we are a large party andany benefit which you confer upon us will be amply rewarded for myown part i openly declare that i am not convinced and that i do notbelieve injustice to be more gainful than justice even ifuncontrolled and allowed to have free play for granting that theremay be an unjust man who is able to commit injustice either by fraudor force still this does not convince me of the superior advantage ofinjustice and there may be others who are in the same predicamentwith myself perhaps we may be wrong if so you in your wisdom shouldconvince us that we are mistaken in preferring justice to injustice 
 and how am i to convince you he said if you are not alreadyconvinced by what i have just said what more can i do for you have me put the proof bodily into your souls 
 heaven forbid i said i would only ask you to be consistent or ifyou change change openly and let there be no deception for i mustremark thrasymachus if you will recall what was previously although you began by defining the true physician in an exactsense you did not observe a like exactness when speaking of theshepherd you thought that the shepherd as a shepherd tends thesheep not with a view to their own good but like a mere diner orbanqueter with a view to the pleasures of the table or again as atrader for sale in the market and not as a shepherd yet surely theart of the shepherd is concerned only with the good of his has only to provide the best for them since the perfection ofthe art is already ensured whenever all the requirements of it aresatisfied and that was what i was saying just now about the conceived that the art of the ruler considered as ruler whether ina state or in private life could only regard the good of his flock orsubjects whereas you seem to think that the rulers in states that isto say the true rulers like being in authority 
 think nay i am sure of it 
 then why in the case of lesser offices do men never take themwillingly without payment unless under the idea that they governfor the advantage not of themselves but of others let me ask you aquestion are not the several arts different by reason of theireach having a separate function and my dear illustrious friend dosay what you think that we may make a little progress 
 yes that is the difference he replied 
 and each art gives us a particular good and not merely a general for example gives us health navigation safety at so on 
 yes he said 
 and the art of payment has the special function of giving pay butwe do not confuse this with other arts any more than the art of thepilot is to be confused with the art of medicine because the healthof the pilot may be improved by a sea voyage you would not beinclined to say would you that navigation is the art of medicine atleast if we are to adopt your exact use of language 
 certainly not 
 or because a man is in good health when he receives pay you wouldnot say that the art of payment is medicine 
 i should say not 
 nor would you say that medicine is the art of receiving paybecause a man takes fees when he is engaged in healing 
 certainly not 
 and we have admitted i said that the good of each art is speciallyconfined to the art 
 yes 
 then if there be any good which all artists have in common that isto be attributed to something of which they all have the common use 
 true he replied 
 and when the artist is benefited by receiving pay the advantage isgained by an additional use of the art of pay which is not the artprofessed by him 
 he gave a reluctant assent to this 
 then the pay is not derived by the several artists from theirrespective arts but the truth is that while the art of medicinegives health and the art of the builder builds a house another artattends them which is the art of pay the various arts may be doingtheir own business and benefiting that over which they preside butwould the artist receive any benefit from his art unless he werepaid as well 
 i suppose not 
 but does he therefore confer no benefit when he works for nothing 
 certainly he confers a benefit 
 then now thrasymachus there is no longer any doubt that neitherarts nor governments provide for their own interests but as wewere before saying they rule and provide for the interests of theirsubjects who are the weaker and not the stronger to their goodthey attend and not to the good of the superior 
 and this is the reason my dear thrasymachus why as i was just nowsaying no one is willing to govern because no one likes to take inhand the reformation of evils which are not his concern withoutremuneration for in the execution of his work and in giving hisorders to another the true artist does not regard his own always that of his subjects and therefore in order that rulersmay be willing to rule they must be paid in one of three modes ofpayment money or honour or a penalty for refusing 
 socrates glaucon 
 what do you mean socrates said glaucon the first two modes ofpayment are intelligible enough but what the penalty is i do notunderstand or how a penalty can be a payment 
 you mean that you do not understand the nature of this payment whichto the best men is the great inducement to rule of course you knowthat ambition and avarice are held to be as indeed they are adisgrace 
 very true 
 and for this reason i said money and honour have no attraction forthem good men do not wish to be openly demanding payment forgoverning and so to get the name of hirelings nor by secretly helpingthemselves out of the public revenues to get the name of not being ambitious they do not care about honour whereforenecessity must be laid upon them and they must be induced to servefrom the fear of punishment and this as i imagine is the reason whythe forwardness to take office instead of waiting to be been deemed dishonourable now the worst part of the punishment isthat he who refuses to rule is liable to be ruled by one who isworse than himself and the fear of this as i conceive induces thegood to take office not because they would but because they cannothelp not under the idea that they are going to have any benefit orenjoyment themselves but as a necessity and because they are notable to commit the task of ruling to any one who is better thanthemselves or indeed as good for there is reason to think that ifa city were composed entirely of good men then to avoid officewould be as much an object of contention as to obtain office is atpresent then we should have plain proof that the true ruler is notmeant by nature to regard his own interest but that of hissubjects and every one who knew this would choose rather to receive abenefit from another than to have the trouble of conferring one sofar am i from agreeing with thrasymachus that justice is theinterest of the stronger this latter question need not be furtherdiscussed at present but when thrasymachus says that the life ofthe unjust is more advantageous than that of the just his newstatement appears to me to be of a far more serious character whichof us has spoken truly and which sort of life glaucon do youprefer 
 i for my part deem the life of the just to be the more answered 
 did you hear all the advantages of the unjust which thrasymachus wasrehearsing 
 yes i heard him he replied but he has not convinced me 
 then shall we try to find some way of convincing him if we he is saying what is not true 
 most certainly he replied 
 if i said he makes a set speech and we make another recounting allthe advantages of being just and he answers and we rejoin there mustbe a numbering and measuring of the goods which are claimed oneither side and in the end we shall want judges to decide but ifwe proceed in our enquiry as we lately did by making admissions toone another we shall unite the offices of judge and advocate in ourown persons 
 very good he said 
 and which method do i understand you to prefer i said 
 that which you propose 
 well then thrasymachus i said suppose you begin at the beginningand answer me you say that perfect injustice is more gainful thanperfect justice 
 socrates glaucon thrasymachus 
 yes that is what i say and i have given you my reasons 
 and what is your view about them would you call one of themvirtue and the other vice 
 certainly 
 i suppose that you would call justice virtue and injustice vice 
 what a charming notion so likely too seeing that i affirminjustice to be profitable and justice not 
 what else then would you say 
 the opposite he replied 
 and would you call justice vice 
 no i would rather say sublime simplicity 
 then would you call injustice malignity 
 no i would rather say discretion 
 and do the unjust appear to you to be wise and good 
 yes he said at any rate those of them who are able to be perfectlyunjust and who have the power of subduing states and nations butperhaps you imagine me to be talking of cutpurses 
 even this profession if undetected has advantages though they arenot to be compared with those of which i was just now speaking 
 i do not think that i misapprehend your meaning thrasymachus ireplied but still i cannot hear without amazement that you classinjustice with wisdom and virtue and justice with the opposite 
 certainly i do so class them 
 now i said you are on more substantial and almost unanswerableground for if the injustice which you were maintaining to beprofitable had been admitted by you as by others to be vice anddeformity an answer might have been given to you on receivedprinciples but now i perceive that you will call injustice honourableand strong and to the unjust you will attribute all the qualitieswhich were attributed by us before to the just seeing that you do nothesitate to rank injustice with wisdom and virtue 
 you have guessed most infallibly he replied 
 then i certainly ought not to shrink from going through with theargument so long as i have reason to think that you thrasymachus arespeaking your real mind for i do believe that you are now inearnest and are not amusing yourself at our expense 
 i may be in earnest or not but what is that to you to refute theargument is your business 
 very true i said that is what i have to do but will you be sogood as answer yet one more question does the just man try to gainany advantage over the just 
 far otherwise if he did would not be the simple amusing creaturewhich he is 
 and would he try to go beyond just action 
 he would not 
 and how would he regard the attempt to gain an advantage over theunjust would that be considered by him as just or unjust 
 he would think it just and would try to gain the advantage buthe would not be able 
 whether he would or would not be able i said is not to thepoint my question is only whether the just man while refusing tohave more than another just man would wish and claim to have morethan the unjust 
 yes he would 
 and what of the unjust does he claim to have more than the justman and to do more than is just 
 of course he said for he claims to have more than all men 
 and the unjust man will strive and struggle to obtain more thanthe unjust man or action in order that he may have more than all 
 true 
 we may put the matter thus i said the just does not desire morethan his like but more than his unlike whereas the unjust desiresmore than both his like and his unlike 
 nothing he said can be better than that statement 
 and the unjust is good and wise and the just is neither 
 good again he said 
 and is not the unjust like the wise and good and the just unlikethem 
 of course he said he who is of a certain nature is like those whoare of a certain nature he who is not not 
 each of them i said is such as his like is 
 certainly he replied 
 very good thrasymachus i said and now to take the case of thearts you would admit that one man is a musician and another not amusician 
 yes 
 and which is wise and which is foolish 
 clearly the musician is wise and he who is not a musician isfoolish 
 and he is good in as far as he is wise and bad in as far as he isfoolish 
 yes 
 and you would say the same sort of thing of the physician 
 yes 
 and do you think my excellent friend that a musician when headjusts the lyre would desire or claim to exceed or go beyond amusician in the tightening and loosening the strings 
 i do not think that he would 
 but he would claim to exceed the 
 of course 
 and what would you say of the physician in prescribing meats anddrinks would he wish to go beyond another physician or beyond thepractice of medicine 
 he would not 
 but he would wish to go beyond the 
 yes 
 and about knowledge and ignorance in general see whether youthink that any man who has knowledge ever would wish to have thechoice of saying or doing more than another man who has he not rather say or do the same as his like in the same case 
 that i suppose can hardly be denied 
 and what of the ignorant would he not desire to have more thaneither the knowing or the ignorant 
 i dare say 
 and the knowing is wise 
 yes 
 and the wise is good 
 true 
 then the wise and good will not desire to gain more than his more than his unlike and opposite 
 i suppose so 
 whereas the bad and ignorant will desire to gain more than both 
 yes 
 but did we not say thrasymachus that the unjust goes beyond bothhis like and unlike were not these your words they were 
 they were 
 and you also said that the lust will not go beyond his like buthis unlike 
 yes 
 then the just is like the wise and good and the unjust like theevil and ignorant 
 that is the inference 
 and each of them is such as his like is 
 that was admitted 
 then the just has turned out to be wise and good and the unjust eviland ignorant 
 thrasymachus made all these admissions not fluently as i repeatthem but with extreme reluctance it was a hot day andthe perspiration poured from him in torrents and then i saw what ihad never seen before thrasymachus blushing as we were now agreedthat justice was virtue and wisdom and injustice vice andignorance i proceeded to another point 
 well i said thrasymachus that matter is now settled but werewe not also saying that injustice had strength do you remember 
 yes i remember he said but do not suppose that i approve ofwhat you are saying or have no answer if however i were to would be quite certain to accuse me of haranguing thereforeeither permit me to have my say out or if you would rather ask doso and i will answer very good as they say to oldwomen and will nod yes and no 
 certainly not i said if contrary to your real opinion 
 yes he said i will to please you since you will not let mespeak what else would you have 
 nothing in the world i said and if you are so disposed i willask and you shall answer 
 proceed 
 then i will repeat the question which i asked before in orderthat our examination of the relative nature of justice and injusticemay be carried on regularly a statement was made that injustice isstronger and more powerful than justice but now justice havingbeen identified with wisdom and virtue is easily shown to be strongerthan injustice if injustice is ignorance this can no longer bequestioned by any one but i want to view the matter thrasymachus ina different way you would not deny that a state may be unjust and maybe unjustly attempting to enslave other states or may have alreadyenslaved them and may be holding many of them in subjection 
 true he replied and i will add the best and perfectly unjust statewill be most likely to do so 
 i know i said that such was your position but what i wouldfurther consider is whether this power which is possessed by thesuperior state can exist or be exercised without justice 
 if you are right in you view and justice is wisdom then onlywith justice but if i am right then without justice 
 i am delighted thrasymachus to see you not only nodding assent anddissent but making answers which are quite excellent 
 that is out of civility to you he replied 
 you are very kind i said and would you have the goodness also toinform me whether you think that a state or an army or a band ofrobbers and thieves or any other gang of could act atall if they injured one another 
 no indeed he said they could not 
 but if they abstained from injuring one another then they might acttogether better 
 yes 
 and this is because injustice creates divisions and hatreds andfighting and justice imparts harmony and friendship is not thattrue thrasymachus 
 i agree he said because i do not wish to quarrel with you 
 how good of you i said but i should like to know also whetherinjustice having this tendency to arouse hatred wherever slaves or among freemen will not make them hate one another andset them at variance and render them incapable of common action 
 certainly 
 and even if injustice be found in two only will they not quarreland fight and become enemies to one another and to the just 
 they will 
 and suppose injustice abiding in a single person would yourwisdom say that she loses or that she retains her natural power 
 let us assume that she retains her power 
 yet is not the power which injustice exercises of such a nature thatwherever she takes up her abode whether in a city in an army in afamily or in any other body that body is to begin with renderedincapable of united action by reason of sedition and does it not become its own enemy and at variance with all thatopposes it and with the just is not this the case 
 yes certainly 
 and is not injustice equally fatal when existing in a single the first place rendering him incapable of action because he is notat unity with himself and in the second place making him an enemyto himself and the just is not that true thrasymachus 
 yes 
 and o my friend i said surely the gods are just 
 granted that they are 
 but if so the unjust will be the enemy of the gods and the justwill be their friend 
 feast away in triumph and take your fill of the argument i willnot oppose you lest i should displease the company 
 well then proceed with your answers and let me have theremainder of my repast for we have already shown that the just areclearly wiser and better and abler than the unjust and that theunjust are incapable of common action nay ing at more that tospeak as we did of men who are evil acting at any time vigorouslytogether is not strictly true for if they had been perfectly would have laid hands upon one another but it is evident thatthere must have been some remnant of justice in them which enabledthem to combine if there had not been they would have injured oneanother as well as their victims they were but half villains intheir enterprises for had they been whole villains and utterlyunjust they would have been utterly incapable of action that as ibelieve is the truth of the matter and not what you said at whether the just have a better and happier life than the unjust isa further question which we also proposed to consider i think thatthey have and for the reasons which to have given but still i shouldlike to examine further for no light matter is at stake nothing lessthan the rule of human life 
 proceed 
 i will proceed by asking a question would you not say that ahorse has some end 
 i should 
 and the end or use of a horse or of anything would be that whichcould not be accomplished or not so well accomplished by any otherthing 
 i do not understand he said 
 let me explain can you see except with the eye 
 certainly not 
 or hear except with the ear 
 no 
 these then may be truly said to be the ends of these organs 
 they may 
 but you can cut off a with a dagger or with a in many other ways 
 of course 
 and yet not so well as with a made for the purpose 
 true 
 may we not say that this is the end of a 
 we may 
 then now i think you will have no difficulty in understanding mymeaning when i asked the question whether the end of anything would bethat which could not be accomplished or not so well any other thing 
 i understand your meaning he said and assent 
 and that to which an end is appointed has also an excellence need iask again whether the eye has an end 
 it has 
 and has not the eye an excellence 
 yes 
 and the ear has an end and an excellence also 
 true 
 and the same is true of all other things they have each of theman end and a special excellence 
 that is so 
 well and can the eyes fulfil their end if they are wanting in theirown proper excellence and have a defect instead 
 how can they he said if they are blind and cannot see 
 you mean to say if they have lost their proper excellence which issight but i have not arrived at that point yet i would rather askthe question more generally and only enquire whether the things whichfulfil their ends fulfil them by their own proper excellence and fallof fulfilling them by their own defect 
 certainly he replied 
 i might say the same of the ears when deprived of their ownproper excellence they cannot fulfil their end 
 true 
 and the same observation will apply to all other things 
 i agree 
 well and has not the soul an end which nothing else can fulfil forexample to superintend and command and deliberate and the like arenot these functions proper to the soul and can they rightly beassigned to any other 
 to no other 
 and is not life to be reckoned among the ends of the soul 
 assuredly he said 
 and has not the soul an excellence also 
 yes 
 and can she or can she not fulfil her own ends when deprived of thatexcellence 
 she cannot 
 then an evil soul must necessarily be an evil ruler andsuperintendent and the good soul a good ruler 
 yes necessarily 
 and we have admitted that justice is the excellence of the soul andinjustice the defect of the soul 
 that has been admitted 
 then the just soul and the just man will live well and the unjustman will live ill 
 that is what your argument proves 
 and he who lives well is blessed and happy and he who lives ill thereverse of happy 
 certainly 
 then the just is happy and the unjust miserable 
 so be it 
 but happiness and not misery is profitable 
 of course 
 then my blessed thrasymachus injustice can never be moreprofitable than justice 
 let this socrates he said be your entertainment at the bendidea 
 for which i am indebted to you i said now that you have growngentle towards me and have left off scolding nevertheless i have notbeen well entertained but that was my own fault and not yours asan epicure snatches a taste of every dish which is successivelybrought to table he not having allowed himself time to enjoy theone before so have i gone from one subject to another withouthaving discovered what i sought at first the nature of justice ileft that enquiry and turned away to consider whether justice isvirtue and wisdom or evil and folly and when there arose a furtherquestion about the comparative advantages of justice and could not refrain from passing on to that and the result of thewhole discussion has been that i know nothing at all for i know notwhat justice is and therefore i am not likely to know whether it isor is not a virtue nor can i say whether the just man is happy or unhappy

 book ii 
 
 socrates glaucon 
 with these words i was thinking that i had made an end of the discussion but the end in truth proved to be only a beginning for glaucon who is always the most pugnacious of men was dissatisfied at thrasymachus retirement he wanted to have the battle out so he said to me socrates do you wish really to persuade us or only to seem to have persuaded us that to be just is always better than to be unjust 
 i should wish really to persuade you i replied if i could 
 then you certainly have not succeeded let me ask you now how would you arrange goods are there not some which we welcome for their own sakes and independently of their consequences as for example harmless pleasures and enjoyments which delight us at the time although nothing follows from them 
 i agree in thinking that there is such a class i replied 
 is there not also a second class of goods such as knowledge sight health which are desirable not only in themselves but also for their results 
 certainly i said 
 and would you not recognize a third class such as gymnastic and the care of the sick and the art also the various ways of these do us good but we regard them as disagreeable and no one would choose them for their own sakes but only for the sake of some reward or result which flows from them 
 there is i said this third class also but why do you ask 
 because i want to know in which of the three classes you would place justice 
 in the highest class i replied among those goods which he who would be happy desires both for their own sake and for the sake of their results 
 then the many are of another mind they think that justice is to be reckoned in the troublesome class among goods which are to be pursued for the sake of rewards and of reputation but in themselves are disagreeable and rather to be avoided 
 i know i said that this is their manner of thinking and that this was the thesis which thrasymachus was maintaining just now when he censured justice and praised injustice but i am too stupid to be convinced by him 
 i wish he said that you would hear me as well as him and then i shall see whether you and i agree for thrasymachus seems to me like a snake to have been charmed by your voice sooner than he ought to have been but to my mind the nature of justice and injustice have not yet been made clear setting aside their rewards and results i want to know what they are in themselves and how they inwardly work in the soul if you please then i will revive the argument of thrasymachus and first i will speak of the nature and origin of justice according to the common view of them secondly i will show that all men who practise justice do so against their will of necessity but not as a good and thirdly i will argue that there is reason in this view for the life of the unjust is after all better far than the life of the just if what they say is true socrates since i myself am not of their opinion but still i acknowledge that i am perplexed when i hear the voices of thrasymachus and myriads of others dinning in my ears and on the other hand i have never yet heard the superiority of justice to injustice maintained by any one in a satisfactory way i want to hear justice praised in respect of itself then i shall be satisfied and you are the person from whom i think that i am most likely to hear this and therefore i will praise the unjust life to the utmost of my power and my manner of speaking will indicate the manner in which i desire to hear you too praising justice and censuring injustice will you say whether you approve of my proposal 
 indeed i do nor can i imagine any theme about which a man of sense would oftener wish to converse 
 i am delighted he replied to hear you say so and shall begin by speaking as i proposed of the nature and origin of justice 
 glaucon 
 they say that to do injustice is by nature good to suffer injustice evil but that the evil is greater than the good and so when men have both done and suffered injustice and have had experience of both not being able to avoid the one and obtain the other they think that they had better agree among themselves to have neither hence there arise laws and mutual covenants and that which is ordained by law is termed by them lawful and just this they affirm to be the origin and nature of justice it is a mean or compromise between the best of all which is to do injustice and not be punished and the worst of all which is to suffer injustice without the power of retaliation and justice being at a middle point between the two is tolerated not as a good but as the lesser evil and honoured by reason of the inability of men to do injustice for no man who is worthy to be called a man would ever submit to such an agreement if he were able to resist he would be mad if he did such is the received account socrates of the nature and origin of justice 
 now that those who practise justice do so involuntarily and because they have not the power to be unjust will best appear if we imagine something of this kind having given both to the just and the unjust power to do what they will let us watch and see whither desire will lead them then we shall discover in the very act the just and unjust man to be proceeding along the same road following their interest which all natures deem to be their good and are only diverted into the path of justice by the force of law the liberty which we are supposing may be most completely given to them in the form of such a power as is said to have been possessed by gyges the ancestor of croesus the lydian according to the tradition gyges was a shepherd in the service of the king of lydia there was a great storm and an earthquake made an opening in the earth at the place where he was feeding his flock amazed at the sight he descended into the opening where among other marvels he beheld a hollow brazen horse having doors at which he stooping and looking in saw a dead body of stature as appeared to him more than human and having nothing on but a gold ring this he took from the finger of the dead and reascended now the shepherds met together according to custom that they might send their monthly report about the flocks to the king into their assembly he came having the ring on his finger and as he was sitting among them he chanced to turn the collet of the ring inside his hand when instantly he became invisible to the rest of the company and they began to speak of him as if he were no longer present he was astonished at this and again touching the ring he turned the collet outwards and reappeared he made several trials of the ring and always with the same he turned the collet inwards he became invisible when outwards he reappeared whereupon he contrived to be chosen one of the messengers who were sent to the court where as soon as he arrived he seduced the queen and with her help conspired against the king and slew him and took the kingdom suppose now that there were two such magic rings and the just put on one of them and the unjust the man can be imagined to be of such an iron nature that he would stand fast in justice no man would keep his hands off what was not his own when he could safely take what he liked out of the market or go into houses and lie with any one at his pleasure or kill or release from prison whom he would and in all respects be like a god among men then the actions of the just would be as the actions of the unjust they would both come at last to the same point and this we may truly affirm to be a great proof that a man is just not willingly or because he thinks that justice is any good to him individually but of necessity for wherever any one thinks that he can safely be unjust there he is unjust for all men believe in their hearts that injustice is far more profitable to the individual than justice and he who argues as i have been supposing will say that they are right if you could imagine any one obtaining this power of becoming invisible and never doing any wrong or touching what was he would be thought by the to be a most wretched idiot although they would praise him to one faces and keep up appearances with one another from a fear that they too might suffer injustice enough of this 
 now if we are to form a real judgment of the life of the just and unjust we must isolate them there is no other way and how is the isolation to be effected i answer let the unjust man be entirely unjust and the just man entirely just nothing is to be taken away from either of them and both are to be perfectly furnished for the work of their respective lives first let the unjust be like other distinguished masters of craft like the skilful pilot or physician who knows intuitively his own powers and keeps within their limits and who if he fails at any point is able to recover himself so let the unjust make his unjust attempts in the right way and lie hidden if he means to be great in his injustice he who is found out is nobody for the highest reach of injustice is to be deemed just when you are not therefore i say that in the perfectly unjust man we must assume the most perfect injustice there is to be no deduction but we must allow him while doing the most unjust acts to have acquired the greatest reputation for justice if he have taken a false step he must be able to recover himself he must be one who can speak with effect if any of his deeds come to light and who can force his way where force is required his courage and strength and command of money and friends and at his side let us place the just man in his nobleness and simplicity wishing as aeschylus says to be and not to seem good there must be no seeming for if he seem to be just he will be honoured and rewarded and then we shall not know whether he is just for the sake of justice or for the sake of honours and rewards therefore let him be clothed in justice only and have no other covering and he must be imagined in a state of life the opposite of the former let him be the best of men and let him be thought the worst then he will have been put to the proof and we shall see whether he will be affected by the fear of infamy and its consequences and let him continue thus to the hour of death being just and seeming to be unjust when both have reached the uttermost extreme the one of justice and the other of injustice let judgment be given which of them is the happier of the two 
 socrates glaucon 
 heavens my dear glaucon i said how energetically you polish them up for the decision first one and then the other as if they were two statues 
 i do my best he said and now that we know what they are like there is no difficulty in tracing out the sort of life which awaits either of them this i will proceed to describe but as you may think the description a little too coarse i ask you to suppose socrates that the words which follow are not mine let me put them into the mouths of the eulogists of injustice they will tell you that the just man who is thought unjust will be scourged racked bound will have his eyes burnt out and at last after suffering every kind of evil he will be impaled then he will understand that he ought to seem only and not to be just the words of aeschylus may be more truly spoken of the unjust than of the just for the unjust is pursuing a reality he does not live with a view to appearances he wants to be really unjust and not to seem only 
 his mind has a soil deep and fertile 
 out of which spring his prudent counsels in the first place he is thought just and therefore bears rule in the city he can marry whom he will and give in marriage to whom he will also he can trade and deal where he likes and always to his own advantage because he has no misgivings about injustice and at every contest whether in public or private he gets the better of his antagonists and gains at their expense and is rich and out of his gains he can benefit his friends and harm his enemies moreover he can offer sacrifices and dedicate gifts to the gods abundantly and magnificently and can honour the gods or any man whom he wants to honour in a far better style than the just and therefore he is likely to be dearer than they are to the gods and thus socrates gods and men are said to unite in making the life of the unjust better than the life of the just 
 adeimantus socrates 
 i was going to say something in answer to glaucon when adeimantus his brother interposed socrates he said you do not suppose that there is nothing more to be urged 
 why what else is there i answered 
 the strongest point of all has not been even mentioned he replied 
 well then according to the proverb let brother help brother if he fails in any part do you assist him although i must confess that glaucon has already said quite enough to lay me in the dust and take from me the power of helping justice 
 adeimantus 
 nonsense he replied but let me add something more there is another side to argument about the praise and censure of justice and injustice which is equally required in order to bring out what i believe to be his meaning parents and tutors are always telling their sons and their wards that they are to be just but why not for the sake of justice but for the sake of character and reputation in the hope of obtaining for him who is reputed just some of those offices marriages and the like which glaucon has enumerated among the advantages accruing to the unjust from the reputation of justice more however is made of appearances by this class of persons than by the others for they throw in the good opinion of the gods and will tell you of a shower of benefits which the heavens as they say rain upon the pious and this accords with the testimony of the noble hesiod and homer the first of whom says that the gods make the oaks of the just 
 to hear acorns at their summit and bees i the middle 
 and the sheep the bowed down bowed the with the their fleeces and many other blessings of a like kind are provided for them and homer has a very similar strain for he speaks of one whose fame is 
 as the fame of some blameless king who like a god 
 maintains justice to whom the black earth brings forth 
 wheat and barley whose trees are bowed with fruit 
 and his sheep never fail to bear and the sea gives him fish still grander are the gifts of heaven which musaeus and his son vouchsafe to the just they take them down into the world below where they have the saints lying on couches at a feast everlastingly drunk crowned with garlands their idea seems to be that an immortality of drunkenness is the highest meed of virtue some extend their rewards yet further the posterity as they say of the faithful and just shall survive to the third and fourth generation this is the style in which they praise justice but about the wicked there is another strain they bury them in a slough in hades and make them carry water in a sieve also while they are yet living they bring them to infamy and inflict upon them the punishments which glaucon described as the portion of the just who are reputed to be unjust nothing else does their invention supply such is their manner of praising the one and censuring the other 
 once more socrates i will ask you to consider another way of speaking about justice and injustice which is not confined to the poets but is found in prose writers the universal voice of mankind is always declaring that justice and virtue are honourable but grievous and toilsome and that the pleasures of vice and injustice are easy of attainment and are only censured by law and opinion they say also that honesty is for the most part less profitable than dishonesty and they are quite ready to call wicked men happy and to honour them both in public and private when they are rich or in any other way influential while they despise and overlook those who may be weak and poor even though acknowledging them to be better than the others but most extraordinary of all is their mode of speaking about virtue and the gods they say that the gods apportion calamity and misery to many good men and good and happiness to the wicked and mendicant prophets go to rich doors and persuade them that they have a power committed to them by the gods of making an atonement for a own or his sins by sacrifices or charms with rejoicings and feasts and they promise to harm an enemy whether just or unjust at a small cost with magic arts and incantations binding heaven as they say to execute their will and the poets are the authorities to whom they appeal now smoothing the path of vice with the words of hesiod 
 vice may be had in abundance without trouble the way is smooth and her is near but before virtue the gods have set toil and a tedious and uphill road then citing homer as a witness that the gods may be influenced by men for he also says 
 the gods too may he turned from their purpose and men pray to them and avert their wrath by sacrifices and soothing entreaties and by libations and the odour of fat when they have sinned and transgressed and they produce a host of books written by musaeus and orpheus who were children of the moon and the muses that is what they say according to which they perform their ritual and persuade not only individuals but whole cities that expiations and atonements for sin may be made by sacrifices and amusements which fill a vacant hour and are equally at the service of the living and the dead the latter sort they call mysteries and they redeem us from the pains of hell but if we neglect them no one knows what awaits us 
 he proceeded and now when the young hear all this said about virtue and vice and the way in which gods and men regard them how are their minds likely to be affected my dear socrates those of them i mean who are quickwitted and like bees on the wing light on every flower and from all that they hear are prone to draw conclusions as to what manner of persons they should be and in what way they should walk if they would make the best of life probably the youth will say to himself in the words of pindar 
 can i by justice or by crooked ways of deceit ascend a loftier tower which may he a fortress to me all my days for what men say is that if i am really just and am not also thought just profit there is none but the pain and loss on the other hand are unmistakable but if though unjust i acquire the reputation of justice a heavenly life is promised to me since then as philosophers prove appearance tyrannizes over truth and is lord of happiness to appearance i must devote myself i will describe around me a picture and shadow of virtue to be the vestibule and exterior of my house behind i will trail the subtle and crafty fox as archilochus greatest of sages recommends but i hear some one exclaiming that the concealment of wickedness is often difficult to which i answer nothing great is easy nevertheless the argument indicates this if we would be happy to be the path along which we should proceed with a view to concealment we will establish secret brotherhoods and political clubs and there are professors of rhetoric who teach the art of persuading courts and assemblies and so partly by persuasion and partly by force i shall make unlawful gains and not be punished still i hear a voice saying that the gods cannot be deceived neither can they be compelled but what if there are no gods or suppose them to have no care of human things why in either case should we mind about concealment and even if there are gods and they do care about us yet we know of them only from tradition and the genealogies of the poets and these are the very persons who say that they may be influenced and turned by sacrifices and soothing entreaties and by offerings let us be consistent then and believe both or neither if the poets speak truly why then we had better be unjust and offer of the fruits of injustice for if we are just although we may escape the vengeance of heaven we shall lose the gains of injustice but if we are unjust we shall keep the gains and by our sinning and praying and praying and sinning the gods will be propitiated and we shall not be punished but there is a world below in which either we or our posterity will suffer for our unjust deeds yes my friend will be the reflection but there are mysteries and atoning deities and these have great power that is what mighty cities declare and the children of the gods who were their poets and prophets bear a like testimony 
 on what principle then shall we any longer choose justice rather than the worst injustice when if we only unite the latter with a deceitful regard to appearances we shall fare to our mind both with gods and men in life and after death as the most numerous and the highest authorities tell us knowing all this socrates how can a man who has any superiority of mind or person or rank or wealth be willing to honour justice or indeed to refrain from laughing when he hears justice praised and even if there should be some one who is able to disprove the truth of my words and who is satisfied that justice is best still he is not angry with the unjust but is very ready to forgive them because he also knows that men are not just of their own free will unless peradventure there be some one whom the divinity within him may have inspired with a hatred of injustice or who has attained knowledge of the truth but no other man he only blames injustice who owing to cowardice or age or some weakness has not the power of being unjust and this is proved by the fact that when he obtains the power he immediately becomes unjust as far as he can be 
 the cause of all this socrates was indicated by us at the beginning of the argument when my brother and i told you how astonished we were to find that of all the professing panegyrists of justice beginning with the ancient heroes of whom any memorial has been preserved to us and ending with the men of our own time no one has ever blamed injustice or praised justice except with a view to the glories honours and benefits which flow from them no one has ever adequately described either in verse or prose the true essential nature of either of them abiding in the soul and invisible to any human or divine eye or shown that of all the things of a soul which he has within him justice is the greatest good and injustice the greatest evil had this been the universal strain had you sought to persuade us of this from our youth upwards we should not have been on the watch to keep one another from doing wrong but every one would have been his own watchman because afraid if he did wrong of harbouring in himself the greatest of evils i dare say that thrasymachus and others would seriously hold the language which i have been merely repeating and words even stronger than these about justice and injustice grossly as i conceive perverting their true nature but i speak in this vehement manner as i must frankly confess to you because i want to hear from you the opposite side and i would ask you to show not only the superiority which justice has over injustice but what effect they have on the possessor of them which makes the one to be a good and the other an evil to him and please as glaucon requested of you to exclude reputations for unless you take away from each of them his true reputation and add on the false we shall say that you do not praise justice but the appearance of it we shall think that you are only exhorting us to keep injustice dark and that you really agree with thrasymachus in thinking that justice is good and the interest of the stronger and that injustice is a own profit and interest though injurious to the weaker now as you have admitted that justice is one of that highest class of goods which are desired indeed for their results but in a far greater degree for their own sakes like sight or hearing or knowledge or health or any other real and natural and not merely conventional good i would ask you in your praise of justice to regard one point only i mean the essential good and evil which justice and injustice work in the possessors of them let others praise justice and censure injustice magnifying the rewards and honours of the one and abusing the other that is a manner of arguing which coming from them i am ready to tolerate but from you who have spent your whole life in the consideration of this question unless i hear the contrary from your own lips i expect something better and therefore i say not only prove to us that justice is better than injustice but show what they either of them do to the possessor of them which makes the one to be a good and the other an evil whether seen or unseen by gods and men 
 socrates adeimantus 
 i had always admired the genius of glaucon and adeimantus but on hearing these words i was quite delighted and said sons of an illustrious father that was not a bad beginning of the elegiac verses which the admirer of glaucon made in honour of you after you had distinguished yourselves at the battle of megara 
 sons of ariston he sang divine offspring of an illustrious hero the epithet is very appropriate for there is something truly divine in being able to argue as you have done for the superiority of injustice and remaining unconvinced by your own arguments and i do believe that you are not convinced this i infer from your general character for had i judged only from your speeches i should have mistrusted you but now the greater my confidence in you the greater is my difficulty in knowing what to say for i am in a strait between two on the one hand i feel that i am unequal to the task and my inability is brought home to me by the fact that you were not satisfied with the answer which i made to thrasymachus proving as i thought the superiority which justice has over injustice and yet i cannot refuse to help while breath and speech remain to me i am afraid that there would be an impiety in being present when justice is evil spoken of and not lifting up a hand in her defence and therefore i had best give such help as i can 
 glaucon and the rest entreated me by all means not to let the question drop but to proceed in the investigation they wanted to arrive at the truth first about the nature of justice and injustice and secondly about their relative advantages i told them what i really thought that the enquiry would be of a serious nature and would require very good eyes seeing then i said that we are no great wits i think that we had better adopt a method which i may illustrate thus suppose that a person had been asked by some one to read small letters from a distance and it occurred to some one else that they might be found in another place which was larger and in which the letters were larger if they were the same and he could read the larger letters first and then proceed to the lesser this would have been thought a rare piece of good fortune 
 very true said adeimantus but how does the illustration apply to our enquiry 
 i will tell you i replied justice which is the subject of our enquiry is as you know sometimes spoken of as the virtue of an individual and sometimes as the virtue of a state 
 true he replied 
 and is not a state larger than an individual 
 it is 
 then in the larger the quantity of justice is likely to be larger and more easily discernible i propose therefore that we enquire into the nature of justice and injustice first as they appear in the state and secondly in the individual proceeding from the greater to the lesser and comparing them 
 that he said is an excellent proposal 
 and if we imagine the state in process of creation we shall see the justice and injustice of the state in process of creation also 
 i dare say 
 when the state is completed there may be a hope that the object of our search will be more easily discovered 
 yes far more easily 
 but ought we to attempt to construct one i said for to do so as i am inclined to think will be a very serious task reflect therefore 
 i have reflected said adeimantus and am anxious that you should proceed 
 a state i said arises as i conceive out of the needs of mankind no one is but all of us have many wants can any other origin of a state be imagined 
 there can i be no other 
 then as we have many wants and many persons are needed to supply them one takes a helper for one purpose and another for another and when these partners and helpers are gathered together in one habitation the body of inhabitants is termed a state 
 true he said 
 and they exchange with one another and one gives and another receives under the idea that the exchange will be for their good 
 very true 
 then i said let us begin and create in idea a state and yet the true creator is necessity who is the mother of our invention 
 of course he replied 
 now the first and greatest of necessities is food which is the condition of life and existence 
 certainly 
 the second is a dwelling and the third clothing and the like 
 true 
 and now let us see how our city will be able to supply this great demand we may suppose that one man is a husbandman another a builder some one else a weaver shall we add to them a shoemaker or perhaps some other purveyor to our bodily wants 
 quite right 
 the barest notion of a state must include four or five men 
 clearly 
 and how will they proceed will each bring the result of his labours into a common stock the individual husbandman for example producing for four and labouring four times as long and as much as he need in the provision of food with which he supplies others as well as himself or will he have nothing to do with others and not be at the trouble of producing for them but provide for himself alone a fourth of the food in a fourth of the time and in the remaining of his time be employed in making a house or a coat or a pair of shoes having no partnership with others but supplying himself all his own wants 
 adeimantus thought that he should aim at producing food only and not at producing everything 
 probably i replied that would be the better way and when i hear you say this i am myself reminded that we are not all alike there are diversities of natures among us which are adapted to different occupations 
 very true 
 and will you have a work better done when the workman has many occupations or when he has only one 
 when he has only one 
 further there can be no doubt that a work is spoilt when not done at the right time 
 no doubt 
 for business is not disposed to wait until the doer of the business is at leisure but the doer must follow up what he is doing and make the business his first object 
 he must 
 and if so we must infer that all things are produced more plentifully and easily and of a better quality when one man does one thing which is natural to him and does it at the right time and leaves other things 
 undoubtedly 
 then more than four citizens will be required for the husbandman will not make his own plough or mattock or other implements of agriculture if they are to be good for anything neither will the builder make his tools and he too needs many and in like manner the weaver and shoemaker 
 true 
 then carpenters and smiths and many other artisans will be sharers in our little state which is already beginning to grow 
 true 
 yet even if we add neatherds shepherds and other herdsmen in order that our husbandmen may have oxen to plough with and builders as well as husbandmen may have draught cattle and curriers and weavers fleeces and hides still our state will not be very large 
 that is true yet neither will it be a very small state which contains all these 
 then again there is the situation of the city to find a place where nothing need be imported is impossible 
 impossible 
 then there must be another class of citizens who will bring the required supply from another city 
 there must 
 but if the trader goes having nothing which they require who would supply his need he will come back 
 that is certain 
 and therefore what they produce at home must be not only enough for themselves but such both in quantity and quality as to accommodate those from whom their wants are supplied 
 very true 
 then more husbandmen and more artisans will be required 
 they will 
 not to mention the importers and exporters who are called merchants 
 yes 
 then we shall want merchants 
 we shall 
 and if merchandise is to be carried over the sea skilful sailors will also be needed and in considerable numbers 
 yes in considerable numbers 
 then again within the city how will they exchange their productions to secure such an exchange was as you will remember one of our principal objects when we formed them into a society and constituted a state 
 clearly they will buy and sell 
 then they will need a and a for purposes of exchange 
 certainly 
 suppose now that a husbandman or an artisan brings some production to market and he comes at a time when there is no one to exchange with him is he to leave his calling and sit idle in the 
 not at all he will find people there who seeing the want undertake the office of salesmen in states they are commonly those who are the weakest in bodily strength and therefore of little use for any other purpose their duty is to be in the market and to give money in exchange for goods to those who desire to sell and to take money from those who desire to buy 
 this want then creates a class of in our state is not retailer the term which is applied to those who sit in the engaged in buying and selling while those who wander from one city to another are called merchants 
 yes he said 
 and there is another class of servants who are intellectually hardly on the level of companionship still they have plenty of bodily strength for labour which accordingly they sell and are called if i do not mistake hirelings hire being the name which is given to the price of their labour 
 true 
 then hirelings will help to make up our population 
 yes 
 and now adeimantus is our state matured and perfected 
 i think so 
 where then is justice and where is injustice and in what part of the state did they spring up 
 probably in the dealings of these citizens with one another cannot imagine that they are more likely to be found anywhere else 
 i dare say that you are right in your suggestion i said we had better think the matter out and not shrink from the enquiry 
 let us then consider first of all what will be their way of life now that we have thus established them will they not produce corn and wine and clothes and shoes and build houses for themselves and when they are housed they will work in summer commonly stripped and barefoot but in winter substantially clothed and shod they will feed on and flour of wheat baking and kneading them making noble cakes and loaves these they will serve up on a mat of reeds or on clean leaves themselves reclining the while upon beds strewn with yew or myrtle and they and their children will feast drinking of the wine which they have made wearing garlands on their heads and hymning the praises of the gods in happy converse with one another and they will take care that their families do not exceed their means having an eye to poverty or war 
 socrates glaucon 
 but said glaucon interposing you have not given them a relish to their meal 
 true i replied i had forgotten of course they must have a and olives and cheese and they will boil roots and herbs such as country people prepare for a dessert we shall give them figs and peas and beans and they will roast and acorns at the fire drinking in moderation and with such a diet they may be expected to live in peace and health to a good old age and bequeath a similar life to their children after them 
 yes socrates he said and if you were providing for a city of pigs how else would you feed the beasts 
 but what would you have glaucon i replied 
 why he said you should give them the ordinary conveniences of life people who are to be comfortable are accustomed to lie on sofas and dine off tables and they should have sauces and sweets in the modern style 
 yes i said now i understand the question which you would have me consider is not only how a state but how a luxurious state is created and possibly there is no harm in this for in such a state we shall be more likely to see how justice and injustice originate in my opinion the true and healthy constitution of the state is the one which i have described but if you wish also to see a state at fever heat i have no objection for i suspect that many will not be satisfied with the simpler way of way they will be for adding sofas and tables and other furniture also dainties and perfumes and incense and courtesans and cakes all these not of one sort only but in every variety we must go beyond the necessaries of which i was at first speaking such as houses and clothes and shoes the arts of the painter and the embroiderer will have to be set in motion and gold and ivory and all sorts of materials must be procured 
 true he said 
 then we must enlarge our borders for the original healthy state is no longer sufficient now will the city have to fill and swell with a multitude of callings which are not required by any natural want such as the whole tribe of hunters and actors of whom one large class have to do with forms and colours another will be the votaries of music poets and their attendant train of rhapsodists players dancers contractors also makers of divers kinds of articles including dresses and we shall want more servants will not tutors be also in request and nurses wet and dry tirewomen and barbers as well as confectioners and cooks and swineherds too who were not needed and therefore had no place in the former edition of our state but are needed now they must not be forgotten and there will be animals of many other kinds if people eat them 
 certainly 
 and living in this way we shall have much greater need of physicians than before 
 much greater 
 and the country which was enough to support the original inhabitants will be too small now and not enough 
 quite true 
 then a slice of our neighbours land will be wanted by us for pasture and tillage and they will want a slice of ours if like ourselves they exceed the limit of necessity and give themselves up to the unlimited accumulation of wealth 
 that socrates will be inevitable 
 and so we shall go to war glaucon shall we not 
 most certainly he replied 
 then without determining as yet whether war does good or harm thus much we may affirm that now we have discovered war to be derived from causes which are also the causes of almost all the evils in states private as well as public 
 undoubtedly 
 and our state must once more enlarge and this time the will be nothing short of a whole army which will have to go out and fight with the invaders for all that we have as well as for the things and persons whom we were describing above 
 why he said are they not capable of defending themselves 
 no i said not if we were right in the principle which was acknowledged by all of us when we were framing the state the principle as you will remember was that one man cannot practise many arts with success 
 very true he said 
 but is not war an art 
 certainly 
 and an art requiring as much attention as shoemaking 
 quite true 
 and the shoemaker was not allowed by us to be husbandman or a weaver a builder in order that we might have our shoes well made but to him and to every other worker was assigned one work for which he was by nature fitted and at that he was to continue working all his life long and at no other he was not to let opportunities slip and then he would become a good workman now nothing can be more important than that the work of a soldier should be well done but is war an art so easily acquired that a man may be a warrior who is also a husbandman or shoemaker or other artisan although no one in the world would be a good dice or draught player who merely took up the game as a recreation and had not from his earliest years devoted himself to this and nothing else 
 no tools will make a man a skilled workman or master of defence nor be of any use to him who has not learned how to handle them and has never bestowed any attention upon them how then will he who takes up a shield or other implement of war become a good fighter all in a day whether with or any other kind of troops 
 yes he said the tools which would teach men their own use would be beyond price 
 and the higher the duties of the guardian i said the more time and skill and art and application will be needed by him 
 no doubt he replied 
 will he not also require natural aptitude for his calling 
 certainly 
 then it will be our duty to select if we can natures which are fitted for the task of guarding the city 
 it will 
 and the selection will be no easy matter i said but we must be brave and do our best 
 we must 
 is not the noble youth very like a dog in respect of guarding and watching 
 what do you mean 
 i mean that both of them ought to be quick to see and swift to overtake the enemy when they see him and strong too if when they have caught him they have to fight with him 
 all these qualities he replied will certainly be required by them 
 well and your guardian must be brave if he is to fight well 
 certainly 
 and is he likely to be brave who has no spirit whether horse or dog or any other animal have you never observed how invincible and unconquerable is spirit and how the presence of it makes the soul of any creature to be absolutely fearless and indomitable 
 i have 
 then now we have a clear notion of the bodily qualities which are required in the guardian 
 true 
 and also of the mental ones his soul is to be full of spirit 
 yes 
 but are not these spirited natures apt to be savage with one another and with everybody else 
 a difficulty by no means easy to overcome he replied 
 whereas i said they ought to be dangerous to their enemies and gentle to their friends if not they will destroy themselves without waiting for their enemies to destroy them 
 true he said 
 what is to be done then i said how shall we find a gentle nature which has also a great spirit for the one is the contradiction of the other 
 true 
 he will not be a good guardian who is wanting in either of these two qualities and yet the combination of them appears to be impossible and hence we must infer that to be a good guardian is impossible 
 i am afraid that what you say is true he replied 
 here feeling perplexed i began to think over what had preceded my friend i said no wonder that we are in a perplexity for we have lost sight of the image which we had before us 
 what do you mean he said 
 i mean to say that there do exist natures gifted with those opposite qualities 
 and where do you find them 
 many animals i replied furnish examples of them our friend the dog is a very good one you know that dogs are perfectly gentle to their familiars and acquaintances and the reverse to strangers 
 yes i know 
 then there is nothing impossible or out of the order of nature in our finding a guardian who has a similar combination of qualities 
 certainly not 
 would not he who is fitted to be a guardian besides the spirited nature need to have the qualities of a philosopher 
 i do not apprehend your meaning 
 the trait of which i am speaking i replied may be also seen in the dog and is remarkable in the animal 
 what trait 
 why a dog whenever he sees a stranger is angry when an acquaintance he welcomes him although the one has never done him any harm nor the other any good did this never strike you as curious 
 the matter never struck me before but i quite recognise the truth of your remark 
 and surely this instinct of the dog is very charming your dog is a true philosopher 
 why 
 why because he distinguishes the face of a friend and of an enemy only by the criterion of knowing and not knowing and must not an animal be a lover of learning who determines what he likes and dislikes by the test of knowledge and ignorance 
 most assuredly 
 and is not the love of learning the love of wisdom which is philosophy 
 they are the same he replied 
 and may we not say confidently of man also that he who is likely to be gentle to his friends and acquaintances must by nature be a lover of wisdom and knowledge 
 that we may safely affirm 
 then he who is to be a really good and noble guardian of the state will require to unite in himself philosophy and spirit and swiftness and strength 
 undoubtedly 
 then we have found the desired natures and now that we have found them how are they to be reared and educated is not this enquiry which may be expected to throw light on the greater enquiry which is our final end how do justice and injustice grow up in states for we do not want either to omit what is to the point or to draw out the argument to an inconvenient length 
 socrates adeimantus 
 adeimantus thought that the enquiry would be of great service to us 
 then i said my dear friend the task must not be given up even if somewhat long 
 certainly not 
 come then and let us pass a leisure hour in and our story shall be the education of our heroes 
 by all means 
 and what shall be their education can we find a better than the traditional sort and this has two divisions gymnastic for the body and music for the soul 
 true 
 shall we begin education with music and go on to gymnastic afterwards 
 by all means 
 and when you speak of music do you include literature or not 
 i do 
 and literature may be either true or false 
 yes 
 and the young should be trained in both kinds and we begin with the false 
 i do not understand your meaning he said 
 you know i said that we begin by telling children stories which though not wholly destitute of truth are in the main fictitious and these stories are told them when they are not of an age to learn gymnastics 
 very true 
 that was my meaning when i said that we must teach music before gymnastics 
 quite right he said 
 you know also that the beginning is the most important part of any work especially in the case of a young and tender thing for that is the time at which the character is being formed and the desired impression is more readily taken 
 quite true 
 and shall we just carelessly allow children to hear any casual tales which may be devised by casual persons and to receive into their minds ideas for the most part the very opposite of those which we should wish them to have when they are grown up 
 we cannot 
 then the first thing will be to establish a censorship of the writers of fiction and let the censors receive any tale of fiction which is good and reject the bad and we will desire mothers and nurses to tell their children the authorised ones only let them fashion the mind with such tales even more fondly than they mould the body with their hands but most of those which are now in use must be discarded 
 of what tales are you speaking he said 
 you may find a model of the lesser in the greater i said for they are necessarily of the same type and there is the same spirit in both of them 
 very likely he replied but i do not as yet know what you would term the greater 
 those i said which are narrated by homer and hesiod and the rest of the poets who have ever been the great of mankind 
 but which stories do you mean he said and what fault do you find with them 
 a fault which is most serious i said the fault of telling a lie and what is more a bad lie 
 but when is this fault committed 
 whenever an erroneous representation is made of the nature of gods and heroes as when a painter paints a portrait not having the shadow of a likeness to the original 
 yes he said that sort of thing is certainly very blamable but what are the stories which you mean 
 first of all i said there was that greatest of all lies in high places which the poet told about uranus and which was a bad lie too i mean what hesiod says that uranus did and how cronus retaliated on him the doings of cronus and the sufferings which in turn his son inflicted upon him even if they were true ought certainly not to be lightly told to young and thoughtless persons if possible they had better be buried in silence but if there is an absolute necessity for their mention a chosen few might hear them in a mystery and they should sacrifice not a common eleusinian pig but some huge and unprocurable victim and then the number of the hearers will be very few indeed 
 why yes said he those stories are extremely objectionable 
 yes adeimantus they are stories not to be repeated in our state the young man should not be told that in committing the worst of crimes he is far from doing anything outrageous and that even if he chastises his father when does wrong in whatever manner he will only be following the example of the first and greatest among the gods 
 i entirely agree with you he said in my opinion those stories are quite unfit to be repeated 
 neither if we mean our future guardians to regard the habit of quarrelling among themselves as of all things the basest should any word be said to them of the wars in heaven and of the plots and fightings of the gods against one another for they are not true no we shall never mention the battles of the giants or let them be embroidered on garments and we shall be silent about the innumerable other quarrels of gods and heroes with their friends and relatives if they would only believe us we would tell them that quarrelling is unholy and that never up to this time has there been any quarrel between citizens this is what old men and old women should begin by telling children and when they grow up the poets also should be told to compose for them in a similar spirit but the narrative of hephaestus binding here his mother or how on another occasion zeus sent him flying for taking her part when she was being beaten and all the battles of the gods in homer these tales must not be admitted into our state whether they are supposed to have an allegorical meaning or not for a young person cannot judge what is allegorical and what is literal anything that he receives into his mind at that age is likely to become indelible and unalterable and therefore it is most important that the tales which the young first hear should be models of virtuous thoughts 
 there you are right he replied but if any one asks where are such models to be found and of what tales are you speaking how shall we answer him 
 i said to him you and i adeimantus at this moment are not poets but founders of a state now the founders of a state ought to know the general forms in which poets should cast their tales and the limits which must be observed by them but to make the tales is not their business 
 very true he said but what are these forms of theology which you mean 
 something of this kind i replied god is always to be represented as he truly is whatever be the sort of poetry epic lyric or tragic in which the representation is given 
 right 
 and is he not truly good and must he not be represented as such 
 certainly 
 and no good thing is hurtful 
 no indeed 
 and that which is not hurtful hurts not 
 certainly not 
 and that which hurts not does no evil 
 no 
 and can that which does no evil be a cause of evil 
 impossible 
 and the good is advantageous 
 yes 
 and therefore the cause of 
 yes 
 it follows therefore that the good is not the cause of all things but of the good only 
 assuredly 
 then god if he be good is not the author of all things as the many assert but he is the cause of a few things only and not of most things that occur to men for few are the goods of human life and many are the evils and the good is to be attributed to god alone of the evils the causes are to be sought elsewhere and not in him 
 that appears to me to be most true he said 
 then we must not listen to homer or to any other poet who is guilty of the folly of saying that two casks lie at the threshold of zeus full of lots one of good the other of evil lots and that he to whom zeus gives a mixture of the two sometimes meets with evil fortune at other times with good but that he to whom is given the cup of unmingled ill 
 him wild hunger drives the beauteous earth and again 
 zeus who is the dispenser of good and evil to us and if any one asserts that the violation of oaths and treaties which was really the work of pandarus was brought about by athene and zeus or that the strife and contention of the gods was instigated by themis and zeus he shall not have our approval neither will we allow our young men to hear the words of aeschylus that god plants guilt among men when he desires utterly to destroy a house and if a poet writes of the sufferings of niobe the subject of the tragedy in which these iambic verses occur or of the house of pelops or of the trojan war or on any similar theme either we must not permit him to say that these are the works of god or if they are of god he must devise some explanation of them such as we are seeking he must say that god did what was just and right and they were the better for being punished but that those who are punished are miserable and that god is the author of their misery the poet is not to be permitted to say though he may say that the wicked are miserable because they require to be punished and are benefited by receiving punishment from god but that god being good is the author of evil to any one is to be strenuously denied and not to be said or sung or heard in verse or prose by any one whether old or young in any commonwealth such a fiction is suicidal ruinous impious 
 i agree with you he replied and am ready to give my assent to the law 
 let this then be one of our rules and principles concerning the gods to which our poets and reciters will be expected to conform that god is not the author of all things but of good only 
 that will do he said 
 and what do you think of a second principle shall i ask you whether god is a magician and of a nature to appear insidiously now in one shape and now in another sometimes himself changing and passing into many forms sometimes deceiving us with the semblance of such transformations or is he one and the same immutably fixed in his own proper image 
 i cannot answer you he said without more thought 
 well i said but if we suppose a change in anything that change must be effected either by the thing itself or by some other thing 
 most certainly 
 and things which are at their best are also least liable to be altered or discomposed for example when healthiest and strongest the human frame is least liable to be affected by meats and drinks and the plant which is in the fullest vigour also suffers least from winds or the heat of the sun or any similar causes 
 of course 
 and will not the bravest and wisest soul be least confused or deranged by any external influence 
 true 
 and the same principle as i should suppose applies to all composite things furniture houses garments when good and well made they are least altered by time and circumstances 
 very true 
 then everything which is good whether made by art or nature or both is least liable to suffer change from without 
 true 
 but surely god and the things of god are in every way perfect 
 of course they are 
 then he can hardly be compelled by external influence to take many shapes 
 he cannot 
 but may he not change and transform himself 
 clearly he said that must be the case if he is changed at all 
 and will he then change himself for the better and fairer or for the worse and more unsightly 
 if he change at all he can only change for the worse for we cannot suppose him to be deficient either in virtue or beauty 
 very true adeimantus but then would any one whether god or man desire to make himself worse 
 impossible 
 then it is impossible that god should ever be willing to change being as is supposed the fairest and best that is conceivable every god remains absolutely and for ever in his own form 
 that necessarily follows he said in my judgment 
 then i said my dear friend let none of the poets tell us that 
 the gods taking the disguise of strangers from other lands walk up and down cities in all sorts of forms and let no one slander proteus and thetis neither let any one either in tragedy or in any other kind of poetry introduce here disguised in the likeness of a priestess asking an alms 
 for the daughters of inachus the river of argos let us have no more lies of that sort neither must we have mothers under the influence of the poets scaring their children with a bad version of these myths telling how certain gods as they say go about by night in the likeness of so many strangers and in divers forms but let them take heed lest they make cowards of their children and at the same time speak blasphemy against the gods 
 heaven forbid he said 
 but although the gods are themselves unchangeable still by witchcraft and deception they may make us think that they appear in various forms 
 perhaps he replied 
 well but can you imagine that god will be willing to lie whether in word or deed or to put forth a phantom of himself 
 i cannot say he replied 
 do you not know i said that the true lie if such an expression may be allowed is hated of gods and men 
 what do you mean he said 
 i mean that no one is willingly deceived in that which is the truest and highest part of himself or about the truest and highest matters there above all he is most afraid of a lie having possession of him 
 still he said i do not comprehend you 
 the reason is i replied that you attribute some profound meaning to my words but i am only saying that deception or being deceived or uninformed about the highest realities in the highest part of themselves which is the soul and in that part of them to have and to hold the lie is what mankind least like that i say is what they utterly detest 
 there is nothing more hateful to them 
 and as i was just now remarking this ignorance in the soul of him who is deceived may be called the true lie for the lie in words is only a kind of imitation and shadowy image of a previous affection of the soul not pure unadulterated falsehood am i not right 
 perfectly right 
 the true lie is hated not only by the gods but also by men 
 yes 
 whereas the lie in words is in certain cases useful and not hateful in dealing with enemies that would be an instance or again when those whom we call our friends in a fit of madness or illusion are going to do some harm then it is useful and is a sort of medicine or preventive also in the tales of mythology of which we were just now speaking because we do not know the truth about ancient times we make falsehood as much like truth as we can and so turn it to account 
 very true he said 
 but can any of these reasons apply to god can we suppose that he is ignorant of antiquity and therefore has recourse to invention 
 that would be ridiculous he said 
 then the lying poet has no place in our idea of god 
 i should say not 
 or perhaps he may tell a lie because he is afraid of enemies 
 that is inconceivable 
 but he may have friends who are senseless or mad 
 but no mad or senseless person can be a friend of god 
 then no motive can be imagined why god should lie 
 none whatever 
 then the superhuman and divine is absolutely incapable of falsehood 
 yes 
 then is god perfectly simple and true both in word and deed he changes not he deceives not either by sign or word by dream or waking vision 
 your thoughts he said are the reflection of my own 
 you agree with me then i said that this is the second type or form in which we should write and speak about divine things the gods are not magicians who transform themselves neither do they deceive mankind in any way 
 i grant that 
 then although we are admirers of homer we do not admire the lying dream which zeus sends to agamemnon neither will we praise the verses of aeschylus in which thetis says that apollo at her nuptials 
 was celebrating in song her fair progeny whose days were to he long and to know no sickness and when he had spoken of my lot as in all things blessed of heaven he raised a note of triumph and cheered my soul and i thought that the word of phoebus being divine and full of prophecy would not fail and now he himself who uttered the strain he who was present at the banquet and who said this he it is who has slain my son 
 these are the kind of sentiments about the gods which will arouse our anger and he who utters them shall be refused a chorus neither shall we allow teachers to make use of them in the instruction of the young meaning as we do that our guardians as far as men can be should be true worshippers of the gods and like them 
 i entirely agree be said in these principles and promise to make them my laws
