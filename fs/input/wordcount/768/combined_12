 the sobriquet 
 mode of formation of family names 
 marius was at this epoch a handsome young man of medium stature with thick and intensely black hair a lofty and intelligent brow and passionate nostrils an air of calmness and sincerity and with something indescribably proud thoughtful and innocent over his whole countenance 
 his profile all of whose lines were rounded without thereby losing their firmness had a certain germanic sweetness which has made its way into the french physiognomy by way of alsace and lorraine and that complete absence of angles which rendered the sicambres so easily recognizable among the romans and which distinguishes the leonine from the aquiline race he was at that period of life when the mind of men who think is composed in nearly equal parts of depth and ingenuousness a grave situation being given he had all that is required to be stupid 
 one more turn of the key and he might be sublime his manners were reserved cold polished not very genial as his mouth was charming his lips the reddest and his teeth the whitest in the world his smile corrected the severity of his face as a whole 
 at certain moments that pure brow and that voluptuous smile presented a singular contrast 
 his eyes were small but his glance was large 
 at the period of his most abject misery he had observed that young girls turned round when he passed by and he fled or hid with death in his soul 
 he thought that they were staring at him because of his old clothes and that they were laughing at them the fact is that they stared at him because of his grace and that they dreamed of him 
 this mute misunderstanding between him and the pretty had made him shy 
 he chose none of them for the excellent reason that he fled from all of them 
 he lived thus indefinitely stupidly as courfeyrac said 
 courfeyrac also said to him 
 do not aspire to be venerable they called each other thou it is the tendency of youthful friendships to slip into this mode of address let me give you a piece of advice my dear fellow 
 read so many books and look a little more at the lasses 
 the jades have some good points about them o marius 
 by dint of fleeing and blushing you will become brutalized 
 on other occasions courfeyrac encountered him and morning monsieur 
 when courfeyrac had addressed to him some remark of this nature marius avoided women both young and old more than ever for a week to come and he avoided courfeyrac to boot 
 nevertheless there existed in all the immensity of creation two women whom marius did not flee and to whom he paid no attention whatever in truth he would have been very much amazed if he had been informed that they were women 
 one was the bearded old woman who swept out his chamber and caused courfeyrac to say 
 seeing that his servant woman wears his beard marius does not wear his own beard the other was a sort of little girl whom he saw very often and whom he never looked at 
 for more than a year marius had noticed in one of the walks of the luxembourg the one which skirts the parapet of the pepiniere a man and a very young girl who were almost always seated side by side on the same bench at the most solitary end of the alley on the rue de side 
 every time that that chance which meddles with the strolls of persons whose gaze is turned inwards led marius to that it was nearly every found this couple there 
 the man appeared to be about sixty years of age he seemed sad and serious his whole person presented the robust and weary aspect peculiar to military men who have retired from the service 
 if he had worn a decoration marius would have said he is an he had a kindly but unapproachable air and he never let his glance linger on the eyes of any one he wore blue trousers a blue frock coat and a hat which always appeared to be new a black cravat a quaker shirt that is to say it was dazzlingly white but of coarse linen 
 a grisette who passed near him one day said 
 a very tidy widower his hair was very white 
 the first time that the young girl who accompanied him came and seated herself on the bench which they seemed to have adopted she was a sort of child thirteen or fourteen years of age so thin as to be almost homely awkward insignificant and with a possible promise of handsome eyes 
 only they were always raised with a sort of displeasing assurance 
 her dress was both aged and childish like the dress of the scholars in a convent it consisted of a badly cut gown of black merino 
 they had the air of being father and daughter 
 marius scanned this old man who was not yet aged and this little girl who was not yet a person for a few days and thereafter paid no attention to them 
 they on their side did not appear even to see him they conversed together with a peaceful and indifferent air 
 the girl chattered incessantly and merrily 
 the old man talked but little and at times he fixed on her eyes overflowing with an ineffable paternity 
 marius had acquired the mechanical habit of strolling in that walk he invariably found them there 
 this is the way things went 
 marius liked to arrive by the end of the alley which was furthest from their bench he walked the whole length of the alley passed in front of them then returned to the extremity whence he had come and began again 
 this he did five or six times in the course of his promenade and the promenade was taken five or six times a week without its having occurred to him or to these people to exchange a greeting 
 that personage and that young girl although they perhaps because they appeared to shun all glances had naturally caused some attention on the part of the five or six students who strolled along the pepiniere from time to time the studious after their lectures the others after their game of billiards 
 courfeyrac who was among the last had observed them several times but finding the girl homely he had speedily and carefully kept out of the way 
 he had fled discharging at them a sobriquet like a parthian dart impressed solely with the gown and the old hair he had dubbed the daughter mademoiselle lanoire and the father monsieur leblanc so that as no one knew them under any other title this nickname became a law in the default of any other name the students said 
 ah 
 monsieur leblanc is on his bench and marius like the rest had found it convenient to call this unknown gentleman monsieur leblanc 
 we shall follow their example and we shall say m leblanc in order to facilitate this tale 
 so marius saw them nearly every day at the same hour during the first year 
 he found the man to his taste but the girl insipid

 chapter xxiii 
 
 at that moment count rostopchin with his protruding chin and alert eyes wearing the uniform of a general with sash over his shoulder entered the room stepping briskly to the front of the crowd of gentry 
 our sovereign the emperor will be here in a moment said rostopchin i am straight from the palace seeing the position we are in i think there is little need for discussion the emperor has deigned to summon us and the merchants millions will pour forth from there he pointed to the merchants hall but our business is to supply men and not spare ourselves that is the least we can do 
 a conference took place confined to the magnates sitting at the table the whole consultation passed more than quietly after all the preceding noise the sound of their old voices saying one after another i agree or for variety i too am of that opinion and so on had even a mournful effect 
 the secretary was told to write down the resolution of the moscow nobility and gentry that they would furnish ten men fully equipped out of every thousand serfs as the smolensk gentry had done their chairs made a scraping noise as the gentlemen who had conferred rose with apparent relief and began walking up and down arm in arm to stretch their legs and converse in couples 
 the emperor the emperor a sudden cry resounded through the halls and the whole throng hurried to the entrance 
 the emperor entered the hall through a broad path between two lines of nobles every face expressed respectful curiosity pierre stood rather far off and could not hear all that the emperor said from what he did hear he understood that the emperor spoke of the danger threatening the empire and of the hopes he placed on the moscow nobility he was answered by a voice which informed him of the resolution just arrived at 
 gentlemen said the emperor with a quivering voice 
 there was a rustling among the crowd and it again subsided so that pierre distinctly heard the pleasantly human voice of the emperor saying with emotion 
 i never doubted the devotion of the russian nobles but today it has surpassed my expectations i thank you in the name of the fatherland gentlemen let us act time is most precious 
 the emperor ceased speaking the crowd began pressing round him and rapturous exclamations were heard from all sides 
 yes most precious a royal word said count rostov with a sob he stood at the back and though he had heard hardly anything understood everything in his own way 
 from the hall of the nobility the emperor went to that of the merchants there he remained about ten minutes pierre was among those who saw him come out from the merchants hall with tears of emotion in his eyes as became known later he had scarcely begun to address the merchants before tears gushed from his eyes and he concluded in a trembling voice when pierre saw the emperor he was coming out accompanied by two merchants one of whom pierre knew a fat otkupshchik the other was the mayor a man with a thin sallow face and narrow beard both were weeping tears filled the thin eyes and the fat otkupshchik sobbed outright like a child and kept repeating 
 our lives and property take them your majesty 
 one feeling at the moment was a desire to show that he was ready to go all lengths and was prepared to sacrifice everything he now felt ashamed of his speech with its constitutional tendency and sought an opportunity of effacing it having heard that count mamonov was furnishing a regiment bezukhov at once informed rostopchin that he would give a thousand men and their maintenance 
 old rostov could not tell his wife of what had passed without tears and at once consented to request and went himself to enter his name 
 next day the emperor left moscow the assembled nobles all took off their uniforms and settled down again in their homes and clubs and not without some groans gave orders to their stewards about the enrollment feeling amazed themselves at what they had done

 chapter ii 
 
 lux facta est 
 during the second year precisely at the point in this history which the reader has now reached it chanced that this habit of the luxembourg was interrupted without marius himself being quite aware why and nearly six months elapsed during which he did not set foot in the alley 
 one day at last he returned thither once more it was a serene summer morning and marius was in joyous mood as one is when the weather is fine 
 it seemed to him that he had in his heart all the songs of the birds that he was listening to and all the bits of blue sky of which he caught glimpses through the leaves of the trees 
 he went straight to his alley and when he reached the end of it he perceived still on the same bench that couple only when he approached it certainly was the same man but it seemed to him that it was no longer the same girl 
 the person whom he now beheld was a tall and beautiful creature possessed of all the most charming lines of a woman at the precise moment when they are still combined with all the most ingenuous graces of the child a pure and fugitive moment which can be expressed only by these two words fifteen years 
 she had wonderful brown hair shaded with threads of gold a brow that seemed made of marble cheeks that seemed made of a pale flush an agitated whiteness an exquisite mouth whence smiles darted like sunbeams and words like music a head such as raphael would have given to mary set upon a neck that jean goujon would have attributed to a venus 
 and in order that nothing might be lacking to this bewitching face her nose was not handsome it was pretty neither straight nor curved neither italian nor greek it was the parisian nose that is to say spiritual delicate irregular drives painters to despair and charms poets 
 when marius passed near her he could not see her eyes which were constantly lowered 
 he saw only her long chestnut lashes permeated with shadow and modesty 
 this did not prevent the beautiful child from smiling as she listened to what the old man was saying to her and nothing could be more fascinating than that fresh smile combined with those drooping eyes 
 for a moment marius thought that she was another daughter of the same man a sister of the former no doubt 
 but when the invariable habit of his stroll brought him for the second time near the bench and he had examined her attentively he recognized her as the same in six months the little girl had become a young maiden that was all nothing is more frequent than this phenomenon 
 there is a moment when girls blossom out in the twinkling of an eye and become roses all at once 
 one left them children but yesterday today one finds them disquieting to the feelings 
 this child had not only grown she had become idealized as three days in april suffice to cover certain trees with flowers six months had sufficed to clothe her with beauty 
 her april had arrived 
 one sometimes sees people who poor and mean seem to wake up pass suddenly from indigence to luxury indulge in expenditures of all sorts and become dazzling prodigal magnificent all of a sudden 
 that is the result of having pocketed an income a note fell due yesterday 
 the young girl had received her quarterly income 
 and then she was no longer the with her felt hat her merino gown her shoes and red hands taste had come to her with beauty she was a person clad with a sort of rich and simple elegance and without affectation she wore a dress of black damask a cape of the same material and a bonnet of white crape 
 her white gloves displayed the delicacy of the hand which toyed with the carved chinese ivory handle of a parasol and her silken shoe outlined the smallness of her foot when one passed near her her whole toilette exhaled a youthful and penetrating perfume 
 as for the man he was the same as usual 
 the second time that marius approached her the young girl raised her eyelids her eyes were of a deep celestial blue but in that veiled azure there was as yet nothing but the glance of a child she looked at marius indifferently as she would have stared at the brat running beneath the sycamores or the marble vase which cast a shadow on the bench and marius on his side continued his promenade and thought about something else 
 he passed near the bench where the young girl sat five or six times but without even turning his eyes in her direction 
 on the following days he returned as was his wont to the luxembourg as usual he found there the father and daughter but he paid no further attention to them 
 he thought no more about the girl now that she was beautiful than he had when she was homely he passed very near the bench where she sat because such was his habit

 book ten 
 chapter i 
 
 napoleon began the war with russia because he could not resist going to dresden could not help having his head turned by the homage he received could not help donning a polish uniform and yielding to the stimulating influence of a june morning and could not refrain from bursts of anger in the presence of kurakin and then of balashev 
 alexander refused negotiations because he felt himself to be personally insulted barclay de tolly tried to command the army in the best way because he wished to fulfill his duty and earn fame as a great commander rostov charged the french because he could not restrain his wish for a gallop across a level field and in the same way the innumerable people who took part in the war acted in accord with their personal characteristics habits circumstances and aims they were moved by fear or vanity rejoiced or were indignant reasoned imagining that they knew what they were doing and did it of their own free will but they all were involuntary tools of history carrying on a work concealed from them but comprehensible to us such is the inevitable fate of men of action and the higher they stand in the social hierarchy the less are they free 
 the actors of have long since left the stage their personal interests have vanished leaving no trace and nothing remains of that time but its historic results 
 providence compelled all these men striving to attain personal aims to further the accomplishment of a stupendous result no one of them at all expected neither napoleon nor alexander nor still less any of those who did the actual fighting 
 the cause of the destruction of the french army in is clear to us now no one will deny that that cause was on the one hand its advance into the heart of russia late in the season without any preparation for a winter campaign and on the other the character given to the war by the burning of russian towns and the hatred of the foe this aroused among the russian people but no one at the time foresaw what now seems so evident that this was the only way an army of eight hundred thousand men the best in the world and led by the best general could be destroyed in conflict with a raw army of half its numerical strength and led by inexperienced commanders as the russian army was not only did no one see this but on the russian side every effort was made to hinder the only thing that could save russia while on the french side despite experience and military genius every effort was directed to pushing on to moscow at the end of the summer that is to doing the very thing that was bound to lead to destruction 
 in historical works on the year french writers are very fond of saying that napoleon felt the danger of extending his line that he sought a battle and that his marshals advised him to stop at smolensk and of making similar statements to show that the danger of the campaign was even then understood russian authors are still fonder of telling us that from the commencement of the campaign a scythian war plan was adopted to lure napoleon into the depths of russia and this plan some of them attribute to pfuel others to a certain frenchman others to toll and others again to alexander himself pointing to notes projects and letters which contain hints of such a line of action but all these hints at what happened both from the french side and the russian are advanced only because they fit in with the event had that event not occurred these hints would have been forgotten as we have forgotten the thousands and millions of hints and expectations to the contrary which were current then but have now been forgotten because the event falsified them there are always so many conjectures as to the issue of any event that however it may end there will always be people to say i said then that it 
 would be so quite forgetting that amid their innumerable conjectures many were to quite the contrary effect 
 conjectures as to awareness of the danger of extending his line and on the russian side as to luring the enemy into the depths of russia are evidently of that kind and only by much straining can historians attribute such conceptions to napoleon and his marshals or such plans to the russian commanders all the facts are in flat contradiction to such conjectures during the whole period of the war not only was there no wish on the russian side to draw the french into the heart of the country but from their first entry into russia everything was done to stop them and not only was napoleon not afraid to extend his line but he welcomed every step forward as a triumph and did not seek battle as eagerly as in former campaigns but very lazily 
 at the very beginning of the war our armies were divided and our sole aim was to unite them though uniting the armies was no advantage if we meant to retire and lure the enemy into the depths of the country our emperor joined the army to encourage it to defend every inch of russian soil and not to retreat the enormous drissa camp was formed on plan and there was no intention of retiring farther the emperor reproached the commanders in chief for every step they retired he could not bear the idea of letting the enemy even reach smolensk still less could he contemplate the burning of moscow and when our armies did unite he was displeased that smolensk was abandoned and burned without a general engagement having been fought under its walls 
 so thought the emperor and the russian commanders and people were still more provoked at the thought that our forces were retreating into the depths of the country 
 napoleon having cut our armies apart advanced far into the country and missed several chances of forcing an engagement in august he was at smolensk and thought only of how to advance farther though as we now see that advance was evidently ruinous to him 
 the facts clearly show that napoleon did not foresee the danger of the advance on moscow nor did alexander and the russian commanders then think of luring napoleon on but quite the contrary the luring of napoleon into the depths of the country was not the result of any plan for no one believed it to be possible it resulted from a most complex interplay of intrigues aims and wishes among those who took part in the war and had no perception whatever of the inevitable or of the one way of saving russia everything came about fortuitously the armies were divided at the commencement of the campaign we tried to unite them with the evident intention of giving battle and checking the advance and by this effort to unite them while avoiding battle with a much stronger enemy and necessarily withdrawing the armies at an acute angle we led the french on to smolensk but we withdrew at an acute angle not only because the french advanced between our two armies the angle became still more acute and we withdrew still farther because barclay de tolly was an unpopular foreigner disliked by bagration who would come his command and bagration being in command of the second army tried to postpone joining up and coming under command as long as he could bagration was slow in effecting the junction though that was the chief aim of all at headquarters because as he alleged he exposed his army to danger on this march and it was best for him to retire more to the left and more to the south worrying the enemy from flank and rear and securing from the ukraine recruits for his army and it looks as if he planned this in order not to come under the command of the detested foreigner barclay whose rank was inferior to his own 
 the emperor was with the army to encourage it but his presence and ignorance of what steps to take and the enormous number of advisers and plans destroyed the first energy and it retired 
 the intention was to make a stand at the drissa camp but paulucci aiming at becoming commander in chief unexpectedly employed his energy to influence alexander and whole plan was abandoned and the command entrusted to barclay but as barclay did not inspire confidence his power was limited the armies were divided there was no unity of command and barclay was unpopular but from this confusion division and the unpopularity of the foreign commander in chief there resulted on the one hand indecision and the avoidance of a battle which we could not have refrained from had the armies been united and had someone else instead of barclay been in command and on the other an indignation against the foreigners and an increase in patriotic zeal 
 at last the emperor left the army and as the most convenient and indeed the only pretext for his departure it was decided that it was necessary for him to inspire the people in the capitals and arouse the nation in general to a patriotic war and by this visit of the emperor to moscow the strength of the russian army was trebled 
 he left in order not to obstruct the commander in undivided control of the army and hoping that more decisive action would then be taken but the command of the armies became still more confused and enfeebled bennigsen the tsarevich and a swarm of adjutants general remained with the army to keep the commander in chief under observation and arouse his energy and barclay feeling less free than ever under the observation of all these eyes of the emperor became still more cautious of undertaking any decisive action and avoided giving battle 
 barclay stood for caution the tsarevich hinted at treachery and demanded a general engagement lubomirski bronnitski wlocki and the others of that group stirred up so much trouble that barclay under pretext of sending papers to the emperor dispatched these polish adjutants general to petersburg and plunged into an open struggle with bennigsen and the tsarevich 
 at smolensk the armies at last reunited much as bagration disliked it 
 bagration drove up in a carriage to to the house occupied by barclay barclay donned his sash and came out to meet and report to his senior officer bagration 
 despite his seniority in rank bagration in this contest of magnanimity took his orders from barclay but having submitted agreed with him less than ever by the orders bagration reported direct to him he wrote to arakcheev the confidant it must be as my sovereign pleases but i cannot work with the minister meaning barclay for sake send me somewhere else if only in command of a regiment i cannot stand it here headquarters are so full of germans that a russian cannot exist and there is no sense in anything i thought i was really serving my sovereign and the fatherland but it turns out that i am serving barclay i confess i do not want to 
 the swarm of bronnitskis and wintzingerodes and their like still further embittered the relations between the commanders in chief and even less unity resulted preparations were made to fight the french before smolensk a general was sent to survey the position this general hating barclay rode to visit a friend of his own a corps commander and having spent the day with him returned to barclay and condemned as unsuitable from every point of view the battleground he had not seen 
 while disputes and intrigues were going on about the future field of battle and while we were looking for the french having lost touch with them the french stumbled upon division and reached the walls of smolensk 
 it was necessary to fight an unexpected battle at smolensk to save our lines of communication the battle was fought and thousands were killed on both sides 
 smolensk was abandoned contrary to the wishes of the emperor and of the whole people but smolensk was burned by its own had been misled by their governor and these ruined inhabitants setting an example to other russians went to moscow thinking only of their own losses but kindling hatred of the foe napoleon advanced farther and we retired thus arriving at the very result which caused his destruction

 chapter iii 
 
 effect of the spring 
 one day the air was warm the luxembourg was inundated with light and shade the sky was as pure as though the angels had washed it that morning the sparrows were giving vent to little twitters in the depths of the marius had thrown open his whole soul to nature he was not thinking of anything he simply lived and breathed he passed near the bench the young girl raised her eyes to him the two glances met 
 what was there in the young glance on this occasion marius could not have told 
 there was nothing and there was everything it was a strange flash 
 she dropped her eyes and he pursued his way 
 what he had just seen was no longer the ingenuous and simple eye of a child it was a mysterious gulf which had half opened then abruptly closed again 
 there comes a day when the young girl glances in this manner woe to him who chances to be there 
 that first gaze of a soul which does not as yet know itself is like the dawn in the sky 
 it is the awakening of something radiant and strange 
 nothing can give any idea of the dangerous charm of that unexpected gleam which flashes suddenly and vaguely forth from adorable shadows and which is composed of all the innocence of the present and of all the passion of the future it is a sort of undecided tenderness which reveals itself by chance and which waits 
 it is a snare which the innocent maiden sets unknown to herself and in which she captures hearts without either wishing or knowing it 
 it is a virgin looking like a woman 
 it is rare that a profound revery does not spring from that glance where it falls 
 all purities and all candors meet in that celestial and fatal gleam which more than all the tender glances of coquettes possesses the magic power of causing the sudden blossoming in the depths of the soul of that sombre flower impregnated with perfume and with poison which is called love 
 that evening on his return to his garret marius cast his eyes over his garments and perceived for the first time that he had been so slovenly indecorous and inconceivably stupid as to go for his walk in the luxembourg with his clothes that is to say with a hat battered near the band coarse boots black trousers which showed white at the knees and a black coat which was pale at the elbows

 chapter ii 
 
 the day after his son had left prince nicholas sent for princess mary to come to his study 
 well are you satisfied now said he made me quarrel with my son satisfied are you all you wanted satisfied it hurts me it hurts old and weak and this is what you wanted well then gloat over it gloat over it 
 after that princess mary did not see her father for a whole week he was ill and did not leave his study 
 princess mary noticed to her surprise that during this illness the old prince not only excluded her from his room but did not admit mademoiselle bourienne either tikhon alone attended him 
 at the end of the week the prince reappeared and resumed his former way of life devoting himself with special activity to building operations and the arrangement of the gardens and completely breaking off his relations with mademoiselle bourienne his looks and cold tone to his daughter seemed to say there you see you plotted against me you lied to prince andrew about my relations with that frenchwoman and made me quarrel with him but you see i need neither her nor you 
 princess mary spent half of every day with little nicholas watching his lessons teaching him russian and music herself and talking to dessalles the rest of the day she spent over her books with her old nurse or with folk who sometimes came by the back door to see her 
 of the war princess mary thought as women do think about wars she feared for her brother who was in it was horrified by and amazed at the strange cruelty that impels men to kill one another but she did not understand the significance of this war which seemed to her like all previous wars she did not realize the significance of this war though dessalles with whom she constantly conversed was passionately interested in its progress and tried to explain his own conception of it to her and though the folk who came to see her reported in their own way the rumors current among the people of an invasion by antichrist and though julie now princess drubetskaya who had resumed correspondence with her wrote patriotic letters from moscow 
 i write you in russian my good friend wrote julie in her frenchified russian because i have a detestation for all the french and the same for their language which i cannot support to hear spoken we in moscow are elated by enthusiasm for our adored emperor 
 my poor husband is enduring pains and hunger in jewish taverns but the news which i have inspires me yet more 
 you heard probably of the heroic exploit of raevski embracing his two sons and saying i will perish with them but we will not be shaken and truly though the enemy was twice stronger than we we were unshakable we pass the time as we can but in war as in war the princesses aline and sophie sit whole days with me and we unhappy widows of live men make beautiful conversations over our charpie only you my friend are missing and so on 
 the chief reason princess mary did not realize the full significance of this war was that the old prince never spoke of it did not recognize it and laughed at dessalles when he mentioned it at dinner the tone was so calm and confident that princess mary unhesitatingly believed him 
 all that july the old prince was exceedingly active and even animated he planned another garden and began a new building for the domestic serfs the only thing that made princess mary anxious about him was that he slept very little and instead of sleeping in his study as usual changed his sleeping place every day one day he would order his camp bed to be set up in the glass gallery another day he remained on the couch or on the lounge chair in the drawing room and dozed there without undressing while instead of mademoiselle bourienne a serf boy read to him then again he would spend a night in the dining room 
 on august a second letter was received from prince andrew in his first letter which came soon after he had left home prince andrew had dutifully asked his forgiveness for what he had allowed himself to say and begged to be restored to his favor to this letter the old prince had replied affectionately and from that time had kept the frenchwoman at at prince second letter written near vitebsk after the french had occupied that town gave a brief account of the whole campaign enclosed for them a plan he had drawn and forecasts as to the further progress of the war in this letter prince andrew pointed out to his father the danger of staying at bald hills so near the theater of war and on the direct line of march and advised him to move to moscow 
 at dinner that day on dessalles mentioning that the french were said to have already entered vitebsk the old prince remembered his letter 
 there was a letter from prince andrew today he said to princess mary you read it 
 no father she replied in a frightened voice 
 she could not have read the letter as she did not even know it had arrived 
 he writes about this war said the prince with the ironic smile that had become habitual to him in speaking of the present war 
 that must be very interesting said dessalles prince andrew is in a position to know 
 oh very interesting said mademoiselle bourienne 
 go and get it for me said the old prince to mademoiselle bourienne you know under the paperweight on the little table 
 mademoiselle bourienne jumped up eagerly 
 no he exclaimed with a frown you go michael ivanovich 
 michael ivanovich rose and went to the study but as soon as he had left the room the old prince looking uneasily round threw down his napkin and went himself 
 they do anything always make some muddle he muttered 
 while he was away princess mary dessalles mademoiselle bourienne and even little nicholas exchanged looks in silence the old prince returned with quick steps accompanied by michael ivanovich bringing the letter and a plan these he put down beside him not letting anyone read them at dinner 
 on moving to the drawing room he handed the letter to princess mary and spreading out before him the plan of the new building and fixing his eyes upon it told her to read the letter aloud when she had done so princess mary looked inquiringly at her father he was examining the plan evidently engrossed in his own ideas 
 what do you think of it prince dessalles ventured to ask 
 i i said the prince as if unpleasantly awakened and not taking his eyes from the plan of the building 
 very possibly the theater of war will move so near to us that 
 ha ha ha the theater of war said the prince i have said and still say that the theater of war is poland and the enemy will never get beyond the niemen 
 dessalles looked in amazement at the prince who was talking of the niemen when the enemy was already at the dnieper but princess mary forgetting the geographical position of the niemen thought that what her father was saying was correct 
 when the snow melts sink in the polish swamps only they could fail to see it the prince continued evidently thinking of the campaign of which seemed to him so recent bennigsen should have advanced into prussia sooner then things would have taken a different turn 
 but prince dessalles began timidly the letter mentions vitebsk 
 ah the letter yes replied the prince peevishly yes yes his face suddenly took on a morose expression he paused yes he writes that the french were beaten at at what river is it 
 dessalles dropped his eyes 
 the prince says nothing about that he remarked gently 
 he but i invent it myself 
 no one spoke for a long time 
 yes yes well michael ivanovich he suddenly went on raising his head and pointing to the plan of the building tell me how you mean to alter it 
 michael ivanovich went up to the plan and the prince after speaking to him about the building looked angrily at princess mary and dessalles and went to his own room 
 princess mary saw dessalles embarrassed and astonished look fixed on her father noticed his silence and was struck by the fact that her father had forgotten his letter on the table but she was not only afraid to speak of it and ask dessalles the reason of his confusion and silence but was afraid even to think about it 
 in the evening michael ivanovich sent by the prince came to princess mary for prince letter which had been forgotten in the drawing room she gave it to him and unpleasant as it was to her to do so ventured to ask him what her father was doing 
 always busy replied michael ivanovich with a respectfully ironic smile which caused princess mary to turn pale worrying very much about the new building he has been reading a little but now michael ivanovich went on lowering his voice now at his desk busy with his will i expect one of the favorite occupations of late had been the preparation of some papers he meant to leave at his death and which he called his will 
 and alpatych is being sent to smolensk asked princess mary 
 oh yes he has been waiting to start for some time

 beginning of a great malady 
 on the following day at the accustomed hour marius drew from his wardrobe his new coat his new trousers his new hat and his new boots he clothed himself in this complete panoply put on his gloves a tremendous luxury and set off for the luxembourg 
 on the way thither he encountered courfeyrac and pretended not to see him 
 courfeyrac on his return home said to his friends 
 i have just met marius new hat and new coat with marius inside them 
 he was going to pass an examination no doubt he looked utterly stupid 
 on arriving at the luxembourg marius made the tour of the fountain basin and stared at the swans then he remained for a long time in contemplation before a statue whose head was perfectly black with mould and one of whose hips was missing 
 near the basin there was a bourgeois forty years of age with a prominent stomach who was holding by the hand a little urchin of five and saying to him 
 shun excess my son keep at an equal distance from despotism and from anarchy 
 marius listened to this bourgeois then he made the circuit of the basin once more 
 at last he directed his course towards his alley slowly and as if with regret one would have said that he was both forced to go there and withheld from doing so 
 he did not perceive it himself and thought that he was doing as he always did 
 on turning into the walk he saw m leblanc and the young girl at the other end on their bench 
 he buttoned his coat up to the very top pulled it down on his body so that there might be no wrinkles examined with a certain complaisance the lustrous gleams of his trousers and marched on the bench 
 this march savored of an attack and certainly of a desire for conquest 
 so i say that he marched on the bench as i should say 
 hannibal marched on rome 
 however all his movements were purely mechanical and he had interrupted none of the habitual preoccupations of his mind and labors 
 at that moment he was thinking that the manuel du baccalaureat was a stupid book and that it must have been drawn up by rare idiots to allow of three tragedies of racine and only one comedy of moliere being analyzed therein as masterpieces of the human mind 
 there was a piercing whistling going on in his ears as he approached the bench he held fast to the folds in his coat and fixed his eyes on the young girl 
 it seemed to him that she filled the entire extremity of the alley with a vague blue light 
 in proportion as he drew near his pace slackened more and more on arriving at some little distance from the bench and long before he had reached the end of the walk he halted and could not explain to himself why he retraced his steps 
 he did not even say to himself that he would not go as far as the end 
 it was only with difficulty that the young girl could have perceived him in the distance and noted his fine appearance in his new clothes 
 nevertheless he held himself very erect in case any one should be looking at him from behind 
 he attained the opposite end then came back and this time he approached a little nearer to the bench 
 he even got to within three intervals of trees but there he felt an indescribable impossibility of proceeding further and he hesitated 
 he thought he saw the young face bending towards him 
 but he exerted a manly and violent effort subdued his hesitation and walked straight ahead 
 a few seconds later he rushed in front of the bench erect and firm reddening to the very ears without daring to cast a glance either to the right or to the left with his hand thrust into his coat like a statesman 
 at the moment when he passed under the cannon of the felt his heart beat wildly as on the preceding day she wore her damask gown and her crape bonnet he heard an ineffable voice which must have been her voice she was talking tranquilly 
 she was very pretty 
 he felt it although he made no attempt to see her 
 she could not however he thought help feeling esteem and consideration for me if she only knew that i am the veritable author of the dissertation on marcos obregon de la ronde which m francois de neufchateau put as though it were his own at the head of his edition of gil blas he went beyond the bench as far as the extremity of the walk which was very near then turned on his heel and passed once more in front of the lovely girl 
 this time he was very pale moreover all his emotions were disagreeable 
 as he went further from the bench and the young girl and while his back was turned to her he fancied that she was gazing after him and that made him stumble 
 he did not attempt to approach the bench again he halted near the middle of the walk and there a thing which he never did he sat down and reflecting in the most profoundly indistinct depths of his spirit that after all it was hard that persons whose white bonnet and black gown he admired should be absolutely insensible to his splendid trousers and his new coat 
 at the expiration of a quarter of an hour he rose as though he were on the point of again beginning his march towards that bench which was surrounded by an aureole 
 but he remained standing there motionless 
 for the first time in fifteen months he said to himself that that gentleman who sat there every day with his daughter had on his side noticed him and probably considered his assiduity singular 
 for the first time also he was conscious of some irreverence in designating that stranger even in his secret thoughts by the sobriquet of m le blanc 
 he stood thus for several minutes with drooping head tracing figures in the sand with the cane which he held in his hand 
 then he turned abruptly in the direction opposite to the bench to m leblanc and his daughter and went home 
 that day he forgot to dine 
 at eight in the evening he perceived this fact and as it was too late to go down to the rue he said 
 never mind and ate a bit of bread 
 he did not go to bed until he had brushed his coat and folded it up with great care

 chapter iii 
 
 when michael ivanovich returned to the study with the letter the old prince with spectacles on and a shade over his eyes was sitting at his open bureau with screened candles holding a paper in his outstretched hand and in a somewhat dramatic attitude was reading his manuscript his remarks as he termed it which was to be transmitted to the emperor after his death 
 when michael ivanovich went in there were tears in the eyes evoked by the memory of the time when the paper he was now reading had been written he took the letter from michael hand put it in his pocket folded up his papers and called in alpatych who had long been waiting 
 the prince had a list of things to be bought in smolensk and walking up and down the room past alpatych who stood by the door he gave his instructions 
 first notepaper do you hear eight quires like this sample it must be exactly like the sample varnish sealing wax as in michael list 
 he paced up and down for a while and glanced at his notes 
 then hand to the governor in person a letter about the deed 
 next bolts for the doors of the new building were wanted and had to be of a special shape the prince had himself designed and a leather case had to be ordered to keep the will in 
 the instructions to alpatych took over two hours and still the prince did not let him go he sat down sank into thought closed his eyes and dozed off alpatych made a slight movement 
 well go go if anything more is wanted send after you 
 alpatych went out the prince again went to his bureau glanced into it fingered his papers closed the bureau again and sat down at the table to write to the governor 
 it was already late when he rose after sealing the letter he wished to sleep but he knew he would not be able to and that most depressing thoughts came to him in bed so he called tikhon and went through the rooms with him to show him where to set up the bed for that night 
 he went about looking at every corner every place seemed unsatisfactory but worst of all was his customary couch in the study that couch was dreadful to him probably because of the oppressive thoughts he had had when lying there it was unsatisfactory everywhere but the corner behind the piano in the sitting room was better than other places he had never slept there yet 
 with the help of a footman tikhon brought in the bedstead and began putting it up 
 not right not right cried the prince and himself pushed it a few inches from the corner and then closer in again 
 well at last finished now rest thought the prince and let tikhon undress him 
 frowning with vexation at the effort necessary to divest himself of his coat and trousers the prince undressed sat down heavily on the bed and appeared to be meditating as he looked contemptuously at his withered yellow legs he was not meditating but only deferring the moment of making the effort to lift those legs up and turn over on the bed ugh how hard it is oh that this toil might end and you would release me thought he pressing his lips together he made that effort for the time and lay down but hardly had he done so before he felt the bed rocking backwards and forwards beneath him as if it were breathing heavily and jolting this happened to him almost every night he opened his eyes as they were closing 
 no peace damn them he muttered angry he knew not with whom ah yes there was something else important very important that i was keeping till i should be in bed the bolts no i told him about them no it was something something in the drawing room princess mary talked some nonsense dessalles that fool said something something in my pocket remember 
 tikhon what did we talk about at dinner 
 about prince michael 
 be quiet quiet the prince slapped his hand on the table yes i know prince letter princess mary read it dessalles said something about vitebsk now read it 
 he had the letter taken from his pocket and the table on which stood a glass of lemonade and a spiral wax candle moved close to the bed and putting on his spectacles he began reading only now in the stillness of the night reading it by the faint light under the green shade did he grasp its meaning for a moment 
 the french at vitebsk in four days march they may be at smolensk perhaps are already there tikhon tikhon jumped up no no i want anything he shouted 
 he put the letter under the candlestick and closed his eyes and there rose before him the danube at bright noonday reeds the russian camp and himself a young general without a wrinkle on his ruddy face vigorous and alert entering gaily colored tent and a burning sense of jealousy of the favorite agitated him now as strongly as it had done then he recalled all the words spoken at that first meeting with potemkin and he saw before him a plump rather short stout woman the empress mother with her smile and her words at her first gracious reception of him and then that same face on the catafalque and the encounter he had with zubov over her coffin about his right to kiss her hand 
 oh quicker quicker to get back to that time and have done with all the present quicker quicker and that they should leave me in peace

 divrs claps of thunder fall on bougon 
 on the following day bougon as courfeyrac styled the old housekeeper of the gorbeau hovel bougon whose name was in reality madame burgon as we have found out but this iconoclast courfeyrac respected nothing bougon observed with stupefaction that m marius was going out again in his new coat 
 he went to the luxembourg again but he did not proceed further than his bench midway of the alley 
 he seated himself there as on the preceding day surveying from a distance and clearly making out the white bonnet the black dress and above all that blue light he did not stir from it and only went home when the gates of the luxembourg closed 
 he did not see m leblanc and his daughter retire he concluded that they had quitted the garden by the gate on the rue de later on several weeks afterwards when he came to think it over he could never recall where he had dined that evening 
 on the following day which was the third bougon was thunderstruck 
 marius went out in his new coat three days in succession she exclaimed 
 she tried to follow him but marius walked briskly and with immense strides it was a hippopotamus undertaking the pursuit of a chamois she lost sight of him in two minutes and returned breathless choked with asthma and furious 
 if there is any sense she growled in putting on best clothes every day and making people run like this 
 marius betook himself to the luxembourg 
 the young girl was there with m leblanc 
 marius approached as near as he could pretending to be busy reading a book but he halted afar off then returned and seated himself on his bench where he spent four hours in watching the who were skipping about the walk and who produced on him the impression that they were making sport of him 
 a fortnight passed thus 
 marius went to the luxembourg no longer for the sake of strolling there but to seat himself always in the same spot and that without knowing why 
 once arrived there he did not stir 
 he put on his new coat every morning for the purpose of not showing himself and he began all over again on the morrow 
 she was decidedly a marvellous beauty 
 the only remark approaching a criticism that could be made was that the contradiction between her gaze which was melancholy and her smile which was merry gave a rather wild effect to her face which sometimes caused this sweet countenance to become strange without ceasing to be charming

 bald hills prince nicholas estate lay forty miles east from smolensk and two miles from the main road to moscow 
 the same evening that the prince gave his instructions to alpatych dessalles having asked to see princess mary told her that as the prince was not very well and was taking no steps to secure his safety though from prince letter it was evident that to remain at bald hills might be dangerous he respectfully advised her to send a letter by alpatych to the provincial governor at smolensk asking him to let her know the state of affairs and the extent of the danger to which bald hills was exposed dessalles wrote this letter to the governor for princess mary she signed it and it was given to alpatych with instructions to hand it to the governor and to come back as quickly as possible if there was danger 
 having received all his orders alpatych wearing a white beaver hat a present from the prince and carrying a stick as the prince did went out accompanied by his family three roans stood ready harnessed to a small conveyance with a leather hood 
 the larger bell was muffled and the little bells on the harness stuffed with paper the prince allowed no one at bald hills to drive with ringing bells but on a long journey alpatych liked to have them his satellites the senior clerk a countinghouse clerk a scullery maid a cook two old women a little pageboy the coachman and various domestic serfs were seeing him off 
 his daughter placed down cushions for him to sit on and behind his back his old popped in a small bundle and one of the coachmen helped him into the vehicle 
 there there fuss women women said alpatych puffing and speaking rapidly just as the prince did and he climbed into the trap 
 after giving the clerk orders about the work to be done alpatych not trying to imitate the prince now lifted the hat from his bald head and crossed himself three times 
 if there is anything come back yakov alpatych for sake think of us cried his wife referring to the rumors of war and the enemy 
 women women fuss muttered alpatych to himself and started on his journey looking round at the fields of yellow rye and the thickly growing oats and at other quite black fields just being plowed a second time 
 as he went along he looked with pleasure at the splendid crop of corn scrutinized the strips of ryefield which here and there were already being reaped made his calculations as to the sowing and the harvest and asked himself whether he had not forgotten any of the orders 
 having baited the horses twice on the way he arrived at the town toward evening on the fourth of august 
 alpatych kept meeting and overtaking baggage trains and troops on the road as he approached smolensk he heard the sounds of distant firing but these did not impress him what struck him most was the sight of a splendid field of oats in which a camp had been pitched and which was being mown down by the soldiers evidently for fodder this fact impressed alpatych but in thinking about his own business he soon forgot it 
 all the interests of his life for more than thirty years had been bounded by the will of the prince and he never went beyond that limit everything not connected with the execution of the orders did not interest and did not even exist for alpatych 
 on reaching smolensk on the evening of the fourth of august he put up in the gachina suburb across the dnieper at the inn kept by ferapontov where he had been in the habit of putting up for the last thirty years some thirty years ago ferapontov by advice had bought a wood from the prince had begun to trade and now had a house an inn and a corn shop in that province he was a stout dark peasant in the forties with thick lips a broad knob of a nose similar knobs over his black frowning brows and a round belly 
 wearing a waistcoat over his cotton shirt ferapontov was standing before his shop which opened onto the street on seeing alpatych he went up to him 
 welcome yakov alpatych folks are leaving the town but you have come to it said he 
 why are they leaving the town asked alpatych 
 what i say folks are foolish always afraid of the french 
 fuss fuss said alpatych 
 just what i think yakov alpatych what i say is orders have been given not to let them in so that must be right and the peasants are asking three rubles for carting it christian 
 yakov alpatych heard without heeding he asked for a samovar and for hay for his horses and when he had had his tea he went to bed 
 all night long troops were moving past the inn next morning alpatych donned a jacket he wore only in town and went out on business it was a sunny morning and by eight it was already hot a good day for harvesting thought alpatych 
 from beyond the town firing had been heard since early morning at eight the booming of cannon was added to the sound of musketry many people were hurrying through the streets and there were many soldiers but cabs were still driving about tradesmen stood at their shops and service was being held in the churches as usual alpatych went to the shops to government offices to the post office and to the in the offices and shops and at the post office everyone was talking about the army and about the enemy who was already attacking the town everybody was asking what should be done and all were trying to calm one another 
 in front of the house alpatych found a large number of people cossacks and a traveling carriage of the at the porch he met two of the landed gentry one of whom he knew this man an of police was saying angrily 
 no joke you know all very well if single one man though undone is but one as the proverb says but with thirteen in your family and all the property brought us to utter ruin what sort of governors are they to do that they ought to be hanged the brigands 
 oh come enough said the other 
 what do i care let him hear not dogs said the of police and looking round he noticed alpatych 
 oh yakov alpatych what have you come for 
 to see the governor by his order answered alpatych lifting his head and proudly thrusting his hand into the bosom of his coat as he always did when he mentioned the prince he has ordered me to inquire into the position of affairs he added 
 yes go and find out shouted the angry gentleman brought things to such a pass that there are no carts or anything there it is again do you hear said he pointing in the direction whence came the sounds of firing 
 brought us all to ruin the brigands he repeated and descended the porch steps 
 alpatych swayed his head and went upstairs in the waiting room were tradesmen women and officials looking silently at one another the door of the room opened and they all rose and moved forward an official ran out said some words to a merchant called a stout official with a cross hanging on his neck to follow him and vanished again evidently wishing to avoid the inquiring looks and questions addressed to him alpatych moved forward and next time the official came out addressed him one hand placed in the breast of his buttoned coat and handed him two letters 
 to his honor baron asch from prince bolkonski he announced with such solemnity and significance that the official turned to him and took the letters 
 a few minutes later the governor received alpatych and hurriedly said to him 
 inform the prince and princess that i knew nothing i acted on the highest instructions here and he handed a paper to alpatych still as the prince is unwell my advice is that they should go to moscow i am just starting myself inform them 
 but the governor did not finish a dusty perspiring officer ran into the room and began to say something in french the face expressed terror 
 go he said nodding his head to alpatych and began questioning the officer 
 eager frightened helpless glances were turned on alpatych when he came out of the room involuntarily listening now to the firing which had drawn nearer and was increasing in strength alpatych hurried to his inn the paper handed to him by the governor said this 
 i assure you that the town of smolensk is not in the slightest danger as yet and it is unlikely that it will be threatened with any i from the one side and prince bagration from the other are marching to unite our forces before smolensk which junction will be effected on the nd instant and both armies with their united forces will defend our compatriots of the province entrusted to your care till our efforts shall have beaten back the enemies of our fatherland or till the last warrior in our valiant ranks has perished from this you will see that you have a perfect right to reassure the inhabitants of smolensk for those defended by two such brave armies may feel assured of victory instructions from barclay de tolly to baron asch the civil governor of smolensk 
 people were anxiously roaming about the streets 
 carts piled high with household utensils chairs and cupboards kept emerging from the gates of the yards and moving along the streets loaded carts stood at the house next to and women were wailing and lamenting as they said a small watchdog ran round barking in front of the harnessed horses 
 alpatych entered the innyard at a quicker pace than usual and went straight to the shed where his horses and trap were the coachman was asleep he woke him up told him to harness and went into the passage from the room came the sounds of a child crying the despairing sobs of a woman and the hoarse angry shouting of ferapontov the cook began running hither and thither in the passage like a frightened hen just as alpatych entered 
 done her to death killed the mistress beat her dragged her about so 
 what for asked alpatych 
 she kept begging to go away a woman take me away says she let me perish with my little children folks she says are all gone so why she says we go and he began beating and pulling her about so 
 at these words alpatych nodded as if in approval and not wishing to hear more went to the door of the room opposite the where he had left his purchases 
 you brute you murderer screamed a thin pale woman who with a baby in her arms and her kerchief torn from her head burst through the door at that moment and down the steps into the yard 
 ferapontov came out after her but on seeing alpatych adjusted his waistcoat smoothed his hair yawned and followed alpatych into the opposite room 
 going already said he 
 alpatych without answering or looking at his host sorted his packages and asked how much he owed 
 reckon up well have you been to the asked ferapontov what has been decided 
 alpatych replied that the governor had not told him anything definite 
 with our business how can we get away said ferapontov have to pay seven rubles a cartload to dorogobuzh and i tell them not christians to ask it selivanov now did a good stroke last thursday sold flour to the army at nine rubles a sack will you have some tea he added 
 while the horses were being harnessed alpatych and ferapontov over their tea talked of the price of corn the crops and the good weather for harvesting 
 well it seems to be getting quieter remarked ferapontov finishing his third cup of tea and getting up ours must have got the best of it the orders were not to let them in so in force it seems they say the other day matthew ivanych platov drove them into the river marina and drowned some eighteen thousand in one day 
 alpatych collected his parcels handed them to the coachman who had come in and settled up with the innkeeper the noise of wheels hoofs and bells was heard from the gateway as a little trap passed out 
 it was by now late in the afternoon half the street was in shadow the other half brightly lit by the sun alpatych looked out of the window and went to the door suddenly the strange sound of a whistling and thud was heard followed by a boom of cannon blending into a dull roar that set the windows rattling 
 he went out into the street two men were running past toward the bridge from different sides came whistling sounds and the thud of cannon balls and bursting shells falling on the town but these sounds were hardly heard in comparison with the noise of the firing outside the town and attracted little attention from the inhabitants the town was being bombarded by a hundred and thirty guns which napoleon had ordered up after four the people did not at once realize the meaning of this bombardment 
 at first the noise of the falling bombs and shells only aroused curiosity wife who till then had not ceased wailing under the shed became quiet and with the baby in her arms went to the gate listening to the sounds and looking in silence at the people 
 the cook and a shop assistant came to the gate with lively curiosity everyone tried to get a glimpse of the projectiles as they flew over their heads several people came round the corner talking eagerly 
 what force remarked one knocked the roof and ceiling all to splinters 
 routed up the earth like a pig said another 
 grand it bucks one up laughed the first lucky you jumped aside or it would have wiped you out 
 others joined those men and stopped and told how cannon balls had fallen on a house close to them meanwhile still more projectiles now with the swift sinister whistle of a cannon ball now with the agreeable intermittent whistle of a shell flew over heads incessantly but not one fell close by they all flew over alpatych was getting into his trap the innkeeper stood at the gate 
 what are you staring at he shouted to the cook who in her red skirt with sleeves rolled up swinging her bare elbows had stepped to the corner to listen to what was being said 
 what marvels she exclaimed but hearing her voice she turned back pulling down her skirt 
 once more something whistled but this time quite close swooping downwards like a little bird a flame flashed in the middle of the street something exploded and the street was shrouded in smoke 
 scoundrel what are you doing shouted the innkeeper rushing to the cook 
 at that moment the pitiful wailing of women was heard from different sides the frightened baby began to cry and people crowded silently with pale faces round the cook the loudest sound in that crowd was her wailing 
 dear souls dear kind souls let me die my good souls 
 five minutes later no one remained in the street the cook with her thigh broken by a shell splinter had been carried into the kitchen alpatych his coachman wife and children and the house porter were all sitting in the cellar listening the roar of guns the whistling of projectiles and the piteous moaning of the cook which rose above the other sounds did not cease for a moment the mistress rocked and hushed her baby and when anyone came into the cellar asked in a pathetic whisper what had become of her husband who had remained in the street a shopman who entered told her that her husband had gone with others to the cathedral whence they were fetching the icon of smolensk 
 toward dusk the cannonade began to subside alpatych left the cellar and stopped in the doorway the evening sky that had been so clear was clouded with smoke through which high up the sickle of the new moon shone strangely now that the terrible din of the guns had ceased a hush seemed to reign over the town broken only by the rustle of footsteps the moaning the distant cries and the crackle of fires which seemed widespread everywhere the moans had now subsided on two sides black curling clouds of smoke rose and spread from the fires through the streets soldiers in various uniforms walked or ran confusedly in different directions like ants from a ruined several of them ran into yard before eyes alpatych went out to the gate a retreating regiment thronging and hurrying blocked the street 
 noticing him an officer said the town is being abandoned get away get away and then turning to the soldiers shouted 
 teach you to run into the yards 
 alpatych went back to the house called the coachman and told him to set off whole household came out too following alpatych and the coachman the women who had been silent till then suddenly began to wail as they looked at the fires the smoke and even the flames of which could be seen in the failing twilight and as if in reply the same kind of lamentation was heard from other parts of the street inside the shed alpatych and the coachman arranged the tangled reins and traces of their horses with trembling hands 
 as alpatych was driving out of the gate he saw some ten soldiers in open shop talking loudly and filling their bags and knapsacks with flour and sunflower seeds just then ferapontov returned and entered his shop on seeing the soldiers he was about to shout at them but suddenly stopped and clutching at his hair burst into sobs and laughter 
 loot everything lads let those devils get it he cried taking some bags of flour himself and throwing them into the street 
 some of the soldiers were frightened and ran away others went on filling their bags on seeing alpatych ferapontov turned to him 
 russia is done for he cried alpatych set the place on fire myself done for and ferapontov ran into the yard 
 soldiers were passing in a constant stream along the street blocking it completely so that alpatych could not pass out and had to wait wife and children were also sitting in a cart waiting till it was it was possible to drive out 
 night had come there were stars in the sky and the new moon shone out amid the smoke that screened it on the sloping descent to the dnieper cart and that of the wife which were slowly moving amid the rows of soldiers and of other vehicles had to stop in a side street near the crossroads where the vehicles had stopped a house and some shops were on fire this fire was already burning itself out the flames now died down and were lost in the black smoke now suddenly flared up again brightly lighting up with strange distinctness the faces of the people crowding at the crossroads black figures flitted about before the fire and through the incessant crackling of the flames talking and shouting could be heard seeing that his trap would not be able to move on for some time alpatych got down and turned into the side street to look at the fire soldiers were continually rushing backwards and forwards near it and he saw two of them and a man in a frieze coat dragging burning beams into another yard across the street while others carried bundles of hay 
 alpatych went up to a large crowd standing before a high barn which was blazing briskly the walls were all on fire and the back wall had fallen in the wooden roof was collapsing and the rafters were alight the crowd was evidently watching for the roof to fall in and alpatych watched for it too 
 alpatych a familiar voice suddenly hailed the old man 
 mercy on us your excellency answered alpatych immediately recognizing the voice of his young prince 
 prince andrew in his riding cloak mounted on a black horse was looking at alpatych from the back of the crowd 
 why are you here he asked 
 your your excellency stammered alpatych and broke into sobs are we really lost master 
 why are you here prince andrew repeated 
 at that moment the flames flared up and showed his young pale worn face alpatych told how he had been sent there and how difficult it was to get away 
 are we really quite lost your excellency he asked again 
 prince andrew without replying took out a notebook and raising his knee began writing in pencil on a page he tore out he wrote to his sister 
 smolensk is being abandoned bald hills will be occupied by the enemy within a week set off immediately for moscow let me know at once when you will start send by special messenger to usvyazh 
 having written this and given the paper to alpatych he told him how to arrange for departure of the prince the princess his son and the tutor and how and where to let him know immediately before he had had time to finish giving these instructions a chief of staff followed by a suite galloped up to him 
 you are a colonel shouted the chief of staff with a german accent in a voice familiar to prince andrew houses are set on fire in your presence and you stand by what does this mean you will answer for it shouted berg who was now assistant to the chief of staff of the commander of the left flank of the infantry of the first army a place as berg said very agreeable and well en evidence 
 prince andrew looked at him and without replying went on speaking to alpatych 
 so tell them that i shall await a reply till the tenth and if by the tenth i receive news that they have all got away i shall have to throw up everything and come myself to bald hills 
 prince said berg recognizing prince andrew i only spoke because i have to obey orders because i always do obey exactly you must please excuse me he went on apologetically 
 something cracked in the flames the fire died down for a moment and wreaths of black smoke rolled from under the roof there was another terrible crash and something huge collapsed 
 yelled the crowd echoing the crash of the collapsing roof of the barn the burning grain in which diffused a cakelike aroma all around the flames flared up again lighting the animated delighted exhausted faces of the spectators 
 the man in the frieze coat raised his arms and shouted 
 fine lads now raging fine 
 the owner himself cried several voices 
 well then continued prince andrew to alpatych report to them as i have told you and not replying a word to berg who was now mute beside him he touched his horse and rode down the side street

 taken prisoner 
 on one of the last days of the second week marius was seated on his bench as usual holding in his hand an open book of which he had not turned a page for the last two hours 
 all at once he started an event was taking place at the other extremity of the walk leblanc and his daughter had just left their seat and the daughter had taken her arm and both were advancing slowly towards the middle of the alley where marius was 
 marius closed his book then opened it again then forced himself to read he trembled the aureole was coming straight towards him 
 ah good heavens thought he i shall not have time to strike an attitude still the man and the girl advanced 
 it seemed to him that this lasted for a century and that it was but a second what are they coming in this direction for he asked himself what 
 she will pass here 
 her feet will tread this sand this walk two paces from me 
 he was utterly upset he would have liked to be very handsome he would have liked to own the cross he heard the soft and measured sound of their approaching footsteps he imagined that m leblanc was darting angry glances at him is that gentleman going to address me he thought to himself he dropped his head when he raised it again they were very near him the young girl passed and as she passed she glanced at him she gazed steadily at him with a pensive sweetness which thrilled marius from head to foot 
 it seemed to him that she was reproaching him for having allowed so long a time to elapse without coming as far as her and that she was saying to him 
 i am coming myself 
 marius was dazzled by those eyes fraught with rays and abysses 
 he felt his brain on fire 
 she had come to him what joy and then how she had looked at him 
 she appeared to him more beautiful than he had ever seen her yet 
 beautiful with a beauty which was wholly feminine and angelic with a complete beauty which would have made petrarch sing and dante kneel 
 it seemed to him that he was floating free in the azure heavens 
 at the same time he was horribly vexed because there was dust on his boots 
 he thought he felt sure that she had looked at his boots too 
 he followed her with his eyes until she disappeared 
 then he started up and walked about the luxembourg garden like a madman it is possible that at times he laughed to himself and talked aloud he was so dreamy when he came near the nurses that each one of them thought him in love with her 
 he quitted the luxembourg hoping to find her again in the street 
 he encountered courfeyrac under the arcades of the odeon and said to him 
 come and dine with me 
 they went off to and spent six francs 
 marius ate like an ogre 
 he gave the waiter six sous at dessert he said to courfeyrac 
 have you read the paper what a fine discourse audry de puyraveau delivered 
 he was desperately in love 
 after dinner he said to courfeyrac 
 i will treat you to the play they went to the to see frederick in des adrets 
 marius was enormously amused 
 at the same time he had a redoubled attack of shyness on emerging from the theatre he refused to look at the garter of a modiste who was stepping across a gutter and courfeyrac who said 
 i should like to put that woman in my collection almost horrified him 
 courfeyrac invited him to breakfast at the cafe voltaire on the following morning 
 marius went thither and ate even more than on the preceding evening 
 he was very thoughtful and very merry one would have said that he was taking advantage of every occasion to laugh uproariously 
 he tenderly embraced some man or other from the provinces who was presented to him 
 a circle of students formed round the table and they spoke of the nonsense paid for by the state which was uttered from the rostrum in the sorbonne then the conversation fell upon the faults and omissions in dictionaries and grammars 
 marius interrupted the discussion to exclaim 
 but it is very agreeable all the same to have the cross 
 queer whispered courfeyrac to jean prouvaire 
 no responded prouvaire serious 
 it was serious in fact marius had reached that first violent and charming hour with which grand passions begin 
 a glance had wrought all this 
 when the mine is charged when the conflagration is ready nothing is more simple 
 a glance is a spark 
 it was all over with him 
 marius loved a woman 
 his fate was entering the unknown 
 the glance of women resembles certain combinations of wheels which are tranquil in appearance yet formidable 
 you pass close to them every day peaceably and with impunity and without a suspicion of anything 
 a moment arrives when you forget that the thing is there 
 you go and come dream speak laugh 
 all at once you feel yourself clutched all is over 
 the wheels hold you fast the glance has ensnared you 
 it has caught you no matter where or how by some portion of your thought which was fluttering loose by some distraction which had attacked you 
 you are lost 
 the whole of you passes into it 
 a chain of mysterious forces takes possession of you 
 you struggle in vain no more human succor is possible you go on falling from gearing to gearing from agony to agony from torture to torture you your mind your fortune your future your soul and according to whether you are in the power of a wicked creature or of a noble heart you will not escape from this terrifying machine otherwise than disfigured with shame or transfigured by passion

 chapter v 
 
 from smolensk the troops continued to retreat followed by the enemy on the tenth of august the regiment prince andrew commanded was marching along the highroad past the avenue leading to bald hills heat and drought had continued for more than three weeks each day fleecy clouds floated across the sky and occasionally veiled the sun but toward evening the sky cleared again and the sun set in mist heavy night dews alone refreshed the earth the unreaped corn was scorched and shed its grain the marshes dried up the cattle lowed from hunger finding no food on the meadows only at night and in the forests while the dew lasted was there any freshness but on the road the highroad along which the troops marched there was no such freshness even at night or when the road passed through the forest the dew was imperceptible on the sandy dust churned up more than six inches deep as soon as day dawned the march began the artillery and baggage wagons moved noiselessly through the deep dust that rose to the very hubs of the wheels and the infantry sank in that soft choking hot dust that never cooled even at night some of this dust was kneaded by the feet and wheels while the rest rose and hung like a cloud over the troops settling in eyes ears hair and nostrils and worst of all in the lungs of the men and beasts as they moved along that road the higher the sun rose the higher rose that cloud of dust and through the screen of its hot fine particles one could look with naked eye at the sun which showed like a huge crimson ball in the unclouded sky there was no wind and the men choked in that motionless atmosphere they marched with handkerchiefs tied over their noses and mouths when they passed through a village they all rushed to the wells and fought for the water and drank it down to the mud 
 prince andrew was in command of a regiment and the management of that regiment the welfare of the men and the necessity of receiving and giving orders engrossed him the burning of smolensk and its abandonment made an epoch in his life a novel feeling of anger against the foe made him forget his own sorrow he was entirely devoted to the affairs of his regiment and was considerate and kind to his men and officers in the regiment they called him our prince were proud of him and loved him but he was kind and gentle only to those of his regiment to timokhin and the like people quite new to him belonging to a different world and who could not know and understand his past as soon as he came across a former acquaintance or anyone from the staff he bristled up immediately and grew spiteful ironical and contemptuous everything that reminded him of his past was repugnant to him and so in his relations with that former circle he confined himself to trying to do his duty and not to be unfair 
 in truth everything presented itself in a dark and gloomy light to prince andrew especially after the abandonment of smolensk on the sixth of august he considered that it could and should have been defended and after his sick father had had to flee to moscow abandoning to pillage his dearly beloved bald hills which he had built and peopled but despite this thanks to his regiment prince andrew had something to think about entirely apart from general questions two days previously he had received news that his father son and sister had left for moscow and though there was nothing for him to do at bald hills prince andrew with a characteristic desire to foment his own grief decided that he must ride there 
 he ordered his horse to be saddled and leaving his regiment on the march rode to his estate where he had been born and spent his childhood riding past the pond where there used always to be dozens of women chattering as they rinsed their linen or beat it with wooden beetles prince andrew noticed that there was not a soul about and that the little washing wharf torn from its place and half submerged was floating on its side in the middle of the pond he rode to the lodge no one at the stone entrance gates of the drive and the door stood open grass had already begun to grow on the garden paths and horses and calves were straying in the english park prince andrew rode up to the hothouse some of the glass panes were broken and of the trees in tubs some were overturned and others dried up he called for taras the gardener but no one replied having gone round the corner of the hothouse to the ornamental garden he saw that the carved garden fence was broken and branches of the plum trees had been torn off with the fruit an old peasant whom prince andrew in his childhood had often seen at the gate was sitting on a green garden seat plaiting a bast shoe 
 he was deaf and did not hear prince andrew ride up he was sitting on the seat the old prince used to like to sit on and beside him strips of bast were hanging on the broken and withered branch of a magnolia 
 prince andrew rode up to the house several limes in the old garden had been cut down and a piebald mare and her foal were wandering in front of the house among the rosebushes the shutters were all closed except at one window which was open a little serf boy seeing prince andrew ran into the house alpatych having sent his family away was alone at bald hills and was sitting indoors reading the lives of the saints on hearing that prince andrew had come he went out with his spectacles on his nose buttoning his coat and hastily stepping up without a word began weeping and kissing prince knee 
 then vexed at his own weakness he turned away and began to report on the position of affairs everything precious and valuable had been removed to bogucharovo seventy quarters of grain had also been carted away the hay and the spring corn of which alpatych said there had been a remarkable crop that year had been commandeered by the troops and mown down while still green the peasants were ruined some of them too had gone to bogucharovo only a few remained 
 without waiting to hear him out prince andrew asked 
 when did my father and sister leave meaning when did they leave for moscow 
 alpatych understanding the question to refer to their departure for bogucharovo replied that they had left on the seventh and again went into details concerning the estate management asking for instructions 
 am i to let the troops have the oats and to take a receipt for them we have still six hundred quarters left he inquired 
 what am i to say to him thought prince andrew looking down on the old bald head shining in the sun and seeing by the expression on his face that the old man himself understood how untimely such questions were and only asked them to allay his grief 
 yes let them have it replied prince andrew 
 if you noticed some disorder in the garden said alpatych it was impossible to prevent it three regiments have been here and spent the night dragoons mostly i took down the name and rank of their commanding officer to hand in a complaint about it 
 well and what are you going to do will you stay here if the enemy occupies the place asked prince andrew 
 alpatych turned his face to prince andrew looked at him and suddenly with a solemn gesture raised his arm 
 he is my refuge his will be done he exclaimed 
 a group of bareheaded peasants was approaching across the meadow toward the prince 
 well said prince andrew bending over to alpatych you must go away too take away what you can and tell the serfs to go to the ryazan estate or to the one near moscow 
 alpatych clung to prince leg and burst into sobs gently disengaging himself the prince spurred his horse and rode down the avenue at a gallop 
 the old man was still sitting in the ornamental garden like a fly impassive on the face of a loved one who is dead tapping the last on which he was making the bast shoe and two little girls running out from the hot house carrying in their skirts plums they had plucked from the trees there came upon prince andrew on seeing the young master the elder one frightened look clutched her younger companion by the hand and hid with her behind a birch tree not stopping to pick up some green plums they had dropped 
 prince andrew turned away with startled haste unwilling to let them see that they had been observed he was sorry for the pretty frightened little girl was afraid of looking at her and yet felt an irresistible desire to do so a new sensation of comfort and relief came over him when seeing these girls he realized the existence of other human interests entirely aloof from his own and just as legitimate as those that occupied him evidently these girls passionately desired one thing to carry away and eat those green plums without being caught and prince andrew shared their wish for the success of their enterprise he could not resist looking at them once more believing their danger past they sprang from their ambush and chirruping something in their shrill little voices and holding up their skirts their bare little sunburned feet scampered merrily and quickly across the meadow grass 
 prince andrew was somewhat refreshed by having ridden off the dusty highroad along which the troops were moving but not far from bald hills he again came out on the road and overtook his regiment at its halting place by the dam of a small pond it was past one the sun a red ball through the dust burned and scorched his back intolerably through his black coat the dust always hung motionless above the buzz of talk that came from the resting troops there was no wind as he crossed the dam prince andrew smelled the ooze and freshness of the pond he longed to get into that water however dirty it might be and he glanced round at the pool from whence came sounds of shrieks and laughter the small muddy green pond had risen visibly more than a foot flooding the dam because it was full of the naked white bodies of soldiers with hands necks and faces who were splashing about in it all this naked white human flesh laughing and shrieking floundered about in that dirty pool like carp stuffed into a watering can and the suggestion of merriment in that floundering mass rendered it specially pathetic 
 one young soldier of the third company whom prince andrew knew and who had a strap round the calf of one leg crossed himself stepped back to get a good run and plunged into the water another a dark noncommissioned officer who was always shaggy stood up to his waist in the water joyfully wriggling his muscular figure and snorted with satisfaction as he poured the water over his head with hands blackened to the wrists there were sounds of men slapping one another yelling and puffing 
 everywhere on the bank on the dam and in the pond there was healthy white muscular flesh the officer timokhin with his red little nose standing on the dam wiping himself with a towel felt confused at seeing the prince but made up his mind to address him nevertheless 
 very nice your excellency you like to said he 
 dirty replied prince andrew making a grimace 
 clear it out for you in a minute said timokhin and still undressed ran off to clear the men out of the pond 
 the prince wants to bathe 
 what prince ours said many voices and the men were in such haste to clear out that the prince could hardly stop them he decided that he would rather himself with water in the barn 
 flesh bodies cannon fodder he thought and he looked at his own naked body and shuddered not from cold but from a sense of disgust and horror he did not himself understand aroused by the sight of that immense number of bodies splashing about in the dirty pond 
 on the seventh of august prince bagration wrote as follows from his quarters at mikhaylovna on the smolensk road 
 dear count alexis andreevich he was writing to arakcheev but knew that his letter would be read by the emperor and therefore weighed every word in it to the best of his ability 
 i expect the minister barclay de tolly has already reported the abandonment of smolensk to the enemy it is pitiable and sad and the whole army is in despair that this most important place has been wantonly abandoned i for my part begged him personally most urgently and finally wrote him but nothing would induce him to consent i swear to you on my honor that napoleon was in such a fix as never before and might have lost half his army but could not have taken smolensk our troops fought and are fighting as never before with fifteen thousand men i held the enemy at bay for hours and beat him but he would not hold out even for fourteen hours it is disgraceful a stain on our army and as for him he ought it seems to me not to live if he reports that our losses were great it is not true perhaps about four thousand not more and not even that but even were they ten thousand war but the enemy has lost masses 
 what would it have cost him to hold out for another two days they would have had to retire of their own accord for they had no water for men or horses he gave me his word he would not retreat but suddenly sent instructions that he was retiring that night we cannot fight in this way or we may soon bring the enemy to moscow 
 there is a rumor that you are thinking of peace god forbid that you should make peace after all our sacrifices and such insane retreats you would set all russia against you and every one of us would feel ashamed to wear the uniform if it has come to this we must fight as long as russia can and as long as there are men able to stand 
 one man ought to be in command and not two your minister may perhaps be good as a minister but as a general he is not merely bad but execrable yet to him is entrusted the fate of our whole country i am really frantic with vexation forgive my writing boldly it is clear that the man who advocates the conclusion of a peace and that the minister should command the army does not love our sovereign and desires the ruin of us all so i write you frankly call out the militia for the minister is leading these visitors after him to moscow in a most masterly way the whole army feels great suspicion of the imperial wolzogen he is said to be more man than ours and he is always advising the minister i am not merely civil to him but obey him like a corporal though i am his senior this is painful but loving my benefactor and sovereign i submit only i am sorry for the emperor that he entrusts our fine army to such as he consider that on our retreat we have lost by fatigue and left in the hospital more than fifteen thousand men and had we attacked this would not have happened tell me for sake what will russia our mother russia say to our being so frightened and why are we abandoning our good and gallant fatherland to such rabble and implanting feelings of hatred and shame in all our subjects what are we scared at and of whom are we afraid i am not to blame that the minister is vacillating a coward dense dilatory and has all bad qualities the whole army bewails it and calls down curses upon him

 adventures of the letter u delivered over to conjectures 
 isolation detachment from everything pride independence the taste of nature the absence of daily and material activity the life within himself the secret conflicts of chastity a benevolent ecstasy towards all creation had prepared marius for this possession which is called passion 
 his worship of his father had gradually become a religion and like all religions it had retreated to the depths of his soul 
 something was required in the foreground 
 love came 
 a full month elapsed during which marius went every day to the luxembourg 
 when the hour arrived nothing could hold him is on duty said courfeyrac 
 marius lived in a state of delight 
 it is certain that the young girl did look at him 
 he had finally grown bold and approached the bench 
 still he did not pass in front of it any more in obedience to the instinct of timidity and to the instinct of prudence common to lovers he considered it better not to attract the attention of the father he combined his stations behind the trees and the pedestals of the statues with a profound diplomacy so that he might be seen as much as possible by the young girl and as little as possible by the old gentleman 
 sometimes he remained motionless by the together in the shade of a leonidas or a spartacus holding in his hand a book above which his eyes gently raised sought the beautiful girl and she on her side turned her charming profile towards him with a vague smile 
 while conversing in the most natural and tranquil manner in the world with the man she bent upon marius all the reveries of a virginal and passionate eye ancient and manoeuvre which eve understood from the very first day of the world and which every woman understands from the very first day of her life her mouth replied to one and her glance replied to another 
 it must be supposed that m leblanc finally noticed something for often when marius arrived he rose and began to walk about he had abandoned their accustomed place and had adopted the bench by the gladiator near the other end of the walk as though with the object of seeing whether marius would pursue them thither marius did not understand and committed this error 
 the father began to grow inexact and no longer brought his daughter every day 
 sometimes he came alone 
 then marius did not stay another blunder 
 marius paid no heed to these symptoms 
 from the phase of timidity he had passed by a natural and fatal progress to the phase of blindness 
 his love increased 
 he dreamed of it every night and then an unexpected bliss had happened to him oil on the fire a redoubling of the shadows over his eyes 
 one evening at dusk he had found on the bench which m leblanc and his daughter had just quitted a handkerchief a very simple handkerchief without embroidery but white and fine and which seemed to him to exhale ineffable perfume 
 he seized it with rapture this handkerchief was marked with the letters u f marius knew nothing about this beautiful her family name her christian name nor her abode these two letters were the first thing of her that he had gained possession of adorable initials upon which he immediately began to construct his scaffolding u was evidently the christian name 
 ursule he thought what a delicious name 
 he kissed the handkerchief drank it in placed it on his heart on his flesh during the day and at night laid it beneath his lips that he might fall asleep on it 
 i feel that her whole soul lies within it he exclaimed 
 this handkerchief belonged to the old gentleman who had simply let it fall from his pocket 
 in the days which followed the finding of this treasure he only displayed himself at the luxembourg in the act of kissing the handkerchief and laying it on his heart 
 the beautiful child understood nothing of all this and signified it to him by imperceptible signs 
 o modesty said marius

 among the innumerable categories applicable to the phenomena of human life one may discriminate between those in which substance prevails and those in which form prevails to the latter as distinguished from village country provincial or even moscow life we may allot petersburg life and especially the life of its salons that life of the salons is unchanging since the year we had made peace and had again quarreled with bonaparte and had made constitutions and unmade them again but the salons of anna pavlovna helene remained just as they had been the one seven and the other five years before at anna they talked with perplexity of successes just as before and saw in them and in the subservience shown to him by the european sovereigns a malicious conspiracy the sole object of which was to cause unpleasantness and anxiety to the court circle of which anna pavlovna was the representative and in salon which rumyantsev himself honored with his visits regarding helene as a remarkably intelligent woman they talked with the same ecstasy in as in of the great nation and the great man and regretted our rupture with france a rupture which according to them ought to be promptly terminated by peace 
 of late since the return from the army there had been some excitement in these conflicting salon circles and some demonstrations of hostility to one another but each camp retained its own tendency in anna circle only those frenchmen were admitted who were legitimists and patriotic views were expressed to the effect that one ought not to go to the french theater and that to maintain the french troupe was costing the government as much as a whole army corps the progress of the war was eagerly followed and only the reports most flattering to our army were circulated in the french circle of helene and rumyantsev the reports of the cruelty of the enemy and of the war were contradicted and all attempts at conciliation were discussed in that circle they discountenanced those who advised hurried preparations for a removal to kazan of the court and the girls educational establishments under the patronage of the dowager empress in circle the war in general was regarded as a series of formal demonstrations which would very soon end in peace and the view prevailed expressed by bilibin who now in petersburg was quite at home in house which every clever man was obliged to visit that not by gunpowder but by those who invented it would matters be settled in that circle the moscow enthusiasm news of which had reached petersburg simultaneously with the return was ridiculed sarcastically and very cleverly though with much caution 
 anna circle on the contrary was enraptured by this enthusiasm and spoke of it as plutarch speaks of the deeds of the ancients prince vasili who still occupied his former important posts formed a connecting link between these two circles he visited his good friend anna pavlovna as well as his diplomatic salon and often in his constant comings and goings between the two camps became confused and said at what he should have said at anna and vice versa 
 soon after the return prince vasili in a conversation about the war at anna severely condemned barclay de tolly but was undecided as to who ought to be appointed commander in chief one of the visitors usually spoken of as a man of great merit having described how he had that day seen kutuzov the newly chosen chief of the petersburg militia presiding over the enrollment of recruits at the treasury cautiously ventured to suggest that kutuzov would be the man to satisfy all requirements 
 anna pavlovna remarked with a melancholy smile that kutuzov had done nothing but cause the emperor annoyance 
 i have talked and talked at the assembly of the nobility prince vasili interrupted but they did not listen to me i told them his election as chief of the militia would not please the emperor they did not listen to me 
 all this mania for opposition he went on and who for it is all because we want to ape the foolish enthusiasm of those muscovites prince vasili continued forgetting for a moment that though at one had to ridicule the moscow enthusiasm at anna one had to be ecstatic about it but he retrieved his mistake at once now is it suitable that count kutuzov the oldest general in russia should preside at that tribunal he will get nothing for his pains how could they make a man commander in chief who cannot mount a horse who drops asleep at a council and has the very worst morals a good reputation he made for himself at bucharest i speak of his capacity as a general but at a time like this how they appoint they appoint a decrepit blind old man positively blind a fine idea to have a blind general he see anything to play bluff he see at all 
 no one replied to his remarks 
 this was quite correct on the of july but on the of july kutuzov received the title of prince this might indicate a wish to get rid of him and therefore prince opinion continued to be correct though he was not now in any hurry to express it but on the eighth of august a committee consisting of field marshal saltykov arakcheev vyazmitinov lopukhin and kochubey met to consider the progress of the war this committee came to the conclusion that our failures were due to a want of unity in the command and though the members of the committee were aware of the dislike of kutuzov after a short deliberation they agreed to advise his appointment as commander in chief that same day kutuzov was appointed commander in chief with full powers over the armies and over the whole region occupied by them 
 on the ninth of august prince vasili at anna again met the man of great merit the latter was very attentive to anna pavlovna because he wanted to be appointed director of one of the educational establishments for young ladies prince vasili entered the room with the air of a happy conqueror who has attained the object of his desires 
 well have you heard the great news prince kutuzov is field marshal all dissensions are at an end i am so glad so delighted at last we have a man said he glancing sternly and significantly round at everyone in the drawing room 
 the man of great merit despite his desire to obtain the post of director could not refrain from reminding prince vasili of his former opinion though this was impolite to prince vasili in anna drawing room and also to anna pavlovna herself who had received the news with delight he could not resist the temptation 
 but prince they say he is blind said he reminding prince vasili of his own words 
 eh nonsense he sees well enough said prince vasili rapidly in a deep voice and with a slight cough the voice and cough with which he was wont to dispose of all difficulties 
 he sees well enough he added and what i am so pleased about he went on is that our sovereign has given him full powers over all the armies and the whole region powers no commander in chief ever had before he is a second autocrat he concluded with a victorious smile 
 god grant it god grant it said anna pavlovna 
 the man of great merit who was still a novice in court circles wishing to flatter anna pavlovna by defending her former position on this question observed 
 it is said that the emperor was reluctant to give kutuzov those powers they say he blushed like a girl to whom joconde is read when he said to kutuzov your emperor and the fatherland award you this honor 
 perhaps the heart took no part in that speech said anna pavlovna 
 oh no no warmly rejoined prince vasili who would not now yield kutuzov to anyone in his opinion kutuzov was not only admirable himself but was adored by everybody no impossible said he for our sovereign appreciated him so highly before 
 god grant only that prince kutuzov assumes real power and does not allow anyone to put a spoke in his wheel observed anna pavlovna 
 understanding at once to whom she alluded prince vasili said in a whisper 
 i know for a fact that kutuzov made it an absolute condition that the tsarevich should not be with the army do you know what he said to the emperor 
 and prince vasili repeated the words supposed to have been spoken by kutuzov to the emperor i can neither punish him if he does wrong nor reward him if he does right 
 oh a very wise man is prince kutuzov i have known him a long time 
 they even say remarked the man of great merit who did not yet possess courtly tact that his excellency made it an express condition that the sovereign himself should not be with the army 
 as soon as he said this both prince vasili and anna pavlovna turned away from him and glanced sadly at one another with a sigh at his naivete

 the veterans themselves can be happy 
 since we have pronounced the word modesty and since we conceal nothing we ought to say that once nevertheless in spite of his ecstasies his ursule caused him very serious grief 
 it was on one of the days when she persuaded m leblanc to leave the bench and stroll along the walk 
 a brisk may breeze was blowing which swayed the crests of the the father and daughter arm in arm had just passed marius bench 
 marius had risen to his feet behind them and was following them with his eyes as was fitting in the desperate situation of his soul 
 all at once a gust of wind more merry than the rest and probably charged with performing the affairs of springtime swept down from the nursery flung itself on the alley enveloped the young girl in a delicious shiver worthy of nymphs and the fawns of theocritus and lifted her dress the robe more sacred than that of isis almost to the height of her garter 
 a leg of exquisite shape appeared 
 marius saw it 
 he was exasperated and furious 
 the young girl had hastily thrust down her dress with a divinely troubled motion but he was none the less angry for all that 
 he was alone in the alley it is true 
 but there might have been some one there and what if there had been some one there 
 can any one comprehend such a thing 
 what she had just done is the poor child had done nothing there had been but one culprit the wind but marius in whom quivered the bartholo who exists in cherubin was determined to be vexed and was jealous of his own shadow it is thus in fact that the harsh and capricious jealousy of the flesh awakens in the human heart and takes possession of it even without any right 
 moreover setting aside even that jealousy the sight of that charming leg had contained nothing agreeable for him the white stocking of the first woman he chanced to meet would have afforded him more pleasure 
 when his ursule after having reached the end of the walk retraced her steps with m leblanc and passed in front of the bench on which marius had seated himself once more marius darted a sullen and ferocious glance at her 
 the young girl gave way to that slight straightening up with a backward movement accompanied by a raising of the eyelids which signifies 
 well what is the matter 
 this was their first quarrel 
 marius had hardly made this scene at her with his eyes when some one crossed the walk 
 it was a veteran very much bent extremely wrinkled and pale in a uniform of the louis xv pattern bearing on his breast the little oval plaque of red cloth with the crossed swords the cross of and adorned in addition with a which had no arm within it with a silver chin and a wooden leg 
 marius thought he perceived that this man had an extremely well satisfied air it even struck him that the aged cynic as he hobbled along past him addressed to him a very fraternal and very merry wink as though some chance had created an understanding between them and as though they had shared some piece of good luck together what did that relic of mars mean by being so contented 
 what had passed between that wooden leg and the other 
 marius reached a paroxysm of he was there he said to himself perhaps he he felt a desire to exterminate the veteran 
 with the aid of time all points grow dull 
 marius wrath against ursule just and legitimate as it was passed off 
 he finally pardoned her but this cost him a great effort he sulked for three days 
 nevertheless in spite of all this and because of all this his passion augmented and grew to madness

 while this was taking place in petersburg the french had already passed smolensk and were drawing nearer and nearer to moscow historian thiers like other of his historians trying to justify his hero says that he was drawn to the walls of moscow against his will he is as right as other historians who look for the explanation of historic events in the will of one man he is as right as the russian historians who maintain that napoleon was drawn to moscow by the skill of the russian commanders here besides the law of retrospection which regards all the past as a preparation for events that subsequently occur the law of reciprocity comes in confusing the whole matter a good chessplayer having lost a game is sincerely convinced that his loss resulted from a mistake he made and looks for that mistake in the opening but forgets that at each stage of the game there were similar mistakes and that none of his moves were perfect he only notices the mistake to which he pays attention because his opponent took advantage of it how much more complex than this is the game of war which occurs under certain limits of time and where it is not one will that manipulates lifeless objects but everything results from innumerable conflicts of various wills 
 after smolensk napoleon sought a battle beyond dorogobuzh at vyazma and then at but it happened that owing to a conjunction of innumerable circumstances the russians could not give battle till they reached borodino seventy miles from moscow from vyazma napoleon ordered a direct advance on moscow 
 moscou la capitale asiatique de ce grand empire la ville sacree des peuples moscou avec ses innombrables eglises en forme de pagodes chinoises this moscow gave imagination no rest on the march from vyazma to he rode his light bay bobtailed ambler accompanied by his guards his bodyguard his pages and berthier his chief of staff dropped behind to question a russian prisoner captured by the cavalry followed by lelorgne an interpreter he overtook napoleon at a gallop and reined in his horse with an amused expression 
 moscow the asiatic capital of this great empire the sacred city of people moscow with its innumerable churches shaped like chinese pagodas 
 well asked napoleon 
 one of cossacks says that corps is joining up with the main army and that kutuzov has been appointed commander in chief he is a very shrewd and garrulous fellow 
 napoleon smiled and told them to give the cossack a horse and bring the man to him he wished to talk to him himself several adjutants galloped off and an hour later lavrushka the serf denisov had handed over to rostov rode up to napoleon in an jacket and on a french cavalry saddle with a merry and tipsy face napoleon told him to ride by his side and began questioning him 
 you are a cossack 
 yes a cossack your honor 
 the cossack not knowing in what company he was for plain appearance had nothing about it that would reveal to an oriental mind the presence of a monarch talked with extreme familiarity of the incidents of the war says thiers narrating this episode in reality lavrushka having got drunk the day before and left his master dinnerless had been whipped and sent to the village in quest of chickens where he engaged in looting till the french took him prisoner lavrushka was one of those coarse lackeys who have seen all sorts of things consider it necessary to do everything in a mean and cunning way are ready to render any sort of service to their master and are keen at guessing their baser impulses especially those prompted by vanity and pettiness 
 finding himself in the company of napoleon whose identity he had easily and surely recognized lavrushka was not in the least abashed but merely did his utmost to gain his new favor 
 he knew very well that this was napoleon but presence could no more intimidate him than or a sergeant with the rods would have done for he had nothing that either the sergeant major or napoleon could deprive him of 
 so he rattled on telling all the gossip he had heard among the orderlies much of it true but when napoleon asked him whether the russians thought they would beat bonaparte or not lavrushka screwed up his eyes and considered 
 in this question he saw subtle cunning as men of his type see cunning in everything so he frowned and did not answer immediately 
 like this he said thoughtfully if a battle soon yours will win right but if three days pass then after that well then that same battle will not soon be over 
 lelorgne smilingly interpreted this speech to napoleon thus if a battle takes place within the next three days the french will win but if later god knows what will happen napoleon did not smile though he was evidently in high good humor and he ordered these words to be repeated 
 lavrushka noticed this and to entertain him further pretending not to know who napoleon was added 
 we know that you have bonaparte and that he has beaten everybody in the world but we are a different matter without knowing why or how this bit of boastful patriotism slipped out at the end 
 the interpreter translated these words without the last phrase and bonaparte smiled the young cossack made his mighty interlocutor smile says thiers after riding a few paces in silence napoleon turned to berthier and said he wished to see how the news that he was talking to the emperor himself to that very emperor who had written his immortally victorious name on the pyramids would affect this enfant du don 
 child of the don 
 the fact was accordingly conveyed to lavrushka 
 lavrushka understanding that this was done to perplex him and that napoleon expected him to be frightened to gratify his new masters promptly pretended to be astonished and opened his eyes wide and assumed the expression he usually put on when taken to be whipped as soon as interpreter had spoken says thiers the cossack seized by amazement did not utter another word but rode on his eyes fixed on the conqueror whose fame had reached him across the steppes of the east all his loquacity was suddenly arrested and replaced by a naive and silent feeling of admiration napoleon after making the cossack a present had him set free like a bird restored to its native fields 
 napoleon rode on dreaming of the moscow that so appealed to his imagination and the bird restored to its native fields galloped to our outposts inventing on the way all that had not taken place but that he meant to relate to his comrades what had really taken place he did not wish to relate because it seemed to him not worth telling he found the cossacks inquired for the regiment operating with detachment and by evening found his master nicholas rostov quartered at yankovo rostov was just mounting to go for a ride round the neighboring villages with ilyin he let lavrushka have another horse and took him along with him

 eclipse 
 the reader has just seen how marius discovered or thought that he discovered that she was named ursule 
 appetite grows with loving 
 to know that her name was ursule was a great deal it was very little 
 in three or four weeks marius had devoured this bliss 
 he wanted another 
 he wanted to know where she lived 
 he had committed his first blunder by falling into the ambush of the bench by the gladiator 
 he had committed a second by not remaining at the luxembourg when m leblanc came thither alone he now committed a third and an immense one 
 he followed ursule 
 she lived in the rue de in the most unfrequented spot in a new house of modest appearance 
 from that moment forth marius added to his happiness of seeing her at the luxembourg the happiness of following her home 
 his hunger was increasing 
 he knew her first name at least a charming name a genuine name he knew where she lived he wanted to know who she was 
 one evening after he had followed them to their dwelling and had seen them disappear through the carriage gate he entered in their train and said boldly to the porter 
 is that the gentleman who lives on the first floor who has just come in 
 no replied the porter 
 he is the gentleman on the third floor 
 another step gained 
 this success emboldened marius 
 on the front he asked 
 parbleu said the porter the house is only built on the street 
 and what is that business began marius again 
 he is a gentleman of property sir 
 a very kind man who does good to the unfortunate though not rich himself 
 what is his name resumed marius 
 the porter raised his head and said 
 are you a police spy sir 
 marius went off quite abashed but delighted 
 he was getting on 
 good thought he i know that her name is ursule that she is the daughter of a gentleman who lives on his income and that she lives there on the third floor in the rue de 
 on the following day m leblanc and his daughter made only a very brief stay in the luxembourg they went away while it was still broad daylight 
 marius followed them to the rue de as he had taken up the habit of doing 
 on arriving at the carriage entrance m leblanc made his daughter pass in first then paused before crossing the threshold and stared intently at marius 
 on the next day they did not come to the luxembourg 
 marius waited for them all day in vain 
 at nightfall he went to the rue de and saw a light in the windows of the third story 
 he walked about beneath the windows until the light was extinguished 
 the next day no one at the luxembourg 
 marius waited all day then went and did sentinel duty under their windows 
 this carried him on to ten in the evening 
 his dinner took care of itself 
 fever nourishes the sick man and love the lover 
 he spent a week in this manner 
 m leblanc no longer appeared at the luxembourg 
 marius indulged in melancholy conjectures he dared not watch the porte cochere during the day he contented himself with going at night to gaze upon the red light of the windows 
 at times he saw shadows flit across them and his heart began to beat 
 on the eighth day when he arrived under the windows there was no light in them 
 hello he said the lamp is not lighted yet 
 but it is dark can they have gone out 
 he waited until ten until midnight until one in the morning 
 not a light appeared in the windows of the third story and no one entered the house 
 he went away in a very gloomy frame of mind 
 on the he only existed from morrow to morrow there was so to speak no for the morrow he found no one at the luxembourg he had expected this 
 at dusk he went to the house 
 no light in the windows the shades were drawn the third floor was totally dark 
 marius rapped at the porte cochere entered and said to the porter 
 the gentleman on the third floor 
 has moved away replied the porter 
 marius reeled and said feebly 
 how long ago 
 yesterday 
 where is he living now 
 i know anything about it 
 so he has not left his new address 
 no 
 and the porter raising his eyes recognized marius 
 come 
 so you said he but you are decidedly a spy then

 chapter viii 
 
 princess mary was not in moscow and out of danger as prince andrew supposed 
 after the return of alpatych from smolensk the old prince suddenly seemed to awake as from a dream he ordered the militiamen to be called up from the villages and armed and wrote a letter to the commander in chief informing him that he had resolved to remain at bald hills to the last extremity and to defend it leaving to the commander in discretion to take measures or not for the defense of bald hills where one of oldest generals would be captured or killed and he announced to his household that he would remain at bald hills 
 but while himself remaining he gave instructions for the departure of the princess and dessalles with the little prince to bogucharovo and thence to moscow princess mary alarmed by her feverish and sleepless activity after his previous apathy could not bring herself to leave him alone and for the first time in her life ventured to disobey him she refused to go away and her fury broke over her in a terrible storm he repeated every injustice he had ever inflicted on her trying to convict her he told her she had worn him out had caused his quarrel with his son had harbored nasty suspicions of him making it the object of her life to poison his existence and he drove her from his study telling her that if she did not go away it was all the same to him he declared that he did not wish to remember her existence and warned her not to dare to let him see her the fact that he did not as she had feared order her to be carried away by force but only told her not to let him see her cheered princess mary she knew it was a proof that in the depth of his soul he was glad she was remaining at home and had not gone away 
 the morning after little nicholas had left the old prince donned his full uniform and prepared to visit the commander in chief his caleche was already at the door princess mary saw him walk out of the house in his uniform wearing all his orders and go down the garden to review his armed peasants and domestic serfs she sat by the window listening to his voice which reached her from the garden suddenly several men came running up the avenue with frightened faces 
 princess mary ran out to the porch down the path and into the avenue a large crowd of militiamen and domestics were moving toward her and in their midst several men were supporting by the armpits and dragging along a little old man in a uniform and decorations she ran up to him and in the play of the sunlight that fell in small round spots through the shade of the avenue could not be sure what change there was in his face all she could see was that his former stern and determined expression had altered to one of timidity and submission on seeing his daughter he moved his helpless lips and made a hoarse sound it was impossible to make out what he wanted he was lifted up carried to his study and laid on the very couch he had so feared of late 
 the doctor who was fetched that same night bled him and said that the prince had had seizure a paralyzing his right side 
 it was becoming more and more dangerous to remain at bald hills and next day they moved the prince to bogucharovo the doctor accompanying him 
 by the time they reached bogucharovo dessalles and the little prince had already left for moscow 
 for three weeks the old prince lay stricken by paralysis in the new house prince andrew had built at bogucharovo ever in the same state getting neither better nor worse he was unconscious and lay like a distorted corpse he muttered unceasingly his eyebrows and lips twitching and it was impossible to tell whether he understood what was going on around him or not one thing was certain that he was suffering and wished to say something but what it was no one could tell it might be some caprice of a sick and man or it might relate to public affairs or possibly to family concerns 
 the doctor said this restlessness did not mean anything and was due to physical causes but princess mary thought he wished to tell her something and the fact that her presence always increased his restlessness confirmed her opinion 
 he was evidently suffering both physically and mentally there was no hope of recovery it was impossible for him to travel it would not do to let him die on the road would it not be better if the end did come the very end princess mary sometimes thought night and day hardly sleeping at all she watched him and terrible to say often watched him not with hope of finding signs of improvement but wishing to find symptoms of the approach of the end 
 strange as it was to her to acknowledge this feeling in herself yet there it was and what seemed still more terrible to her was that since her illness began perhaps even sooner when she stayed with him expecting something to happen all the personal desires and hopes that had been forgotten or sleeping within her had awakened thoughts that had not entered her mind for years thoughts of a life free from the fear of her father and even the possibility of love and of family happiness floated continually in her imagination like temptations of the devil thrust them aside as she would questions continually recurred to her as to how she would order her life now after that these were temptations of the devil and princess mary knew it she knew that the sole weapon against him was prayer and she tried to pray she assumed an attitude of prayer looked at the icons repeated the words of a prayer but she could not pray she felt that a different world had now taken possession of her the life of a world of strenuous and free activity quite opposed to the spiritual world in which till now she had been confined and in which her greatest comfort had been prayer she could not pray could not weep and worldly cares took possession of her 
 it was becoming dangerous to remain in bogucharovo news of the approach of the french came from all sides and in one village ten miles from bogucharovo a homestead had been looted by french marauders 
 the doctor insisted on the necessity of moving the prince the provincial marshal of the nobility sent an official to princess mary to persuade her to get away as quickly as possible and the head of the rural police having come to bogucharovo urged the same thing saying that the french were only some miles away that french proclamations were circulating in the villages and that if the princess did not take her father away before the fifteenth he could not answer for the consequences 
 the princess decided to leave on the fifteenth the cares of preparation and giving orders for which everyone came to her occupied her all day she spent the night of the fourteenth as usual without undressing in the room next to the one where the prince lay several times waking up she heard his groans and muttering the creak of his bed and the steps of tikhon and the doctor when they turned him over several times she listened at the door and it seemed to her that his mutterings were louder than usual and that they turned him over oftener she could not sleep and several times went to the door and listened wishing to enter but not deciding to do so though he did not speak princess mary saw and knew how unpleasant every sign of anxiety on his account was to him she had noticed with what dissatisfaction he turned from the look she sometimes involuntarily fixed on him she knew that her going in during the night at an unusual hour would irritate him 
 but never had she felt so grieved for him or so much afraid of losing him she recalled all her life with him and in every word and act of his found an expression of his love of her occasionally amid these memories temptations of the devil would surge into her imagination thoughts of how things would be after his death and how her new liberated life would be ordered but she drove these thoughts away with disgust toward morning he became quiet and she fell asleep 
 she woke late that sincerity which often comes with waking showed her clearly what chiefly concerned her about her illness on waking she listened to what was going on behind the door and hearing him groan said to herself with a sigh that things were still the same 
 but what could have happened what did i want i want his death she cried with a feeling of loathing for herself 
 she washed dressed said her prayers and went out to the porch in front of it stood carriages without horses and things were being packed into the vehicles 
 it was a warm gray morning princess mary stopped at the porch still horrified by her spiritual baseness and trying to arrange her thoughts before going to her father the doctor came downstairs and went out to her 
 he is a little better today said he i was looking for you one can make out something of what he is saying his head is clearer come in he is asking for you 
 princess heart beat so violently at this news that she grew pale and leaned against the wall to keep from falling to see him talk to him feel his eyes on her now that her whole soul was overflowing with those dreadful wicked temptations was a torment of joy and terror 
 come said the doctor 
 princess mary entered her room and went up to his bed he was lying on his back propped up high and his small bony hands with their knotted purple veins were lying on the quilt his left eye gazed straight before him his right eye was awry and his brows and lips motionless he seemed altogether so thin small and pathetic his face seemed to have shriveled or melted his features had grown smaller princess mary went up and kissed his hand his left hand pressed hers so that she understood that he had long been waiting for her to come he twitched her hand and his brows and lips quivered angrily 
 she looked at him in dismay trying to guess what he wanted of her when she changed her position so that his left eye could see her face he calmed down not taking his eyes off her for some seconds then his lips and tongue moved sounds came and he began to speak gazing timidly and imploringly at her evidently afraid that she might not understand 
 straining all her faculties princess mary looked at him the comic efforts with which he moved his tongue made her drop her eyes and with difficulty repress the sobs that rose to her throat he said something repeating the same words several times she could not understand them but tried to guess what he was saying and inquiringly repeated the words he uttered 
 he repeated several times 
 it was quite impossible to understand these sounds the doctor thought he had guessed them and inquiringly repeated mary are you afraid the prince shook his head again repeated the same sounds 
 my mind my mind aches questioned princess mary 
 he made a mumbling sound in confirmation of this took her hand and began pressing it to different parts of his breast as if trying to find the right place for it 
 always thoughts about you thoughts he then uttered much more clearly than he had done before now that he was sure of being understood 
 princess mary pressed her head against his hand trying to hide her sobs and tears 
 he moved his hand over her hair 
 i have been calling you all night he brought out 
 if only i had known she said through her tears i was afraid to come in 
 he pressed her hand 
 you asleep 
 no i did not sleep said princess mary shaking her head 
 unconsciously imitating her father she now tried to express herself as he did as much as possible by signs and her tongue too seemed to move with difficulty 
 dear one dearest princess mary could not quite make out what he had said but from his look it was clear that he had uttered a tender caressing word such as he had never used to her before why you come in 
 and i was wishing for his death thought princess mary 
 he was silent awhile 
 thank you daughter dear for all for all forgive thank you forgive thank you and tears began to flow from his eyes call andrew he said suddenly and a childish timid expression of doubt showed itself on his face as he spoke 
 he himself seemed aware that his demand was meaningless so at least it seemed to princess mary 
 i have a letter from him she replied 
 he glanced at her with timid surprise 
 where is he 
 with the army father at smolensk 
 he closed his eyes and remained silent a long time then as if in answer to his doubts and to confirm the fact that now he understood and remembered everything he nodded his head and reopened his eyes 
 yes he said softly and distinctly russia has perished destroyed her 
 and he began to sob and again tears flowed from his eyes princess mary could no longer restrain herself and wept while she gazed at his face 
 again he closed his eyes his sobs ceased he pointed to his eyes and tikhon understanding him wiped away the tears 
 then he again opened his eyes and said something none of them could understand for a long time till at last tikhon understood and repeated it princess mary had sought the meaning of his words in the mood in which he had just been speaking she thought he was speaking of russia or prince andrew of herself of his grandson or of his own death and so she could not guess his words 
 put on your white dress i like it was what he said 
 having understood this princess mary sobbed still louder and the doctor taking her arm led her out to the veranda soothing her and trying to persuade her to prepare for her journey when she had left the room the prince again began speaking about his son about the war and about the emperor angrily twitching his brows and raising his hoarse voice and then he had a second and final stroke 
 princess mary stayed on the veranda the day had cleared it was hot and sunny she could understand nothing think of nothing and feel nothing except passionate love for her father love such as she thought she had never felt till that moment she ran out sobbing into the garden and as far as the pond along the avenues of young lime trees prince andrew had planted 
 yes i i i wished for his death yes i wanted it to end quicker i wished to be at peace and what will become of me what use will peace be when he is no longer here princess mary murmured pacing the garden with hurried steps and pressing her hands to her bosom which heaved with convulsive sobs 
 when she had completed the tour of the garden which brought her again to the house she saw mademoiselle bourienne who had remained at bogucharovo and did not wish to leave it coming toward her with a stranger this was the marshal of the nobility of the district who had come personally to point out to the princess the necessity for her prompt departure princess mary listened without understanding him she led him to the house offered him lunch and sat down with him then excusing herself she went to the door of the old room the doctor came out with an agitated face and said she could not enter 
 go away princess go away go away 
 she returned to the garden and sat down on the grass at the foot of the slope by the pond where no one could see her she did not know how long she had been there when she was aroused by the sound of a footsteps running along the path she rose and saw dunyasha her maid who was evidently looking for her and who stopped suddenly as if in alarm on seeing her mistress 
 please come princess the prince said dunyasha in a breaking voice 
 immediately coming coming replied the princess hurriedly not giving dunyasha time to finish what she was saying and trying to avoid seeing the girl she ran toward the house 
 princess will you must be prepared for everything said the marshal meeting her at the house door 
 let me alone not true she cried angrily to him 
 the doctor tried to stop her she pushed him aside and ran to her door why are these people with frightened faces stopping me i want any of them and what are they doing here she thought she opened the door and the bright daylight in that previously darkened room startled her in the room were her nurse and other women they all drew back from the bed making way for her he was still lying on the bed as before but the stern expression of his quiet face made princess mary stop short on the threshold 
 no not dead impossible she told herself and approached him and repressing the terror that seized her she pressed her lips to his cheek but she stepped back immediately all the force of the tenderness she had been feeling for him vanished instantly and was replaced by a feeling of horror at what lay there before her no he is no more he is not but here where he was is something unfamiliar and hostile some dreadful terrifying and repellent mystery and hiding her face in her hands princess mary sank into the arms of the doctor who held her up 
 in the presence of tikhon and the doctor the women washed what had been the prince tied his head up with a handkerchief that the mouth should not stiffen while open and with another handkerchief tied together the legs that were already spreading apart then they dressed him in uniform with his decorations and placed his shriveled little body on a table heaven only knows who arranged all this and when but it all got done as if of its own accord toward night candles were burning round his coffin a pall was spread over it the floor was strewn with sprays of juniper a printed band was tucked in under his shriveled head and in a corner of the room sat a chanter reading the psalms 
 just as horses shy and snort and gather about a dead horse so the inmates of the house and strangers crowded into the drawing room round the coffin the marshal the village elder peasant women and all with fixed and frightened eyes crossing themselves bowed and kissed the old cold and stiffened hand

 mines and miners 
 human societies all have what is called in theatrical parlance a third lower floor 
 the social soil is everywhere undermined sometimes for good sometimes for evil 
 these works are superposed one upon the other 
 there are superior mines and inferior mines there is a top and a bottom in this obscure which sometimes gives way beneath civilization and which our indifference and heedlessness trample under foot 
 the encyclopedia in the last century was a mine that was almost open to the sky 
 the shades those sombre hatchers of primitive christianity only awaited an opportunity to bring about an explosion under the caesars and to inundate the human race with light 
 for in the sacred shadows there lies latent light volcanoes are full of a shadow that is capable of flashing forth every form begins by being night 
 the catacombs in which the first mass was said were not alone the cellar of rome they were the vaults of the world 
 beneath the social construction that complicated marvel of a structure there are excavations of all sorts 
 there is the religious mine the philosophical mine the economic mine the revolutionary mine such and such a with the idea such a pick with ciphers such another with wrath 
 people hail and answer each other from one catacomb to another 
 utopias travel about underground in the pipes there they branch out in every direction 
 they sometimes meet and fraternize there 
 lends his pick to diogenes who lends him his lantern 
 sometimes they enter into combat there calvin seizes socinius by the hair 
 but nothing arrests nor interrupts the tension of all these energies toward the goal and the vast simultaneous activity which goes and comes mounts descends and mounts again in these obscurities and which immense unknown swarming slowly transforms the top and the bottom and the inside and the outside 
 society hardly even suspects this digging which leaves its surface intact and changes its bowels 
 there are as many different subterranean stages as there are varying works as there are extractions 
 what emerges from these deep excavations the future 
 the deeper one goes the more mysterious are the toilers the work is good up to a degree which the social philosophies are able to recognize beyond that degree it is doubtful and mixed lower down it becomes terrible 
 at a certain depth the excavations are no longer penetrable by the spirit of civilization the limit breathable by man has been passed a beginning of monsters is possible

 mines and miners 
 human societies all have what is called in theatrical parlance a third lower floor 
 the social soil is everywhere undermined sometimes for good sometimes for evil 
 these works are superposed one upon the other 
 there are superior mines and inferior mines there is a top and a bottom in this obscure which sometimes gives way beneath civilization and which our indifference and heedlessness trample under foot 
 the encyclopedia in the last century was a mine that was almost open to the sky 
 the shades those sombre hatchers of primitive christianity only awaited an opportunity to bring about an explosion under the caesars and to inundate the human race with light 
 for in the sacred shadows there lies latent light volcanoes are full of a shadow that is capable of flashing forth every form begins by being night 
 the catacombs in which the first mass was said were not alone the cellar of rome they were the vaults of the world 
 beneath the social construction that complicated marvel of a structure there are excavations of all sorts 
 there is the religious mine the philosophical mine the economic mine the revolutionary mine such and such a with the idea such a pick with ciphers such another with wrath 
 people hail and answer each other from one catacomb to another 
 utopias travel about underground in the pipes there they branch out in every direction 
 they sometimes meet and fraternize there 
 lends his pick to diogenes who lends him his lantern 
 sometimes they enter into combat there calvin seizes socinius by the hair 
 but nothing arrests nor interrupts the tension of all these energies toward the goal and the vast simultaneous activity which goes and comes mounts descends and mounts again in these obscurities and which immense unknown swarming slowly transforms the top and the bottom and the inside and the outside 
 society hardly even suspects this digging which leaves its surface intact and changes its bowels 
 there are as many different subterranean stages as there are varying works as there are extractions 
 what emerges from these deep excavations the future 
 the deeper one goes the more mysterious are the toilers the work is good up to a degree which the social philosophies are able to recognize beyond that degree it is doubtful and mixed lower down it becomes terrible 
 at a certain depth the excavations are no longer penetrable by the spirit of civilization the limit breathable by man has been passed a beginning of monsters is possible 
 the descending scale is a strange one and each one of the rungs of this ladder corresponds to a stage where philosophy can find foothold and where one encounters one of these workmen sometimes divine sometimes misshapen 
 below john huss there is luther below luther there is descartes below descartes there is voltaire below voltaire there is condorcet below condorcet there is robespierre below robespierre there is marat below marat there is babeuf and so it goes on

 book ten 
 chapter ix 
 
 until prince andrew settled in bogucharovo its owners had always been absentees and its peasants were of quite a different character from those of bald hills they differed from them in speech dress and disposition they were called steppe peasants the old prince used to approve of them for their endurance at work when they came to bald hills to help with the harvest or to dig ponds and ditches but he disliked them for their boorishness 
 prince last stay at bogucharovo when he introduced hospitals and schools and reduced the quitrent the peasants had to pay had not softened their disposition but had on the contrary strengthened in them the traits of character the old prince called boorishness various obscure rumors were always current among them at one time a rumor that they would all be enrolled as cossacks at another of a new religion to which they were all to be converted then of some proclamation of the and of an oath to the tsar paul in in connection with which it was rumored that freedom had been granted them but the landowners had stopped it then of peter return to the throne in seven years time when everything would be made free and so simple that there would be no restrictions rumors of the war with bonaparte and his invasion were connected in their minds with the same sort of vague notions of antichrist the end of the world and pure freedom 
 in the vicinity of bogucharovo were large villages belonging to the crown or to owners whose serfs paid quitrent and could work where they pleased there were very few resident landlords in the neighborhood and also very few domestic or literate serfs and in the lives of the peasantry of those parts the mysterious undercurrents in the life of the russian people the causes and meaning of which are so baffling to contemporaries were more clearly and strongly noticeable than among others one instance which had occurred some twenty years before was a movement among the peasants to emigrate to some unknown warm rivers hundreds of peasants among them the bogucharovo folk suddenly began selling their cattle and moving in whole families toward the southeast as birds migrate to somewhere beyond the sea so these men with their wives and children streamed to the southeast to parts where none of them had ever been they set off in caravans bought their freedom one by one or ran away and drove or walked toward the warm rivers many of them were punished some sent to siberia many died of cold and hunger on the road many returned of their own accord and the movement died down of itself just as it had sprung up without apparent reason but such undercurrents still existed among the people and gathered new forces ready to manifest themselves just as strangely unexpectedly and at the same time simply naturally and forcibly now in to anyone living in close touch with these people it was apparent that these undercurrents were acting strongly and nearing an eruption 
 alpatych who had reached bogucharovo shortly before the old death noticed an agitation among the peasants and that contrary to what was happening in the bald hills district where over a radius of forty miles all the peasants were moving away and leaving their villages to be devastated by the cossacks the peasants in the steppe region round bogucharovo were it was rumored in touch with the french received leaflets from them that passed from hand to hand and did not migrate he learned from domestic serfs loyal to him that the peasant karp who possessed great influence in the village commune and had recently been away driving a government transport had returned with news that the cossacks were destroying deserted villages but that the french did not harm them alpatych also knew that on the previous day another peasant had even brought from the village of visloukhovo which was occupied by the french a proclamation by a french general that no harm would be done to the inhabitants and if they remained they would be paid for anything taken from them as proof of this the peasant had brought from visloukhovo a hundred rubles in notes he did not know that they were false paid to him in advance for hay 
 more important still alpatych learned that on the morning of the very day he gave the village elder orders to collect carts to move the princess luggage from bogucharovo there had been a village meeting at which it had been decided not to move but to wait yet there was no time to waste on the fifteenth the day of the old death the marshal had insisted on princess leaving at once as it was becoming dangerous he had told her that after the sixteenth he could not be responsible for what might happen on the evening of the day the old prince died the marshal went away promising to return next day for the funeral but this he was unable to do for he received tidings that the french had unexpectedly advanced and had barely time to remove his own family and valuables from his estate 
 for some thirty years bogucharovo had been managed by the village elder dron whom the old prince called by the diminutive dronushka 
 dron was one of those physically and mentally vigorous peasants who grow big beards as soon as they are of age and go on unchanged till they are sixty or seventy without a gray hair or the loss of a tooth as straight and strong at sixty as at thirty 
 soon after the migration to the warm rivers in which he had taken part like the rest dron was made village elder and overseer of bogucharovo and had since filled that post irreproachably for years the peasants feared him more than they did their master the masters both the old prince and the young and the steward respected him and jestingly called him the minister during the whole time of his service dron had never been drunk or ill never after sleepless nights or the hardest tasks had he shown the least fatigue and though he could not read he had never forgotten a single money account or the number of quarters of flour in any of the endless cartloads he sold for the prince nor a single shock of the whole corn crop on any single acre of the bogucharovo fields 
 alpatych arriving from the devastated bald hills estate sent for his dron on the day of the funeral and told him to have twelve horses got ready for the princess carriages and eighteen carts for the things to be removed from bogucharovo though the peasants paid quitrent alpatych thought no difficulty would be made about complying with this order for there were two hundred and thirty households at work in bogucharovo and the peasants were well to do but on hearing the order dron lowered his eyes and remained silent alpatych named certain peasants he knew from whom he told him to take the carts 
 dron replied that the horses of these peasants were away carting alpatych named others but they too according to dron had no horses available some horses were carting for the government others were too weak and others had died for want of fodder it seemed that no horses could be had even for the carriages much less for the carting 
 alpatych looked intently at dron and frowned just as dron was a model village elder so alpatych had not managed the estates for twenty years in vain he a model steward possessing in the highest degree the faculty of divining the needs and instincts of those he dealt with having glanced at dron he at once understood that his answers did not express his personal views but the general mood of the bogucharovo commune by which the elder had already been carried away but he also knew that dron who had acquired property and was hated by the commune must be hesitating between the two camps the masters and the serfs he noticed this hesitation in look and therefore frowned and moved closer up to him 
 now just listen dronushka said he talk nonsense to me his excellency prince andrew himself gave me orders to move all the people away and not leave them with the enemy and there is an order from the tsar about it too anyone who stays is a traitor to the tsar do you hear 
 i hear dron answered without lifting his eyes 
 alpatych was not satisfied with this reply 
 eh dron it will turn out badly he said shaking his head 
 the power is in your hands dron rejoined sadly 
 eh dron drop it alpatych repeated withdrawing his hand from his bosom and solemnly pointing to the floor at feet i can see through you and three yards into the ground under you he continued gazing at the floor in front of dron 
 dron was disconcerted glanced furtively at alpatych and again lowered his eyes 
 you drop this nonsense and tell the people to get ready to leave their homes and go to moscow and to get carts ready for tomorrow morning for the princess things and go to any meeting yourself do you hear 
 dron suddenly fell on his knees 
 yakov alpatych discharge me take the keys from me and discharge me for sake 
 stop that cried alpatych sternly i see through you and three yards under you he repeated knowing that his skill in beekeeping his knowledge of the right time to sow the oats and the fact that he had been able to retain the old favor for twenty years had long since gained him the reputation of being a wizard and that the power of seeing three yards under a man is considered an attribute of wizards 
 dron got up and was about to say something but alpatych interrupted him 
 what is it you have got into your heads eh what are you thinking of eh 
 what am i to do with the people said dron quite beside themselves i have already told them 
 told them i dare say said alpatych are they drinking he asked abruptly 
 quite beside themselves yakov alpatych fetched another barrel 
 well then listen go to the police officer and you tell them so and that they must stop this and the carts must be got ready 
 i understand 
 alpatych did not insist further he had managed people for a long time and knew that the chief way to make them obey is to show no suspicion that they can possibly disobey having wrung a submissive i understand from dron alpatych contented himself with that though he not only doubted but felt almost certain that without the help of troops the carts would not be forthcoming 
 and so it was for when evening came no carts had been provided in the village outside the drink shop another meeting was being held which decided that the horses should be driven out into the woods and the carts should not be provided without saying anything of this to the princess alpatych had his own belongings taken out of the carts which had arrived from bald hills and had those horses got ready for the princess carriages meanwhile he went himself to the police authorities

 of empire 
 it is a miserable state of mind to have few things to desire and many things to 
 fear and yet that commonly is the case of kings who being at the highest want matter of desire which makes their minds more languishing and have many representations of perils and shadows which makes their minds the less clear 
 and this is one reason also of that effect which the scripture speaketh of that the heart is inscrutable for multitude of jealousies and lack of some predominant desire that should marshal and put in order all the rest maketh any heart hard to find or sound hence it comes likewise that princes many times make themselves desires and set their hearts upon toys sometimes upon a building sometimes upon erecting of an order sometimes upon the advancing of a person sometimes upon obtaining excellency in some art or feat of the hand as nero for playing on the harp domitian for certainty of the hand with the arrow commodus for playing at fence caracalla for driving chariots and the like this seemeth incredible unto those that know not the principle that the mind of man is more cheered and refreshed by profiting in small things than by standing at a stay in great we see also that kings that have been fortunate conquerors in their first years it being not possible for them to go forward infinitely but that they must have some check or arrest in their fortunes turn in their latter years to be superstitious and melancholy as did alexander the great 
 dioclesian and in our memory charles the fifth and others for he that is used 
 to go forward and findeth a stop falleth out of his own favour and is not the thing he was 
 
 to speak now of the true temper of empire it is a thing rare and hard to keep for both temper and distemper consist of contraries but it is one thing to mingle 
 contraries another to interchange them the answer of apollonius to vespasian is full of excellent instruction 
 vespasian asked him what was overthrow he answered 
 nero could touch and tune the harp well but in government sometimes he used to wind the pins too high sometimes to let them down too low and certain it is that nothing destroyeth authority so much as the unequal and untimely interchange of power pressed too far and relaxed too much 
 
 this is true that the wisdom of all these latter times in princes affairs is rather 
 fine deliveries and shiftings of dangers and mischiefs when they are near than 
 solid and grounded courses to keep them aloof but this is but to try masteries with fortune and let men beware how they neglect and suffer matter of trouble to be prepared for no man can forbid the spark nor tell whence it may come 
 the difficulties in princes business are many and great but the greatest difficulty is often in their own mind for it is common with princes saith tacitus to will contradictories sunt voluntates vehementes et inter se contrariae for it is the solecism of power to think to command the end and yet not to endure the mean 
 
 kings have to deal with their neighbours their wives their children their prelates 
 or clergy their nobles their or gentlemen their merchants their 
 commons and their men of war and from all these arise dangers if care and 
 circumspection be not used 
 
 first for their neighbours there can no general rule be given the occasions are 
 so variable save one which ever holdeth which is that princes do keep due sentinel that none of their neighbours do overgrow so by increase of territory by embracing of trade by approaches or the like as they become more able to annoy them than they were and this is generally the work of standing councils to foresee and to hinder it during that triumvirate of kings king henry vffl of england francis i king of france and charles v emperor there was such a watch kept that none of the three could win a palm of ground but the other two would straightways balance it either by confederation or if need were by a war and would not in any wise take up peace at interest and the like was done by that league which guicciardine saith was the security of italy made between ferdinando king of naples lorenzius medices and ludovicus sforza potentates the one of florence the other of milan 
 
 neither is the opinion of some of the schoolmen to be received that a war cannot justly be made but upon a precedent injury or provocation for there is no question but a just fear of an imminent danger though there be no blow given is a lawful cause of a war 
 
 for their wives there are cruel examples of them livia is enfamed for the poisoning of her husband roxolana wife was the destruction of that renowned prince 
 
 sultan mustapha and otherwise troubled his house and succession edward the second of england his queen had the principal hand in the deposing and murder of her husband 
 
 this kind of danger is then to be feared chiefly when the wives have plots for the raising of their own children or else that they be adulteresses 
 
 for their children the tragedies likewise of dangers from them have been many 
 
 and generally the entering of fathers into suspicion of their children hath been 
 ever unfortunate the destruction of mustapha that we named before was so fatal to line as the succession of the turks from solyman until this day is suspected to be untrue and of strange blood for mat selymus the 
 second was thought to be supposititious the destruction of crispus a young prince of rare towardness by constantinus the great his father was in like manner fatal to his house for both constantinus and constance his sons died violent deaths and constantius his other son did little better who died indeed of sickness but after that julianus had taken arms against him the destruction of demetrius son to philip the second of macedonia turned upon the father who died of repentance and many like examples there are but few or none where the fathers had good by such distrust except it were where me sons were up in open arms against them as was selymus the first against baiazet and the three sons of henry the second king of england 
 
 for their prelates when they are proud and great there is also danger from them 
 as it was in the times of anselmus and thomas becket archbishops of canterbury who with their croziers did almost try it with the sword and yet they had to deal with stout and haughty kings william rufus henry the 
 first and henry the second the danger is not from that state but where it hath a dependence of foreign authority or where the churchmen come in and are elected not by the collation of the king or particular patrons but by the people 
 
 for their nobles to keep them at a distance it is not amiss but to depress them 
 may make a king more absolute but less safe and less able to perform anything that he desires i have noted it in my history of king henry the seventh of england who depressed his nobility whereupon it came to pass that his times were full of difficulties and troubles for the nobility though they continued loyal unto him yet did they not cooperate with him in his business so that in effect he was fain to do all things himself 
 
 for their second nobles there is not much danger from them being a body dispersed they may sometimes discourse high but that doth little hurt besides they are a counterpoise to the higher nobility that they grow not too potent and lastly being the most immediate in authority with the common people they do best temper popular commotions 
 
 for their merchants they are venaporta and if they flourish not a kingdom may have good limbs but will have empty veins and nourish lime taxes and imposts upon them do seldom good to the revenue for that that he wins in the hundred he loseth in the shire the particular rates being increased but the total bulk of trading rather decreased 
 
 for their commons there is little danger from them except it be where they have great and potent heads or where you meddle with the point of religion or their customs or means of life 
 
 for their men of war it is a dangerous state where they live and remain in a body and are used to donatives whereof we see examples in the janissaries and pretorian bands of rome but trainings of men and arming them in several places and under several commanders and without donatives are things of defence and no danger 
 
 princes are like to heavenly bodies which cause good or evil times 
 and which have much veneration but no rest all precepts concerming kings are in effect comprehended in those two remembrances memento quod es homo and memento quod es deus or vice da the one bridleth their power and the other their will

 book fall 
 chapter iv 
 
 details concerning the of pontarlier 
 now in order to convey an idea of what passed at that table we cannot do better than to transcribe here a passage from one of mademoiselle letters to madame boischevron wherein the conversation between the convict and the bishop is described with ingenious minuteness 
 this man paid no attention to any one 
 he ate with the voracity of a starving man 
 however after supper he said 
 monsieur le cure of the good god all this is far too good for me but i must say that the carters who would not allow me to eat with them keep a better table than you do 
 between ourselves the remark rather shocked me 
 my brother replied 
 they are more fatigued than i 
 no returned the man they have more money 
 you are poor i see that plainly 
 you cannot be even a curate 
 are you really a cure 
 ah if the good god were but just you certainly ought to be a cure 
 the good god is more than just said my brother 
 a moment later he added 
 monsieur jean valjean is it to pontarlier that you are going 
 with my road marked out for me 
 i think that is what the man said 
 then he went on 
 i must be on my way by daybreak travelling is hard if the nights are cold the days are hot 
 you are going to a good country said my brother 
 during the revolution my family was ruined 
 i took refuge in at first and there i lived for some time by the toil of my hands my will was good 
 i found plenty to occupy me 
 one has only to choose there are paper mills tanneries distilleries oil factories watch factories on a large scale steel mills copper works twenty iron foundries at least four of which situated at lods at chatillon at audincourt and at beure are tolerably large 
 i think i am not mistaken in saying that those are the names which my brother mentioned 
 then he interrupted himself and addressed me 
 have we not some relatives in those parts my dear sister 
 i replied 
 we did have some among others m de lucenet who was captain of the gates at pontarlier under the old regime 
 yes resumed my brother but in one had no longer any relatives one had only arms 
 i worked 
 they have in the country of pontarlier whither you are going monsieur valjean a truly patriarchal and truly charming industry my sister it is their which they call fruitieres 
 then my brother while urging the man to eat explained to him with great minuteness what these fruitieres of pontarlier were that they were divided into two classes 
 the big barns which belong to the rich and where there are forty or fifty cows which produce from seven to eight thousand cheeses each summer and the associated fruitieres which belong to the poor these are the peasants of who hold their cows in common and share the proceeds they engage the services of a whom they call the grurin the grurin receives the milk of the associates three times a day and marks the quantity on a double tally 
 it is towards the end of april that the work of the begins it is towards the middle of june that the drive their cows to the mountains 
 the man recovered his animation as he ate 
 my brother made him drink that good mauves wine which he does not drink himself because he says that wine is expensive 
 my brother imparted all these details with that easy gayety of his with which you are acquainted interspersing his words with graceful attentions to me 
 he recurred frequently to that comfortable trade of grurin as though he wished the man to understand without advising him directly and harshly that this would afford him a refuge 
 one thing struck me this man was what i have told you 
 well neither during supper nor during the entire evening did my brother utter a single word with the exception of a few words about jesus when he entered which could remind the man of what he was nor of what my brother was to all appearances it was an occasion for preaching him a little sermon and of impressing the bishop on the convict so that a mark of the passage might remain behind 
 this might have appeared to any one else who had this unfortunate man in his hands to afford a chance to nourish his soul as well as his body and to bestow upon him some reproach seasoned with moralizing and advice or a little commiseration with an exhortation to conduct himself better in the future my brother did not even ask him from what country he came nor what was his history 
 for in his history there is a fault and my brother seemed to avoid everything which could remind him of it 
 to such a point did he carry it that at one time when my brother was speaking of the mountaineers of pontarlier who exercise a gentle labor near heaven and who he added are happy because they are innocent he stopped short fearing lest in this remark there might have escaped him something which might wound the man by dint of reflection i think i have comprehended what was passing in my heart 
 he was thinking no doubt that this man whose name is jean valjean had his misfortune only too vividly present in his mind that the best thing was to divert him from it and to make him believe if only momentarily that he was a person like any other by treating him just in his ordinary way 
 is not this indeed to understand charity well 
 is there not dear madame something truly evangelical in this delicacy which abstains from sermon from moralizing from allusions and is not the truest pity when a man has a sore point not to touch it at all 
 it has seemed to me that this might have been my private thought in any case what i can say is that if he entertained all these ideas he gave no sign of them from beginning to end even to me he was the same as he is every evening and he supped with this jean valjean with the same air and in the same manner in which he would have supped with m gedeon le provost or with the curate of the parish 
 towards the end when he had reached the figs there came a knock at the door 
 it was mother gerbaud with her little one in her arms my brother kissed the child on the brow and borrowed fifteen sous which i had about me to give to mother gerbaud 
 the man was not paying much heed to anything then 
 he was no longer talking and he seemed very much fatigued 
 after poor old gerbaud had taken her departure my brother said grace then he turned to the man and said to him you must be in great need of your bed 
 madame magloire cleared the table very promptly 
 i understood that we must retire in order to allow this traveller to go to sleep and we both went up stairs 
 nevertheless i sent madame magloire down a moment later to carry to the bed a goat skin from the black forest which was in my room 
 the nights are frigid and that keeps one warm it is a pity that this skin is old all the hair is falling out my brother bought it while he was in germany at tottlingen near the sources of the danube as well as the little knife which i use at table 
 madame magloire returned immediately 
 we said our prayers in the where we hang up the linen and then we each retired to our own chambers without saying a word to each other

 the empire strikes back

 no one on hoth heard the sound at first it was simply too distant to carry abovethe whining winds besides the rebel troopers fighting the cold as they preparedfor battle were too busy to really listen 
 in the snow trenches rebel officers screamed out their orders to makethemselves heard above the winds troopers hurried to carry out theircommands running through the snow with heavy bazookalike weapons on theirshoulders and lodging those death rays along the icy rims of the trenches 
 the rebel power generators near the gun towers began popping buzzing andcrackling with deafening bursts of electrical to supply the vastunderground complex but above all this activity and noise a strange sound could beheard an ominous thumping that was coming nearer and was beginning to shake thefrozen ground when it was close enough to attract the attention of an officer hestrained to see through the storm looking for the source of the heavy rhythmicpounding other men looked up from their work and saw what looked like a numberof moving specks through the blizzard the small dots seemed to be advancing at aslow yet steady pace churning up clouds of snow as they moved toward the rebelbase

 as luke soared up and away from the walker he looked back that armor istoo strong for blasters he thought there must be some other way of attacking thesehorrors something other than fire power for a moment luke thought of some ofthe simple tactics a farm boy might employ against a wild beast then turning hissnowspeeder for yet another run against the walkers he made a decision 
 rogue group he called into his comlink use your harpoons and tow for the legs our only hope of stopping them hobbie are you still withme 
 the reassuring voice immediately responded yes sir 
 well stick close now 
 as he leveled his ship luke was grimly determined to glide in tight formationwith hobbie together they veered dropping nearer surface 
 in cockpit his gunner dack was jostled by the abrupt movement of thecraft trying to keep his grip on the rebel harpoon gun in his hand he luke i seem to find my restraints 
 explosions rocked ship tossing it about violently in the enveloping the window he could see another walker that appeared to be unaffected bythe full fire power of the rebel attack speeders this lumbering machine nowbecame target as he flew moving in a descending arc the walker was firingdirectly at him creating a wall of laser bolts and flak 
 just hang on dack he yelled over the explosions and get ready to fire thattow cable 
 another great blast shook snowspeeder he fought to regain control asthe ship wobbled in its flight luke began to sweat profusely despite the cold as hedesperately attempted to right his plunging ship but the horizon still spun in frontof him 
 stand by dack almost there are you okay 
 dack answer luke managed to turn and saw that speeder wasmaintaining its course next to him as they evaded the explosions bursting around craned his head around and saw dack blood streaming from his forehead slumpedagainst the controls 
 dack 
 on the ground the gun towers near the rebel power generators blasted away atthe walking imperial machines but with no apparent effect imperial weaponsbombarded the area all around them blasting the snow skyward almost blinding theirhuman targets with the continuous onslaught the officer who had first seen theincredible machines and fought alongside his men was one of the first to be cut downby a rays troops rushed to his aid but save much of his blood had already spilled making a scarlet stain against the snow 
 more rebel fire power blasted from one of the dishlike guns that had beenerected near the power generators despite these tremendous explosions thewalkers continued to march another speeder made a heroic dive between a pair ofthe walkers only to be caught by fire from one of the machines that exploded it into agreat ball of rippling flames 
 the surface explosions made the walls of the ice hangar tremble causing deepcracks to spread 
 han solo and chewbacca were working frantically to complete their welding they worked it became obvious that the widening cracks would soon bring theentire ice ceiling smashing down upon them 
 first chance we get han said giving this crate a complete he knew that first he would have to get the millennium falcon out of this whitehell 
 even as he and the wookiee labored on the ship enormous pieces of ice brokenloose by the explosions came tumbling down throughout the underground leia moved quickly trying to avoid the falling frozen chunks as she soughtshelter in the rebel command center 
 not sure we can protect two transports at a time general rieekan told heras she entered the chamber 
 risky she answered but our holding action is faltering leia realizedthat the transport launchings were taking too much time and that the procedure had tobe hastened 
 rieekan issued a command through his comlink launch patrol proceed withaccelerated departures 
 as the general gave his order leia looked toward an aide and said beginclearing the remaining ground stuff but she knew that their escape dependedcompletely on rebel success in the battle above 
 inside the cold and cramped cockpit of the lead imperial walker general veersmoved between his pilots what is the distance to the powergenerators 
 without looking away from the control panel one of the pilots 
 satisfied general veers reached for an electrotelescope and peered through theviewfinder to focus on the power generators and the rebel soldiersfighting to save them suddenly the walker began to rock violently under a barrageof rebel gunfire as he was propelled backward veers saw his pilot scramblingover the controls to keep the machine from toppling over 
 the rogue three snowspeeder had just attacked the lead walker its hooted with a loud rebel shout of victory as he saw the damage his guns hadcaused 
 other snowspeeders passed wedge racing in the opposite direction he steeredhis craft on a direct course toward another walking death machine as heapproached the monster wedge shouted to his gunner activate harpoon 
 the gunner pressed the firing switch as his pilot daringly maneuvered their craftthrough the legs immediately the harpoon whooshed from the rear of thespeeder a long length of cable unwinding behind it 
 cable out the gunner yelled let her go 
 wedge saw the harpoon plunge into one of the metal legs the cable stillconnected to his snowspeeder he checked his controls then brought the speederaround in front of the imperial machine making an abrupt turn wedge guided hisship around one of the hind legs the cable banding around it like a metallic lariat 
 so far thought wedge plan was working now all he had to do was flyhis speeder around to the tail end of the walker wedge caught a glimpse of rogueleader as he carried out the maneuver 
 cable out shouted the gunner again as wedge flew their craftalongside the walker close to the metal hull gunnerdepressed another switch and released the cable from the rear of the snowspeeder 
 the speeder zoomed away and wedge laughed as he looked down at the resultsof their efforts the walker was awkwardly struggling to continue on its way but therebel cable had completely entangled its legs finally it leaned to one side andcrashed against the ground its impact stirring up a cloud of ice and snow 
 rogue leaderone down luke wedge announced to the pilot of hiscompanion speeder 
 i see it wedge commander skywalker answered good work 
 in the trenches rebel troops cheered in triumph when they saw the assaultmachine topple an officer leaped from his snow trench and signaled his out of the trench he led his troopers in a boisterous charge against the fallenwalker reaching the great metallic hulk before a single imperial soldier could pullhimself free 
 the rebels were about to enter the walker when it suddenly exploded fromwithin hurtling great jagged chunks of torn metal at them the impact of the blastflinging the stunned troops back against the snow 
 luke and zev could see the destruction of the walker as they flew from right to left to avoid the flak bursting around them when they finallyleveled off their craft were shaken by explosions from the cannons 
 steady rogue two luke said looking over at the snowspeeder flying parallelto his own ship set harpoon cover for you 
 but there was another explosion this one damaging the front section of the pilot could barely see through the engulfing cloud of smoke that foggedhis windshield he fought to keep his ship on a horizontal path but more blasts bythe enemy made it rock violently 
 his view had become so obscured that it until zev was directly in the lineof fire that he saw the massive image of another imperial walker rogue pilotfelt an instant of pain then his craft spewing smoke and hurtling on acollision course with the walker suddenly erupted in flames amid a burst of cannonfire very little of zev or his ship remained to hit the ground 
 luke saw the disintegration and was sickened by the loss of yet another he let himself dwell on his grief especially now when so many otherlives depended on his steady leadership 
 he looked around desperately then spoke into his three set your harpoon and follow me on the nextpass 
 as he spoke luke was hit hard by a terrific explosion that ripped through hisspeeder he struggled with the controls in a futile attempt to keep the small craftunder control a chill of fear swept over him when he noticed the dense twistingfunnel of black smoke pouring from his aft section he realized then thatthere was no way his damaged speeder could remain aloft and to make matterseven worse a walker loomed directly in his path 
 luke struggled with the controls as his ship plunged toward the ground leaving atrail of smoke and flames behind by then the heat in the cockpit was nearlyunbearable flames were beginning to leap about inside the speeder and werecoming uncomfortably close to luke he finally brought his ship down to skid andcrash into the snow just a few meters away from one of the walking imperialmachines 
 after impact luke struggled to pull himself from the cockpit and looked withhorror at the looming figure of the approaching walker 
 gathering all his strength luke quickly squeezed himself from under the twistedmetal of the control board and moved up against the top of his cockpit somehow hemanaged to open the hatch halfway and climbed out of the ship with eachelephantine step of the oncoming walker the speeder shook violently luke had notrealized just how enormous these horrors were until unprotected by theshelter of his craft he saw one up close 
 then he remembered dack and returned to try to pull his lifeless formfrom the wrecked speeder but luke had to give up the body was too tightlywedged in the cockpit and the walker was now almost upon him braving theflames luke reached into his speeder and grabbed the harpoon gun 
 he gazed at the advancing mechanical behemoth and suddenly had an idea hereached back inside the cockpit of the speeder and groped for a land mine attached tothe interior with a great effort he stretched his fingers and firmly grasped themine 
 luke leaped away from his vehicle just as the towering machine lifted a massivefoot and planted it firmly on the snowspeeder crushing it flat 
 luke crouched underneath the walker moving with it to avoid its slow his head he felt the cold wind slap against his face as he studied vast underbelly 
 as he ran along under the machine luke aimed his harpoon gun and fired apowerful magnet attached to a long thin cable was ejected from the gun and firmlyattached itself to the underbelly 
 still running luke tanked on the cable testing to make sure its strength wassufficient to sustain his weight then he attached the cable drum to the buckle of hisutility belt allowing its mechanism to pull him up off the ground now danglingfrom the underbelly luke could see the remaining walkers and two rebelsnowspeeders continuing the battle as they soared through fiery explosions 
 he climbed up to the hull where he had observed a small cutting it open with his laser sword luke pulled open the hatch threw in theland mine and made a rapid descent along the cable as he reached the end lukedropped hard onto the snow and became unconscious his inert body was nearlybrushed by one of the hind fee 
 as the walker passed over and away from him a muffled explosion tore at itsinsides suddenly the tremendous bulk of the mechanical beast exploded at theseams machinery and pieces of hull flying in every direction the imperial assaultmachine crumbled into a smoking motionless heap coming to rest upon whatremained of its four stiltlike legs

 chapter xix 
 
 at the end of the table the talk grew more and more animated the colonel told them that the declaration of war had already appeared in petersburg and that a copy which he had himself seen had that day been forwarded by courier to the commander in chief 
 and why the deuce are we going to fight bonaparte remarked shinshin he has stopped cackle and i fear it will be our turn next 
 the colonel was a stout tall plethoric german evidently devoted to the service and patriotically russian he resented remark 
 it is for the reasson my goot sir said he speaking with a german accent for the reasson zat ze emperor knows zat he declares in ze manifessto zat he cannot fiew wiz indifference ze danger vreatening russia and zat ze safety and dignity of ze empire as vell as ze sanctity of its alliances he spoke this last word with particular emphasis as if in it lay the gist of the matter 
 then with the unerring official memory that characterized him he repeated from the opening words of the manifesto 
 and the wish which constitutes the sole and absolute aim to establish peace in europe on firm foundations has now decided him to despatch part of the army abroad and to create a new condition for the attainment of that purpose 
 zat my dear sir is vy he concluded drinking a tumbler of wine with dignity and looking to the count for approval 
 le proverbe jerome jerome do not roam but turn spindles at home said shinshin puckering his brows and smiling cela nous convient a merveille suvorov now he knew what he was about yet they beat him a plate couture and where are we to find suvorovs now je vous demande un peu said he continually changing from french to russian 
 do you know the proverb 
 that suits us down to the ground 
 hollow 
 i just ask you that 
 ve must vight to the last of our plood said the colonel thumping the table and ve must tie for our emperor and zen all vill pe vell and ve must discuss it as little as he dwelt particularly on the word possible as he ended again turning to the count zat is how ve old hussars look at it and an end of it and how do you a young man and a young hussar how do you judge of it he added addressing nicholas who when he heard that the war was being discussed had turned from his partner with eyes and ears intent on the colonel 
 i am quite of your opinion replied nicholas flaming up turning his plate round and moving his wineglasses about with as much decision and desperation as though he were at that moment facing some great danger i am convinced that we russians must die or conquer he concluded conscious as were others after the words were uttered that his remarks were too enthusiastic and emphatic for the occasion and were therefore awkward 
 what you said just now was splendid said his partner julie 
 sonya trembled all over and blushed to her ears and behind them and down to her neck and shoulders while nicholas was speaking 
 pierre listened to the speech and nodded approvingly 
 fine said he 
 the young a real hussar shouted the colonel again thumping the table 
 what are you making such a noise about over there marya deep voice suddenly inquired from the other end of the table what are you thumping the table for she demanded of the hussar and why are you exciting yourself do you think the french are here 
 i am speaking ze truce replied the hussar with a smile 
 all about the war the count shouted down the table you know my going marya dmitrievna my son is going 
 i have four sons in the army but still i fret it is all in hands you may die in your bed or god may spare you in a battle replied marya deep voice which easily carried the whole length of the table 
 true 
 once more the conversations concentrated the ladies at the one end and the at the other 
 you ask little brother was saying i know you ask 
 i will replied natasha 
 her face suddenly flushed with reckless and joyous resolution she half rose by a glance inviting pierre who sat opposite to listen to what was coming and turning to her mother 
 mamma rang out the clear contralto notes of her childish voice audible the whole length of the table 
 what is it asked the countess startled but seeing by her face that it was only mischief she shook a finger at her sternly with a threatening and forbidding movement of her head 
 the conversation was hushed 
 mamma what sweets are we going to have and voice sounded still more firm and resolute 
 the countess tried to frown but could not marya dmitrievna shook her fat finger 
 cossack she said threateningly 
 most of the guests uncertain how to regard this sally looked at the elders 
 you had better take care said the countess 
 mamma what sweets are we going to have natasha again cried boldly with saucy gaiety confident that her prank would be taken in good part 
 sonya and fat little petya doubled up with laughter 
 you see i have asked whispered natasha to her little brother and to pierre glancing at him again 
 ice pudding but you get any said marya dmitrievna 
 natasha saw there was nothing to be afraid of and so she braved even marya dmitrievna 
 marya dmitrievna what kind of ice pudding i like ice cream 
 carrot ices 
 no what kind marya dmitrievna what kind she almost screamed i want to know 
 marya dmitrievna and the countess burst out laughing and all the guests joined in everyone laughed not at marya answer but at the incredible boldness and smartness of this little girl who had dared to treat marya dmitrievna in this fashion 
 natasha only desisted when she had been told that there would be pineapple ice before the ices champagne was served round the band again struck up the count and countess kissed and the guests leaving their seats went up to congratulate the countess and reached across the table to clink glasses with the count with the children and with one another again the footmen rushed about chairs scraped and in the same order in which they had entered but with redder faces the guests returned to the drawing room and to the study

 chapter 
 
 a letter edged with black announced the day of my return isabella was dead and he wrote to bid me get mourning for his daughter and arrange a room and other accommodations for his youthful nephew catherine ran wild with joy at the idea of welcoming her father back and indulged most sanguine anticipations of the innumerable excellences of her real cousin the evening of their expected arrival came since early morning she had been busy ordering her own small affairs and now attired in her new black thing her death impressed her with no definite obliged me by constant worrying to walk with her down through the grounds to meet them 
 linton is just six months younger than i am she chattered as we strolled leisurely over the swells and hollows of mossy turf under shadow of the trees how delightful it will be to have him for a playfellow aunt isabella sent papa a beautiful lock of his hair it was lighter than flaxen and quite as fine i have it carefully preserved in a little glass box and often thought what pleasure it would be to see its owner oh i am papa dear dear papa come ellen let us run come run 
 she ran and returned and ran again many times before my sober footsteps reached the gate and then she seated herself on the grassy bank beside the path and tried to wait patiently but that was impossible she be still a minute 
 how long they are she exclaimed ah i see some dust on the road they are coming no when will they be here may we not go a little a mile ellen only just half a mile do say yes to that clump of birches at the turn 
 i refused staunchly at length her suspense was ended the travelling carriage rolled in sight miss cathy shrieked and stretched out her arms as soon as she caught her face looking from the window he descended nearly as eager as herself and a considerable interval elapsed ere they had a thought to spare for any but themselves while they exchanged caresses i took a peep in to see after linton he was asleep in a corner wrapped in a warm cloak as if it had been winter a pale delicate effeminate boy who might have been taken for my younger brother so strong was the resemblance but there was a sickly peevishness in his aspect that edgar linton never had the latter saw me looking and having shaken hands advised me to close the door and leave him undisturbed for the journey had fatigued him cathy would fain have taken one glance but her father told her to come on and they walked together up the park while i hastened before to prepare the servants 
 now darling said mr linton addressing his daughter as they halted at the bottom of the front steps your cousin is not so strong or so merry as you are and he has lost his mother remember a very short time since therefore expect him to play and run about with you directly and harass him much by talking let him be quiet this evening at least will you 
 yes yes papa answered catherine but i do want to see him and he once looked out 
 the carriage stopped and the sleeper being roused was lifted to the ground by his uncle 
 this is your cousin cathy linton he said putting their little hands together fond of you already and mind you grieve her by crying tonight try to be cheerful now the travelling is at an end and you have nothing to do but rest and amuse yourself as you please 
 let me go to bed then answered the boy shrinking from salute and he put his fingers to his eyes to remove incipient tears 
 come come a good child i whispered leading him in 
 make her weep how sorry she is for you 
 i do not know whether it were sorrow for him but his cousin put on as sad a countenance as himself and returned to her father all three entered and mounted to the library where tea was laid ready i proceeded to remove cap and mantle and placed him on a chair by the table but he was no sooner seated than he began to cry afresh my master inquired what was the matter 
 i sit on a chair sobbed the boy 
 go to the sofa then and ellen shall bring you some tea answered his uncle patiently 
 he had been greatly tried during the journey i felt convinced by his fretful ailing charge linton slowly trailed himself off and lay down cathy carried a footstool and her cup to his side at first she sat silent but that could not last she had resolved to make a pet of her little cousin as she would have him to be and she commenced stroking his curls and kissing his cheek and offering him tea in her saucer like a baby this pleased him for he was not much better he dried his eyes and lightened into a faint smile 
 oh do very well said the master to me after watching them a minute very well if we can keep him ellen the company of a child of his own age will instil new spirit into him soon and by wishing for strength gain it 
 ay if we can keep him i mused to myself and sore misgivings came over me that there was slight hope of that and then i thought however will that weakling live at wuthering heights between his father and hareton what playmates and instructors be our doubts were presently decided even earlier than i expected i had just taken the children upstairs after tea was finished and seen linton would not suffer me to leave him till that was the had come down and was standing by the table in the hall lighting a bedroom candle for mr edgar when a maid stepped out of the kitchen and informed me that mr servant joseph was at the door and wished to speak with the master 
 i shall ask him what he wants first i said in considerable trepidation a very unlikely hour to be troubling people and the instant they have returned from a long journey i think the master can see him 
 joseph had advanced through the kitchen as i uttered these words and now presented himself in the hall he was donned in his sunday garments with his most sanctimonious and sourest face and holding his hat in one hand and his stick in the other he proceeded to clean his shoes on the mat 
 good evening joseph i said coldly what business brings you here tonight 
 maister linton aw mun spake tull he answered waving me disdainfully aside 
 mr linton is going to bed unless you have something particular to say sure he hear it now i continued you had better sit down in there and entrust your message to me 
 which is his rahm pursued the fellow surveying the range of closed doors 
 i perceived he was bent on refusing my mediation so very reluctantly i went up to the library and announced the unseasonable visitor advising that he should be dismissed till next day mr linton had no time to empower me to do so for joseph mounted close at my heels and pushing into the apartment planted himself at the far side of the table with his two fists clapped on the head of his stick and began in an elevated tone as if anticipating opposition 
 heathcliff has send me for his lad and aw goa back bout him 
 edgar linton was silent a minute an expression of exceeding sorrow overcast his features he would have pitied the child on his own account but recalling hopes and fears and anxious wishes for her son and her commendations of him to his care he grieved bitterly at the prospect of yielding him up and searched in his heart how it might be avoided no plan offered itself the very exhibition of any desire to keep him would have rendered the claimant more peremptory there was nothing left but to resign him however he was not going to rouse him from his sleep 
 tell mr heathcliff he answered calmly that his son shall come to wuthering heights tomorrow he is in bed and too tired to go the distance now you may also tell him that the mother of linton desired him to remain under my guardianship and at present his health is very precarious 
 noa said joseph giving a thud with his prop on the floor and assuming an authoritative air noa that manes nowt hathecliff maks noa cahnt uh t mother nur yah norther bud hev his lad und aw mun tak nah yah knaw 
 you shall not tonight answered linton decisively walk downstairs at once and repeat to your master what i have said ellen show him down go 
 and aiding the indignant elder with a lift by the arm he rid the room of him and closed the door 
 varrah weell shouted joseph as he slowly drew off tuhmorn come hisseln un thrust him aht if yah darr

 chapter nineteen 
 
 while these things were happening at home amy was having hard times at aunt she felt her exile deeply and for the first time in her life realized how much she was beloved and petted at home aunt march never petted any one she did not approve of it but she meant to be kind for the well behaved little girl pleased her very much and aunt march had a soft place in her old heart for her children though she think it proper to confess it she really did her best to make amy happy but dear me what mistakes she made some old people keep young at heart in spite of wrinkles and gray hairs can sympathize with little cares and joys make them feel at home and can hide wise lessons under pleasant plays giving and receiving friendship in the sweetest way but aunt march had not this gift and she worried amy very much with her rules and orders her prim ways and long prosy talks finding the child more docile and amiable than her sister the old lady felt it her duty to try and counteract as far as possible the bad effects of home freedom and indulgence so she took amy by the hand and taught her as she herself had been taught sixty years ago a process which carried dismay to soul and made her feel like a fly in the web of a very strict spider 
 she had to wash the cups every morning and polish up the spoons the fat silver teapot and the glasses till they shone then she must dust the room and what a trying job that was not a speck escaped aunt eye and all the furniture had claw legs and much carving which was never dusted to suit then polly had to be fed the lap dog combed and a dozen trips upstairs and down to get things or deliver orders for the old lady was very lame and seldom left her big chair after these tiresome labors she must do her lessons which was a daily trial of every virtue she possessed then she was allowed one hour for exercise or play and she enjoy it 
 laurie came every day and wheedled aunt march till amy was allowed to go out with him when they walked and rode and had capital times after dinner she had to read aloud and sit still while the old lady slept which she usually did for an hour as she dropped off over the first page then patchwork or towels appeared and amy sewed with outward meekness and inward rebellion till dusk when she was allowed to amuse herself as she liked till teatime the evenings were the worst of all for aunt march fell to telling long stories about her youth which were so unutterably dull that amy was always ready to go to be intending to cry over her hard fate but usually going to sleep before she had squeezed out more than a tear or two 
 if it had not been for laurie and old esther the maid she felt that she never could have got through that dreadful time the parrot alone was enough to drive her distracted for he soon felt that she did not admire him and revenged himself by being as mischievous as possible he pulled her hair whenever she came near him upset his bread and milk to plague her when she had newly cleaned his cage made mop bark by pecking at him while madam dozed called her names before company and behaved in all respects like an reprehensible old bird then she could not endure the dog a fat cross beast who snarled and yelped at her when she made his toilet and who lay on his back with all his legs in the air and a most idiotic expression of countenance when he wanted something to eat which was about a dozen times a day the cook was the old coachman was deaf and esther the only one who ever took any notice of the young lady 
 esther was a frenchwoman who had lived as she called her mistress for many years and who rather tyrannized over the old lady who could not get along without her her real name was estelle but aunt march ordered her to change it and she obeyed on condition that she was never asked to change her religion she took a fancy to mademoiselle and amused her very much with odd stories of her life in france when amy sat with her while she got up laces she also allowed her to roam about the great house and examine the curious and pretty things stored away in the big wardrobes and the ancient chests for aunt march hoarded like a magpie chief delight was an indian cabinet full of queer drawers little pigeonholes and secret places in which were kept all sorts of ornaments some precious some merely curious all more or less antique to examine and arrange these things gave amy great satisfaction especially the jewel cases in which on velvet cushions reposed the ornaments which had adorned a belle forty years ago there was the garnet set which aunt march wore when she came out the pearls her father gave her on her wedding day her diamonds the jet mourning rings and pins the queer lockets with portraits of dead friends and weeping willows made of hair inside the baby bracelets her one little daughter had worn uncle big watch with the red seal so many childish hands had played with and in a box all by itself lay aunt wedding ring too small now for her fat finger but put carefully away like the most precious jewel of them all 
 which would mademoiselle choose if she had her will asked esther wo always sat near to watch over and lock up the valuables 
 i like the diamonds best but there is no necklace among them and fond of necklaces they are so becoming i should choose this if i might replied amy looking with great admiration at a string of gold and ebony beads from which hung a heavy cross of the same 
 i too covet that but not as a necklace ah no to me it is a rosary and as such i should use it like a good catholic said esther eyeing the handsome thing wistfully 
 is it meant to use as you use the string of wooden beads hanging over your glass asked amy 
 truly yes to pray with it would be pleasing to the saints if one used so fine a rosary as this instead of wearing it as a vain bijou 
 you seem to take a great deal of comfort in your prayers esther and always come down looking quiet and satisfied i wish i could 
 if mademoiselle was a catholic she would find true comfort but as that is not to be it would be well if you went apart each day to meditate and pray as did the good mistress whom i served before madame she had a little chapel and in it found solacement for much trouble 
 would it be right for me to do so too asked amy who in her loneliness felt the need of help of some sort and found that she was apt to forget her little book now that beth was not there to remind her of it 
 it would be excellent and charming and i shall gladly arrange the little dressing room for you if you like it say nothing to madame but when she sleeps go you and sit alone a while to think good thoughts and pray the dear god preserve your sister 
 esther was truly pious and quite sincere in her advice for she had an affectionate heart and felt much for the sisters in their anxiety amy liked the idea and gave her leave to arrange the light closet next her room hoping it would do her good 
 i wish i knew where all these pretty things would go when aunt march dies she said as she slowly replaced the shining rosary and shut the jewel cases one by one 
 to you and your sisters i know it madame confides in me i witnessed her will and it is to be so whispered esther smiling 
 how nice but i wish let us have them now procrastination is not agreeable observed amy taking a last look at the diamonds 
 it is too soon yet for the young ladies to wear these things the first one who is affianced will have the pearls madame has said it and i have a fancy that the little turquoise ring will be given to you when you go for madame approves your good behavior and charming manners 
 do you think so oh be a lamb if i can only have that lovely ring ever so much prettier than kitty i do like aunt march after all and amy tried on the blue ring with a delighted face and a firm resolve to earn it 
 from that day she was a model of obedience and the old lady complacently admired the success of her training esther fitted up the closet with a little table placed a footstool before it and over it a picture taken from one of the rooms she thought it was of no great value but being appropriate she borrowed it well knowing that madame would never know it nor care if she did it was however a very valuable copy of one of the famous pictures of the world and eyes were never tired of looking up at the sweet face of the divine mother while her tender thoughts of her own were busy at her heart on the table she laid her little testament and hymnbook kept a vase always full of the best flowers laurie brought her and came every day to sit alone thinking good thoughts and praying the dear god to preserve her sister esther had given her a rosary of black beads with a silver cross but amy hung it up and did not use it feeling doubtful as to its fitness for protestant prayers 
 the little girl was very sincere in all this for being left alone outside the safe home nest she felt the need of some kind hand to hold by so sorely that she instinctively turned to the strong and tender friend whose fatherly love most closely surrounds his little children she missed her help to understand and rule herself but having been taught where to look she did her best to find the way and walk in it confidingly but amy was a young pilgrim and just now her burden seemed very heavy she tried to forget herself to keep cheerful and be satisfied with doing right though no one saw or praised her for it in her firsteffort at being very very good she decided to make her will as aunt march had done so that if she did fall ill and die her possessions might be justly and generously divided it cost her a pang even to think of giving up the little treasures which in her eyes were as precious as the old jewels 
 during one of her play hours she wrote out the important document as well as she could with some help from esther as to certain legal terms and when the frenchwoman had signed her name amy felt relieved and laid it by to show laurie whom she wanted as a second witness as it was a rainy day she went upstairs to amuse herself in one of the large chambers and took polly with her for company in this room there was a wardrobe full of costumes with which esther allowed her to play and it was her favorite amusement to array herself in the faded brocades and parade up and down before the long mirror making stately curtsies and sweeping her train about with a rustle which delighted her ears so busy was she on this day that she did not hear ring nor see his face peeping in at her as she gravely promenaded to and fro flirting her fan and tossing her head on which she wore a great pink turban contrasting oddly with her blue brocade dress and yellow quilted petticoat she was obliged to walk carefully for she had on highheeled shoes and as laurie told jo afterward it was a comical sight to see her mince along in her gay suit with polly sidilng and bridling just behind her imitating her as well as he could and occasionally stopping to laugh or exclaim we fine get along you fright hold your tongue kiss me dear ha ha 
 having with difficulty restrained an explosion of merriment lest it should offend her majesty laurie tapped and was graciously received 
 sit down and rest while i put these things away then i want to consult you about a very serious matter said amy when she had shown her splendor and driven polly into a corner that bird is the trial of my life she continued removing the pink mountain from her head while laurie seated himself astride a chair yesterday when aunt was asleep and i was trying to be as still as a mouse polly began to squall and flap about in his cage so i went to let him out and found a big spider there i poked it out and it ran under the bookcase polly marched straight after it stooped down and peeped under the bookcase saying in his funny way with a cock of his eye come out and take a walk my dear i help laughing which made poll swear and aunt woke up and scolded us both 
 did the spider accept the old invitation asked laurie yawning 
 yes out it came and away ran polly frightened to death and scrambled up on chair calling out catch her catch her catch her as i chased the spider 
 a lie oh lor cried the parrot pecking at toes 
 wring your neck if you were mine you old torment cried laurie shaking his fist at the bird who put his head on one side and gravely croaked allyluyer bless your buttons dear 
 now ready said amy shutting the wardrobe and taking a piece of paper out of her pocket i want you to read that please and tell me if it is legal and right i felt i ought to do it for life is uncertain and i want any ill feeling over my tomb 
 laurie bit his lips and turning a little from the pensive speaker read the following document with praiseworthy gravity considering the spelling 
 
 
 my last will and testiment 
 
 i amy curtis march being in my sane mind go give and bequeethe all my earthly 
 to my father my best pictures sketches maps and works of art including frames also my to do what he likes with

 to our venerable benefactor mr laurence i leave my purple box with a looking glass in the cover which will be nice for his pens and remind him of the departed girl who thanks him for his favors to her family especially beth 
 i wish my favorite playmate kitty bryant to have the blue silk apron and my ring with a kiss

 and now having disposed of my most valuable property i hope all will be satisfied and not blame the dead i forgive everyone and trust we may all meet when the trump shall sound amen 
 to this will and testiment i set my hand and seal on this th day of nov anni domino 
 
 amy curtis march 
 
 witnesses 
 estelle valnor 
 theodore laurence 
 
 the last name was written in pencil and amy explained that he was to rewrite it in ink and seal it up for her properly 
 what put it into your head did anyone tell you about giving away her things asked laurie soberly as amy laid a bit of red tape with sealing wax a taper and a standish before him 
 she explained and then asked anxiously what about beth 
 sorry i spoke but as i did tell you she felt so ill one day that she told jo she wanted to give her piano to meg her cats to you and the poor old doll to jo who would love it for her sake she was sorry she had so little to give and left locks of hair to the rest of us and her best love to grandpa she never thought of a will 
 laurie was signing and sealing as he spoke and did not look up till a great tear dropped on the paper face was full of trouble but she only said people put sort of postscripts to their wills sometimes 
 yes codicils they call them 
 put one in mine then that i wish all my curls cut off and given round to my friends i forgot it but i want it done though it will spoil my looks 
 laurie added it smiling at last and greatest sacrifice then he amused her for an hour and was much interested in all her trials but when he came to go amy held him back to whisper with trembling lips is there really any danger about beth 
 afraid there is but we must hope for the best so cry dear and laurie put his arm about her with a brotherly gesture which was very comforting 
 when he had gone she went to her little chapel and sitting in the twilight prayed for beth with streaming tears and an aching heart feeling that a million turquoise rings would not console her for the loss of her gentle little sister

lionfish nov chapter nineteen the servant of lord voldemortcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 hermione screamed black leapt to his feet harry felt as though received a huge electric shock 
 
 i found this at the base of the whomping willow said snape throwing the cloak aside careful to keep this wand pointing directly at chest very useful potter i thank you 
 
 snape was slightly breathless but his face was full of suppressed triumph wondering perhaps how i knew you were here he said his eyes glittering just been to your office lupin you forgot to take your potion tonight so i took a gobletful along and very lucky i didlucky for me i mean lying on your desk was a certain map one glance at it told me all i needed to know i saw you running along this passageway and out of sight 
 
 severus lupin began but snape overrode him 
 
 told the headmaster again and again that helping your old friend black into the castle lupin and the proof not even i dreamed you would have the nerve to use this old place as your hideout 
 
 severus making a mistake said lupin urgently you heard everything i can explain sirius is not here to kill harry 
 
 two more for azkaban tonight said snape his eyes now gleaming fanatically i shall be interested to see how dumbledore takes thishe was quite convinced you were harmless you know lupina tame werewolf 
 
 you fool said lupin softly is a schoolboy grudge worth putting an innocent man back inside azkaban 
 
 bang thin snakelike cords burst from the end of wand and twisted themselves around mouth wrists and ankles he overbalanced and fell to the floor unable to move with a roar of rage black started toward snape but snape pointed his wand straight between eyes 
 
 give me a reason he whispered give me a reason to do it and i swear i will 
 
 black stopped dead it would have been impossible to say which face showed more hatred 
 
 harry stood there paralyzed not knowing what to do or whom to believe he glanced around at ron and hermione ron looked just as confused as he did still fighting to keep hold on the struggling scabbers hermione however took an uncertain step toward snape and said in a very breathless voice professor snape it hurt to hear what got to say it 
 
 miss granger you are already facing suspension from this school snape spat you potter and weasley are in the company of a convicted murderer and a werewolf for once in your life hold your tongue 
 
 but if if there was a mistake 
 
 keep quiet you stupid girl snape shouted looking suddenly quite deranged talk about what you understand a few sparks shot out of the end of his wand which was still pointed at face hermione fell silent 
 
 vengeance is very sweet snape breathed at black how i hoped i would be the one to catch you 
 
 the on you again severus black snarled as long as this boy brings his rat up to the castle he jerked his head at ron come quietly 
 
 up to the castle said snape silkily i think we need to go that far all i have to do is call the dementors once we get out of the willow be very pleased to see you blackpleased enough to give you a little kiss i daresayi 
 
 what little color there was in face left it 
 
 you got to hear me out he croaked the rat look at the rat 
 
 but there was a mad glint in eyes that harry had never seen before he seemed beyond reason 
 
 come on all of you he said he clicked his fingers and the ends of the cords that bound lupin flew to his hands drag the werewolf perhaps the dementors will have a kiss for him too 
 
 before he knew what he was doing harry had crossed the room in three strides and blocked the door 
 
 get out of the way potter in enough trouble already snarled snape if i been here to save your skin 
 
 professor lupin could have killed me about a hundred times this year harry said been alone with him loads of times having defense lessons against the dementors if he was helping black why he just finish me off then 
 
 ask me to fathom the way a mind works hissed snape get out of the way potter 
 
 pathetic harry yelled just because they made a fool of you at school you even listen 
 
 silence i will not be spoken to like that snape shrieked looking madder than ever like father like son potter i have just saved your neck you should be thanking me on bended knee you would have been well served if killed you have died like your father too arrogant to believe you might be mistaken in black now get out of the way or i will make you get out of the way potter 
 
 harry made up his mind in a split second before snape could take even one step toward him he had raised his wand 
 
 expelliarmus he yelled except that his the only voice that shouted there was a blast that made the door rattle on its hinges snape was lifted off his feet and slammed into the wall then slid down it to the floor a trickle of blood oozing from under his hair he had been knocked out 
 
 harry looked around both ron and hermione had tried to disarm snape at exactly the same moment wand soared in a high arc and landed on the bed next to crookshanks 
 
 you have done that said black looking at harry 
 
 you should have left him to me 
 
 harry avoided eyes he sure even now that done the right thing 
 
 we attacked a teacherwe attacked a teacher hermione whimpered staring at the lifeless snape with frightened eyes oh going to be in so much trouble 
 
 lupin was struggling against his bonds black bent down quickly and untied him lupin straightened up rubbing his arms where the ropes had cut into them 
 
 thank you harry he said 
 
 still not saying i believe you he told lupin 
 
 then time we offered you some proof said lupin you boy give me peter please now 
 
 ron clutched scabbers closer to his chest 
 
 come off it he said weakly are you trying to say he broke out of azkaban just to get his hands on scabbers i mean he looked up at harry and hermione for support okay say pettigrew could turn into a rat there are millions of rats he supposed to know which one he is after if he was locked up in azkaban 
 
 you know sirius a fair question said lupin turning to black and frowning slightly how did you find out where he was 
 
 black put one of his hands inside his robes and took out a crumpled piece of paper which he smoothed flat and held out to show the others 
 
 it was the photograph of ron and his family that had appeared in the daily prophet the previous summer and there on shoulder was scabbers 
 
 how did you get this lupin asked black thunderstruck 
 
 fudge said black when he came to inspect azkaban last year he gave me his paper and there was peter on the front page on this shoulderi knew him at oncehow many times had i seen him transform and the caption said the boy would be going back to hogwartsto where harry was 
 
 my god said lupin softly staring from scabbers to the picture in the paper and back again his front paw 
 
 what about it said ron defiantly 
 
 got a toe missing said black 
 
 of course lupin breathed so simpleso brillianthe cut it off himself 
 
 just before he transformed said black when i cornered him he yelled for the whole street to hear that betrayed lily and james then before i could curse him he blew apart the street with the wand behind his back killed everyone within twenty feet of himself and sped down into the sewer with the other rats 
 
 you ever hear ron said lupin the biggest bit of peter they found was his finger 
 
 look scabbers probably had a fight with another rat or something been in my family for ages right 
 
 twelve years in fact said lupin you ever wonder why he was living so long 
 
 we been taking good care of him said ron 
 
 not looking too good at the moment though is he said lupin guess been losing weight ever since he heard sirius was on the loose again 
 
 been scared of that mad cat said ron nodding toward crookshanks who was still purring on the bed 
 
 but that right harry thought suddenlyscabbers had been looking ill before he met crookshanks ever since return from egyptsince the time when black had escaped 
 
 this cat mad said black hoarsely he reached out a bony hand and stroked fluffy head the most intelligent of his kind ever met he recognized peter for what he was right away and when he met me he knew i was no dog it was a while before he trusted mefinally i managed to communicate to him what i was after and been helping me 
 
 what do you mean breathed hermione 
 
 he tried to bring peter to me but he stole the passwords into gryffindor tower for meas i understand it he took them from a bedside table 
 
 brain seemed to be sagging under the weight of what he was hearing it was absurdand yet 
 
 but peter got wind of what was going on and ran for it croaked black this cat crookshanks did you call him told me peter had left blood on the sheetsi supposed he bit himselfwell faking his own death had worked once 
 
 these words jolted harry to his senses 
 
 and why did he fake his death he said furiously because he knew you were about to kill him like you killed my parents 
 
 no said lupin harry 
 
 and now come to finish him off 
 
 yes i have said black with an evil look at scabbers 
 
 then i let snape take you harry shouted 
 
 harry said lupin hurriedly you see all this time thought sirius betrayed your parents and peter tracked him down but it was the other way around you see peter betrayed your mother and father sirius tracked peter down 
 
 not true harry yelled he was their he said so before you turned up he said he killed them 
 
 he was pointing at black who shook his head slowly the sunken eyes were suddenly over bright 
 
 harryi as good as killed them he croaked i persuaded lily and james to change to peter at the last moment persuaded them to use him as instead of to blame i know itthe night they died arranged to check on peter make sure he was still safe but when i arrived at his hiding place gone yet there was no sign of a struggle it feel right i was scared i set out for your parents house straight away and when i saw their house destroyed and their bodiesi realized what peter donewhat done 
 
 his voice broke he turned away 
 
 enough of this said lupin and there was a steely note in his voice harry had never heard before one certain way to prove what really happened ron give me that rat 
 
 what are you going to do with him if i give him to you ron asked lupin tensely 
 
 force him to show himself said lupin if he really is a rat it hurt him 
 
 ron hesitated then at long last he held out scabbers and lupin took him scabbers began to squeak without stopping twisting and turning his tiny black eyes bulging in his head ready sirius said lupin 
 
 black had already retrieved wand from the bed he approached lupin and the struggling rat and his wet eyes suddenly seemed to be burning in his face 
 
 together he said quietly 
 
 i think so said lupin holding scabbers tightly in one hand and his wand in the other on the count of three one two three 
 
 a flash of light erupted from both wands for a moment scabbers was frozen in midair his small gray form twisting madly ron yelled the rat fell and hit the floor there was another blinding flash of light and then 
 
 it was like watching a film of a growing tree a head was shooting upward from the ground limbs were sprouting a moment later a man was standing where scabbers had been cringing and wringing his hands crookshanks was spitting and snarling on the bed the hair on his back was standing up 
 
 he was a very short man hardly taller than harry and hermione his thin colorless hair was unkempt and there was a large bald patch on top he had the shrunken appearance of a plump man who has lost a lot of weight in a short time his skin looked grubby almost like fur and something of the rat lingered around his pointed nose and his very small watery eyes he looked around at them all his breathing fast and shallow harry saw his eyes dart to the door and back again 
 
 well hello peter said lupin pleasantly as though rats frequently erupted into old school friends around him long time no see 
 
 ssiriusrremus even voice was squeaky again his eyes darted toward the door my friendsmy old friends 
 
 wand arm rose but lupin seized him around the wrist gave him a warning took then turned again to pettigrew his voice light and casual 
 
 been having a little chat peter about what happened the night lily and james died you might have missed the finer points while you were squeaking around down there on the bed 
 
 remus gasped pettigrew and harry could see beads of sweat breaking out over his pasty face you believe him do you he tried to kill me remus 
 
 so heard said lupin more coldly like to clear up one or two little matters with you peter if be so 
 
 come to try and kill me again pettigrew squeaked suddenly pointing at black and harry saw that he used his middle finger because his index was missing he killed lily and james and now going to kill me got to help me remus 
 
 face looked more than ever as he stared at pettigrew with his fathomless eyes 
 
 no going to try and kill you until sorted a few things out said lupin 
 
 sorted things out squealed pettigrew looking wildly about him once more eyes taking in the boarded windows and again the only door i knew come after me i knew be back for me been waiting for this for twelve years 
 
 you knew sirius was going to break out of azkaban said lupin his brow furrowed when nobody has ever done it before 
 
 got dark powers the rest of us can only dream of pettigrew shouted shrilly how else did he get out of there i suppose taught him a few tricks 
 
 black started to laugh a horrible mirthless laugh that filled the whole room 
 
 voldemort teach me tricks he said 
 
 pettigrew flinched as though black had brandished a whip at him 
 
 what scared to hear your old name said black i blame you peter his lot very happy with you are they 
 
 know what you mean sirius muttered pettigrew his breathing faster than ever his whole face was shining with sweat now 
 
 you been hiding from me for twelve years said black been hiding from old supporters i heard things in azkaban peterthey all think dead or have to answer to heard them screaming all sorts of things in their sleep sounds like they think the them voldemort went to the potters on your informationand voldemort met his downfall there and not all supporters ended up in azkaban did they there are still plenty out here biding their time pretending seen the error of their ways if they ever got wind that you were still alive peter 
 
 knowwhat talking about said pettigrew again more shrilly than ever he wiped his face on his sleeve and looked up at lupin you believe this this madness remus 
 
 i must admit peter i have difficulty in understanding why an innocent man would want to spend twelve years as a rat said lupin evenly 
 
 innocent but scared squealed pettigrew if supporters were after me it was because i put one of their best men in azkaban the spy sirius black 
 
 face contorted 
 
 how dare you he growled sounding suddenly like the bearsized dog he had been i a spy for voldemort when did i ever sneak around people who were stronger and more powerful than myself but you peter never understand why i see you were the spy from the start you always liked big friends look after you you it used to be usme and remusand james 
 
 pettigrew wiped his face again he was almost panting for breath 
 
 me a spymust be out of your know how you can say such a 
 
 lily and james only made you because i suggested it black hissed so venomously that pettigrew took a step backward i thought it was the perfect plana bluffvoldemort would be sure to come after me would never dream use a weak talentless thing like youit must have been the finest moment of your miserable life telling voldemort you could hand him the potters 
 
 pettigrew was muttering distractedly harry caught words like and lunacy but he help paying more attention to the ashen color of face and the way his eyes continued to dart toward the windows and door 
 
 professor lupin said hermione timidly can can i say something 
 
 certainly hermione said lupin courteously 
 
 well scabbers i mean this this man been sleeping in dormitory for three years if working for how come he never tried to hurt harry before now 
 
 there said pettigrew shrilly pointing at ron with his maimed hand thank you you see remus i have never hurt a hair of head why should i 
 
 tell you why said black because you never did anything for anyone unless you could see what was in it for you been in hiding for fifteen years they say half dead you about to commit murder right under albus nose for a wreck of a wizard lost all of his power were you want to be quite sure he was the biggest bully in the playground before you went back to him you why else did you find a wizard family to take you in keeping an ear out for news you peter just in case your old protector regained strength and it was safe to rejoin him 
 
 pettigrew opened his mouth and closed it several times he seemed to have lost the ability to talk 
 
 er mr black sirius said hermione 
 
 black jumped at being addressed like this and stared at hermione as though he had never seen anything quite like her 
 
 if you mind me asking how how did you get out of azkaban if you use dark magic 
 
 thank you gasped pettigrew nodding frantically at her exactly precisely what i 
 
 but lupin silenced him with a look black was frowning slightly at hermione but not as though he were annoyed with her he seemed to be pondering his answer 
 
 i know how i did it he said slowly i think the only reason i never lost my mind is that i knew i was innocent that a happy thought so the dementors suck it out of mebut it kept me sane and knowing who i amhelped me keep my powersso when it all becametoo muchi could transform in my cellbecome a dog dementors see you know he swallowed they feel their way toward people by feeding off their emotionsthey could tell that my feelings were less less human less complex when i was a dogbut they thought of course that i was losing my mind like everyone else in there so it trouble them but i was weak very weak and i had no hope of driving them away from me without a wand 
 
 but then i saw peter in that picturei realized he was at hogwarts with harryperfectly positioned to act if one hint reached his ears that the dark side was gathering strength again 
 
 pettigrew was shaking his head mouthing noiselessly but staring all the while at black as though hypnotized 
 
 ready to strike at the moment he could be sure of alliesand to deliver the last potter to them if he gave them harry dare say betrayed lord voldemort be welcomed back with honors 
 
 so you see i had to do something i was the only one who knew peter was still alive 
 
 harry remembered what mr weasley had told mrs wealsey the guards say been talking in his sleep always the same words at hogwarts 
 
 it was as if someone had lit a fire in my head and the dementors destroy itit a happy feelingit was an obsessionbut it gave me strength it cleared my mind so one night when they opened my door to bring food i slipped past them as a so much harder for them to sense animal emotions that they were confusedi was thin very thinthin enough to slip through the barsi swam as a dog back to the mainland i journeyed north and slipped into the hogwarts grounds as a dog been living in the forest ever since except when i came to watch the quidditch of course you fly as well as your father did harry 
 
 he looked at harry who did not look away 
 
 believe me croaked black believe me harry i never betrayed james and lily i would have died before i betrayed them 
 
 and at long last harry believed him throat too tight to speak he nodded 
 
 no 
 
 pettigrew had fallen to his knees as though nod had been his own death sentence he shuffled forward on his knees groveling his hands clasped in front of him as though praying 
 
 sirius peteryour friendyou 
 
 black kicked out and pettigrew recoiled 
 
 enough filth on my robes without you touching them said black 
 
 remus pettigrew squeaked turning to lupin instead writhing imploringly in front of him you believe this sirius have told you changed the plan 
 
 not if he thought i was the spy peter said lupin i assume why you tell me sirius he said casually over head 
 
 forgive me remus said black 
 
 not at all padfoot old friend said lupin who was now rolling up his sleeves and will you in turn forgive me for believing you were the spy 
 
 of course said black and the ghost of a grin flitted across his gaunt face he too began rolling up his sleeves shall we kill him together 
 
 yes i think so said lupin grimly 
 
 you gasped pettigrew and he scrambled around to ron 
 
 i been a good frienda good pet you let them kill me ron will on my side you 
 
 but ron was staring at pettigrew with the utmost revulsion 
 
 i let you sleep in my bed he said 
 
 kind boykind master pettigrew crawled toward ron you let them do iti was your rati was a good pet 
 
 if you made a better rat than a human not much to boast about peter said black harshly ron going still paler with pain wrenched his broken leg out of reach pettigrew turned on his knees staggered forward and seized the hem of robes 
 
 sweet girlclever girlyou you let themhelp me 
 
 hermione pulled her robes out of clutching hands and backed away against the wall looking horrified 
 
 pettigrew knelt trembling uncontrollably and turned his head slowly toward harry 
 
 harryharryyou look just like your fatherjust like him 
 
 how dare you speak to harry roared black how dare you face him how dare you talk about james in front of him 
 
 harry whispered pettigrew shuffling toward him hands outstretched harry james have wanted me killedjames would have understood harryhe would have shown me mercy 
 
 both black and lupin strode forward seized shoulders and threw him backward onto the floor he sat there twitching with terror staring up at them 
 
 you sold lily and james to voldemort said black who was shaking too do you deny it 
 
 pettigrew burst into tears it was horrible to watch like an oversized balding baby cowering on the floor 
 
 sirius sirius what could i have done the dark lordyou have no ideahe has weapons you imagine i was scared sirius i was never brave like you and remus and james i never meant it to forced me 
 
 lie bellowed black been passing information to him for a year before lily and james died you were his spy 
 
 he he was taking over everywhere gasped pettigrew was there to be gained by refusing him 
 
 what was there to be gained by fighting the most evil wizard who has ever existed said black with a terrible fury in his face only innocent lives peter 
 
 you understand whined pettigrew he would have killed me sirius 
 
 then you should have died roared black died rather than betray your friends as we would have done for you 
 
 black and lupin stood shoulder to shoulder wands raised 
 
 you should have realized said lupin quietly if voldemort kill you we would peter 
 
 hermione covered her face with her hands and turned to the wall 
 
 no harry yelled he ran forward placing himself in front pettigrew facing the wands you kill him he said breathlessly you 
 
 black and lupin both looked staggered 
 
 harry this piece of vermin is the reason you have no parents black snarled this cringing bit of filth would have seen you die too without turning a hair you heard him his own stinking skin meant more to him than your whole family 
 
 i know harry panted take him up to the castle hand him over to the dementorshe can go to azkabanbut kill him 
 
 harry gasped pettigrew and he flung his arms around knees you thank you more than i deserve thank you 
 
 get off me harry spat throwing hands off him in disgust not doing this for you doing it because i reckon my dad wanted them to become killers just for you 
 
 no one moved or made a sound except pettigrew whose breath was coming in wheezes as he clutched his chest black and lupin were looking at each other then with one movement they lowered their wands 
 
 the only person who has the right to decide harry said black but think think what he did 
 
 he can go to azkaban harry repeated if anyone deserves that place he does 
 
 pettigrew was still wheezing behind him 
 
 very well said lupin stand aside harry 
 
 harry hesitated 
 
 going to tie him up said lupin all i swear 
 
 harry stepped out of the way thin cords shot from wand this time and next moment pettigrew was wriggling on the floor bound and gagged 
 
 but if you transform peter growled black his own wand pointing at pettigrew too we will kill you you agree harry 
 
 harry looked down at the pitiful figure on the floor and nodded so that pettigrew could see him 
 
 right said lupin suddenly businesslike ron i mend bones nearly as well as madam pomfrey so i think best if we just strap your leg up until we can get you to the hospital wing 
 
 he hurried over to ron bent down tapped leg with his wand and muttered ferula bandages spun up leg strapping it tightly to a splint lupin helped him to his feet ron put his weight gingerly on the leg and wince 
 
 better he said thanks 
 
 what about professor snape said hermione in a small voice looking down at prone figure 
 
 nothing seriously wrong with him said lupin bending over snape and checking his pulse you were just a little overenthusiastic still out cold er perhaps it will be best if we revive him until safety back in the castle we can take him like this 
 
 he muttered mobilicorpus as though invisible strings were tied to wrists neck and knees he was pulled into a standing position head still lolling unpleasantly like a grotesque puppet he hung a few inches above the ground his limp feet dangling lupin picked up the invisibility cloak and tucked it safely into his pocket 
 
 and two of us should be chained to this said black nudging pettigrew with his toe just to make sure 
 
 do it said lupin 
 
 and me said ron savagely limping forward 
 
 black conjured heavy manacles from thin air soon pettigrew was upright again left arm chained to right right arm to left face was set he seemed to have taken true identity as a personal insult crookshanks leapt lightly off the bed and led the way out of the room his bottlebrush tail held jauntily high 
 
 rowling

 the prisoner of azkaban 
 

lionfish nov chapter nineteen the hungarian horntailcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 the prospect of talking with sirius was all that sustained harry over the next fortnight the only bright spot on a horizon that had never looked darker the shock of finding himself school champion had worn off slightly now and the fear of what was facing him had started to sink in the first task was drawing steadily nearer he felt as though it were crouching ahead of him hike some horrific monster barring his path he had never suffered nerves like these they were way beyond anything he had experienced before a quidditch match not even his last one against slytherin which had decided who would win the quidditch cup harry was finding it hard to think about the future at all he felt as though his whole life had been heading up to and would finish with the first task 
 
 admittedly he see how sirius was going to make him feel any better about having to perform an unknown piece of difficult and dangerous magic in front of hundreds of people but the mere sight of a friendly face would be something at the moment harry wrote back to sirius saying that he would be beside the common room fire at the time sirius had suggested and he and hermione spent a long time going over plans for forcing any stragglers out of the common room on the night in question if the worst came to the worst they were going to drop a bag of dungbombs but they hoped they have to resort to that filch would skin them alive 
 
 in the meantime life became even worse for harry within the confines of the castle for rita skeeter had published her piece about the triwizard tournament and it had turned out to be not so much a report on the tournament as a highly colored life story of harry much of the front page had been given over to a picture of harry the article continuing on pages two six and seven had been all about harry the names of the beauxbatons and durmstrang champions misspelled had been squashed into the last line of the article and cedric been mentioned at all 
 
 the article had appeared ten days ago and harry still got a sick burning feeling of shame in his stomach every time he thought about it rita skeeter had reported him saying an awful lot of things that he remember ever saying in his life let alone in that broom cupboard 
 
 
 
 i suppose i get my strength from my parents i know be very proud of me if they could see me sometimes at night i still cry about them not ashamed to admit know nothing will hurt me during the tournament because watching over me 
 but rita skeeter had gone even further than transforming his into long sickly sentences she had interviewed other people about him too 
 
 harry has at last found love at hogwarts his close friend colin creevey says that harry is rarely seen out of the company of one hermione granger a stunningly pretty girl who like harry is one of the top students in the school 
 from the moment the article had appeared harry had had to endure people slytherins mainly quoting it at him as he passed and making sneering comments 
 
 want a hanky potter in case you start crying in transfiguration 
 
 since when have you been one of the top students in the school potter or is this a school you and longbottom have set up together 
 
 hey harry 
 
 yeah right harry found himself shouting as he wheeled around in the corridor having had just about enough just been crying my eyes out over my dead mum and just off to do a bit more 
 
 no it was just you dropped your quill 
 
 it was cho harry felt the color rising in his face 
 
 oh right sorry he muttered taking the quill back 
 
 ergood luck on tuesday she said i really hope you do well 
 
 which left harry feeling extremely stupid 
 
 hermione had come in for her fair share of unpleasantness too but she yet started yelling at innocent bystanders in fact harry was full of admiration for the way she was handling the situation 
 
 stunningly pretty her pansy parkinson had shrieked the first time she had come with hermione after article had appeared what was she judging against a chipmunk 
 
 ignore it hermione said in a dignified voice holding her head in the air and stalking past the sniggering slytherin girls as though she hear them just ignore it harry 
 
 but harry ignore it ron spoken to him at all since he had told him about detentions harry had half hoped they would make things up during the two hours they were forced to pickle rats brains in dungeon but that had been the day article had appeared which seemed to have confirmed belief that harry was really enjoying all the attention 
 
 hermione was furious with the pair of them she went from one to the other trying to force them to talk to each other but harry was adamant he would talk to ron again only if ron admitted that harry put his name in the goblet of fire and apologized for calling him a liar 
 
 i start this harry said stubbornly his problem 
 
 you miss him hermione said impatiently and i know he misses you 
 
 miss him said harry i miss him 
 
 but this was a downright lie harry liked hermione very much but she just the same as ron there was much hess laughter and a lot more hanging around in the library when hermione was your best friend harry still mastered summoning charms he seemed to have developed something of a block about them and hermione insisted that learning the theory would help they consequently spent a lot of time poring over books during their lunchtimes 
 
 viktor krum was in the library an awful lot too and harry wondered what he was up to was he studying or was he looking for things to help him through the first task hermione often complained about krum being there not that he ever bothered them but because groups of giggling girls often turned up to spy on him from behind bookshelves and hermione found the noise distracting 
 
 not even she muttered angrily glaring at sharp profile they only like him because famous they look twice at him if he do that thing 
 
 wronski feint said harry through gritted teeth quite apart from liking to get quidditch terms correct it caused him another pang to imagine expression if he could have heard hermione talking about 
 
 
 
 it is a strange thing but when you are dreading something and would give anything to slow down time it has a disobliging habit of speeding up the days until the first task seemed to slip by as though someone had fixed the clocks to work at double speed feeling of barely controlled panic was with him wherever he went as everpresent as the snide comments about the daily prophet article 
 
 on the saturday before the first task all students in the third year and above were permitted to visit the village of hogsmeade hermione told harry that it would do him good to get away from the castle for a bit and harry need much persuasion 
 
 what about ron though he said you want to go with him 
 
 went slightly pink i thought we might meet up with him in the three broomsticks 
 
 no said harry flatly 
 
 oh harry this is so stupid 
 
 come but not meeting ron and wearing my invisibility cloak 
 
 oh all right then hermione snapped but i hate talking to you in that cloak i never know if looking at you or not 
 
 so harry put on his invisibility cloak in the dormitory went back downstairs and together he and hermione set off for hogsmeade 
 
 harry felt wonderfully free under the cloak he watched other students walking past them as they entered the village most of them sporting support cedric diggory badges but no horrible remarks came his way for a change and nobody was quoting that stupid article 
 
 people keep looking at me now said hermione grumpily as they came out of honeydukes sweetshop later eating large chocolates they think talking to myself 
 
 move your lips so much then 
 
 come on please just take off your cloak for a bit no going to bother you here 
 
 oh yeah said harry look behind you 
 
 rita skeeter and her photographer friend had just emerged from the three broomsticks pub talking in low voices they passed right by hermione without hooking at her harry backed into the wall of honeydukes to stop rita skeeter from hitting him with her handbag when they were gone harry said staying in the village i bet coming to watch the first task 
 
 as he said it his stomach flooded with a wave of molten panic he mention this he and hermione discussed what was coming in the first task much he had the feeling she want to think about it 
 
 gone said hermione looking right through harry toward the end of the street why we go and have a butterbeer in the three broomsticks a bit cold it you have to talk to ron she added irritably correctly interpreting his silence 
 
 the three broomsticks was packed mainly with hogwarts students enjoying their free afternoon but also with a variety of magical people harry rarely saw anywhere else harry supposed that as hogsmeade was the only village in britain it was a bit of a haven for creatures like hags who were not as adept as wizards at disguising themselves 
 
 it was very hard to move through crowds in the invisibility cloak in case you accidentally trod on someone which tended to lead to awkward questions harry edged slowly toward a spare table in the corner while hermione went to buy drinks on his way through the pub harry spotted ron who was sitting with fred george and lee jordan resisting the urge to give ron a good hard poke in the back of the head he finally reached the table and sat down at it 
 
 hermione joined him a moment later and slipped him a butterbeer under his cloak 
 
 i look like such an idiot sitting here on my own she muttered lucky i brought something to do 
 
 and she pulled out a notebook in which she had been keeping a record of members harry saw his and names at the top of the very short list it seemed a long time ago that they had sat making up those predictions together and hermione had turned up and appointed them secretary and treasurer 
 
 you know maybe i should try and get some of the villagers involved in hermione said thoughtfully looking around the pub 
 
 yeah right said harry he took a swig of butterbeer under his cloak hermione when are you going to give up on this spew stuff 
 
 when have decent wages and working conditions she hissed back you know starting to think time for more direct action i wonder how you get into the school kitchens 
 
 no idea ask fred and george said harry 
 
 hermione lapsed into thoughtful silence while harry drank his butterbeer watching the people in the pub all of them looked cheerful and relaxed ernie macmillan and hannah abbot were swapping chocolate frog cards at a nearby table both of them sporting support cedric diggory badges on their cloaks right over by the door he saw cho and a large group of her ravenclaw friends she wearing a cedric badge cheered up harry very slightly 
 
 what he have given to be one of these people sitting around laughing and talking with nothing to worry about but homework he imagined how it would have felt to be here if his name come out of the goblet of fire he be wearing the invisibility cloak for one thing ron would be sitting with him the three of them would probably be happily imagining what deadly dangerous task the school champions would be facing on tuesday have been really hooking forward to it watching them do whatever it wascheering on cedric with everyone else safe in a seat at the back of the stands 
 
 he wondered how the other champions were feeling every time he had seen cedric lately he had been surrounded by admirers and looking nervous but excited harry glimpsed fleur delacour from time to time in the corridors she looked exactly as she always did haughty and unruffled and krum just sat in the library poring over books 
 
 harry thought of sirius and the tight tense knot in his chest seemed to ease slightly he would be speaking to him in just over twelve hours for tonight was the night they were meeting at the common room fire assuming nothing went wrong as everything else had done lately 
 
 look hagrid said hermione 
 
 the back of enormous shaggy head he had mercifully abandoned his bunches emerged over the crowd harry wondered why he spotted him at once as hagrid was so large but standing up carefully he saw that hagrid had been leaning low talking to professor moody hagrid had his usual enormous tankard in front of him but moody was drinking from his hip flask madam rosmerta the pretty landlady seem to think much of this she was looking askance at moody as she collected glasses from tables around them perhaps she thought it was an insult to her mulled mead but harry knew better moody had told them all during their last defense against the dark arts lesson that he preferred to prepare his own food and drink at all times as it was so easy for dark wizards to poison an unattended cup 
 
 as harry watched he saw hagrid and moody get up to leave he waved then remembered that hagrid see him moody however paused his magical eye on the corner where harry was standing he tapped hagrid in the small of the back being unable to reach his shoulder muttered something to him and then the pair of them made their way back across the pub toward harry and table 
 
 all right hermione said hagrid loudly 
 
 hello said hermione smiling back 
 
 moody limped around the table and bent down harry thought he was reading the notebook until he muttered nice cloak potter 
 
 harry stared at him in amazement the large chunk missing from nose was particularly obvious at a few inches distance moody grinned 
 
 can your eye i mean can you 
 
 yeah it can see through invisibility cloaks moody said quietly and come in useful at times i can tell you 
 
 hagrid was beaming down at harry too harry knew hagrid see him but moody had obviously told hagrid he was there hagrid now bent down on the pretext of reading the notebook as well and said in a whisper so low that only harry could hear it harry meet me tonight at midnight at me cabin wear that cloak 
 
 straightening up hagrid said loudly nice ter see yeh hermione winked and departed moody followed him 
 
 why does hagrid want me to meet him at midnight harry said very surprised 
 
 does he said hermione looking startled i wonder what up to i know whether you should go harry she looked nervously around and hissed it might make you late for sirius 
 
 it was true that going down to at midnight would mean cutting his meeting with sirius very fine indeed hermione suggested sending hedwig down to to tell him he go always assuming she would consent to take the note of course harry however thought it better just to be quick at whatever hagrid wanted him for he was very curious to know what this might be hagrid had never asked harry to visit him so late at night 
 
 at half past eleven that evening harry who had pretended to go up to bed early pulled the invisibility cloak back over himself and crept back downstairs through the common room quite a few people were still in there the creevey brothers had managed to get hold of a stack of support cedric diggory badges and were trying to bewitch them to make them say support harry potter instead so far however all they had managed to do was get the badges stuck on potter stinks harry crept past them to the portrait hole and waited for a minute or so keeping an eye on his watch then hermione opened the fat lady for him from outside as they had planned he slipped past her with a whispered thanks and set off through the castle 
 
 the grounds were very dark harry walked down the lawn toward the lights shining in cabin the inside of the enormous beauxbatons carriage was also lit up harry could hear madame maxime talking inside it as he knocked on front door 
 
 you there harry hagrid whispered opening the door and looking around 
 
 yeah said harry slipping inside the cabin and pulling the cloak down off his head up 
 
 got summat ter show yeh said hagrid 
 
 there was an air of enormous excitement about hagrid he was wearing a flower that resembled an oversized artichoke in his buttonhole it looked as though he had abandoned the use of axle grease but he had certainly attempted to comb his hair harry could see the broken teeth tangled in it 
 
 you showing me harry said warily wondering if the skrewts had laid eggs or hagrid had managed to buy another giant dog off a stranger in a pub 
 
 come with me keep quiet an keep yerself covered with that cloak said hagrid we won take fang he won like it 
 
 listen hagrid i stay got to be back up at the castle by one 
 
 but hagrid listening he was opening the cabin door and striding off into the night harry hurried to follow and found to his great surprise that hagrid was leading him to the beauxbatons carriage 
 
 hagrid what 
 
 shhh said hagrid and he knocked three times on the door bearing the crossed golden wands 
 
 madame maxime opened it she was wearing a silk shawl wrapped around her massive shoulders she smiled when she saw hagrid 
 
 ah agridit is time 
 
 said hagrid beaming at her and holding out a hand to help her down the golden steps 
 
 madame maxime closed the door behind her hagrid offered her his arm and they set off around the edge of the paddock containing madame giant winged horses with harry totally bewildered running to keep up with them had hagrid wanted to show him madame maxime he could see her any old time he wantedshe exactly hard to miss 
 
 but it seemed that madame maxime was in for the same treat as harry because after a while she said playfully wair is it you are taking me agrid 
 
 enjoy this said hagrid gruffly worth seein trust me don go tellin anyone i showed yeh right not ter know 
 
 of course not said madame maxime fluttering her long black eyelashes 
 
 and still they walked harry getting more and more irritated as he jogged along in their wake checking his watch every now and then hagrid had some harebrained scheme in hand which might make him miss sirius if they get there soon he was going to turn around go straight back to the castle and leave hagrid to enjoy his moonlit stroll with madame maxime 
 
 but then when they had walked so far around the perimeter of the forest that the castle and the lake were out of sight harry heard something men were shouting up aheadthen came a deafening earsplitting roar 
 
 hagrid led madame maxime around a clump of trees and came to a halt harry hurried up alongside them for a split second he thought he was seeing bonfires and men darting around them and then his mouth fell open 
 
 dragons 
 
 four fully grown enormous dragons were rearing onto their hind legs inside an enclosure fenced with thick planks of wood roaring and snorting torrents of fire were shooting into the dark sky from their open fanged mouths fifty feet above the ground on their outstretched necks there was a one with long pointed horns snapping and snarling at the wizards on the ground a green one which was writhing and stamping with all its might a red one with an odd fringe of fine gold spikes around its face which was shooting fire clouds into the air and a gigantic black one more than the others which was nearest to them 
 
 at least thirty wizards seven or eight to each dragon were attempting to control them pulling on the chains connected to heavy leather straps around their necks and legs mesmerized harry looked up high above him and saw the eyes of the black dragon with vertical pupils like a bulging with either fear or rage he tell was making a horrible noise a yowling screeching scream 
 
 keep back there hagrid yelled a wizard near the fence straining on the chain he was holding they can shoot fire at a range of twenty feet you know seen this horntail do forty 
 
 it beautiful said hagrid softly 
 
 no good yelled another wizard stunning spells on the count of three 
 
 harry saw each of the dragon keepers pull out his wand 
 
 stupefy they shouted in unison and the stunning spells shot into the darkness like fiery rockets bursting in showers of stars on the dragons scaly hides 
 
 harry watched the dragon nearest to them teeter dangerously on its back legs its jaws stretched wide in a silent howl its nostrils were suddenly devoid of flame though still smoking then very slowly it fell several tons of sinewy dragon hit the ground with a thud that harry could have sworn made the trees behind him quake 
 
 the dragon keepers lowered their wands and walked forward to their fallen charges each of which was the size of a small hill they hurried to tighten the chains and fasten them securely to iron pegs which they forced deep into the ground with their wands 
 
 wan a closer look hagrid asked madame maxime excitedly the pair of them moved right up to the fence and harry followed the wizard who had warned hagrid not to come any closer turned and harry realized who it was charlie weasley 
 
 all right hagrid he panted coming over to talk they should be okay now we put them out with a sleeping draft on the way here thought it might be better for them to wake up in the dark and the quiet but like you saw they happy not happy at all 
 
 what breeds you got here charlie said hagrid gazing at the closest dragon the black one with something chose to reverence its eyes were still just open harry could see a strip of gleaming yellow beneath its wrinkled black eyelid 
 
 this is a hungarian horntail said charlie a common welsh green over there the smaller one a swedish that and a chinese fireball the red 
 
 charlie looked around madame maxime was strolling away around the edge of the enclosure gazing at the stunned dragons 
 
 i know you were bringing her hagrid charlie said frowning the champions supposed to know coming bound to tell her student she 
 
 jus thought like ter see em shrugged hagrid still gazing enraptured at the dragons 
 
 really romantic date hagrid said charlie shaking his head 
 
 four said hagrid so one fer each o the champions is it they gotta do fight em 
 
 just get past them i think said charlie be on hand if it gets nasty extinguishing spells at the ready they wanted nesting mothers i know whybut i tell you this i envy the one who gets the horntail vicious thing its back as dangerous as its front look 
 
 charlie pointed toward the tail and harry saw long spikes protruding along it every few inches 
 
 five of fellow keepers staggered up to the horntail at that moment carrying a clutch of huge eggs between them in a blanket they placed them carefully at the side hagrid let out a moan of longing 
 
 got them counted hagrid said charlie sternly then he said harry 
 
 fine said hagrid he was still gazing at the eggs 
 
 just hope still fine after faced this lot said charlie grimly looking out over the dragons enclosure i dare tell mum what got to do for the first task already having kittens about him charlie imitated his anxious voice how could they let him enter that tournament much too young i thought they were all safe i thought there was going to be an age limit she was in floods after that daily prophet article about him he still cries about his parents oh bless him i never knew 
 
 harry had had enough trusting to the fact that hagrid miss him with the attractions of four dragons and madame maxime to occupy him he turned silently and began to walk away back to the castle 
 
 he know whether he was glad seen what was coming or not perhaps this way was better the first shock was over now maybe if seen the dragons for the first time on tuesday he would have passed out cold in front of the whole schoolbut maybe he would was going to be armed with his wand which just now felt like nothing more than a narrow strip of wood against a scaly dragon and he had to get past it with everyone watching how 
 
 harry sped up skirting the edge of the forest he had just under fifteen minutes to get back to the fireside and talk to sirius and he remember ever wanting to talk to someone more than he did right now when without warning he ran into something very solid 
 
 harry fell backward his glasses askew clutching the cloak around him a voice nearby said ouch there 
 
 harry hastily checked that the cloak was covering him and hay very still staring up at the dark outline of the wizard he had hit he recognized the goateeit was karkaroff 
 
 there said karkaroff again very suspiciously looking around in the darkness harry remained still and silent after a minute or so karkaroff seemed to decide that he had hit some sort of animal he was looking around at waist height as though expecting to see a dog then he crept back under the cover of the trees and started to edge forward toward the place where the dragons were 
 
 very slowly and very carefully harry got to his feet and set off again as fast as he could without making too much noise hurrying through the darkness back toward hogwarts 
 
 he had no doubt whatsoever what karkaroff was up to he had sneaked off his ship to try and find out what the first task was going to be he might even have spotted hagrid and madame maxime heading off around the forest together they were hardly difficult to spot at a distanceand now all karkaroff had to do was follow the sound of voices and he like madame maxime would know what was in store for the champions 
 
 by the looks of it the only champion who would be facing the unknown on tuesday was cedric 
 
 harry reached the castle slipped in through the front doors and began to climb the marble stairs he was very out of breath but he dare slow had less than five minutes to get up to the fire 
 
 balderdash he gasped at the fat lady who was snoozing in her frame in front of the portrait hole 
 
 if you say so she muttered sleepily without opening her eyes and the picture swung forward to admit him harry climbed inside the common room was deserted and judging by the fact that it smelled quite normal hermione had not needed to set off any dungbombs to ensure that he and sirius got privacy 
 
 harry pulled off the invisibility cloak and threw himself into an armchair in front of the fire the room was in semidarkness the flames were the only source of light nearby on a table the support cedric diggory badges the creeveys had been trying to improve were glinting in the firelight they now read potter really stinks harry looked back into the flames and jumped 
 
 head was sitting in the fire if harry seen mr diggory do exactly this back in the weasleys kitchen it would have scared him out of his wits instead his face breaking into the first smile he had worn for days he scrambled out of his chair crouched down by the hearth and said sirius you doing 
 
 sirius looked different from memory of him when they had said face had been gaunt and sunken surrounded by a quantity of long black matted hair but the hair was short and clean now face was fuller and he looked younger much more like the only photograph harry had of him which had been taken at the potters wedding 
 
 never mind me how are you said sirius seriously 
 
 for a second harry tried to say fine but he do it before he could stop himself he was talking more than talked in days about how no one believed he entered the tournament of his own free will how rita skeeter had lied about him in the daily prophet how he walk down a corridor without being sneered at and about ron ron not believing him jealousy 
 
 and now just shown me coming in the first task and dragons sirius and a goner he finished desperately 
 
 sirius looked at him eyes full of concern eyes that had not yet lost the look that azkaban had given them that deadened haunted look he had let harry talk himself into silence without interruption but now he said dragons we can deal with harry but get to that in a minute i got long broken into a wizarding house to use the fire but they could be back at any time there are things i need to warn you about 
 
 what said harry feeling his spirits slip a further few there could be nothing worse than dragons coming 
 
 karkaroff said sirius harry he was a death eater you know what death eaters are you 
 
 yes he what 
 
 he was caught he was in azkaban with me but he got released bet everything why dumbledore wanted an auror at hogwarts this year to keep an eye on him moody caught karkaroff put him into azkaban in the first place 
 
 karkaroff got released harry said slowly his brain seemed to be struggling to absorb yet another piece of shocking information why did they release him 
 
 he did a deal with the ministry of magic said sirius bitterly he said seen the error of his ways and then he named nameshe put a load of other people into azkaban in his not very popular in there i can tell you and since he got out from what i can tell been teaching the dark arts to every student who passes through that school of his so watch out for the durmstrang champion as well 
 
 okay said harry slowly butare you saying karkaroff put my name in the goblet because if he did a really good actor he seemed furious about it he wanted to stop me from competing 
 
 we know a good actor said sirius because he convinced the ministry of magic to set him free he now been keeping an eye on the daily prophet harry 
 
 you and the rest of the world said harry bitterly 
 
 and reading between the lines of that skeeter article last month moody was attacked the night before he started at hogwarts yes i know she says it was another false alarm sirius said hastily seeing harry about to speak but i think so somehow i think someone tried to stop him from getting to hogwarts i think someone knew their job would be a lot more difficult with him around and no going to look into it too closely heard intruders a bit too often but that mean he still spot the real thing moody was the best auror the ministry ever had 
 
 sowhat are you saying said harry slowly trying to kill me but why 
 
 sirius hesitated 
 
 been nearing some very strange things he said slowly the death eaters seem to be a bit more active than usual lately they showed themselves at the quidditch world cup they someone set off the dark markand then did you hear about that ministry of magic witch gone missing 
 
 bertha jorkins said harry 
 
 exactlyshe disappeared in albania and definitely where voldemort was rumored to be lastand she would have known the triwizard tournament was coming up she 
 
 yeah not very likely have walked straight into voldemort is it said harry 
 
 listen i knew bertha jorkins said sirius grimly she was at hogwarts when i was a few years above your dad and me and she was an idiot very nosy but no brains none at all not a good combination harry say be very easy to lure into a trap 
 
 soso voldemort could have found out about the tournament said harry is that what you mean you think karkaroff might be here on his orders 
 
 i know said sirius slowly i just knowkarkaroff strike me as the type go back to voldemort unless he knew voldemort was powerful enough to protect him but whoever put your name in that goblet did it for a reason and i help thinking the tournament would be a very good way to attack you and make it hook like an accident 
 
 looks hike a really good plan from where standing said harry grinning bleaky just have to stand back and let the dragons do their stuff 
 
 right these dragons said sirius speaking very quickly now a way harry be tempted to try a stunning spell dragons are strong and too powerfully magical to be knocked out by a single stunner you need about half a dozen wizards at a time to overcome a dragon 
 
 yeah i know i just saw said harry 
 
 but you can do it alone said sirius there is away and a simple all you need just 
 
 but harry held up a hand to silence him his heart suddenly pounding as though it would burst he could hear footsteps coming down the spiral staircase behind him 
 
 go he hissed at sirius go someone coming 
 
 harry scrambled to his feet hiding the fire if someone saw face within the walls of hogwarts they would raise an almighty uproar the ministry would get dragged in he harry would be questioned about whereabouts 
 
 harry heard a tiny pop in the fire behind him and knew sirius had gone he watched the bottom of the spiral staircase who had decided to go for a stroll at one in the morning and stopped sirius from telling him how to get past a dragon 
 
 it was ron dressed in his maroon paisley pajamas ron stopped dead facing harry across the room and looked around 
 
 who were you talking to he said 
 
 that got to do with you harry snarled what are you doing down here at this time of night 
 
 i just wondered where you ron broke off shrugging nothing going back to bed 
 
 just thought come nosing around did you harry shouted he knew that ron had no idea what walked in on knew he done it on purpose but he care at this moment he hated everything about ron right down to the several inches of bare ankle showing beneath his pajama trousers 
 
 sorry about that said ron his face reddening with anger realized you want to be disturbed let you get on with practicing for your next interview in peace 
 
 harry seized one of the potter really stinks badges off the table and chucked it as hard as he could across the room it hit ron on the forehead and bounced off 
 
 there you go harry said something for you to wear on tuesday you might even have a scar now if what you want it 
 
 he strode across the room toward the stairs he half expected ron to stop him he would even have liked ron to throw a punch at him but ron just stood there in his pajamas and harry having stormed upstairs lay awake in bed fuming for a long time afterward and hear him come up to bed

lionfish nov chapter nineteen the lion and the serpentcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry felt as though he were carrying some kind of talisman inside his chest over the following two weeks a glowing secret that supported him through classes and even made it possible for him to smile blandly as he looked into her horrible bulging eyes he and the da were resisting her under her very nose doing the very thing she and the ministry most feared and whenever he was supposed to be reading wilbert book during her lessons he dwelled instead on satisfying memories of their most recent meetings remembering how neville had successfully disarmed hermione how colin creevey had mastered the impediment jinx after three meetings hard effort how parvati patil had produced such a good reductor curse that she had reduced the table carrying all the sneakoscopes to dust 
 
 he was finding it almost impossible to fix a regular night of the week for the da meetings as they had to accommodate three separate quidditch practices which were often rearranged due to bad weather conditions but harry was not sorry about this he had a feeling that it was probably better to keep the timing of their meetings unpredictable if anyone was watching them it would be hard to make out a pattern 
 
 hermione soon devised a very clever method of communicating the time and date of the next meeting to all the members in case they needed to change it at short notice because it would look suspicious if people from different houses were seen crossing the great hall to talk to each other too often she gave each of the members of the da a fake galleon ron became very excited when he first saw the basket and was convinced she was actually giving out gold 
 
 you see the numerals around the edge of the coins hermione said holding one up for examination at the end of their fourth meeting the coin gleamed fat and yellow in the light from the torches on real galleons just a serial number referring to the goblin who cast the coin on these fake coins though the numbers will change to reflect the time and date of the next meeting the coins will grow hot when the date changes so if carrying them in a pocket be able to feel them we take one each and when harry sets the date of the next meeting change the numbers on his coin and because put a protean charm on them all change to mimic his 
 
 a blank silence greeted words she looked around at all the faces upturned to her rather disconcerted 
 
 welli thought it was a good idea she said uncertainly i mean even if umbridge asked us to turn out our pockets nothing fishy about carrying a galleon is there but well if you want to use them 
 
 you can do a protean charm said terry boot 
 
 yes said hermione 
 
 but newt standard that is he said weakly 
 
 oh said hermione trying to look modest oh well yes i suppose it is 
 
 how come not in ravenclaw he demanded staring at hermione with something close to wonder with brains like yours 
 
 well the sorting hat did seriously consider putting me in ravenclaw during my sorting said hermione brightly but it decided on gryffindor in the end so does that mean using the galleons 
 
 there was a murmur of assent and everybody moved forwards to collect one from the basket harry looked sideways at hermione 
 
 you know what these remind me of 
 
 no that 
 
 the death eaters scars voldemort touches one of them and all their scars burn and they know got to join him 
 
 well yes said hermione quietly that is where i got the idea but notice i decided to engrave the date on bits of metal rather than on our members skin 
 
 yeah i prefer your way said harry grinning as he slipped his galleon into his pocket i suppose the only danger with these is that we might accidentally spend them 
 
 fat chance said ron who was examining his own fake galleon with a slightly mournful air i got any real galleons to confuse it with 
 
 as the first quidditch match of the season gryffindor versus slytherin drew nearer their da meetings were put on hold because angelina insisted on almost daily practices the fact that the quidditch cup had not been held for so long added considerably to the interest and excitement surrounding the forthcoming game the ravenclaws and hufflepuffs were taking a lively interest in the outcome for they of course would be playing both teams over the coming year and the heads of house of the competing teams though they attempted to disguise it under a decent pretence of sportsmanship were determined to see their own side victorious harry realised how much professor mcgonagall cared about beating slytherin when she abstained from giving them homework in the week leading up to the match 
 
 i think got enough to be getting on with at the moment she said loftily nobody could quite believe their ears until she looked directly at harry and ron and said grimly become accustomed to seeing the quidditch cup in my study boys and i really want to have to hand it over to professor snape so use the extra time to practise you 
 
 snape was no less obviously partisan he had booked the quidditch pitch for slytherin practice so often that the gryffindors had difficulty getting on it to play he was also turning a deaf ear to the many reports of slytherin attempts to hex gryffindor players in the corridors when alicia spinnet turned up in the hospital wing with her eyebrows growing so thick and fast they obscured her vision and obstructed her mouth snape insisted that she must have attempted a charm on herself and refused to listen to the fourteen who insisted they had seen the slytherin keeper miles bletchley hit her from behind with a jinx while she worked in the library 
 
 harry felt optimistic about gryffindors chances they had after all never lost to team admittedly ron was still not performing to standard but he was working extremely hard to improve his greatest weakness was a tendency to lose confidence after made a blunder if he let in one goal he became flustered and was therefore likely to miss more on the other hand harry had seen ron make some truly spectacular saves when he was on form during one memorable practice he had hung from his broom and kicked the quaffle so hard away from the goalhoop that it soared the length of the pitch and through the centre hoop at the other end the rest of the team felt this save compared favourably with one made recently by barry ryan the irish international keeper against top chaser ladislaw zamojski even fred had said that ron might yet make him and george proud and that they were seriously considering admitting he was related to them something they assured him they had been trying to deny for four years 
 
 the only thing really worrying harry was how much ron was allowing the tactics of the slytherin team to upset him before they even got on to the pitch harry of course had endured their snide comments for over four years so whispers of hey potty i heard sworn to knock you off your broom on saturday far from chilling his blood made him laugh so pathetic be more worried if he was aiming for the person next to me he retorted which made ron and hermione laugh and wiped the smirk off pansy face 
 
 but ron had never endured a relentless campaign of insults jeers and intimidation when slytherins some of them and considerably larger than he was muttered as they passed in the corridors got your bed booked in the hospital wing weasley he laugh but turned a delicate shade of green when draco malfoy imitated ron dropping the quaffle which he did whenever they came within sight of each other ears glowed red and his hands shook so badly that he was likely to drop whatever he was holding at the time too 
 
 october extinguished itself in a rush of howling winds and driving rain and november arrived cold as frozen iron with hard frosts every morning and icy draughts that bit at exposed hands and faces the skies and the ceiling of the great hall turned a pale pearly grey the mountains around hogwarts were snowcapped and the temperature in the castle dropped so low that many students wore their thick protective dragonskin gloves in the corridors between lessons 
 
 the morning of the match dawned bright and cold when harry awoke he looked round at bed and saw him sitting bolt upright his arms around his knees staring fixedly into space 
 
 you all right said harry 
 
 ron nodded but did not speak harry was reminded forcibly of the time ron had accidentally put a charm on himself he looked just as pale and sweaty as he had done then not to mention as reluctant to open his mouth 
 
 you just need some breakfast harry said bracingly 
 
 the great hall was filling up fast when they arrived the talk louder and the mood more exuberant than usual as they passed the slytherin table there was an upsurge of noise harry looked round and saw that in addition to the usual green and silver scarves and hats every one of them was wearing a silver badge in the shape of what seemed to be a crown for some reason many of them waved at ron laughing uproariously harry tried to see what was written on the badges as he walked by but he was too concerned to get ron past their table quickly to linger long enough to read them 
 
 they received a rousing welcome at the gryffindor table where everyone was wearing red and gold but far from raising spirits the cheers seemed to sap the last of his morale he collapsed on to the nearest bench looking as though he were facing his final meal 
 
 i been mental to do this he said in a croaky whisper mental 
 
 be thick said harry firmly passing him a choice of cereals going to be fine normal to be nervous 
 
 rubbish croaked ron lousy i play to save my life what was i thinking 
 
 get a grip said harry sternly look at that save you made with your foot the other day even fred and george said it was brilliant 
 
 ron turned a tortured face to harry 
 
 that was an accident he whispered miserably i mean to do iti slipped off my broom when none of you were looking and when i was trying to get back on i kicked the quaffle by accident 
 
 well said harry recovering quickly from this unpleasant surprise a few more accidents like that and the in the bag it 
 
 hermione and ginny sat down opposite them wearing red and gold scarves gloves and rosettes 
 
 you feeling ginny asked ron who was now staring into the dregs of milk at the bottom of his empty cereal bowl as though seriously considering attempting to drown himself in them 
 
 just nervous said harry 
 
 well a good sign i never feel you perform as well in exams if not a bit nervous said hermione heartily 
 
 hello said a vague and dreamy voice from behind them harry looked up luna lovegood had drifted over from the ravenclaw table many people were staring at her and a few were openly laughing and pointing she had managed to procure a hat shaped like a head which was perched precariously on her head 
 
 supporting gryffindor said luna pointing unnecessarily at her hat look what it does 
 
 she reached up and tapped the hat with her wand it opened its mouth wide and gave an extremely realistic roar that made everyone in the vicinity jump 
 
 good it said luna happily i wanted to have it chewing up a serpent to represent slytherin you know but there time anyway good luck ronald 
 
 she drifted away they had not quite recovered from the shock of hat before angelina came hurrying towards them accompanied by katie and alicia whose eyebrows had mercifully been returned to normal by madam pomfrey 
 
 when ready she said going to go straight down to the pitch check out conditions and change 
 
 be there in a bit harry assured her just got to have some breakfast 
 
 it became clear after ten minutes however that ron was not capable of eating anything more and harry thought it best to get him down to the changing rooms as they rose from the table hermione got up too and taking arm she drew him to one side 
 
 let ron see on those slytherins badges she whispered urgently 
 
 harry looked questioningly at her but she shook her head warningly ron had just ambled over to them looking lost and desperate 
 
 good luck ron said hermione standing on tiptoe and kissing him on the cheek and you harry 
 
 ron seemed to come to himself slightly as they walked back across the great hall he touched the spot on his face where hermione had kissed him looking puzzled as though he was not quite sure what had just happened he seemed too distracted to notice much around him but harry cast a curious glance at the badges as they passed the slytherin table and this time he made out the words etched on to them 
 
 weasley is our king 
 
 with an unpleasant feeling that this could mean nothing good he hurried ron across the entrance hall clown the stone steps and out into the icy air 
 
 the frosty grass crunched under their feet as they hurried down the sloping lawns towards the stadium there was no wind at all and the sky was a uniform pearly white which meant that visibility would be good without the drawback of direct sunlight in the eyes harry pointed out these encouraging factors to ron as they walked but he was not sure that ron was listening 
 
 angelina had changed already and was talking to the rest of the team when they entered harry and ron pulled on their robes ron attempted to do his up for several minutes before alicia took pity on him and went to help then sat down to listen to the talk while the babble of voices outside grew steadily louder as the crowd came pouring out of the castle towards the pitch 
 
 ok only just found out the final for slytherin said angelina consulting a piece of parchment last beaters derrick and bole have left but it looks as though replaced them with the usual gorillas rather than anyone who can fly particularly well two blokes called crabbe and goyle i know much about them 
 
 we do said harry and ron together 
 
 well they look bright enough to tell one end of a broom from the other said angelina pocketing her parchment but then i was always surprised derrick and bole managed to find their way on to the pitch without signposts 
 
 crabbe and goyle are in the same mould harry assured her 
 
 they could hear hundreds of footsteps mounting the banked benches of the spectators stands some people were singing though harry could not make out the words he was starting to feel nervous but he knew his butterflies were as nothing compared to who was clutching his stomach and staring straight ahead again his jaw set and his complexion pale grey 
 
 time said angelina in a hushed voice looking at her watch everyone good luck 
 
 the team rose shouldered their brooms and marched in single file out of the changing room and into the dazzling sunlight a roar of sound greeted them in which harry could still hear singing though it was muffled by the cheers and whistles 
 
 the slytherin team was standing waiting for them they too were wearing those silver badges the new captain montague was built along the same lines as dudley dursley with massive forearms like hairy hams behind him lurked crabbe and goyle almost as large blinking stupidly in the sunlight swinging their new beaters bats malfoy stood to one side the sunlight gleaming on his head he caught eye and smirked tapping the badge on his chest 
 
 captains shake hands ordered the referee madam hooch as angelina and montague reached each other harry could tell that montague was trying to crush fingers though she did not wince mount your brooms 
 
 madam hooch placed her whistle in her mouth and blew 
 
 the balls were released and the fourteen players shot upwards out of the corner of his eye harry saw ron streak off towards the goalhoops harry zoomed higher dodging a bludger and set off on a wide lap of the pitch gazing around for a glint of gold on the other side of the stadium draco malfoy was doing exactly the same 
 
 and johnson johnson with the quaffle what a player that girl is been saying it for years but she still go out with me 
 
 jordan yelled professor mcgonagall 
 
 just a fun fact professor adds a bit of interestand ducked warrington passed montague hit from behind by a bludger from crabbe montague catches the quaffle montague heading back up the pitch andnice bludger there from george weasley a bludger to the head for montague he drops the quaffle caught by katie bell katie bell of gryffindor to alicia spinnet and away 
 
 lee commentary rang through the stadium and harry listened as hard as he could through the wind whistling in his ears and the din of the crowd all yelling and booing and singing 
 
 dodges warrington avoids a bludgerclose call aliciaand the crowd are loving this just listen to them that singing 
 
 and as lee paused to listen the song rose loud and clear from the sea of green and silver in the slytherin section of the stands 
 
 
 
 weasley cannot save a thing 
 
 he cannot block a single ring 
 
 why slytherins all sing 
 
 weasley is our king 
 
 
 weasley was born in a bin 
 
 he always lets the quaffle in 
 
 weasley will make sure we win 
 
 weasley is our king 
 
 a nd alicia passes back to angelina lee shouted and as harry swerved his insides boiling at what he had just heard he knew lee was trying to drown out the words of the song come on now angelinalooks like got just the keeper to shootssheaaaah 
 
 bletchley the slytherin keeper had saved the goal he threw the quaffle to warrington who sped off with it in between alicia and katie the singing from below grew louder and louder as he drew nearer and nearer ron 
 
 weasley is our king 
 
 weasley is our king 
 
 he always lets the quaffle in 
 
 weasley is our king 
 
 harry could not help himself abandoning his search for the snitch he wheeled around to watch ron a lone figure at the far end of the pitch hovering before the three goalhoops while the massive warrington pelted towards him 
 
 and warrington with the quaffle warrington heading for goal out of bludger range with just the keeper ahead 
 
 a great swell of song rose from the slytherin stands below 
 
 weasley cannot save a thing 
 
 he cannot block a single ring 
 
 
 
 so the first test for new gryffindor keeper weasley brother of beaters fred and george and a promising new talent on the teamcome on ron 
 
 but the scream of delight came from the slytherins end ron had dived wildly his arms wide and the quaffle had soared between them straight through central hoop 
 
 slytherin score came voice amid the cheering and booing from the crowds below so to slytherinbad luck ron 
 
 the slytherins sang even louder 
 
 weasley was born in a bin 
 
 he always lets the quaffle in 
 
 and gryffindor back in possession and katie bell tanking up the pitch cried lee valiantly though the singing was now so deafening that he could hardly make himself heard above it 
 
 weasley will make sure we win 
 
 weasley is our king 
 
 
 
 harry what are you doing screamed angelina soaring past him to keep up with katie get going 
 
 harry realised he had been stationary in midair for over a minute watching the progress of the match without sparing a thought for the whereabouts of the snitch horrified he went into a dive and started circling the pitch again staring around trying to ignore the chorus now thundering through the stadium 
 
 weasley is our king 
 
 weasley is our king 
 
 there was no sign of the snitch anywhere he looked malfoy was still circling the stadium just as he was they passed one another midway around the pitch going in opposite directions and harry heard malfoy singing loudly 
 
 weasley was born in a bin 
 
 
 
 and warrington again bellowed lee who passes to pucey off past spinnet come on now angelina you can take him turns out you nice bludger from fred weasley i mean george weasley oh who cares one of them anyway and warrington drops the quaffle and katie bellerdrops it tooso montague with the quaffle slytherin captain montague takes the quaffle and off up the pitch come on now gryffindor block him 
 
 harry zoomed around the end of the stadium behind the slytherin goalhoops willing himself not to look at what was going on at end as he sped past the slytherin keeper he heard bletchley singing along with the crowd below 
 
 weasley cannot save a thing 
 
 and dodged alicia again and heading straight for goal stop it ron 
 
 harry did not have to look to see what had happened there was a terrible groan from the gryffindor end coupled with fresh screams and applause from the slytherins looking down harry saw the pansy parkinson right at the front of the stands her back to the pitch as she conducted the slytherin supporters who were roaring 
 
 why slytherins all sing 
 
 weasley is our king 
 
 but was nothing there was still time for gryffindor to catch up or catch the snitch a few goals and they would be in the lead as usual harry assured himself bobbing and weaving through the other players in pursuit of something shiny that turned out to be watchstrap 
 
 but ron let in two more goals there was an edge of panic in desire to find the snitch now if he could just get it soon and finish the game quickly 
 
 and katie bell of gryffindor dodges pucey ducks montague nice swerve katie and she throws to johnson angelina johnson takes the quaffle past warrington heading for goal come on now angelinagryffindor score to slytherin and pucey has the quaffle 
 
 harry could hear ludicrous lion hat roaring amidst the gryffindor cheers and felt heartened only thirty points in it that was nothing they could pull back easily harry ducked a bludger that crabbe had sent rocketing in his direction and resumed his frantic scouring of the pitch for the snitch keeping one eye on malfoy in case he showed signs of having spotted it but malfoy like him was continuing to soar around the stadium searching fruitlessly 
 
 pucey throws to warrington warrington to montague montague back to puceyjohnson intervenes johnson takes the quaffle johnson to bell this looks goodi mean hit by a bludger from goyle of slytherin and pucey in possession again 
 
 weasley was born in a bin 
 
 he always lets the quaffle in 
 
 weasley will make sure we win 
 
 but harry had seen it at last the tiny fluttering golden snitch was hovering feet from the ground at the slytherin end of the pitch 
 
 he dived 
 
 in a matter of seconds malfoy was streaking out of the sky on left a green and silver blur lying flat on his broom 
 
 the snitch skirted the foot of one of the goalhoops and scooted off towards the other side of the stands its change of direction suited malfoy who was nearer harry pulled his firebolt around he and malfoy were now neck and neck 
 
 feet from the ground harry lifted his right hand from his broom stretching towards the snitch to his right arm extended too was reaching groping 
 
 it was over in two breathless desperate windswept fingers closed around the tiny struggling fingernails scrabbled the back of hand hopelesslyharry pulled his broom upwards holding the struggling ball in his hand and the gryffindor spectators screamed their approval 
 
 they were saved it did not matter that ron had let in those goals nobody would remember as long as gryffindor had won 
 
 wham 
 
 a bludger hit harry squarely in the small of the back and he flew forwards off his broom luckily he was only five or six feet above the ground having dived so low to catch the snitch but he was winded all the same as he landed flat on his back on the frozen pitch he heard madam shrill whistle an uproar in the stands compounded of catcalls angry yells and jeering a thud then frantic voice 
 
 are you all right 
 
 course i am said harry grimly taking her hand and allowing her to pull him to his feet madam hooch was zooming towards one of the slytherin players above him though he could not see who it was from this angle 
 
 it was that thug crabbe said angelina angrily he whacked the bludger at you the moment he saw got the snitchbut we won harry we won 
 
 harry heard a snort from behind him and turned around still holding the snitch tightly in his hand draco malfoy had landed close by with fury he was still managing to sneer 
 
 saved neck you he said to harry never seen a worse keeper but then he was born in a bin did you like my lyrics potter 
 
 harry answer he turned away to meet the rest of the team who were now landing one by one yelling and punching the air in triumph all except ron who had dismounted from his broom over by the goalposts and seemed to be making his way slowly back to the changing rooms alone 
 
 we wanted to write another couple of verses malfoy called as katie and alicia hugged harry but we find rhymes for fat and uglywe wanted to sing about his mother see 
 
 talk about sour grapes said angelina casting malfoy a disgusted look 
 
 we fit in useless loser eitherfor his father you know 
 
 fred and george had realised what malfoy was talking about halfway through shaking hand they stiffened looking round at malfoy 
 
 leave it said angelina at once taking fred by the arm leave it fred let him yell just sore he lost the little 
 
 but you like the weasleys you potter said malfoy sneering spend holidays there and everything you see how you stand the stink but i suppose when been dragged up by muggles even the weasleys hovel smells ok 
 
 harry grabbed hold of george meanwhile it was taking the combined efforts of angelina alicia and katie to stop fred leaping on malfoy who was laughing openly harry looked around for madam hooch but she was still berating crabbe for his illegal bludger attack 
 
 or perhaps said malfoy leering as he backed away you can remember what your house stank like potter and pigsty reminds you of it 
 
 harry was not aware of releasing george all he knew was that a second later both of them were sprinting towards malfoy he had completely forgotten that all the teachers were watching all he wanted to do was cause malfoy as much pain as possible with no time to draw out his wand he merely drew back the fist clutching the snitch and sank it as hard as he could into stomach 
 
 harry harry george no 
 
 he could hear girls voices screaming malfoy yelling george swearing a whistle blowing and the bellowing of the crowd around him but he did not care not until somebody in the vicinity yelled impedimenta and he was knocked over backwards by the force of the spell did he abandon the attempt to punch every inch of malfoy he could reach 
 
 what do you think doing screamed madam hooch as harry leapt to his feet it seemed to have been her who had hit him with the impediment jinx she was holding her whistle in one hand and a wand in the other her broom lay abandoned several feet away malfoy was curled up on the ground whimpering and moaning his nose bloody george was sporting a swollen lip fred was still being forcibly restrained by the three chasers and crabbe was cackling in the background never seen behaviour like itback up to the castle both of you and straight to your head of office go now 
 
 harry and george turned on their heels and marched off the pitch both panting neither saying a word to the other the howling and jeering of the crowd grew fainter and fainter until they reached the entrance hall where they could hear nothing except the sound of their own footsteps harry became aware that something was still struggling in his right hand the knuckles of which he had bruised against jaw looking down he saw the silver wings protruding from between his fingers struggling for release 
 
 they had barely reached the door of professor mcgonagalls office when she came marching along the corridor behind them she was wearing a gryffindor scarf but tore it from her throat with shaking hands as she strode towards them looking livid 
 
 in she said furiously pointing to the door harry and george entered she strode around behind her desk and faced them quivering with rage as she threw the gryffindor scarf aside on to the floor 
 
 well she said i have never seen such a disgraceful exhibition two on one explain yourselves 
 
 malfoy provoked us said harry stiffly 
 
 provoked you shouted professor mcgonagall slamming a fist on to her desk so that her tartan tin slid sideways off it and burst open littering the floor with ginger newts just lost he of course he wanted to provoke you but what on earth he can have said that justified what you two 
 
 he insulted my parents snarled george and mother 
 
 but instead of leaving it to madam hooch to sort out you two decided to give an exhibition of muggle duelling did you bellowed professor mcgonagall have you any idea what 
 
 hem hem 
 
 harry and george both wheeled round dolores umbridge was standing in the doorway wrapped in a green tweed cloak that greatly enhanced her resemblance to a giant toad and was smiling in the horrible sickly ominous way that harry had come to associate with imminent misery 
 
 may i help professor mcgonagall asked professor umbridge in her most poisonously sweet voice 
 
 blood rushed into professor face 
 
 help she repeated in a constricted voice what do you mean help 
 
 professor umbridge moved forwards into the office still smiling her sickly smile 
 
 why i thought you might be grateful for a little extra authority 
 
 harry would not have been surprised to see sparks fly from professor nostrils 
 
 you thought wrong she said turning her back on umbridge 
 
 now you two had better listen closely i do not care what provocation malfoy offered you i do not care if he insulted every family member you possess your behaviour was disgusting and i am giving each of you a worth of detentions do not look at me like that potter you deserve it and if either of you ever 
 
 hem hem 
 
 professor mcgonagall closed her eyes as though praying for patience as she turned her face towards professor umbridge again 
 
 yes 
 
 i think they deserve rather more than detentions said umbridge smiling still more broadly 
 
 professor eyes flew open 
 
 but unfortunately she said with an attempt at a reciprocal smile that made her look as though she had lockjaw it is what i think that counts as they are in my house dolores 
 
 well actually minerva simpered professor umbridge i think find that what i think does count now where is it cornelius just sent it i mean she gave a false little laugh as she rummaged in her handbag the minister just sent it ah yes 
 
 she had pulled out a piece of parchment which she now unfurled clearing her throat fussily before starting to read what it said 
 
 hem hem educational decree number 
 
 not another one exclaimed professor mcgonagall violently 
 
 well yes said umbridge still smiling as a matter of fact minerva it was you who made me see that we needed a further amendment you remember how you overrode me when i was unwilling to allow the gryffindor quidditch team to how you took the case to dumbledore who insisted that the team be allowed to play well now i have that i contacted the minister at once and he quite agreed with me that the high inquisitor has to have the power to strip pupils of privileges or shethat is to say iwould have less authority than common teachers and you see now you minerva how right i was in attempting to stop the gryffindor team dreadful tempers anyway i was reading out our amendment hem hem the high inquisitor will henceforth have supreme authority over all punishments sanctions and removal of privileges pertaining to the students of hogwarts and the power to alter such punishments sanctions and removals of privileges as may have been ordered by other staff members signed cornelius fudge minister for magic order of merlin first class etc etc 
 
 she rolled up the parchment and put it back into her handbag still smiling 
 
 so i really think i will have to ban these two from playing quidditch ever again she said looking from harry to george and back again 
 
 harry felt the snitch fluttering madly in his hand 
 
 ban us he said and his voice sounded strangely distant from playing ever again 
 
 yes mr potter i think a lifelong ban ought to do the trick said umbridge her smile widening still further as she watched him struggle to comprehend what she had said you and mr weasley here and i think to be safe this young twin ought to be stopped tooif his teammates had not restrained him i feel sure he would have attacked young mr malfoy as well i will want their broomsticks confiscated of course i shall keep them safely in my office to make sure there is no infringement of my ban but i am not unreasonable professor mcgonagall she continued turning back to professor mcgonagall who was now standing as still as though carved from ice staring at her the rest of the team can continue playing i saw no signs of violence from any of them well good afternoon to you 
 
 and with a look of the utmost satisfaction umbridge left the room leaving a horrified silence in her wake 
 
 banned said angelina in a hollow voice late that evening in the common room seeker and no beaters what on earth are we going to do 
 
 it did not feel as though they had won the match at all everywhere harry looked there were disconsolate and angry faces the team themselves were slumped around the fire all apart from ron who had not been seen since the end of the match 
 
 just so unfair said alicia numbly i mean what about crabbe and that bludger he hit after the whistle had been blown has she banned him 
 
 no said ginny miserably she and hermione were sitting on either side of harry he just got lines i heard montague laughing about it at dinner 
 
 and banning fred when he even do anything said alicia furiously pummelling her knee with her fist 
 
 not my fault i said fred with a very ugly look on his face i pounded the little scumbag to a pulp if you three been holding me back 
 
 harry stared miserably at the dark window snow was falling the snitch he had caught earlier was now zooming around and around the common room people were watching its progress as though hypnotised and crookshanks was leaping from chair to chair trying to catch it 
 
 going to bed said angelina getting slowly to her feet maybe this will all turn out to have been a bad dream maybe wake up tomorrow and find we played yet 
 
 she was soon followed by alicia and katie fred and george sloped off to bed some time later glowering at everyone they passed and ginny went not long after that only harry and hermione were left beside the fire 
 
 have you seen ron hermione asked in a low voice 
 
 harry shook his head 
 
 i think avoiding us said hermione where do you think he 
 
 but at that precise moment there was a creaking sound behind them as the fat lady swung forwards and ron came clambering through the portrait hole he was very pale indeed and there was snow in his hair when he saw harry and hermione he stopped dead in his tracks 
 
 where have you been said hermione anxiously springing up 
 
 walking ron mumbled he was still wearing his quidditch things 
 
 you look frozen said hermione come and sit down 
 
 ron walked to the fireside and sank into the chair furthest from not looking at him the stolen snitch zoomed over their heads 
 
 sorry ron mumbled looking at his feet 
 
 what for said harry 
 
 for thinking i can play quidditch said ron going to resign first thing tomorrow 
 
 if you resign said harry testily only be three players left on the team and when ron looked puzzled he said been given a lifetime ban fred and george 
 
 what ron yelped 
 
 hermione told him the full story harry could not bear to tell it again when she had finished ron looked more anguished than ever 
 
 this is all my fault 
 
 you make me punch malfoy said harry angrily 
 
 if i so terrible at quidditch 
 
 got nothing to do with that 
 
 it was that song that wound me up 
 
 it wound anyone up 
 
 hermione got up and walked to the window away from the argument watching the snow swirling down against the pane 
 
 look drop it will you harry burst out bad enough without you blaming yourself for everything 
 
 ron said nothing but sat gazing miserably at the damp hem of his robes after a while he said in a dull voice this is the worst ever felt in my life 
 
 join the club said harry bitterly 
 
 well said hermione her voice trembling slightly i can think of one thing that might cheer you both up 
 
 oh yeah said harry sceptically 
 
 yeah said hermione turning away from the window a broad smile spreading across her face back 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter nineteen elf tailscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 so all in all not one of better birthdays said fred 
 
 it was evening the hospital wing was quiet the windows curtained the lamps lit was the only occupied bed harry hermione and ginny were sitting around him they had spent all day waiting outside the double doors trying to see inside whenever somebody went in or out madam pomfrey had only let them enter at eight fred and george had arrived at ten past 
 
 this how we imagined handing over our present said george grimly putting down a large wrapped gift on bedside cabinet and sitting beside ginny 
 
 yeah when we pictured the scene he was conscious said fred 
 
 there we were in hogsmeade waiting to surprise him said george 
 
 you were in hogsmeade asked ginny looking up 
 
 we were thinking of buying said fred gloomily a hogsmeade branch you know but a fat lot of good do us if you lot allowed out at weekends to buy our stuff anymore but never mind that now 
 
 he drew up a chair beside harry and looked at pale face 
 
 how exactly did it happen harry 
 
 harry retold the story he had already recounted it felt like a hundred times to dumbledore to mcgonagall to madam pomfrey to hermione and to ginny 
 
 and then i got the bezoar down his throat and his breathing eased up a bit slughorn ran for help mcgonagall and madam pomfrey turned up and they brought ron up here they reckon be all right madam pomfrey says have to stay here a week or so keep taking essence of rue 
 
 blimey it was lucky you thought of a bezoar said george in a low voice 
 
 lucky there was one in the room said harry who kept turning cold at the thought of what would have happened if he had not been able to lay hands on the little stone 
 
 hermione gave an almost inaudible sniff she had been exceptionally quiet all day having hurtled up to harry outside the hospital wing and demanded to know what had happened she had taken almost no part in harry and obsessive discussion about how ron had been poisoned but merely stood beside them and until at last they had been allowed in to see him 
 
 do mum and dad know fred asked ginny 
 
 already seen him they arrived an hour in office now but be back soon 
 
 there was a pause while they all watched ron mumble a little in his sleep 
 
 so the poison was in the drink said fred quietly 
 
 yes said harry at once he could think of nothing else and was glad for the opportunity to start discussing it again slughorn poured it out 
 
 would he have been able to slip something into glass without you seeing 
 
 probably said harry but why would slughorn want to poison ron 
 
 no idea said fred frowning you think he could have mixed up the glasses by mistake meaning to get you 
 
 why would slughorn want to poison harry asked ginny 
 
 i dunno said fred but there must be loads of people like to poison harry there the chosen one and all that 
 
 so you think a death eater said ginny 
 
 possible said fred darkly 
 
 he could be under the imperius curse said george 
 
 or he could be innocent said ginny the poison could have been in the bottle in which case it was probably meant for slughorn himself 
 
 want to kill slughorn 
 
 dumbledore reckons voldemort wanted slughorn on his side said harry slughorn was in hiding for a year before he came to hogwarts and he thought of the memory dumbledore had not yet been able to extract from slughorn and maybe voldemort wants him out of the way maybe he thinks he could be valuable to dumbledore 
 
 but you said slughorn had been planning to give that bottle to dumbledore for christmas ginny reminded him so the poisoner could just as easily have been after dumbledore 
 
 then the poisoner know slughorn very well said hermione speaking for the first time in hours and sounding as though she had a bad head cold anyone who knew slughorn would have i known there was a good chance keep something that tasty for himself 
 
 croaked ron unexpectedly from between them 
 
 they all fell silent watching him anxiously but after muttering incomprehensibly for a moment he merely started snoring 
 
 the dormitory doors flew open making them all jump hagrid came striding toward them his hair his bearskin coat flapping behind him a crossbow in his hand leaving a trail of muddy footprints all over the floor 
 
 bin in the forest all day he panted worse i bin readin to himdidn get up ter dinner till jus now an then professor sprout told me abou ron how is he 
 
 not bad said harry they say be okay 
 
 no more than six visitors at a time said madam pomfrey hurrying out of her office 
 
 hagrid makes six george pointed out 
 
 o yes said madam pomfrey who seemed to have been counting hagrid as several people due to his vastness to cover her confusion she hurried off to clear up his muddy foot prints with her wand 
 
 i don believe this said hagrid hoarsely shaking his great shaggy head as he stared down at ron jus don believe it look at him lyin there want ter hurt him eh 
 
 just what we were discussing said harry we know 
 
 someone couldn have a grudge against the gryfinndor quidditch team could they said hagrid anxiously firs katie now ron 
 
 i see anyone trying to bump off a quidditch team said george 
 
 wood done the slytherins if he got away with it said fred fairly 
 
 well i think quidditch but i think a connection between the attacks said hermione quietly 
 
 how work that out asked fred 
 
 well for one thing they both ought to have been fatal and although that was pure luck and for another neither the poison nor the necklace seems to have reached the person who was supposed to be killed of course she added broodingly that makes the person behind this even more dangerous in a way because they seem to care how many people they finish off before they actually reach their victim 
 
 before anybody could respond to this ominous pronouncement the dormitory doors opened again and mr and mrs weasley hurried up the ward they had done no more than satisfy themselves that ron would make a full recovery on their last visit to the ward now mrs weasley seized hold of harry and hugged him very tighty 
 
 told us how you saved him with the bezoar she sobbed oh harry what can we say you saved ginny you saved arthur now saved ron 
 
 be i muttered harry awkwardly 
 
 half our family does seem to owe you their lives now i stop and think about it mr weasley said in a constricted voice well all i can say is that it was a lucky day for the weasleys when ron decided to sit in your compartment on the hogwarts express harry 
 
 harry could not think of any reply to this and was almost glad when madam pomfrey reminded them that there were only supposed to be six visitors around bed he and hermione rose at once to leave and hagrid decided to go with them leaving ron with his family 
 
 terrible growled hagrid into his beard as the three of them walked back along the corridor to the marble staircase all this new security an kids are still gettin hurt worried sick he don say much but i can tell 
 
 he got any ideas hagrid asked hermione desperately 
 
 i spect got hundreds of ideas brain like his said hagrid but he doesn know who sent that necklace nor put poison in that wine or bin caught wouldn they wha worries me said hagrid lowering his voice and glancing over his shoulder harry for good measure checked the ceiling for peeves is how long hogwarts can stay open if kids are bein attacked chamber o secrets all over again isn it be panic more parents takin their kids outta school an nex thing yeh know the board o governors 
 
 hagrid stopped talking as the ghost of a woman drifted serenely past then resumed in a hoarse whisper the board o be talkin about shuttin us up fer good 
 
 surely not said hermione looking worried 
 
 gotta see it from their point o view said hagrid heavily i mean always bin a bit of a risk sendin a kid ter hogwarts hasn it yer expect accidents don yeh with hundreds of underage wizards all locked up tergether but attempted murder s no wonder angry with sn 
 
 hagrid stopped in his tracks a familiar guilty expression on what was visible of his face above his tangled black beard 
 
 what said harry quickly angry with snape 
 
 i never said tha said hagrid though his look of panic could not have been a bigger giveaway look at the time gettin on fer midnight i need ter 
 
 hagrid why is dumbledore angry with snape harry asked loudly 
 
 shhhh said hagrid looking both nervous and angry don shout stuff like that harry wan me ter lose me job mind i don suppose care would yeh not now given up care of mag 
 
 try and make me feel guilty it work said harry forcefully snape done 
 
 i dunno harry i heard it at all well i was comin outta the forest the other evenin an i overheard em talking well arguin like ter draw attention to meself so i sorta skulked an tried not ter listen but it was well a heated discussion an it wasn easy ter block it out 
 
 well harry urged him as hagrid shuffled his enormous feet uneasily 
 
 well i jus heard snape sayin dumbledore took too much fer granted an maybe hesnapedidn wan ter do it any more 
 
 do what 
 
 i dunno harry it sounded like snape was feelin a bit overworked allanyway dumbledore told him flat out agreed ter do it an that was all there was to it pretty firm with him an then he said summat abou snape makin investigations in his house in slytherin well nothin strange abou that hagrid added hastily as harry and hermione exchanged looks full of meaning all the heads o houses were asked ter look inter that necklace business 
 
 yeah but not having rows with the rest of them is he said harry 
 
 look hagrid twisted his crossbow uncomfortably in his hands there was a loud splintering sound and it snapped in two i know what like abou snape harry an i don want yeh ter go readin more inter this than there is 
 
 look out said hermione tersely 
 
 they turned just in time to see the shadow of argus filch looming over the wall behind them before the man himself turned the corner hunchbacked his jowls aquiver 
 
 oho he wheezed out of bed so late mean detention 
 
 no it won filch said hagrid shortly with me aren they 
 
 and what difference does that make asked filch obnoxiously 
 
 a ruddy teacher aren i yeh sneakin squib said hagrid firing up at once 
 
 there was a nasty hissing noise as filch swelled with fury mrs norris had arrived unseen and was twisting herself sinuously around skinny ankles 
 
 get goin said hagrid out of the corner of his mouth 
 
 harry did not need telling twice he and hermione both hurried off and raised voices echoed behind them as they ran they passed peeves near the turning into gryffindor tower but he was streaking happily toward the source of the yelling cackling and calling 
 
 when strife and when trouble 
 
 call on peevsie make double 
 
 the fat lady was snoozing and not pleased to be woken but swung forward grumpily to allow them to clamber into the mercifully peaceful and empty common room it did not seem that people knew about ron yet harry was very relieved he had been interrogated enough that day hermione bade him good night and set off for the girls dormitory harry however remained behind taking a seat beside the fire and looking down into the dying embers 
 
 so dumbledore had argued with snape in spite of all he had told harry in spite of his insistence that he trusted snape completely he had lost his temper with him he did not think that snape had tried hard enough to investigate the slytherins or perhaps to investigate a single slytherin malfoy 
 
 was it because dumbledore did not want harry to do anything foolish to take matters into his own hands that he had pretended there was nothing in suspicions that seemed likely it might even be that dumbledore did not want anything to distract harry from their lessons or from procuring that memory from slughorn perhaps dumbledore did not think it right to confide suspicions about his staff to 
 
 there you are potter 
 
 harry jumped to his feet in shock his wand at the ready he had been quite convinced that the common room was empty he had not been at all prepared for a hulking figure to rise suddenly out of a distant chair a closer look showed him that it was cormac mclaggen 
 
 been waiting for you to come back said mclaggen disregarding drawn wand fallen asleep look i saw them taking weasley up to the hospital wing earlier look like be fit for next match 
 
 it took harry a few moments to realize what mclaggen was talking about 
 
 oh right quidditch he said putting his wand back into the belt of his jeans and running a hand wearily through his hair yeah he might not make it 
 
 well then be playing keeper i said mclaggen 
 
 yeah said harry yeah i suppose so 
 
 he could not think of an argument against it after all mclaggen had certainly performed in the trials 
 
 excellent said mclaggen in a satisfied voice so practice 
 
 what oh one tomorrow evening 
 
 good listen potter we should have a talk beforehand got some ideas on strategy you might find useful 
 
 right said harry unenthusiastically well hear them tomorrow then pretty tired now see you 
 
 the news that ron had been poisoned spread quickly next day but it did not cause the sensation that attack had done people seemed to think that it might have been an accident given that he had been in the potions room at the time and that as he had been given an antidote immediately there was no real harm done in fact the gryffindors were generally much more interested in the upcoming quidditch match against hufflepuff for many of them wanted to see zacharias smith who played chaser on the hufflepuff team punished soundly for his commentary during the opening match against slytherin 
 
 harry however had never been less interested in quidditch he was rapidly becoming obsessed with draco malfoy still checking the map whenever he got a chance he sometimes made detours to wherever malfoy happened to be but had not yet detected him doing anything out of the ordinary and still there were those inexplicable times when malfoy simply vanished from the map 
 
 but harry did not get a lot of time to consider the problem what with quidditch practice homework and the fact that he was now being dogged wherever he went by cormac mclaggen and lavender brown 
 
 he could not decide which of them was more annoying mclaggen kept up a constant stream of hints that he would make a better permanent keeper for the team than ron and that now that harry was seeing him play regularly he would surely come around to this way of thinking too he was also keen to criticize the other players and provide harry with detailed training schemes so that more than once harry was forced to remind him who was captain 
 
 meanwhile lavender kept sidling up to harry to discuss ron which harry found almost more wearing than quidditch lectures at first lavender had been very annoyed that nobody had thought to tell her that ron was in the hospital mean i am his unfortunately she had now decided to forgive harry this lapse of memory and was keen to have lots of chats with him about feelings a most uncomfortable experience that harry would have happily forgone 
 
 look why you talk to ron about all this harry asked after a particularly long interrogation from lavender that took in everything from precisely what ron had said about her new dress robes to whether or not harry thought that ron considered his relationship with lavender to be serious 
 
 well i would but always asleep when i go and see him said lavender fretfully 
 
 is he said harry surprised for he had found ron perfectly alert every time he had been up to the hospital wing both highly interested in the news of dumbledore and row and keen to abuse mclaggen as much as possible 
 
 is hermione granger still visiting him lavender demanded suddenly 
 
 yeah i think so well friends they said harry uncomfortably 
 
 friends make me laugh said lavender scornfully she talk to him for weeks after he started going out with me but i suppose she wants to make up with him now all interesting 
 
 would you call getting poisoned being interesting asked harry anywaysorry got to mclaggen coming for a talk about quidditch said harry hurriedly and he dashed sideways through a door pretending to be solid wall and sprinted down the shortcut that would take him off to potions where thankfully neither lavender nor mclaggen could follow him 
 
 on the morning of the quidditch match against hufflepuff harry dropped in on the hospital wing before heading down to the pitch ron was very agitated madam pomfrey would not let him go down to watch the match feeling it would overexcite him 
 
 so mclaggen shaping up he asked harry nervously apparently forgetting that he had already asked the same question twice 
 
 told you said harry patiently he could be and i want to keep him he keeps trying to tell everyone what to do he thinks he could play every position better than the rest of us i wait to be shot of him and speaking of getting shot of people harry added getting to his feet and picking up his firebolt will you stop pretending to be asleep when lavender comes to see you driving me mad as well 
 
 oh said ron looking sheepish yeah all right 
 
 if you want to go out with her anymore just tell her said harry 
 
 yeah well not that easy is it said ron he paused hermione going to look in before the match he added casually 
 
 no already gone down to the pitch with ginny 
 
 oh said ron looking rather glum right well good luck hope you hammer mclagi mean smith 
 
 try said harry shouldering his broom see you after the match 
 
 he hurried down through the deserted corridors the whole school was outside either already seated in the stadium or heading down toward it he was looking out of the windows he passed trying to gauge how much wind they were facing when a noise ahead made him glance up and he saw malfoy walking toward him accompanied by two girls both of whom looked sulky and resentful 
 
 malfoy stopped short at the sight of harry then gave a short humorless laugh and continued walking 
 
 you going harry demanded 
 
 yeah really going to tell you because your business potter sneered malfoy better hurry up be waiting for the chosen captainthe boy who scoredwhatever they call you these days 
 
 one of the girls gave an unwilling giggle harry stared at her she blushed malfoy pushed past harry and she and her friend followed at a trot turning the corner and vanishing from view 
 
 harry stood rooted on the spot and watched them disappear this was infuriating he was already cutting it fine to get to the match on time and yet there was malfoy skulking off while the rest of the school was absent best chance yet of discovering what malfoy was up to the silent seconds trickled past and harry remained where he was frozen gazing at the place where malfoy had vanished 
 
 where have you been demanded ginny as harry sprinted into the changing rooms the whole team was changed and ready coote and peakes the beaters were both hitting their clubs nervously against their legs 
 
 i met malfoy harry told her quietly as he pulled his scarlet robes over his head 
 
 so 
 
 so i wanted to know how come up at the castle with a couple of girlfriends while everyone else is down here 
 
 does it matter right now 
 
 well not likely to find out am i said harry seizing his firebolt and pushing his glasses straight come on then 
 
 and without another word he marched out onto the pitch to deafening cheers and boos 
 
 there was little wind the clouds were patchy every now and then there were dazzling flashes of bright sunlight 
 
 tricky conditions mclaggen said bracingly to the team coote peakes want to fly out of the sun so they see you coming 
 
 the captain mclaggen shut up giving them instructions said harry angrily just get up by the goal posts 
 
 once mclaggen had marched off harry turned to coote and peakes 
 
 make sure you do fly out of the sun he told them grudgingly 
 
 he shook hands with the hufflepuff captain and then on madam whistle kicked off and rose into the air higher than the rest of his team streaking around the pitch in search of the snitch if he could catch it good and early there might be a chance he could get back up to the castle seize the map and find out what malfoy was doing 
 
 and smith of hufflepuff with the quaffle said a dreamy voice echoing over the grounds he did the commentary last time of course and ginny weasley flew into him i think probably on purposeit looked like it smith was being quite rude about gryffindor i expect he regrets that now playing themoh look lost the quaffle ginny took it from him i do like her very nice 
 
 harry stared down at the podium surely nobody in their right mind would have let luna lovegood commentate but even from above there was no mistaking that long hair nor the necklace of butterbeer corks beside luna professor mcgonagall was looking slightly uncomfortable as though she was indeed having second thoughts about this appointment 
 
 but now that big hufflepuff got the quaffle from her i remember his name something like bibbleno buggins 
 
 cadwallader said professor mcgonagall loudly from beside luna the crowd laughed 
 
 harry stared around for the snitch there was no sign of it moments later cadwallader scored mclaggen had been shouting criticism at ginny for allowing the quaffle out of her possession with the result that he had not noticed the large red ball soaring past his right ear 
 
 mclaggen will you pay attention to what supposed to be doing and leave everyone else alone bellowed harry wheeling around to face his keeper 
 
 not setting a great example mclaggen shouted back and furious 
 
 and harry now having an argument with his keeper said luna serenely while both hufflepuffs and slytherins below in the crowd cheered and jeered i think help him find the snitch but maybe a clever ruse 
 
 swearing angrily harry spun round and set off around the pitch again scanning the skies for some sign of the tiny winged golden ball 
 
 ginny and demelza scored a goal apiece giving the supporters below something to cheer about then cadwallader scored again making things level but luna did not seem to have noticed she appeared singularly uninterested in such mundane things as the score and kept attempting to draw the attention to such things as interestingly shaped clouds and the possibility that zacharias smith who had so far failed to maintain possession of the quaffle for longer than a minute was suffering from something called lurgy 
 
 to hufflepuff barked professor mcgonagall into megaphone 
 
 is it already said luna vaguely oh look the gryffindor got hold of one of the bats 
 
 harry spun around in midair sure enough mclaggen for reasons best known to himself had pulled bat from him and appeared to be demonstrating how to hit a bludger toward an oncoming cadwallader 
 
 will you give him back his bat and get back to the goalposts roared harry pelting toward mclaggen just as mclaggen took a ferocious swipe at the bludger and mishit it 
 
 a blinding sickening pain a flash of light a distant scream and the sensation of falling down a long tunnel 
 
 and the next thing harry knew he was lying in a remarkably warm and comfortable bed and looking up at a lamp that was throwing a circle of golden light onto a shadowy ceiling he raised his head awkwardly there on his left was a freckly person 
 
 nice of you to drop in said ron grinning 
 
 harry blinked and looked around of course he was in the hospital wing the sky outside was indigo streaked with crimson the match must have finished hours ago as had any hope of cornering malfoy head felt strangely heavy he raised a hand and felt a stiff turban of bandages 
 
 what happened 
 
 cracked skull said madam pomfrey bustling up and pushing him back against his pillows nothing to worry about i mended it at once but keeping you in overnight you overexert yourself for a few hours 
 
 i want to stay here overnight said harry angrily sitting up and throwing back his covers i want to find mclaggen and kill him 
 
 afraid that would come under the heading of overexertion said madam pomfrey pushing him firmly back onto the bed and raising her wand in a threatening manner you will stay here until i discharge you potter or i shall call the headmaster 
 
 she bustled back into her office and harry sank back into his pillows fuming 
 
 know how much we lost by he asked ron through clenched teeth 
 
 well yeah i do said ron apologetically final score was three hundred and twenty to sixty 
 
 brilliant said harry savagely really brilliant when i get hold of mclaggen 
 
 you want to get hold of him the size of a troll said ron reasonably personally i think a lot to be said for hexing him with that toenail thing of the anyway the rest of the team dealt with him before you get out of here not happy 
 
 there was a note of badly suppressed glee in voice harry could tell he was nothing short of thrilled that mclaggen had messed up so badly harry lay there staring up at the patch of light on the ceiling his recently mended skull not hurting precisely but feeling slightly tender underneath all the bandaging 
 
 i could hear the match commentary from here said ron his voice now shaking with laughter i hope luna always commentates from now on lurgy 
 
 but harry was still too angry to see much humor in the situation and after a while snorts subsided 
 
 ginny came in to visit while you were unconscious he said after a long pause and imagination zoomed into overdrive rapidly constructing a scene in which ginny weeping over his lifeless form confessed her feelings of deep attraction to him while ron gave them his reckons you only just arrived on time for the match how come you left here early enough 
 
 oh said harry as the scene in his eye imploded yeah well i saw malfoy sneaking off with a couple of girls who look like they wanted to be with him and the second time made sure he down on the quidditch pitch with the rest of the school he skipped the last match too remember harry sighed wish followed him now the match was such a fiasco 
 
 be stupid said ron sharply you have missed a quidditch match just to follow malfoy the captain 
 
 i want to know what up to said harry and tell me its all in my head not after what i overheard between him and snape 
 
 i never said it was all in your head said ron hoisting himself up on an elbow in turn and frowning at harry but no rule saying only one person at a time can be plotting anything in this place getting a bit obsessed with malfoy harry i mean thinking about missing a match just to follow him 
 
 i want to catch him at it said harry in frustration i mean he going when he disappears off the map 
 
 i dunno hogsmeade suggested ron yawning 
 
 never seen him going along any of the secret passageway on the map i thought they were being watched now anyway 
 
 well then i dunno said ron 
 
 silence fell between them harry stared up at the circle of lamp light above him thinking 
 
 if only he had rufus power he would have been able to set a tail upon malfoy but unfortunately harry did not have an office full of aurors at his command he thought fleetingly of trying to set something up with the but there again was the problem that people would be missed from lessons most of them after all still had full schedules 
 
 there was a low rumbling snore from bed after a while madam pomfrey came out of her office this time wearing a thick dressing gown it was easiest to feign sleep harry rolled over onto his side and listened to all the curtains closing themselves as she waved her wand the lamps dimmed and she returned to her office he heard the door click behind her and knew that she was off to bed 
 
 this was harry reflected in the darkness the third time that he had been brought to the hospital wing because of a quidditch injury last time he had fallen off his broom due to the presence of dementors around the pitch and the time before that all the bones had been removed from his arm by the incurably inept professor lockhart that had been his most painful injury by far he remembered the agony of regrowing an armful of bones in one night a discomfort not eased by the arrival of an unexpected visitor in the middle of the 
 
 harry sat bolt upright his heart pounding his bandage turban askew he had the solution at last there was a way to have malfoy followedhow could he have forgotten why he thought of it before 
 
 but the question was how to call him what did you do quietly tentatively harry spoke into the darkness 
 
 kreacher 
 
 there was a very loud crack and the sounds of scuffling and squeaks filled the silent room ron awoke with a yelp 
 
 going 
 
 harry pointed his wand hastily at the door of madam office and muttered muffliato so that she would not come running then he scrambled to the end of his bed for a better look at what was going on 
 
 two were rolling around on the floor in the middle of the dormitory one wearing a shrunken maroon jumper and several woolly hats the other a filthy old rag strung over his hips like a loincloth then there was another loud bang and peeves the poltergeist appeared in midair above the wrestling elves 
 
 i was watching that potty he told harry indignantly pointing at the fight below before letting out a loud cackle look at the ickle creatures squabbling bitey bitey punchy punchy 
 
 kreacher will not insult harry potter in front of dobby no he or dobby will shut mouth for him cried dobby in a voice 
 
 kicky scratchy cried peeves happily now pelting bits of chalk at the elves to enrage them further tweaky pokey 
 
 kreacher will say what he likes about his master oh yes and what a master he is filthy friend of mudbloods oh what would poor mistress say 
 
 exactly what mistress would have said they did not find out for at that moment dobby sank his knobbly little fist into mouth and knocked out half of his teeth harry and ron both leapt out of their beds and wrenched the two elves apart though they continued to try and kick and punch each other egged on by peeves who swooped around the lamp squealing stick your fingers up his nosey draw his cork and pull his earsies 
 
 harry aimed his wand at peeves and said langlock peeves clutched at his throat gulped then swooped from the room making obscene gestures but unable to speak owing to the fact that his tongue had just glued itself to the roof of his mouth 
 
 nice one said ron appreciatively lifting dobby into the air so that his flailing limbs no longer made contact with kreacher that was another prince hex it 
 
 yeah said harry twisting wizened arm into a half nelson forbidding you to fight each other well kreacher forbidden to fight dobby dobby i know not allowed to give you orders 
 
 dobby is a free and he can obey anyone he likes and dobby will do whatever harry potter wants him to do said dobby tears now streaming down his shriveled little face onto his jumper 
 
 okay then said harry and he and ron both released the elves who fell to the floor but did not continue fighting 
 
 master called me croaked kreacher sinking into a bow even as he gave harry a look that plainly wished him a painful death 
 
 yeah i did said harry glancing toward madam office door to check that the muffliato spell was still working there was no sign that she had heard any of the commotion got a job for you 
 
 kreacher will do whatever master wants said kreacher sinking so low that his lips almost touched his gnarled toes because kreacher has no choice but kreacher is ashamed to have such a master yes 
 
 dobby will do it harry potter squeaked dobby his eyes still swimming in tears dobby would be honored to help harry potter 
 
 come to think of it it would be good to have both of you said harry okay then i want you to tail draco malfoy 
 
 ignoring the look of mingled surprise and exasperation on face harry went on i want to know where going who meeting and what doing i want you to follow him around the clock 
 
 yes harry potter said dobby at once his great eyes shining with excitement and if dobby does it wrong dobby will throw himself off the topmost tower harry potter 
 
 there be any need for that said harry hastily 
 
 master wants me to follow the youngest of the malfoys croaked kreacher master wants me to spy upon the of my old mistress 
 
 the one said harry foreseeing a great danger and determining to prevent it immediately and forbidden to tip him off kreacher or to show him what up to or to talk to him at all or to write him messages or or to contact him in any way got it 
 
 he thought he could see kreacher struggling to see a loophole in the instructions he had just been given and waited after a moment or two and to great satisfaction kreacher bowed deeply again and said with bitter resentment master thinks of everything and kreacher must obey him even though kreacher would much rather be the servant of the malfoy boy oh yes 
 
 settled then said harry want regular reports but make sure not surrounded by people when you turn up ron and hermione are okay and tell anyone what doing just stick to malfoy like a couple of wart plasters

 it was snowing by the time hermione took over the watch at midnight harrys dreams were confused and disturbing nagini wove in and out of them first through a wreath of christmas roses he woke repeatedly panicky convinced that somebody had called out to him in the distance imagining that the wind whipping around the tent was footsteps or voices 
 
 finally he got up in the darkness and joined hermione who was huddled in the entrance to the tent reading a history of magic by the light of her wand the snow was falling thickly and she greeted with relief his suggestion of packing up early and moving on 
 
 well move somewhere more sheltered she agreed shivering as she pulled on a sweatshirt over her pajamas i kept thinking i could hear people moving outside i even though i saw somebody one or twice 
 
 harry paused in the act of pulling on a jumper and glanced at the silent motionless sneakoscope on the table 
 
 im sure i imagined it said hermione looking nervous the snow the dark it plays tricks on your eyes but perhaps we ought to disapparate under the invisibility cloak just in case 
 
 half an hour later with the tent packed harry wearing the horcrux and hermione clutching the beaded bag they disapparated the usual tightness engulfed them harrys feet parted company with the snowy ground then slammed hard onto what felt like frozen earth covered in leaves 
 
 where are we he asked peering around at the fresh mass of trees as hermione opened the beaded bag and began tugging out the tent poles 
 
 the forest of dean she said i came camping here once with my mum and dad 
 
 here too snow lay on the trees all around and it was bitterly cold but they were at least protected from the wind they spent most of the day inside the tent huddled for warmth around the useful bright blue flames that hermione was adept at producing and which could be scooped up and carried in a jar harry felt as though he was recuperating from some brief but severe an impression reinforced by hermiones solicitousness that afternoon fresh flakes drifted down upon them so that even their sheltered clearing had a fresh dusting of powdery snow 
 
 after two nights of little sleep harrys senses seemed more alert than usual their escape from godrics hollow had been so narrow that voldemort seemed somehow closer than before more threatening as darkness drove in again harry refused hermiones offer to keep watch and told her to go to bed 
 
 harry moved an old cushion into the tent mouth and sat down wearing all the sweaters he owned but even so still shivery the darkness deepened with the passing hours until it was virtually impenetrable he was on the point of taking out the marauders map so as to watch ginnys dot for a while before he remembered that it was the christmas holidays and that she would be back at the burrow 
 
 every tiny movement seemed magnified in the vastness of the forest harry knew that it must be full of living creatures but he wished they would all remain still and silent so that he could separate their innocent scurryings and prowlings from noises that might proclaim other sinister movements he remembered the sound of a cloak slithering over dead leaves many years ago and at once thought he heard it again before mentally shaking himself their protective enchantments had worked for weeks why should they break now and yet he could no throw off the feeling that something was different tonight 
 
 several times he jerked upright his neck aching because he had fallen asleep slumped at an awkward angle against the side of the tent the night reached such a depth of velvety blackness that he might have been suspended in limbo between disapparation and apparation he had just held a hand in front of his face to see whether he could make out his fingers when it happened 
 
 a bright silver light appeared right ahead of him moving through the trees whatever the source it was moving soundlessly the light seemed simply to drift toward him 
 
 he jumped to his feet his voice frozen in his throat and raised hermiones wand he screwed up his eyes as the light became blinding the trees in front of it pitch black in silhouette and still the thing came closer 
 
 and then the source of the light stepped out from behind an oak it was a silver white doe and dazzling picking her way over the ground still silent and leaving no hoofprints in the fine powdering of snow she stepped toward him her beautiful head with its wide eyes held high 
 
 harry stared at the creature filled with wonder not at her strangeness but her inexplicable familiarity he felt that he had been waiting for her to come but that he had forgotten until this moment that they had arranged to meet his impulse to shout for hermione which had been so strong a moment ago had gone he knew he would have staked his life on it that she had come for him and him alone 
 
 they gazed at each other for several long moments and then she turned and walked away 
 
 no he said and his voice was cracked with lack of use come back 
 
 she continued to step deliberately through the trees and soon he brightness was striped by their thick black trunks for one trembling second he hesitated caution murmured it could be a trick a lure a trap but instinct overwhelming instinct told him that this was not dark magic he set off in pursuit 
 
 snow crunched beneath his feet but the doe made no noise as she passed through the trees for she was nothing but light deeper and deeper into the forest she led him and harry walked quickly sure that when she stopped she would allow him to approach her properly and then she would speak and the voice would tell him what he needed to know 
 
 at last she came to a halt she turned her beautiful head toward him once more and he broke into a run a question burning in him but as he opened his lips to ask it she vanished 
 
 though the darkness had swallowed her whole her burnished image was still imprinted on his retinas it obscured his vision brightening when he lowered his eyelids disorienting him now fear came her presence had meant safety 
 
 lumos he whispered and the ignited 
 
 the imprint of the doe faded away with every blink of his eyes as he stood there listening to the sounds of the forest to distant crackles of twigs soft swishes of snow was he about to be attacked had she enticed him into an ambush was he imagining that somebody stood beyond the reach of the wandlight watching him 
 
 he held the wand higher nobody ran out at him no flash of green light burst from behind a tree why then had she led him to this spot 
 
 something gleamed in the light of the wand and harry spun about but all that was there was a small frozen pool its black cracked surface glittering as he raised his wand higher to examine it 
 
 he moved forward rather cautiously and looked down the ice reflected his distorted shadow and the beam of wandlight but deep below the thick misty gray carapace something else glinted a great silver cross 
 
 his heart skipped into his mouth he dropped to his knees at the pools edge and angled the wand so as to flood the bottom of the pool with as much light as possible a glint of deep redit was a sword with glittering rubies in its sword of gryffindor was lying at the bottom of the forest pool 
 
 barely breathing he stared down at it how was this possible how could it have come to be lying in a forest pool this close to the place where they were camping had some unknown magic drawn hermione to this spot or was the doe which he had taken to be a patronus some kind of guardian of the pool or had the sword been put into the pool after they had arrived precisely because they were here in which case where was the person who wanted to pass it to harry again he directed the wand at the surrounding trees and bushes searching for a human outline for the glint of an eye but he could not see anyone there all the same a little more fear leavened his exhilaration as he returned his attention to the sword reposing upon the bottom of the frozen pool 
 
 he pointed the wand at the silvery shape and murmured accio sword 
 
 it did not stir he had not expected it to if it had been that easy the sword would have lain on the ground for him to pick up not in the depths of a frozen pool he set off around the circle of ice thinking hard about the last time the sword had delivered itself to him he had been in terrible danger then and had asked for help 
 
 help he murmured but the sword remained upon the pool bottom indifferent motionless 
 
 what was it harry asked himself walking again that dumbledore had told him the last time he had retrieved the sword only a true gryffindor could have pulled that out of the hat and what were the qualities that defined a gryffindor a small voice inside harrys head answered him their daring nerve and chivalry set gryffindor apart 
 
 harry stopped walking and let out a long sigh his smoky breath dispersing rapidly upon the frozen air he knew what he had to do if he was honest with himself he had thought it might come to this from the moment he had spotted the sword through the ice 
 
 he glanced around at the surrounding trees again but was convinced now that nobody was going to attack him they had had their chance as he walked alone through the forest had had plenty of opportunity as he examined the pool the only reason to delay at this point was because the immediate prospect was so deeply uninviting 
 
 with fumbling fingers harry started to remove his many layers of clothing where chivalry entered into this he thought ruefully he was not entirely sure unless it counted as chivalrous that he was not calling for hermione to do it in his stead 
 
 an owl hooted somewhere as he stripped off and he thought with a pang of hedwig he was shivering now his teeth chattering horribly and yet he continued to strip off until at last he stood there in his underwear barefooted in the snow he placed the pouch containing his wand his mothers letter the shard of siriuss mirror and the old snitch on top of his clothes then he pointed hermiones wand at the ice 
 
 diffindo 
 
 it cracked with a sound like a bullet in the silence the surface of the pool broke and chunks of dark ice rocked on the ruffled water as far as harry could judge it was not deep but to retrieve the sword he would have to submerge himself completely 
 
 contemplating the task ahead would not make it easier or the water warmer he stepped to the pools edge and placed hermiones wand on the ground still lit then trying not to imagine how much colder he was about to become or how violently he would soon be shivering he jumped 
 
 every pore of his body screamed in protest the very air in his lungs seemed to freeze solid as he was submerged to his shoulders in the frozen water he could hardly breathe trembling so violently the water lapped over the edges of the pool he felt for the blade with his numb feet he only wanted to dive once 
 
 harry put off the moment of total submersion from second to second gasping and shaking until he told himself that it must be done gathered all his courage and dived 
 
 the cold was agony it attacked him like fire his brain itself seemed to have frozen as he pushed through the dark water to the bottom and reached out groping for the sword his fingers closed around the hilt he pulled it upward 
 
 then something closed tight around his neck he thought of water weeds though nothing had brushed him as he dived and raised his hand to free himself it was not weed the chain of the horcrux had tightened and was slowly constricting his windpipe 
 
 harry kicked out wildly trying to push himself back to the surface but merely propelled himself into the rocky side of the pool thrashing suffocating he scrabbled at the strangling chain his frozen fingers unable to loosen it and now little lights were popping inside his head and he was going to drown there was nothing left nothing he could do and the arms that closed around his chest were surely deaths 
 
 choking and retching soaking and colder than he had ever been in his life he came to facedown in the snow somewhere close by another person was panting and coughing and staggering around as she had come when the snake it did not sound like her not with those deep coughs no judging by the weight of the footsteps 
 
 harry had no strength to lift his head and see his saviors identity all he could do was raise a shaking hand to his throat and feel the place where the locket had cut tightly into his flesh it was gone someone had cut him free then a panting voice spoke from over his head 
 
 are c you c mental 
 
 nothing but the shock of hearing that voice could have given harry the strength to get up shivering violently he staggered to his feet there before him stood ron fully dressed but drenched to the skin his hair plastered to his face the sword of gryffindor in one hand and the horcrux dangling from its broken chain in the other 
 
 why the hell panted ron holding up the horcrux which swung backward and forward on its shortened chain in some parody of hypnosis didnt you take the thing off before you dived 
 
 harry could not answer the silver doe was nothing nothing compared with rons reappearance he could not believe it shuddering with cold he caught up the pile of clothes still lying at the waters edge and began to pull them on as he dragged sweater after sweater over his head harry stared at ron half expecting him to have disappeared every time he lost sight of him and yet he had to be real he had just dived into the pool he had saved harrys life 
 
 it was harry said at last his teeth chattering his voice weaker than usual due to his 
 
 well yeah said ron looking slightly confused 
 
 cast that doe 
 
 what no of course not i thought it was you doing it 
 
 my patronus is a stag 
 
 oh yeah i thought it looked different no antlers 
 
 harry put hagrids pouch back around his neck pulled on a final sweater stooped to pick up hermiones wand and faced ron again 
 
 how come youre here 
 
 apparently ron had hoped that this point would come up later if at all 
 
 well ive c you know c ive come back if c he cleared his throat you know you still want me 
 
 there was a pause in which the subject of rons departure seemed to rise like a wall between them yet he was here he had returned he had just saved harrys life 
 
 ron looked down at his hands he seemed momentarily surprised to see the things he was holding 
 
 oh yeah i got it out he said rather unnecessarily holding up the sword for harrys inspection thats why you jumped in right 
 
 yeah said harry but i dont understand how did you get here how did you find us 
 
 long story said ron ive been looking for you for hours its a big forest isnt it and i was just thinking id have to go kip under a tree and wait for morning when i saw that dear coming and you following 
 
 you didnt see anyone else 
 
 no said ron i c 
 
 but he hesitated glancing at two trees growing close together some yards away 
 
 i did think i saw something move over there but i was running to the pool at the time because youd gone in and you hadnt come up so i wasnt going to make a detour to c hey 
 
 harry was already hurrying to the place that ron had indicated the two oaks grew close together there was a gap of only a few inches between the trunks at eye level an ideal place to see but not be seen the ground around the roots however was free of snow and harry could see no sign of footprints he walked back to where ron stood waiting still holding the sword and the horcrux 
 
 anything there ron asked 
 
 no said harry 
 
 so how did the sword get in that pool 
 
 whoever cast the patronus must have put it there 
 
 they both looked at the ornate silver sword its rubied hilt glinting a little in the light from hermiones wand 
 
 you reckon this is the real one asked ron 
 
 one way to find out isnt there said harry 
 
 the horcrux was still swinging from rons hand the locket was twitching slightly harry knew that the thing inside it was agitated again it had sensed the presence of the sword and had tried to kill harry rather than let him possess it now was not the time for long discussions now was the moment to destroy once and for all harry looked around holding hermiones wand high and saw the place a flattish rock lying in the shadow of a sycamore tree 
 
 come here he said and he led the way brushed snow from the rocks surface and held out his hand for the horcrux when ron offered the sword however harry shook his head 
 
 no you should do it 
 
 me said ron looking shocked why 
 
 because you got the sword out of the pool i think its supposed to be you 
 
 he was not being kind or generous as certainly as he had known that the doe was benign he knew that ron had to be the one to wield the sword dumbledore had at least taught harry something about certain kinds of magic of the incalculable power of certain acts 
 
 im going to open it said harry and you will stab it straightaway okay because whatevers in there will put up a fight the bit of riddle in the diary tried to kill me 
 
 how are you going to open it asked ron he looked terrified im going to ask it to open using parseltongue said harry the answer came so readily to his lips that thought that he had always known it deep down perhaps it had taken his recent encounter with nagini to make him realize it he looked at the serpentine s inlaid with glittering green stones it was easy to visualize it as a miniscule snake curled upon the cold rock 
 
 no said ron dont open it im serious 
 
 why not asked harry lets get rid of the damn thing its been months c 
 
 i cant harry im serious c you do it c 
 
 but why 
 
 because that things bad for me said ron backing away from the locket on the rock i cant handle it im not making excuses for what i was like but it affects me worse than it affects you and hermione it made me think stuff c stuff that i was thinking anyway but it made everything worse i cant explain it and then id take it off and id get my head straight again and then id have to put the effing thing back on c i cant do it harry 
 
 he had backed away the sword dragging at his side shaking his head 
 
 you can do it said harry you can youve just got the sword i know its supposed to be you who uses it please just get rid of it ron 
 
 the sound of his name seemed to act like a stimulant ron swallowed then still breathing hard through his long nose moved back toward the rock 
 
 tell me when he croaked 
 
 on three said harry looking back down at the locket and narrowing his eyes concentrating on the letter s imagining a serpent while the contents of the locket rattled like a trapped cockroach it would have been easy to pity it except that the cut around harrys neck still burned 
 
 one two threeopen 
 
 the last word came as a hiss and a snarl and the golden doors of the locket swung wide open with a little click 
 
 behind both of the glass windows within blinked a living eye dark and handsome as tom riddles eyes had been before he turned them scarlet and stab said harry holding the locket steady on the rock 
 
 ron raised the sword in his shaking hands the point dangled over the frantically swiveling eyes and harry gripped the locket tightly bracing himself already imagining blood pouring from the empty windows 
 
 then a voice hissed from out the horcrux 
 
 i have seen your heart and it is mine 
 
 dont listen to it harry said harshly stab it 
 
 i have seen your dreams ronald weasley and i have seen your fears all you desire is possible but all that you dread is also possible 
 
 stab shouted harry his voice echoed off the surrounding trees the sword point trembled and ron gazed down into riddles eyes 
 
 least loved always by the mother who craved a daughter least loved now by the girl who prefers your friend second best always eternally overshadowed 
 
 ron stab it now harry bellowed he could feel the locket quivering in the grip and was scared of what was coming ron raised the sword still higher and as he did so riddles eyes gleamed scarlet 
 
 out of the lockets two windows out of the eyes there bloomed like two grotesque bubbles the heads of harry and hermione weirdly distorted 
 
 ron yelled in shock and backed away as the figures blossomed out of the locket first chests then waists then legs until they stood in the locket side by side like trees with a common root swaying over ron and the real harry who had snatched his fingers away from the locket as it burned suddenly 
 
 ron he shouted but the was now speaking with voldemorts voice and ron was gazing mesmerized into its face 
 
 why return we were better without you happier without you glad of your absence we laughed at your stupidity your cowardice your presumptionc 
 
 presumption echoed the who was more beautiful and yet more terrible than the real hermione she swayed cackling before ron who looked horrified yet transfixed the sword hanging pointlessly at his side who could look at you who would ever look at you beside harry potter what have you ever done compared with the chosen one what are you compared with the boy who lived 
 
 ron stab it stab it harry yelled but ron did not move his eyes were wide and the and the were reflected in them their hair swirling like flames their eyes shining red their voices lifted in an evil duet 
 
 your mother confessed sneered while jeered that she would have preferred me as a son would be glad to exchange 
 
 who wouldnt prefer him what woman would take you you are nothing nothing nothing to him crooned and she stretched like a snake and entwined herself around wrapping him in a close embrace their lips met 
 
 on the ground in front of them rons face filled with anguish he raised the sword high his arms shaking 
 
 do it ron harry yelled 
 
 ron looked toward him and harry thought he saw a trace of scarlet in his eyes 
 
 ron c 
 
 the sword flashed plunged harry threw himself out of the way there as a clang of metal and a long scream harry whirled around slipping in the snow wand held ready to defend himself but there was nothing to fight 
 
 the monstrous versions of himself and hermione were gone there was only ron standing there with the sword held slackly in his hand looking down at the shattered remains of the locket on the flat rock 
 
 slowly harry walked back to him hardly knowing what to say or do ron was breathing heavily his eyes were no longer red at all but their normal blue they were also wet 
 
 harry stooped pretending he had not seen and picked up the broken horcrux ron had pierced the glass in both windows riddles eyes were gone and the stained silk lining of the locket was smoking slightly the thing that had lived in the horcrux had vanished torturing ron had been its final act the sword clanged as ron dropped it he had sunk to his knees his head in his arms he was shaking but not harry realized from cold harry crammed the broken locket into his pocket knelt down beside ron and placed a hand cautiously on his shoulder he took it as a good sign that ron did not throw it off 
 
 after you left he said in a low voice grateful for the fact that rons face was hidden she cried for a week probably longer only she didnt want me to see there were loads of nights when we never even spoke to each other with you gone 
 
 he could not finish it was now that ron was here again that harry fully realized how much his absence had cost them 
 
 shes like my sister he went on i love her like a sister and i reckon that she feels the same way about me its always been like that i thought you knew 
 
 ron did not respond but turned his face away from harry and wiped his nose noisily on his sleeve harry got to his feet again and walked to where rons enormous rucksack lay yards away discarded as ron had run toward the pool to save harry from drowning he hoisted it onto his own back and walked back to ron who clambered to his feet as harry approached eyes bloodshot but otherwise composed 
 
 im sorry he said in a thick voice im sorry i left i know i was a c a c 
 
 he looked around at the darkness as if hoping a bad enough word would swoop down upon him and claim him 
 
 youve sort of made up for it tonight said harry getting the sword finishing off the horcrux saving my life 
 
 that makes me sound a lot cooler than i was ron mumbled 
 
 stuff like that always sounds cooler than it really was said harry ive been trying to tell you that for years 
 
 simultaneously they walked forward and hugged harry gripping the back of rons jacket 
 
 and now said harry as they broke apart all weve got to do is find that tent again 
 
 but it was not difficult though the walk through the dark forest with the doe had seemed lengthy with ron by his side the journey back seemed to take a surprisingly short time harry could not wait to wake hermione and it was with quickening excitement that he entered the tent ron lagging a little behind him 
 
 it was gloriously warm after the pool and the forest the only illumination the bluebell flames still shimmering in a bowl on the floor hermione was fast asleep curled up under her blankets and did not move until harry had said her name several times 
 
 hermione 
 
 she stirred then sat up quickly pushing her hair out of her face 
 
 whats wrong harry are you all right 
 
 its okay everythings fine more than fine im great theres someone here 
 
 what do you mean who c 
 
 she saw ron who stood there holding the sword and dripping onto the threadbare carpet harry backed into a shadowy corner slipped off rons rucksack and attempted to blend in with the canvas 
 
 hermione slid out of her bunk and moved like a sleepwalker toward ron her eyes upon his pale face she stopped right in front of him her lips slightly parted her eyes wide ron gave a weak hopeful smile and half raised his arms 
 
 hermione launched herself forward and started punching every inch of him that she could reach 
 
 ouch c ow c gerroff what the c hermione c ow 
 
 you c complete c arse c ronald c weasley 
 
 she punctuated every word with a blow ron backed away shielding his head as hermione advanced 
 
 you c crawl c back c here c after c weeks c and c weeks c oh wheres my wand 
 
 she looked as though ready to wrestle it out of harrys hands and he reacted instinctively 
 
 protego 
 
 the invisible shield erupted between ron and hermione the force of it knocked her backward onto the floor spitting hair out of her mouth she lept up again 
 
 hermione said harry calm c 
 
 i will not calm down she screamed never before had he seen her lose control like this she looked quite demented give me back my wand give it back to me 
 
 hermione will you please c 
 
 dont you tell me what do harry potter she screeched dont you dare give it back now and you 
 
 she was pointing at ron in dire accusation it was like a malediction and harry could not blame ron for retreating several steps 
 
 i cam running after you i called you i begged you to come back 
 
 i know ron said hermione im sorry im really c 
 
 oh youre sorry 
 
 she laughed a sound ron looked at harry for help but harry merely grimaced his helplessness 
 
 you came back after weeks c weeks c and you think its all going to be all right if you just say sorry 
 
 well what else can i say ron shouted and harry was glad that ron was fighting back 
 
 oh i dont know yelled hermione with awful sarcasm rack your brains ron that should only take a couple of seconds c 
 
 hermione interjected harry who considered this a low blow he just saved my c 
 
 i dont care she screamed i dont care what hes done weeks and weeks we could have been dead for all he knew c 
 
 i knew you werent dead bellowed ron drowning her voice for the first time and approaching as close as he could with the shield charm between them harrys all over the prophet all over the radio theyre looking for you everywhere all these rumors and mental stories i knew id hear straight off if you were dead you dont know what its been like c 
 
 what its been like for you 
 
 her voice was not so shrill only bats would be able to hear it soon but she had reached a level of indignation that rendered her temporarily speechless and ron seized his opportunity 
 
 i wanted to come back the minute id disapparated but i walked straight into a gang of snatchers hermione and i couldnt go anywhere 
 
 a gang of what asked harry as hermione threw herself down into a chair with her arms and legs crossed so tightly it seemed unlikely that she would unravel them for several years 
 
 snatchers said ron theyre everywhere c gangs trying to earn gold by rounding up and blood traitors theres a reward from the ministry for everyone captured i was on my own and i look like i might be school age they got really excited thought i was a in hiding i had to talk fast to get out of being dragged to the ministry 
 
 what did you say to them 
 
 told them i was stan shunpike first person i could think of 
 
 and they believed that 
 
 they werent the brightest one of them was definitely part troll the smell of him 
 
 ron glanced at hermione clearly hopeful she might soften at this small instance of humor but her expression remained stony above her tightly knotted limbs 
 
 anyway they had a row about whether i was stan or not it was a bit pathetic to be honest but there were still five of them and only one of me and theyd taken my wand then two of them got into a fight and while the others were distracted i managed to hit the one holding me in the stomach grabbed his wand disarmed the bloke holding mine and disapparated i didnt do it so well splinched myself again c ron held up his right hand to show two missing fingernails hermione raised her eyebrows coldly c and i came out miles from where you were by the time i got back to that bit of riverbank where wed been you were gone 
 
 gosh what a gripping story hermione said in the lofty voice she adopted when wishing to wound you must have been simply terrified meanwhile we went to godrics hollow and lets think what happened there harry oh yes snake turned up it nearly killed both of us and then himself arrived and missed us by about a second 
 
 what ron said gaping from her to harry but hermione ignored him 
 
 imagine losing fingernails harry that really puts our sufferings into perspective doesnt it 
 
 hermione said harry quietly ron just saved my life 
 
 she appeared not to have heard him 
 
 one thing i would like to know though she said fixing her eyes on a spot a foot over rons head how exactly did you find us tonight thats important once we know well be able to make sure were not visited by anyone else we dont want to see 
 
 ron glared at her then pulled a small silver object from his jeans pocket 
 
 this 
 
 she had to look at ron to see what he was showing them 
 
 the deluminator she asked so surprised she forgot to look cold and fierce 
 
 it doesnt just turn the lights on and off said ron i dont know how it works or why it happened then and not any other time because ive been wanting to come back ever since i left but i was listening to the radio really early on christmas morning and i heard i heard you 
 
 he was looking at hermione 
 
 you heard me on the radio she asked incredulously 
 
 no i heard you coming out of my pocket your voice he held up the deluminator again came out of this 
 
 and what exactly did i say asked hermione her tone somewhere between skepticism and curiosity 
 
 my name ron and you said something about a wand 
 
 hermione turned a fiery shade of scarlet harry remembered it had been the first time rons name had been said aloud by either of them since the day he had left hermione had mentioned it when talking about repairing harrys wand 
 
 so i took it out ron went on looking at the deluminator and it didnt seem different or anything but i was sure id heard you so i clicked it and the light went out in my room but another light appeared right outside the window 
 
 ron raised his empty hand and pointed in front of him his eyes focused on something neither harry nor hermione could see 
 
 it was a ball of light kind of pulsing and bluish like that light you get around a portkey you know 
 
 yeah said harry and hermione together automatically 
 
 i knew this was it said ron i grabbed my stuff and packed it then i put on my rucksack and went out into the garden 
 
 the little ball of light was hovering there waiting for me and when i came out it bobbed along a bit and i followed it behind the shed and then it well it went inside me 
 
 sorry said harry sure he had not heard correctly 
 
 it sort of floated toward me said ron illustrating the movement with his free index finger right to my chest and then c it just went straight through it was here he touched a point close to his heard i could feel it it was hot and once it was inside me i knew what i was supposed to do i knew it would take me where i needed to go so i disapparated and came out on the side of a hill there was snow everywhere 
 
 we were there said harry we spent two nights there and the second night i kept thinking i could hear someone moving around in the dark and calling out 
 
 yeah well that wouldve been me said ron your protective spells work anyway because i couldnt see you and i couldnt hear you i was sure you were around though so in the end i got in my sleeping bag and waited for one of you to appear i thought youd have to show yourselves when you packed up the tent 
 
 no actually said hermione weve been disapparating under the invisibility cloak as an extra precaution and we left really early because as harry says wed heard somebody blundering around 
 
 well i stayed on that hill all day said ron i kept hoping youd appear but when it started to get dark i knew i must have missed you so i clicked the deluminator again the blue light came out and went inside me and i disapparated and arrived here in these woods i still couldnt see you so i just had to hope one of you would show yourselves in the end c and harry did well i saw the doe first obviously 
 
 you saw the what said hermione sharply 
 
 they explained what had happened and as the story of the silver doe and the sword in the pool unfolded hermione frowned form one to the other of them concentrating so hard she forgot to keep her limbs locked together 
 
 but it must have been a patronus she said couldnt you see who was casting it didnt you see anyone and it led you to the sword i cant believe this then what happened 
 
 ron explained how he had watched harry jump into the pool and had waited for him to resurface how he had realized that something was wrong dived in and saved harry then returned for the sword he got as far as the opening of the locket then hesitated and harry cut in 
 
 c and ron stabbed it with the sword 
 
 and and it went just like that she whispered 
 
 well it c it screamed said harry with half a glance at ron here 
 
 he threw the locket into her lap gingerly she picked it up and examined its punctured windows 
 
 deciding that it was at last safe to do so harry removed the shield charm with a wave of hermiones wand and turned to ron 
 
 did you just say now that you got away from the snatchers with a spare wand 
 
 what said ron who had been watching hermione examining the locket oh c oh yeah 
 
 he tugged open a buckle on his rucksack and pulled a short dark wand out of his pocket here i figured its always handy to have a backup 
 
 you were right said harry holding out his hand mines broken 
 
 youre kidding ron said but at that moment hermione got to her feet and he looked apprehensive again

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 jack the dullard 
 an old story told anew 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 far in the interior of the country lay an old baronial hall and 
 in it lived an old proprietor who had two sons which two young men 
 thought themselves too clever by half they wanted to go out and woo the daughter for the maiden in question had publicly announced that she would choose for her husband that youth who could arrange his words best 
 
 so these two geniuses prepared themselves a full week for the 
 wooing this was the longest time that could be granted them but it 
 was enough for they had had much preparatory information and 
 everybody knows how useful that is one of them knew the whole latin dictionary by heart and three whole years of the daily paper of the little town into the bargain and so well indeed that he could 
 repeat it all either backwards or forwards just as he chose the 
 other was deeply read in the corporation laws and knew by heart 
 what every corporation ought to know and accordingly he thought he 
 could talk of affairs of state and put his spoke in the wheel in 
 the council and he knew one thing more he could embroider suspenders with roses and other flowers and with arabesques for he was a tasty fellow 
 
 i shall win the princess so cried both of them therefore their 
 old papa gave to each of them a handsome horse the youth who knew the dictionary and newspaper by heart had a black horse and he who knew all about the corporation laws received a steed then they rubbed the corners of their mouths with so that they might become very smooth and glib all the servants stood below in the courtyard and looked on while they mounted their horses and just by chance the third son came up for the proprietor had really three sons though nobody counted the third with his brothers because he was not so learned as they and indeed he was generally known as jack the dullard 
 
 hallo said jack the dullard where are you going i declare 
 you have put on your sunday clothes 
 
 going to the court as suitors to the 
 daughter you know the announcement that has been made all 
 through the country and they told him all about it 
 
 my word be in it too cried jack the dullard and his 
 two brothers burst out laughing at him and rode away 
 
 father dear said jack i must have a horse too i do feel 
 so desperately inclined to marry if she accepts me she accepts me 
 and if she have me have her but she shall be mine 
 
 talk nonsense replied the old gentleman you shall 
 have no horse from me you know how to speak you 
 arrange your words your brothers are very different fellows from 
 you 
 
 well quoth jack the dullard if i have a horse 
 take the who belongs to me and he can carry me very 
 well 
 
 and so said so done he mounted the pressed his heels 
 into its sides and galloped down the high street like a hurricane 
 hei houp that was a ride here i come shouted jack the 
 dullard and he sang till his voice echoed far and wide 
 
 but his brothers rode slowly on in advance of him they spoke 
 not a word for they were thinking about the fine extempore speeches 
 they would have to bring out and these had to be cleverly prepared 
 beforehand 
 
 hallo shouted jack the dullard here am i look what i have 
 found on the high road and he showed them what it was and it was 
 a dead crow 
 
 dullard exclaimed the brothers what are you going to do 
 with that 
 
 with the crow why i am going to give it to the princess 
 
 yes do so said they and they laughed and rode on 
 
 hallo here i am again just see what i have found now you 
 find that on the high road every day 
 
 and the brothers turned round to see what he could have found now 
 
 dullard they cried that is only an old wooden shoe and the 
 upper part is missing into the bargain are you going to give that 
 also to the princess 
 
 most certainly i shall replied jack the dullard and again 
 the brothers laughed and rode on and thus they got far in advance 
 of him but 
 
 hallo hop rara and there was jack the dullard again it is 
 getting better and better he cried hurrah it is quite famous 
 
 why what have you found this time inquired the brothers 
 
 oh said jack the dullard i can hardly tell you how glad 
 the princess will be 
 
 bah said the brothers that is nothing but clay out of the 
 ditch 
 
 yes certainly it is said jack the dullard and clay of the 
 finest sort see it is so wet it runs through fingers and he 
 filled his pocket with the clay 
 
 but his brothers galloped on till the sparks flew and 
 consequently they arrived a full hour earlier at the town gate than 
 could jack now at the gate each suitor was provided with a number 
 and all were placed in rows immediately on their arrival six in 
 each row and so closely packed together that they could not move 
 their arms and that was a prudent arrangement for they would 
 certainly have come to blows had they been able merely because one of them stood before the other 
 
 all the inhabitants of the country round about stood in great 
 crowds around the castle almost under the very windows to see the 
 princess receive the suitors and as each stepped into the hall his 
 power of speech seemed to desert him like the light of a candle 
 that is blown out then the princess would say he is of no use away with him out of the hall 
 
 at last the turn came for that brother who knew the dictionary 
 by heart but he did not know it now he had absolutely forgotten it 
 altogether and the boards seemed to with his footsteps and 
 the ceiling of the hall was made of so that he saw 
 himself standing on his head and at the window stood three clerks and a head clerk and every one of them was writing down every single word that was uttered so that it might be printed in the newspapers and sold for a penny at the street corners it was a terrible ordeal and they had moreover made such a fire in the stove that the room seemed quite red hot 
 
 it is dreadfully hot here observed the first brother 
 
 yes replied the princess my father is going to roast young 
 pullets today 
 
 baa there he stood like a he had not been prepared 
 for a speech of this kind and had not a word to say though he 
 intended to say something witty baa 
 
 he is of no use said the princess away with him 
 and he was obliged to go accordingly and now the second brother 
 came in 
 
 it is terribly warm here he observed 
 
 yes roasting pullets replied the princess 
 
 what what were you were you pleased to ob stammered he and 
 all the clerks wrote down pleased to ob 
 
 he is of no use said the princess away with him 
 now came the turn of jack the dullard he rode into the hall on 
 his goat 
 
 well most abominably hot here 
 
 yes because roasting young pullets replied the princess 
 
 ah lucky exclaimed jack the dullard for i suppose 
 let me roast my crow at the same time 
 
 with the greatest pleasure said the princess but have you 
 anything you can roast it in for i have neither pot nor pan 
 
 certainly i have said jack a cooking utensil with a 
 tin handle 
 
 and he brought out the old wooden shoe and put the crow into it 
 
 well that is a famous dish said the princess but what 
 shall we do for sauce 
 
 oh i have that in my pocket said jack i have so much of it 
 that i can afford to throw some away and he poured some of the 
 clay out of his pocket 
 
 i like that said the princess you can give an answer and you 
 have something to say for yourself and so you shall be my husband 
 but are you aware that every word we speak is being taken down and 
 will be published in the paper look yonder and you will 
 see in every window three clerks and a head clerk and the old head 
 clerk is the worst of all for he understand anything 
 
 but she only said this to frighten jack the dullard and the 
 clerks gave a great crow of delight and each one spurted a blot out 
 of his pen on to the floor 
 
 oh those are the gentlemen are they said jack then i will 
 give the best i have to the head clerk and he turned out his 
 pockets and flung the wet clay full in the head face 
 
 that was very cleverly done observed the princess i could not 
 have done that but i shall learn in time 
 
 and accordingly jack the dullard was made a king and received a 
 crown and a wife and sat upon a throne and this report we have wet 
 from the press of the head clerk and the corporation of printers 
 but they are not to be depended upon in the least

who then will speak for the common good 
 barbara jordan 
 democratic national convention keynote address 
 delivered july new york ny 
 thank you ladies and gentlemen for a very warm reception 
 it was one hundred and years ago that members of the democratic party first met in convention to select a presidential candidate since that time democrats have continued to convene once every four years and draft a party platform and nominate a presidential candidate and our meeting this week is a continuation of that tradition but there is something different about tonight there is something special about tonight what is different what is special 
 i barbara jordan am a keynote speaker 
 a lot of years passed since and during that time it would have been most unusual for any national political party to ask that a barbara jordan to deliver a keynote address but tonight here i am and i feel that notwithstanding the past that my presence here is one additional bit of evidence that the american dream need not forever be deferred 
 now that i have this grand distinction what in the world am i supposed to say i could easily spend this time praising the accomplishments of this party and attacking the republicans but i choose to do that i could list the many problems which americans have i could list the problems which cause people to feel cynical angry frustrated problems which include lack of integrity in government the feeling that the individual no longer counts the reality of material and spiritual poverty the feeling that the grand american experiment is failing or has failed i could recite these problems and then i could sit down and offer no solutions but i choose to do that either the citizens of america expect more they deserve and they want more than a recital of problems 
 we are a people in a quandary about the present we are a people in search of our future we are a people in search of a national community we are a people trying not only to solve the problems of the present unemployment inflation but we are attempting on a larger scale to fulfill the promise of america we are attempting to fulfill our national purpose to create and sustain a society in which all of us are equal 
 throughout out history when people have looked for new ways to solve their problems and to uphold the principles of this nation many times they have turned to political parties they have often turned to the democratic party what is it what is it about the democratic party that makes it the instrument the people use when they search for ways to shape their future well i believe the answer to that question lies in our concept of governing our concept of governing is derived from our view of people it is a concept deeply rooted in a set of beliefs firmly etched in the national conscience of all of us 
 now what are these beliefs first we believe in equality for all and privileges for none this is a belief that each american regardless of background has equal standing in the public forum all of us because we believe this idea so firmly we are an inclusive rather than an exclusive party let everybody come i think it no accident that most of those emigrating to america in the th century identified with the democratic party we are a heterogeneous party made up of americans of diverse backgrounds 
 we believe that the people are the source of all governmental power that the authority of the people is to be extended not restricted 
 this can be accomplished only by providing each citizen with every opportunity to participate in the management of the government they must have that we believe we believe that the government which represents the authority of all the people not just one interest group but all the people has an obligation to actively underscore actively seek to remove those obstacles which would block individual achievement obstacles emanating from race sex economic condition the government must remove them seek to remove them 
 we are a party of innovation we do not reject our traditions but we are willing to adapt to changing circumstances when change we must we are willing to suffer the discomfort of change in order to achieve a better future we have a positive vision of the future founded on the belief that the gap between the promise and reality of america can one day be finally closed 
 we believe that 
 this my friends is the bedrock of our concept of governing this is a part of the reason why americans have turned to the democratic party these are the foundations upon which a national community can be built all understand that these guiding principles cannot be discarded for political gains they represent what this country is all about they are indigenous to the american idea and these are principles which are not negotiable 
 in other times i could stand here and give this kind of exposition on the beliefs of the democratic party and that would be enough but today that is not enough people want more that is not sufficient reason for the majority of the people of this country to vote democratic we have made mistakes we realize that in our haste to do all things for all people we did not foresee the full consequences of our actions and when the people raised their voices we hear but our deafness was only a temporary condition and not an irreversible condition 
 even as i stand here and admit that we have made mistakes i still believe that as the people of america sit in judgment on each party they will recognize that our mistakes were mistakes of the heart recognize that 
 and now we must look to the future let us heed the voice of the people and recognize their common sense if we do not we not only blaspheme our political heritage we ignore the common ties that bind all americans many fear the future many are distrustful of their leaders and believe that their voices are never heard many seek only to satisfy their private work wants to satisfy their private interests but this is the great danger america faces that we will cease to be one nation and become instead a collection of interest groups city against suburb region against region individual against individual each seeking to satisfy private wants if that happens who then will speak for america who then will speak for the common good 
 this is the question which must be answered in 
 are we to be one people bound together by common spirit sharing in a common endeavor or will we become a divided nation for all of its uncertainty we cannot flee the future we must not become the new puritans and reject our society we must address and master the future together it can be done if we restore the belief that we share a sense of national community that we share a common national endeavor it can be done 
 there is no executive order there is no law that can require the american people to form a national community this we must do as individuals and if we do it as individuals there is no president of the united states who can veto that decision 
 as a first step we must restore our belief in ourselves we are a generous people so why we be generous with each other we need to take to heart the words spoken by thomas jefferson 
 let us restore to social intercourse that harmony and affection without which liberty and even life are but dreary things 
 a nation is formed by the willingness of each of us to share in the responsibility for upholding the common good a government is invigorated when each of us is willing to participate in shaping the future of this nation in this election year we must define the common good and begin again to shape a common future let each person do his or her part if one citizen is unwilling to participate all of us are going to suffer for the american idea though it is shared by all of us is realized in each one of us 
 and now what are those of us who are elected public officials supposed to do we call ourselves public servants but tell you this we as public servants must set an example for the rest of the nation it is hypocritical for the public official to admonish and exhort the people to uphold the common good if we are derelict in upholding the common good more is required of public officials than slogans and handshakes and press releases more is required we must hold ourselves strictly accountable we must provide the people with a vision of the future 
 if we promise as public officials we must deliver if we as public officials propose we must produce if we say to the american people it is time for you to be sacrificial sacrifice if the public official says that we public officials must be the first to give we must be and again if we make mistakes we must be willing to admit them we have to do that what we have to do is strike a balance between the idea that government should do everything and that idea the belief that government ought to do nothing strike a balance let there be no illusions about the difficulty of forming this kind of a national community tough difficult not easy but a spirit of harmony will survive in america only if each of us remembers that we share a common destiny if each of us remembers when and bitterness seem to prevail that we share a common destiny 
 i have confidence that we can form this kind of national community 
 i have confidence that the democratic party can lead the way 
 i have that confidence 
 we cannot improve on the system of government handed down to us by the founders of the republic there is no way to improve upon that but what we can do is to find new ways to implement that system and realize our destiny 
 now i began this speech by commenting to you on the uniqueness of a barbara jordan making a keynote address well i am going to close my speech by quoting a republican president and i ask you that as you listen to these words of abraham lincoln relate them to the concept of a national community in which every last one of us participates 
 as i would not be a slave so i would not be a master this expresses my idea of democracy whatever differs from this to the extent of the difference is no democracy 
 thank you

 toward the end of winter in the house of the shcherbatskys a consultation was being held which was to determine the state of health and what was to be done to restore her failing strength she had been ill and as spring came on she grew worse the family doctor gave her oil then iron then lunar caustic but since neither the first nor the second nor the third availed and since his advice was to go abroad before the beginning of the spring a celebrated doctor was called in the celebrated doctor not yet old and a very handsome man demanded an examination of the patient he maintained with special satisfaction it seemed that maiden modesty is merely a relic of barbarism and that nothing could be more natural than for a man who was not yet old to handle a young girl in the nude he deemed this natural because he did it every day and neither felt nor thought as it seemed to him anything evil as he did it and consequently he considered girlish modesty not merely as a relic of barbarism but as well an insult to himself 
 it was necessary to submit for although all the doctors studied in the same school all using the same textbooks and all learned in the same science and though some people said this celebrated doctor was but a poor doctor in the household and circle it was for some reason held that this celebrated doctor alone had some peculiar knowledge and that he alone could save kitty after thorough examination and tapping of the patient distraught and dazed with shame the celebrated doctor having painstakingly washed his hands was standing in the drawing room talking to the prince the prince frowned and coughed as he listened to the doctor as a man who had seen something of life and neither a fool nor an invalid he had no faith in medicine and at soul was wrought up with all this comedy especially as he was probably the only one who fully understood the cause of illness barking up the wrong tree he mentally applied this phrase from the vocabulary to the celebrated doctor as he listened to the patter about the symptoms of his complaint the doctor for his part found difficulty in restraining the expression of his contempt for this old grandee as well as in condescending to the low level of his comprehension he perceived that it was useless to talk to the old man and that the head of this house was the mother and she it was before whom he intended to scatter his pearls it was at this point that the princess entered the drawing room with the family doctor the prince retreated doing his best not to betray how ridiculous he regarded the whole comedy the princess was distraught and did not know what to do she felt herself at fault before kitty 
 well doctor decide our fate said the princess tell me everything is there any hope was what she had wanted to say but her lips quivered and she could not utter this question well doctor 
 immediately princess i will discuss the matter with my colleague and then have the honor of laying my opinion before you 
 then we had better leave you 
 as you please 
 the princess with a sigh stepped outside 
 when the doctors were left alone the family doctor began timidly explaining his opinion that there was an incipient tubercular process but and so on the celebrated doctor listened to him and in the middle of the speech looked at his big gold watch 
 that is so said he but 
 the family doctor respectfully ceased in the middle of his speech 
 as you know we cannot determine the incipience of the tubercular process until the appearance of vomicae there is nothing determinate but we may suspect it and there are indications malnutrition nervous excitability and so on the question stands thus if we suspect a tubercular process what must we do to maintain nutrition 
 but then you know there are always moral spiritual causes at the back of these cases the family doctor permitted himself to interpolate with a subtle smile 
 yes to be taken for granted retorted the celebrated doctor again glancing at his watch beg pardon but is the iauzsky bridge finished yet or must one still make a detour he asked ah it is finished well in that case i can make it in twenty minutes as we were saying the question may be posited thus the nutrition must be maintained and the nerves improved the one is bound with the other one must work upon both sides of this circle 
 but what about the trip abroad asked the family doctor 
 i am a foe to trips abroad and take notice if there is any incipient tubercular process which we cannot know a trip abroad will not help we must have a remedy that would improve nutrition and do no harm 
 and the celebrated doctor expounded his plan of treatment with soden waters in designating which his main end was evidently their harmlessness 
 the family doctor heard him out attentively and respectfully 
 but in favor of foreign travel i would urge the change of habits the removal from conditions which evoke memories and then the mother wishes it he added 
 ah well in that case one might go well let them go but those german charlatans may do harm our instructions ought to be followed well let them go then 
 he again glanced at his watch 
 oh time to go and he went to the door 
 the celebrated doctor informed the princess prompted by a feeling of propriety that he must see the patient once more 
 what another examination the mother exclaimed in horror 
 oh no i merely need certain details princess 
 come this way 
 and the mother followed by the doctor went into the drawing room to kitty wasted and blushing with a peculiar glitter in her eyes a consequence of the shame she had gone through kitty was standing in the middle of the room when the doctor came in she turned crimson and her eyes filled with tears all her illness and its treatment seemed to her a thing so stupid even funny treatment seemed to her as funny as reconstructing the pieces of a broken vase it was her heart that was broken why then did they want to cure her with pills and powders but she could not hurt her mother all the more so since her mother considered herself to blame 
 may i trouble you to sit down princess the celebrated doctor said to her 
 smiling he sat down facing her felt her pulse and again started in with his tiresome questions she answered him and suddenly becoming angry got up 
 you must pardon me doctor but really this will lead us nowhere you ask me the same things three times running 
 the celebrated doctor did not take umbrage 
 sickly irritability said he to the princess when kitty had left the room however i had finished 
 and the doctor scientifically defined to the princess as to an exceptionally clever woman the condition of the young princess and concluded by explaining the mode of drinking the unnecessary waters when the question of going abroad came up the doctor was plunged into profound considerations as though deciding a weighty problem finally his decision was given they might go abroad but must put no faith in charlatans but turn to him in everything 
 it seemed as though some cheerful influence had sprung up after the departure the mother grew more cheerful when she returned to her daughter while kitty too pretended to be more cheerful she had frequent almost constant occasions to be pretending now 
 really quite well maman but if you want to go abroad she said and trying to show that she was interested in the proposed trip she began talking of the preparations for the departure

 chapter 
 
 right after the doctor dolly arrived she knew that the consultation was scheduled for that day and despite the fact that she had only recently gotten up from her she had had another little girl at the end of the winter despite her having enough trouble and cares of her own she had left her breast baby and an ailing girl to come and learn fate which was being decided that day 
 well what said she entering into the drawing room without taking off her hat all in good spirits that means good news then 
 an attempt was made to tell her what the doctor had said but it proved that even though the doctor had talked coherently and long it was utterly impossible to convey what he had said the only point of interest was that going abroad was definitely decided upon 
 dolly could not help sighing her dearest friend her sister was going away and her life was far from gay her relations with stepan arkadyevich after their reconciliation had become humiliating the welding anna had made proved not at all solid and family concord had broken down again at the same point there was nothing definite but stepan arkadyevich was hardly ever at home also there was hardly ever any money and dolly was constantly being tortured by suspicions of infidelities and by now she drove them away from her dreading the agony of jealousy she had already experienced the first explosion of jealousy once lived through could never return and even the discovery of infidelities could never affect her now as it had the first time such a discovery now would only mean breaking up her family habits and she permitted him to deceive her despising him and still more herself for this weakness besides this the cares of her large family were a constant torment to her now the nursing of her breast baby did not go well now the nurse would leave now as at the present time one of the children would fall ill 
 well everybody in your family asked her mother 
 ah maman we have enough trouble of our own lili has taken ill and afraid scarlatina i have come here now to find out about kitty and then i shall shut myself up entirely if god forbid it really be scarlatina 
 the old prince too had come in from his study after the departure and after offering his cheek to dolly and chatting awhile with her he turned to his wife 
 what have you decided are you going well and what do you want to do with me 
 i think you had better stay here alexandre said his wife 
 just as you wish 
 maman why father come with us said kitty feel better and so will we 
 the old prince got up and stroked hair she lifted her head and looked at him with a forced smile it always seemed to her that he understood her better than anyone else in the family did though he spoke but little with her being the youngest she was her favorite and she fancied that his love for her gave him insight when now her gaze met his blue kindly eyes scrutinizing her intently it seemed to her that he saw right through her and understood all the evil things that were at work within her reddening she was drawn toward him expecting a kiss but he merely patted her hair and said 
 these silly chignons one as much as get near real daughter but simply stroke the hair of defunct females well dolinka he turned to his elder daughter your ace up to now 
 nothing papa answered dolly who knew that this referred to her husband always out i hardly ever see him she could not resist adding with a mocking smile 
 why he gone into the country yet about the sale of the forest

 see what comes of your jokes the princess pounced on her husband always she launched into her reproachful speech 
 the prince listened to the reproaches rather a long while and kept silent but his face grew more and more glowering

 right after the doctor dolly arrived she knew that the consultation was scheduled for that day and despite the fact that she had only recently gotten up from her she had had another little girl at the end of the winter despite her having enough trouble and cares of her own she had left her breast baby and an ailing girl to come and learn fate which was being decided that day 
 well what said she entering into the drawing room without taking off her hat all in good spirits that means good news then 
 an attempt was made to tell her what the doctor had said but it proved that even though the doctor had talked coherently and long it was utterly impossible to convey what he had said the only point of interest was that going abroad was definitely decided upon 
 dolly could not help sighing her dearest friend her sister was going away and her life was far from gay her relations with stepan arkadyevich after their reconciliation had become humiliating the welding anna had made proved not at all solid and family concord had broken down again at the same point there was nothing definite but stepan arkadyevich was hardly ever at home also there was hardly ever any money and dolly was constantly being tortured by suspicions of infidelities and by now she drove them away from her dreading the agony of jealousy she had already experienced the first explosion of jealousy once lived through could never return and even the discovery of infidelities could never affect her now as it had the first time such a discovery now would only mean breaking up her family habits and she permitted him to deceive her despising him and still more herself for this weakness besides this the cares of her large family were a constant torment to her now the nursing of her breast baby did not go well now the nurse would leave now as at the present time one of the children would fall ill 
 well everybody in your family asked her mother 
 ah maman we have enough trouble of our own lili has taken ill and afraid scarlatina i have come here now to find out about kitty and then i shall shut myself up entirely if god forbid it really be scarlatina 
 the old prince too had come in from his study after the departure and after offering his cheek to dolly and chatting awhile with her he turned to his wife 
 what have you decided are you going well and what do you want to do with me 
 i think you had better stay here alexandre said his wife 
 just as you wish 
 maman why father come with us said kitty feel better and so will we 
 the old prince got up and stroked hair she lifted her head and looked at him with a forced smile it always seemed to her that he understood her better than anyone else in the family did though he spoke but little with her being the youngest she was her favorite and she fancied that his love for her gave him insight when now her gaze met his blue kindly eyes scrutinizing her intently it seemed to her that he saw right through her and understood all the evil things that were at work within her reddening she was drawn toward him expecting a kiss but he merely patted her hair and said 
 these silly chignons one as much as get near real daughter but simply stroke the hair of defunct females well dolinka he turned to his elder daughter your ace up to now 
 nothing papa answered dolly who knew that this referred to her husband always out i hardly ever see him she could not resist adding with a mocking smile 
 why he gone into the country yet about the sale of the forest 
 no still getting ready 
 oh it said the prince and so to be getting ready too at your service he said to his wife sitting down and as for you katia he went on addressing his younger daughter you must wake up one fine day and say to yourself why quite well and merry and going out again with papa for an early morning stroll in the frost eh

 when she went into little sanctum a pretty rosy little room full of knickknacks in vieux saxe as youthful and rosy and gay as kitty herself had been only two months ago dolly recalled how they had together decorated the room the year before with what gaiety and love her heart turned cold when she beheld kitty sitting on the low chair nearest the door her eyes fixed immovably on a corner of the rug kitty glanced at her sister and the cold rather austere expression of her face did not change 
 going now and shall entrench myself at home and you be able to come to see me said darya alexandrovna sitting down beside her i want to talk to you 
 what about kitty asked swiftly lifting her head in fright 
 what should it be save grieving you 
 i have no grief 
 come kitty do you possibly think i cannot know i know all and believe me this is so insignificant all been through it 
 kitty did not speak and her face had a stern expression 
 not worth your suffering on his account pursued darya alexandrovna coming straight to the point 
 yes because he has disdained me said kitty in a jarring voice say anything please say anything 
 but whoever told you that no one has said that certain he was in love with you and remained in love with you but 
 oh the most awful thing of all for me are these condolences cried out kitty in a sudden fit of anger she turned round on her chair turned red and her fingers moved quickly as she pinched the buckle of the belt she held now with one hand now with the other dolly knew this trick her sister had of grasping something in turn with each of her hands when in excitement she knew that in a moment of excitement kitty was capable of forgetting herself and saying a great deal too much and much that was unpleasant and dolly would have calmed her but it was already too late 
 what what is it you want to make me feel eh said kitty quickly that been in love with a man who even care to know me and that dying for love of him and this is said to me by my own sister who imagines that that that sympathizing with me i want these condolences and hypocrisies 
 kitty unjust 
 why do you torment me 
 but i on the contrary i can see hurt 
 but kitty in her heat did not hear her 
 nothing to despair over and be comforted about sufficiently proud never to allow myself to care for a man who does not love me 
 why i say anything of the kind only tell me the truth said darya alexandrovna taking her by the hand tell me did levin speak to you 
 the mention of levin seemed to deprive kitty of the last vestige of she leaped up from her chair and flinging the buckle to the ground gesticulating rapidly with her hands she said 
 why bring levin in too i understand what you want to torture me for told you and i repeat it i have some pride and never never would i do what doing going back to a man deceived you who has come to love another woman i understand this you may but i do it 
 and having said these words she glanced at her sister and seeing that dolly sat silent her head mournfully bowed kitty instead of leaving the room as she had intended sat down near the door and hiding her face in her shawl let her head drop 
 the silence lasted for two minutes thoughts were of herself that humiliation of which she was always conscious came back to her with special pain when her sister reminded her of it she had not expected such cruelty from her sister and was resentful but suddenly she heard the rustle of a skirt and simultaneously an outburst of smothered sobbing and felt arms clasping her neck from below kitty was on her knees before her 
 dolinka i am so so unhappy she whispered penitently 
 and the endearing face covered with tears hid itself in darya skirt 
 it was as if tears were the indispensable oil without which the machinery of mutual communion could not run smoothly between the two sisters the sisters after their tears discussed everything but that which engrossed them but even in talking of outside matters they understood one another kitty knew that what she had uttered in anger about her infidelity and her humiliating position had struck her poor sister to the very depths of her heart but she also knew that the latter had forgiven her dolly for her part had comprehended all she had wanted to find out she had become convinced that her surmises were correct that misery her incurable misery was due precisely to the fact that levin had proposed to her and she had refused him while vronsky had deceived her and that she stood ready to love levin and to hate vronsky kitty said no word of this she spoke of nothing save her own spiritual state 
 i have nothing to grieve over she said calming down but you could understand that everything has become loathsome hateful coarse to me and i myself most of all you imagine what loathsome thoughts i have about everything 
 why whatever loathsome thoughts can you have asked dolly smiling 
 most most loathsome and coarse i tell you this is not melancholy nor boredom but far worse as if everything of good that i had were gone out of sight while only that which was most loathsome were left well how shall i put it to you she went on seeing incomprehension in her eyes papa began saying something to me just now it seems to me he thinks all i need is to marry if mamma takes me to a ball it seems to me she takes me only to marry me off as fast as possible and get me off her hands i know this so but i drive away such thoughts these suitors so called i bear the sight of them it seems to me as if always taking stock of me formerly to go anywhere in a ball dress was a downright joy to me i used to admire myself now i feel ashamed in at ease well take any example you like this doctor now 
 kitty hesitated she wanted to say further that ever since this change had taken place in her stepan arkadyevich had become unbearably repulsive to her and that she could not see him without imagining the grossest and most hideous things 
 well now everything appears to me in the coarsest most loathsome aspect she went on that is my ailment perhaps all this will pass 
 try not to think of such things 
 i help it i feel well only when i am with the children at your house 
 what a pity you visit me 
 oh yes come had scarlatina and persuade maman to let me come 
 kitty insisted on having her way and went to stay at her and nursed the children all through the scarlatina for it really proved to be scarlatina the two sisters brought all the six children successfully through it health however did not improve and in lent the shcherbatskys went abroad

 there is really only one circle of peterburg upper society everyone knows everyone else even visits each other but this great circle has subdivisions of its own anna arkadyevna karenina had friends and close ties in three different circles one circle was her set of civil servants and officials consisting of his colleagues and subordinates brought together in a most diversified and capricious manner yet separated by social conditions anna could now recall only with difficulty the feeling of almost pious reverence which she had at first borne for these persons now she knew all of them as people know one another in a provincial town she knew their habits and weaknesses and where the shoe pinched each one of them she knew their attitudes toward one another and to the chief center knew who backed whom and how and wherewithal each one maintained his position and who agreed or disagreed with whom but this circle of political masculine interests could not interest her and in spite of countess lidia suggestions she avoided it 
 another small circle with which anna was intimate was the one by means of which alexei alexandrovich had made his career the center of this circle was the countess lidia ivanovna this was a circle of elderly homely virtuous and pious women and clever learned and ambitious men one of the clever people belonging to this small circle had called it the conscience of peterburg society alexei alexandrovich appreciated this circle very much and anna who knew so well how to get on with all had in the early days of her life in peterburg found friends even in this circle but now upon her return from moscow this set had become unbearable to her it seemed to her that both she and all of them were dissimulating and she experienced such boredom and lack of ease in their society that she tried to visit the countess lidia ivanovna as infrequently as possible 
 and finally the third circle with which anna had ties was the really fashionable world the world of balls of dinners of sumptuous dresses the world that hung on to the court with one hand in order not to sink to the level of the demimonde which the members of the fashionable world believed they despised yet the tastes of both were not only similar but precisely the same her connection with this circle was maintained through princess betsy tverskaia her wife who had an income of a hundred and twenty thousand roubles and who had taken a great liking to anna ever since she first came out looking after her and drawing her into her own circle poking fun at that of countess lidia ivanovna 
 when old and shall have lost my looks be the same betsy used to say but for a young and pretty woman like you much too early to join that old ladies home 
 anna had at first avoided as much as she could princess world because it necessitated expenditures above her means and besides at soul she preferred the first circle but after her trip to moscow things fell out quite the other way she avoided her moral friends and went out into the fashionable world there she would meet vronsky and experienced an agitating joy at such meetings especially often did she meet vronsky at for betsy was a vronsky by birth and his cousin vronsky went everywhere where he might meet anna and at every chance he had spoke to her of his love she offered him no encouragement yet every time she met him there was kindled in her soul that same feeling of animation which had come upon her that day in the railway carriage when she had seen him for the first time she felt herself that her delight shone in her eyes and puckered her lips into a smile and she could not quench the expression of this delight 
 at first anna had sincerely believed that she was displeased with him for daring to pursue her but not long after her return from moscow on arriving at a soiree where she had anticipated meeting him yet not finding him there she realized clearly from the feeling of sadness which overcame her that she had been deceiving herself and that this pursuit was not merely not distasteful to her but that it constituted all the interest of her life 
 it was the second performance of a celebrated cantatrice and all the fashionable world was in the theater vronsky seeing his cousin from his seat in the front row did not wait till the but went to her box 
 why you come to dinner she said to him i marvel at this clairvoyance of lovers she added with a smile so that no one but he could hear she there but do come after the opera 
 vronsky looked inquiringly at her she nodded he thanked her by a smile and sat down beside her 
 but how i remember your jeers continued princess betsy who took special delight in following up the progress of this passion become of all that caught my dear fellow 
 my one desire to be caught answered vronsky with his calm smile if i complain at all only that not caught enough if the truth were told i begin to lose hope 
 why whatever hope can you expect said betsy offended on behalf of her friend entendons nous but in her eyes flitted gleams of light which proclaimed that she understood very well even as much as he did what hope he might entertain 
 none whatever said vronsky laughing and showing his closely set teeth excuse me he added taking the binoculars out of her hand and proceeding to scrutinize over her bare shoulder the row of boxes opposite them afraid becoming ridiculous 
 he was very well aware that he ran no risk of being ridiculous in the eyes of betsy and all other fashionable people he was very well aware that in the eyes of these people the role of the hapless lover of a girl or in general of any woman free to marry might be ridiculous but the role of a man pursuing a married woman and regardless of everything staking his life on drawing her into adultery that role has something beautiful and majestic about it and can never be ridiculous and so it was with a proud and gay smile under his mustaches that he lowered the binoculars and looked at his cousin 
 but why you come to dinner she said admiring him 
 i must tell you about that i was busy and with what do you suppose give you a hundred guesses a thousand never guess been reconciling a husband with a man insulted his wife yes really 
 well did you reconcile them 
 almost 
 you really must tell me about it she said getting up come to me in the next 
 i going to the french theater 
 leaving nilsson betsy queried in horror though she could not herself have distinguished nilsson from any chorus girl 
 what can i do an appointment there all because of my mission of peace 
 blessed are the peacemakers they shall be saved said betsy recalling something of that sort she had heard from somebody or other very well then sit down and tell me what all about

 chapter 
 
 this is rather indiscreet but so charming that one is awfully tempted to tell the story said vronsky looking at her with laughing eyes i intend to mention any names 
 but i shall guess them so much the better 
 listen then two festive young men were driving along 
 officers of your regiment of course 
 i say they were officers just two young men who had been lunching 
 in other words drinking 
 possibly they were driving on their way to dinner with a friend in the gayest of moods and they catch sight of a pretty woman in a hired sleigh who overtakes them looks back at them and so it seemed to them at any rate nods to them and laughs they of course follow her galloping at full speed to their amazement the fair one alights at the entrance of the very house to which they were going the fair one darts upstairs to the top floor all they got was a glimpse of rosebud lips under a short veil and of exquisite little feet 
 you tell this with such feeling that it seems to me you yourself must have been one of the two 
 but what did you tell me just now well the young men enter their apartment he was giving a farewell dinner there they certainly did take a drop too much as is always the case at farewell dinners and at dinner they inquire who lives at the top in that house no one knows only their valet in answer to their inquiry whether any young ladies are living on the top floor answered that there were a great many of them after dinner the two young men go into their study and write a letter to the fair unknown they composed a passionate epistle really a declaration and then carry the letter upstairs themselves so as to explain whatever might prove not altogether clear in the letter 
 why do you tell me such nasty things and then 
 they ring a maidservant opens the door they hand her the letter and assure her that both so enamored that die on the spot at the door the maid stupefied carries on the negotiations suddenly a gentleman appears with side whiskers like country sausages he is as red as a lobster and informing them that there is no one living in that flat except his wife he sends them both packing 
 how do you know he had side whiskers like sausages as you put it 
 ah do but listen recently i went to make peace between them 
 well and what was the upshot 
 the most interesting part this couple turned out to be a most happy one a government clerk and his lady the government clerk lodges a complaint whereupon i become a mediator and what a mediator i assure you talleyrand was a nobody compared to me 
 just what was the difficulty 
 ah do but listen we make fitting apologies we are in despair we entreat forgiveness for the unfortunate misunderstanding the government clerk with the country sausages begins to melt and he too desires to express his sentiments but no sooner does he begin to express them than he gets heated and says nasty things and again obliged to trot out all my diplomatic talents i agree that their action was bad but i beg of you to take into consideration the misunderstanding and their youth besides the young men had just come from their lunch you understand their repentance is heartfelt and they beg you to forgive their misbehavior the government clerk was softened once more i consent count and am ready to forgive but you must understand that my wife my wife a respectable woman is subjected to annoyances and insults and impertinences by certain milksops scou yet you understand the milksop is present and it is up to me to make peace between them again i trot out all my diplomacy and again just as the matter is about to be concluded our friend the government clerk gets heated and turns red while his country sausages bristle up and i once more exert diplomatic finesse 
 ah you must hear this story said betsy laughing to a lady who was entering the box he has made me laugh so much well bonne chance she added giving vronsky the one finger free from holding her fan and with a shrug of her shoulders letting down the bodice of her gown that had worked up so as to be fittingly and fully nude as she moved forward toward the footlights into the lights of the gas and within the ken of all 
 vronsky drove to the french theater where he really had to see the colonel of his regiment who never missed a single performance there he wanted to talk over his peacemaking which had been occupying and amusing him for the last three days petritsky whom he liked was implicated in the affair as well as another fine fellow and excellent comrade who had lately joined the regiment the young prince kedrov but mainly the interests of the regiment were involved as well 
 both culprits were in squadron the colonel of the regiment had received a call from the government clerk venden with a complaint against his officers who had insulted his wife his young wife as venden told the story he had been married half a year had been at church with her mother and suddenly feeling indisposed due to her interesting condition found that she could not remain standing and drove home in the first sleigh with the mettlesome coachman she came across it was then that the officers set off in pursuit of her she was alarmed and feeling still worse ran home up the staircase venden himself on returning from his office had heard a ring at their bell and voices had stepped out and seeing the intoxicated officers with a letter he had pushed them out he was asking that the culprits be severely punished 
 you may say what you will said the colonel to vronsky whom he had invited to come and see him petritsky is becoming impossible not a week goes by without some scrape this clerk chap let matters drop go on with the thing 
 vronsky saw all the thanklessness of the business and that a duel was out of the question here that everything must be done to soften this government clerk and hush the matter up the colonel had called in vronsky precisely because he knew him to be an honorable and intelligent man but above all one to whom the honor of the regiment was dear they talked it over and decided that petritsky and kedrov must go with vronsky to this government clerk and apologize the colonel and vronsky were both fully aware that name and insignia of were bound to go a long way toward softening the government clerk and these two influences proved in fact not without effect though the result of the mediation remained as vronsky had described uncertain 
 on reaching the french theater vronsky retired to the foyer with the colonel and reported to him his success or lack of it the colonel thinking it all over decided not to go on with the matter but then for his own delectation proceeded to question vronsky about the details of his interview and for a long while could not restrain his laughter as he listened to story of how the government clerk after subsiding for a while would suddenly flare up again as he recalled the details and how vronsky at the last of conciliation had skillfully maneuvered a retreat shoving petritsky out before him 
 a disgraceful scrape but a killing one kedrov really fight this gentleman so he was awfully wrought up he asked again laughing but what do you think of claire today a wonder he went on speaking of a new french actress no matter how often you see her different each time only the french who can do that

 chapter 
 
 princess betsy drove home from the theater without waiting for the end of the last act she had just time enough to go into her dressing room sprinkle her long pale face with powder rub it off set her dress to rights and order tea in the big drawing room when one after another carriages drove up to her huge house on the bolshaia morskaia her guests dismounted at the wide entrance and the stout porter who used to read newspapers mornings behind the glass door to the edification of the noiselessly opened the immense door letting the visitors pass by him into the house 
 almost at the same instant that the hostess with freshly arranged coiffure and freshened face entered at one door her guests entered at the other into the drawing room a large room with dark walls downy rugs and a brightly lighted table gleaming with the light of candles the whiteness of napery the silver of the samovar and the tea service of transparent porcelain 
 the hostess sat down at the samovar and took off her gloves chairs were set with the aid of footmen moving almost imperceptibly about the room the party settled itself divided into two groups one round the samovar near the hostess the other at the opposite end of the drawing room round the handsome wife of an ambassador in black velvet with sharply defined black eyebrows in both groups conversation wavered as it always does for the first few minutes broken up by meetings salutations offers of tea and as it were seeking for some point in common 
 exceptionally fine as an actress one can see studied kaulbach said a diplomatist in the circle of the wife did you notice how she fell down 
 oh please let us talk about nilsson no one can possibly say anything new about her said a fat lady without eyebrows and without chignon wearing an old silk dress this was princess miaghkaia noted for her simplicity and the roughness of her manners and nicknamed enfant terrible princess miaghkaia was seated halfway between the two groups and listening to both took part in the conversation first of one and then of the other three people have used that very phrase about kaulbach to me today just as though they had conspired and i know why that phrase should be so much to their liking 
 the conversation was cut short by this observation and again a new subject had to be thought of 
 do tell us something amusing yet not spiteful said the wife a great proficient in the art of that elegant conversation called by the english small talk she addressed the diplomatist who was now at a loss just what to begin upon 
 that is said to be a difficult task only that which is spiteful is supposed to be amusing he began with a smile however make the attempt give me a theme all a matter of the theme if the theme be but given easy enough to embroider it i often think that the celebrated conversationalists of the last century would find it difficult to talk cleverly now everything clever has become such a bore 
 that has been said long ago the wife interrupted him laughing 
 the conversation had begun amiably but just because it was too amiable it came to a stop again they had to have recourse to the sure remedy malicious gossip 
 you think something louis quinze about tushkevich he said glancing toward a handsome young man standing at the table 
 oh yes in the same style as the drawing room and why it is so often here 
 this conversation was kept up since it depended on allusions to what could not be talked of in that room that is to say of the relations of tushkevich with their hostess 
 round the samovar and the hostess the conversation having in the meanwhile vacillated in precisely the same way between the three inevitable topics the latest piece of public news the theater and censuring the fellow creature had finally come to rest on the last topic that is malicious gossip 
 have you heard that even the maltishcheva the mother not the daughter has ordered a costume in diable rose color 
 impossible no just charming 
 i wonder that with her sense for after all no fool she see how funny she is 
 every one had something to say in censure or ridicule of the hapless maltishcheva and the conversation crackled merrily like a blazing bonfire 
 the husband of princess betsy a corpulent man an ardent collector of engravings hearing that his wife had visitors had come into the drawing room before leaving for his club stepping noiselessly over the thick rugs he approached princess miaghkaia 
 how did you like nilsson he asked 
 oh how can you steal up on anyone like that how you startled me she responded please talk to me about the opera you know nothing about music rather come down to your own level and discuss with you your majolica and engravings come now what treasure have you been buying lately at the rag fair 
 would you like me to show you but you understand such things 
 yes show me been learning about them at those their names those bankers they have some splendid engravings they showed them to us 
 why have you been at the schutzburgs asked the hostess from behind the samovar 
 yes ma chre they asked my husband and myself to dinner and i was told that the sauce at that dinner cost a thousand roubles princess miaghkaia said speaking loudly conscious that all were listening and very nasty sauce it was some green mess we had to ask them and i made a sauce for kopecks and everybody was very much pleased with it i afford sauces 
 unique said the lady of the house 
 amazing somebody else added 
 the effect produced by princess speeches was always the same and the secret of the effect she produced lay in the fact that though she spoke not always appropriately as now she said homely truths not devoid of sense in the society in which she lived such utterances had the same result as the most pungent wit princess miaghkaia could never see why it had that result but she knew it had and took advantage of it 
 since everyone had been listening while princess miaghkaia spoke and the conversation around the wife had dropped princess betsy tried to bring the whole party together and she addressed the wife 
 really you have tea do come and join us 
 no very comfortable here the wife responded with a smile and went on with the interrupted conversation 
 it was a most agreeable conversation they were censuring the karenins husband and wife 
 anna is quite changed since her stay in moscow something strange about her said one of her feminine friends 
 the great change is that she has brought back with her the shadow of alexei vronsky said the wife 
 well what of it a fable of about a man without a shadow a man deprived of his shadow as a punishment for something or other i never could understand just how this was a punishment yet a woman must probably feel uncomfortable without a shadow 
 yes but women followed by a shadow usually come to a bad end said friend 
 bite your tongue said princess miaghkaia suddenly karenina is a splendid woman i like her husband but her i like very much 
 why you like her husband such a remarkable man said the wife my husband says there are few statesmen like him in europe 
 and my husband tells me just the same but i believe it said princess miaghkaia if our husbands talk to us we should see the facts as they are alexei alexandrovich to my thinking is simply a fool i say it in a whisper but it really make everything clear before when i was told to consider him clever i kept looking for his ability and thought myself a fool for not seeing it but directly i said a fool though only in a whisper everything became clear that so 
 how spiteful you are today 
 not a bit no other way out of it one of us two had to be the fool and as you know one could never say that of oneself 
 no one is satisfied with his fortune and everyone is satisfied with his wit the diplomatist repeated the french saying 
 it just it princess miaghkaia turned to him promptly but the point is that i abandon anna to your mercies such a dear so charming how can she help it if all in love with her and follow her about like shadows 
 oh i had no idea of censuring her friend said in 
 if we have no shadows following us it does not prove that any right to blame her 
 and having duly disposed of friend the princess miaghkaia got up and together with the wife joined the group at the table where the general conversation had to do with the king of prussia 
 what were you gossiping so maliciously about asked betsy 
 about the karenins the princess gave us a character sketch of alexei alexandrovich said the wife with a smile as she sat down at the table 
 pity we hear it said princess betsy glancing toward the door ah here you are at last she said turning with a smile to vronsky who was entering 
 vronsky was not merely acquainted with all the persons whom he was meeting here he saw them all every day and so he came in with the quiet manner with which one enters a room full of people whom one had left only a short while ago 
 where do i come from he repeated the question of the wife well no help for it i must confess from the opera bouffe i do believe seen it a hundred times and always with fresh enjoyment exquisite i know disgraceful but i go to sleep at the opera yet i sit out the opera bouffe to the last minute and enjoy it this evening 
 he mentioned a french actress and was about to tell something about her but the wife with playful trepidation cut him short 
 please tell us about that horror 
 very well i especially as everyone knows those horrors 
 and we should all go to see them if it were accepted as the correct thing like the opera chimed in princess miaghkaia

 steps were heard at the door and princess betsy knowing it was madame karenina glanced at vronsky he was looking toward the door and his face wore a strange new expression joyfully intently and at the same time timidly he gazed at the approaching figure and slowly he rose to his feet anna walked into the drawing room holding herself extremely erect as always looking straight before her and moving with her swift resolute and light step that distinguished her walk from that of other society women she crossed the few paces that separated her from her hostess shook hands with her smiled and with the same smile looked around at vronsky vronsky bowed low and pushed a chair up for her 
 she acknowledged this only by a slight nod flushed and frowned but immediately while rapidly greeting her acquaintances and shaking the hands proffered to her she addressed princess betsy 
 i have been at countess and meant to have come here earlier but i stayed on sir john was there a most interesting man 
 oh this missionary 
 yes he told us about life in india most interestingly 
 the conversation interrupted by her coming in flickered up again like the light of a lamp being blown out 
 sir john yes sir john seen him he speaks well vlassieva is altogether in love with him 
 and is it true that the younger vlassieva is to marry topov 
 yes they say quite settled 
 i wonder at the parents they say a marriage of passion 
 of passion what antediluvian notions you have whoever talks of passion nowadays said the wife 
 what would you do this silly old fashion is still far from dead said vronsky 
 so much the worse for those who keep up the fashion the only happy marriages i know are marriages of prudence 
 yes but then how often the happiness of these prudent marriages is scattered like dust precisely because that passion to which recognition has been denied appears on the scene said vronsky 
 but by marriages of prudence we mean those in which both parties have sown their wild oats already like scarlatina one has to go through with it and get it over with 
 in that case we must learn how to vaccinate for love like 
 i was in love in my young days with a church clerk said the princess miaghkaia i know that it did me any good 
 no i think all jokes aside that to know love one must first make a fault and then mend it said princess betsy 
 even after marriage said the wife playfully 
 never too late to mend the diplomatist repeated the english proverb 
 just so betsy agreed one must make a mistake and rectify it what do you think about it she turned to anna who with a barely perceptible resolute smile on her lips was listening to the conversation 
 i think said anna playing with the glove she had taken off i think if there are as many minds as there are heads then surely there must be as many kinds of love as there are hearts 
 vronsky was gazing at anna and with a heart sinking was waiting for what she would say he sighed as after a danger escaped when she had uttered these words 
 anna suddenly turned to him 
 oh i have had a letter from moscow they write me that kitty very ill 
 really said vronsky knitting his brows 
 anna looked sternly at him 
 that interest you 
 on the contrary it does very much what is it exactly that they write you if may know he asked 
 anna got up and went to betsy 
 give me a cup of tea she said pausing behind her chair 
 while betsy was pouring out the tea vronsky walked up to anna 
 what is it they write you he repeated 
 i often think men have no understanding of what is dishonorable though forever talking of it said anna without answering him wanted to tell you something for a long while she added and moving a few steps away she sat down at a corner table which held albums 
 i quite understand the significance of your words he said handing her the cup 
 she glanced towards the sofa beside her and he instantly sat down 
 yes wanted to tell you she said without looking at him your action was wrong wrong very wrong 
 do you suppose i know that acted wrongly but who was the cause of my doing so 
 why do you say that to me she said looking at him sternly 
 you know why he answered boldly and joyously meeting her glance and without dropping his eyes 
 it was not he but she who became confused 
 that merely proves you have no heart she said but her eyes said that she knew he had a heart and that was why she was afraid of him 
 what you spoke of just now was a mistake and not love 
 remember that i have forbidden you to utter that word that detestable word said anna with a shudder but at once she felt that by that very word forbidden she had shown that she acknowledged certain rights over him and by that very fact was encouraging him to speak of love i have long meant to tell you this she went on looking resolutely into his eyes and all aflame from the burning flush on her cheeks come here purposely this evening knowing i should meet you i have come to tell you that this must end i have never blushed before anyone and you force me to feel guilty of something 
 he looked at her and was struck by a new spiritual beauty in her face 
 what do you wish of me he said simply and gravely 
 i want you to go to moscow and ask for forgiveness she said 
 that is not your wish he said 
 he saw she was saying what she was forcing herself to say not what she wanted to say 
 if you love me as you say she whispered you will do this so that i may be at peace 
 his face grew radiant 
 you know that all my life to me but i know no peace and i give it to you all of myself and love yes i think of you and myself apart you and i are one to me and i see no possibility before us of peace either for me or for you i see a possibility of despair of wretchedness or else i see a possibility of happiness and what a happiness can it be impossible he added his lips barely moving yet she heard 
 she strained every effort of her mind to say what ought to be said but instead of that she let her eyes rest on him full of love and made no answer 
 come he thought in ecstasy when i was beginning to despair and it seemed there would be no end come she loves me she owns it 
 then do this for me never say such things to me and let us be friends she said in words but her eyes spoke quite differently 
 friends we shall never be that you know yourself whether we shall be the happiest or the most wretched of people that lies within your power 
 she would have said something but he interrupted her 
 for i ask but one thing i ask for the right to hope to suffer even as i am doing now but if even that cannot be command me to disappear and i disappear you shall not see me if my presence is painful to you 
 i want to drive you away 
 only change anything leave everything as it is said he in a shaky voice your husband 
 at that instant alexei alexandrovich did in fact walk into the room with his calm ungainly gait 
 glancing at his wife and vronsky he went up to the lady of the house and sitting down for a cup of tea began talking in his unhasty always audible voice in his habitual tone of banter as if he were teasing someone 
 your rambouillet is in full conclave he said looking round at all the party the graces and the muses 
 but princess betsy could not endure that tone of his sneering as she called it using the english word and like a clever hostess she at once brought him around to a serious conversation on the subject of universal conscription alexei alexandrovich was immediately carried away by the subject and began seriously defending the new imperial decree before princess betsy who had attacked it 
 vronsky and anna still sat at the little table 
 this is getting indecorous whispered one lady with an expressive glance at madame karenina her husband and vronsky 
 what did i tell you said friend 
 but it was not only these ladies who watched them almost everyone in the room even the princess miaghkaia and betsy herself looked several times in the direction of the two who had withdrawn from the general circle as though they found it a hindrance alexei alexandrovich was the only person who did not once look in their direction and was not diverted from the interesting discussion he had entered upon 
 noticing the disagreeable impression that was being made on everyone princess betsy slipped someone else into her place to listen to alexei alexandrovich and walked over to anna 
 always amazed at the clearness and precision of your language she said the most transcendent ideas seem to be within my grasp when speaking 
 oh yes said anna radiant with a smile of happiness and not understanding a word of what betsy had said she crossed over to the big table and took part in the general conversation 
 alexei alexandrovich after staying half an hour walked up to his wife and suggested that they go home together but she answered without looking at him that she was staying to supper alexei alexandrovich bowed himself out 
 the fat old tatar madame coachman in a glistening leather coat was with difficulty bridling the left of her pair of grays chilled with the cold and rearing at the entrance a footman stood by the carriage door he had opened the hall porter stood holding open the great door of the house anna arkadyevna with her quick little hand was unfastening the lace of her sleeve caught in the hook of her fur cloak and with bent head was listening rapturously to the words vronsky murmured as he saw her down to her carriage 
 said nothing of course and i ask nothing he was saying but you know that friendship is not what i want that only one happiness in life for me that word you dislike so yes love 
 love she repeated slowly in an inner voice and suddenly at the very instant she unhooked the lace she added i like the word precisely because it means too much to me far more than you can understand and she glanced into his face 
 she gave him her hand and with her rapid springy step she passed by the porter and vanished into the carriage 
 her glance the touch of her hand had seared him he kissed the palm of his hand where she had touched it and went home happy in the realization that he had got nearer to the attainment of his aims that evening than during the two last months

 steps were heard at the door and princess betsy knowing it was madame karenina glanced at vronsky he was looking toward the door and his face wore a strange new expression joyfully intently and at the same time timidly he gazed at the approaching figure and slowly he rose to his feet anna walked into the drawing room holding herself extremely erect as always looking straight before her and moving with her swift resolute and light step that distinguished her walk from that of other society women she crossed the few paces that separated her from her hostess shook hands with her smiled and with the same smile looked around at vronsky vronsky bowed low and pushed a chair up for her 
 she acknowledged this only by a slight nod flushed and frowned but immediately while rapidly greeting her acquaintances and shaking the hands proffered to her she addressed princess betsy 
 i have been at countess and meant to have come here earlier but i stayed on sir john was there a most interesting man 
 oh this missionary 
 yes he told us about life in india most interestingly 
 the conversation interrupted by her coming in flickered up again like the light of a lamp being blown out 
 sir john yes sir john seen him he speaks well vlassieva is altogether in love with him 
 and is it true that the younger vlassieva is to marry topov 
 yes they say quite settled 
 i wonder at the parents they say a marriage of passion 
 of passion what antediluvian notions you have whoever talks of passion nowadays said the wife 
 what would you do this silly old fashion is still far from dead said vronsky 
 so much the worse for those who keep up the fashion the only happy marriages i know are marriages of prudence 
 yes but then how often the happiness of these prudent marriages is scattered like dust precisely because that passion to which recognition has been denied appears on the scene said vronsky 
 but by marriages of prudence we mean those in which both parties have sown their wild oats already like scarlatina one has to go through with it and get it over with 
 in that case we must learn how to vaccinate for love like 
 i was in love in my young days with a church clerk said the princess miaghkaia i know that it did me any good 
 no i think all jokes aside that to know love one must first make a fault and then mend it said princess betsy 
 even after marriage said the wife playfully 
 never too late to mend the diplomatist repeated the english proverb 
 just so betsy agreed one must make a mistake and rectify it what do you think about it she turned to anna who with a barely perceptible resolute smile on her lips was listening to the conversation 
 i think said anna playing with the glove she had taken off i think if there are as many minds as there are heads then surely there must be as many kinds of love as there are hearts 
 vronsky was gazing at anna and with a heart sinking was waiting for what she would say he sighed as after a danger escaped when she had uttered these words 
 anna suddenly turned to him 
 oh i have had a letter from moscow they write me that kitty very ill 
 really said vronsky knitting his brows 
 anna looked sternly at him 
 that interest you 
 on the contrary it does very much what is it exactly that they write you if may know he asked 
 anna got up and went to betsy 
 give me a cup of tea she said pausing behind her chair 
 while betsy was pouring out the tea vronsky walked up to anna 
 what is it they write you he repeated 
 i often think men have no understanding of what is dishonorable though forever talking of it said anna without answering him wanted to tell you something for a long while she added and moving a few steps away she sat down at a corner table which held albums 
 i quite understand the significance of your words he said handing her the cup 
 she glanced towards the sofa beside her and he instantly sat down 
 yes wanted to tell you she said without looking at him your action was wrong wrong very wrong 
 do you suppose i know that acted wrongly but who was the cause of my doing so

 alexei alexandrovich had seen nothing striking or improper in the fact that his wife was sitting with vronsky at a table apart in eager conversation with him about something but he noticed that to the rest of the party this appeared as something striking and improper and for that reason it seemed to him too to be improper he made up his mind that he must speak of it to his wife 
 on reaching home alexei alexandrovich went to his study as he usually did seated himself in his low chair opened a book on the papacy at the place he had marked by inserting the paper knife read till one just as he usually did but from time to time he would rub his high forehead and shake his head as though to drive away something at his usual time he got up and made his toilet for the night anna arkadyevna had not yet come in with a book under his arm he went upstairs but this evening instead of his usual thoughts and meditations upon official details his thoughts were absorbed by his wife and something disagreeable connected with her contrary to his usual habit he did not get into bed but fell to walking up and down the rooms with his hands clasped behind his back he could not go to bed feeling that it was absolutely needful for him first to think thoroughly over the situation that had just arisen 
 when alexei alexandrovich had made up his mind that he must have a talk with his wife it had seemed a very easy and simple matter but now when he began to think over the question that had just presented itself it seemed to him very complicated and difficult 
 alexei alexandrovich was not jealous jealousy according to his notions was an insult to wife and one ought to have confidence in wife why one ought to have that confidence that is to say a complete conviction that his young wife would always love him he did not ask himself but he had never experienced such a lack of confidence because he had confidence in her and told himself that he ought to have it now though his conviction that jealousy was a shameful feeling and that one ought to feel confidence had not broken down he still felt that he was standing face to face with something illogical and fatuous and did not know what ought to be done alexei alexandrovich was standing face to face with life with the possibility of his loving someone other than himself and this seemed to him very fatuous and incomprehensible because it was of the very stuff of life all his life alexei alexandrovich had lived and worked in official spheres having to do merely with the reflections of life and every time he had stumbled against life itself he had shrunk away from it now he experienced a feeling akin to that of a man who while calmly crossing a precipice by a bridge should suddenly discover that the bridge is broken and that there is a chasm below that chasm was life itself the bridge that artificial life in which alexei alexandrovich had lived for the first time the question presented itself to him of the possibility of his loving someone else and he was horrified at it 
 he did not undress but walked up and down with his regular tread over the resounding parquet of the dining room where one lamp was burning over the carpet of the dark drawing room in which the light was reflected merely on the big new portrait of himself hanging over the sofa and across her boudoir where two candles burned lighting up the portraits of her parents and feminine friends and the pretty knickknacks of her writing table every one of which he knew so well he walked across her boudoir to the bedroom door and turned back again 
 at each turn in his walk especially on the parquet of the dining room he halted and said to himself yes this i must decide and put a stop to i must express my view of it and my decision and he turned back again but just what shall i express and what decision he would say to himself in the drawing room and found no answer but after all he asked himself before turning into the boudoir what has occurred nothing she was talking a long while with him but what of that surely women in society can talk to whom they please and then jealousy means debasing both her and myself he soliloquized as he entered her boudoir but this dictum which had always had such weight with him before had now no weight and no meaning whatsoever and from the bedroom door he turned back again but as he entered the dark drawing room some inner voice told him that it was not so and that if others had noticed it meant that there was something and he said to himself again in the dining room yes i must decide and put a stop to it and express my views and again at the turn in the drawing room he asked himself decide how and again he asked inwardly what has occurred and answered nothing and recollected that jealousy was a feeling insulting to his wife but again in the drawing room he was convinced that something had happened his thoughts like his body were describing a complete circle without alighting upon anything new he noticed this rubbed his forehead and sat down in her boudoir 
 there looking at her table with the malachite blotting case lying at the top and an unfinished letter his thoughts suddenly changed he began to think of her of what her thoughts and emotions must be for the first time he pictured vividly to himself her personal life her ideas her desires and the thought that she could and must have a separate life of her own seemed to him so appalling that he made haste to drive it away it was the chasm which he was afraid to peep into to put himself in thought and feeling in another place was a spiritual action foreign to alexei alexandrovich he looked on this spiritual action as a harmful and dangerous abuse of the fancy 
 and the worst of it all thought he is that just now at the very moment when my great work is approaching completion he was thinking of the project he was bringing forward at the time when i stand in need of all my mental peace and all my energies just now this stupid worry has to come falling about my ears but to be done not one of those men who submit to uneasiness and worry without having the force of character to face them 
 i must think this over come to a decision and put it out of my mind he said aloud 
 the question of her feelings of what has passed and may be passing in her soul not my affair the affair of her conscience and falls under the head of religion he said to himself feeling consolation in the sense that he had found to which division of regulating principles this new circumstance could be properly referred 
 and so alexei alexandrovich said to himself questions as to her feelings and so on are questions for her conscience with which i can have nothing to do my duty is clearly defined as the head of the family i am a person bound in duty to guide her and consequently in part the person responsible i am bound to point out the danger i perceive to warn her even to use my authority i ought to speak plainly to her 
 and everything that he would say tonight to his wife took clear shape in alexei head thinking over what he would say he somewhat regretted that he should have to use his time and mental powers for domestic consumption with so little to show for it but in spite of that the form and consistency of the speech before him shaped itself as clearly and distinctly in his head as a ministerial report i must speak on and express fully the following points first an explanation of the value to be attached to public opinion and to decorum secondly an explanation of the religious significance of marriage thirdly if need be a reference to the calamity possibly ensuing to our son fourthly a reference to the unhappiness likely to result to herself and interlacing his fingers the palms downward alexei alexandrovich stretched his hands and the joints of the fingers cracked 
 this gesture this bad habit the joining of his hands cracking his fingers always soothed him and gave precision to his thoughts so needful to him now there was the sound of a carriage driving up to the front door alexei alexandrovich halted in the middle of the room 
 a step was heard mounting the stairs alexei alexandrovich ready for his speech stood squeezing his crossed fingers waiting for their crack to come again one joint cracked 
 already from the sound of light steps on the stairs he was aware that she was close and though he was satisfied with his speech he felt frightened because of the explanation confronting him

 chapter 
 
 anna came in with her head bent playing with the tassels of her hood her face was glowing with a vivid glow but this glow was not one of joyousness it recalled the fearful glow of a conflagration in the midst of a dark night on seeing her husband anna raised her head and smiled as though she had just waked up 
 not in bed what a miracle she said throwing off her hood and without stopping she went on into the dressing room late alexei alexandrovich she said from behind the door 
 anna i must have a talk with you 
 with me she said wonderingly she came out from the door and looked at him why what is it what about she asked sitting down well talk if so necessary but it would be better to go to sleep 
 anna was saying whatever came to her tongue and marveled hearing herself at her own capacity for lying how simple and natural were her words and how likely that she was simply sleepy she felt herself clad in an impenetrable armor of falsehood she felt that some unseen force had come to her aid and was supporting her 
 anna i must warn you he began 
 warn me she said of what 
 she looked at him so simply so brightly that anyone who did not know her as her husband knew her could not have noticed anything unnatural either in the sound or the sense of her words but to him knowing her knowing that whenever he went to bed five minutes later than usual she noticed it and asked him the reason to him knowing that every joy every pleasure and pain that she felt she communicated to him at once to him it meant a great deal to see now that she did not care to notice his state of mind that she did not care to say a word about herself he saw that the inmost recesses of her soul that had always hitherto lain open before him were now closed against him more than that he saw from her tone that she was not even perturbed at that but seemed to be saying straightforwardly to him yes it is closed now which is as it should be and will be so in future now he experienced a feeling such as a man might have who returning home finds his own house locked up but perhaps the key may yet be found thought alexei alexandrovich 
 i want to warn you he said in a low voice that through thoughtlessness and lack of caution you may cause yourself to be talked about in society your too animated conversation this evening with count vronsky he enunciated the name firmly and with quiet intervals attracted attention 
 he talked and looked at her laughing eyes which frightened him now with their impenetrable look and as he talked he felt all the uselessness and futility of his words 
 always like that she answered as though completely misapprehending him and of all he had said only taking in the last phrase one time you like my being dull and another time you like my being lively i dull does that offend you 
 alexei alexandrovich shivered and bent his hands to make the joints crack 
 oh please do that i dislike it so she said 
 anna is this you said alexei alexandrovich quietly making an effort over himself and restraining the motion of his hands 
 but what is it all about she said with such genuine and droll wonder what do you want of me 
 alexei alexandrovich paused and rubbed his forehead and his eyes he saw that instead of doing as he had intended that is to say warning his wife against a mistake in the eyes of the world he had unconsciously become agitated over what was the affair of her conscience and was struggling against some imaginary barrier 
 this is what i meant to say to you he went on coldly and composedly and i beg you to hear me to the end i consider jealousy as you know a humiliating and degrading feeling and i shall never allow myself to be guided by it but there are certain rules of decency which cannot be disregarded with impunity this evening it was not i who observed it but judging by the impression made on the company everyone observed that your conduct and deportment were not altogether what one would desire 
 i positively understand said anna shrugging her shoulders he care she thought but other people noticed it and what upsets him not well alexei alexandrovich she added and getting up was about to pass through the door but he moved forward as though he would stop her 
 his face was gloomy and forbidding as anna had never seen it before she stopped and bending her head back and to one side began taking out her hairpins with her hand 
 well listening what does follow she said calmly and ironically and indeed i am listening even with interest for i should like to understand what it is all about 
 she spoke and marveled at the confident calm and natural tone in which she spoke and at the choice of the words she used 
 to enter into all the details of your feelings i have no right and besides i regard that as useless and even harmful began alexei alexandrovich rummaging in our souls we often bring up something that might have otherwise lain there unnoticed your feelings are an affair of your own conscience but i am in duty bound to you to myself and to god to point out to you your duties our life has been joined not by man but by god that union can only be severed by a crime and a crime of that nature brings its own chastisement 
 i understand a word and oh dear how sleepy i am unluckily she said rapidly passing her hand through her hair feeling for the remaining hairpins 
 anna for sake speak like that he said gently perhaps i am mistaken but believe me that which i am saying i say as much for myself as for you i am your husband and i love you 
 for an instant her face fell and the mocking gleam in her eyes died away but the phrase i love threw her into revolt again she thought love can he love if he heard there was such a thing as love he would never have used the word he even know what love is 
 alexei alexandrovich i really do not understand she said define what it is you consider 
 pardon let me say all i have to say i love you but i am not speaking of myself the most important persons in this matter are our son and yourself it may very well be i repeat that my words seem to you utterly unnecessary and out of place it may be that they are called forth by my mistaken impression in that case i beg you to forgive me but if you are conscious yourself of even the smallest foundation for them then i beg you to think a little and if your heart prompts you to speak out to me 
 alexei alexandrovich was unconsciously saying something utterly unlike what he had prepared 
 i have nothing to say and besides she said suddenly with difficulty repressing a smile really time to be in bed 
 alexei alexandrovich sighed and without saying more went into the bedroom 
 when she came into the bedroom he was already in bed his lips were sternly compressed and his eyes looked away from her anna got into her bed and lay expecting every minute that he would begin to speak to her again she both feared his speaking and wished for it but he was silent she waited for a long while without moving and forgot about him she thought of that other she pictured him and felt how her heart was flooded with emotion and guilty delight at the thought of him suddenly she heard an even tranquil snore for the first instant alexei alexandrovich seemed as it were appalled at his own snoring and ceased but after a pause of one or two breaths the snore sounded again with a new tranquil rhythm 
 late late she whispered with a smile a long while she lay without moving and with open eyes whose brilliance she almost fancied she could herself see in the darkness

 anna came in with her head bent playing with the tassels of her hood her face was glowing with a vivid glow but this glow was not one of joyousness it recalled the fearful glow of a conflagration in the midst of a dark night on seeing her husband anna raised her head and smiled as though she had just waked up 
 not in bed what a miracle she said throwing off her hood and without stopping she went on into the dressing room late alexei alexandrovich she said from behind the door 
 anna i must have a talk with you 
 with me she said wonderingly she came out from the door and looked at him why what is it what about she asked sitting down well talk if so necessary but it would be better to go to sleep 
 anna was saying whatever came to her tongue and marveled hearing herself at her own capacity for lying how simple and natural were her words and how likely that she was simply sleepy she felt herself clad in an impenetrable armor of falsehood she felt that some unseen force had come to her aid and was supporting her 
 anna i must warn you he began 
 warn me she said of what 
 she looked at him so simply so brightly that anyone who did not know her as her husband knew her could not have noticed anything unnatural either in the sound or the sense of her words but to him knowing her knowing that whenever he went to bed five minutes later than usual she noticed it and asked him the reason to him knowing that every joy every pleasure and pain that she felt she communicated to him at once to him it meant a great deal to see now that she did not care to notice his state of mind that she did not care to say a word about herself he saw that the inmost recesses of her soul that had always hitherto lain open before him were now closed against him more than that he saw from her tone that she was not even perturbed at that but seemed to be saying straightforwardly to him yes it is closed now which is as it should be and will be so in future now he experienced a feeling such as a man might have who returning home finds his own house locked up but perhaps the key may yet be found thought alexei alexandrovich 
 i want to warn you he said in a low voice that through thoughtlessness and lack of caution you may cause yourself to be talked about in society your too animated conversation this evening with count vronsky he enunciated the name firmly and with quiet intervals attracted attention 
 he talked and looked at her laughing eyes which frightened him now with their impenetrable look and as he talked he felt all the uselessness and futility of his words 
 always like that she answered as though completely misapprehending him and of all he had said only taking in the last phrase one time you like my being dull and another time you like my being lively i dull does that offend you 
 alexei alexandrovich shivered and bent his hands to make the joints crack 
 oh please do that i dislike it so she said 
 anna is this you said alexei alexandrovich quietly making an effort over himself and restraining the motion of his hands 
 but what is it all about she said with such genuine and droll wonder what do you want of me 
 alexei alexandrovich paused and rubbed his forehead and his eyes he saw that instead of doing as he had intended that is to say warning his wife against a mistake in the eyes of the world he had unconsciously become agitated over what was the affair of her conscience and was struggling against some imaginary barrier 
 this is what i meant to say to you he went on coldly and composedly and i beg you to hear me to the end i consider jealousy as you know a humiliating and degrading feeling and i shall never allow myself to be guided by it but there are certain rules of decency which cannot be disregarded with impunity this evening it was not i who observed it but judging by the impression made on the company everyone observed that your conduct and deportment were not altogether what one would desire 
 i positively understand said anna shrugging her shoulders he care she thought but other people noticed it and what upsets him not well alexei alexandrovich she added and getting up was about to pass through the door but he moved forward as though he would stop her 
 his face was gloomy and forbidding as anna had never seen it before she stopped and bending her head back and to one side began taking out her hairpins with her hand

 from that time a new life began for alexei alexandrovich and for his wife nothing special happened anna went out into society as she had always done was particularly often at princess and met vronsky everywhere alexei alexandrovich saw this but was powerless to do anything all his efforts to draw her into open discussion she confronted with a barrier which he could not penetrate made up of a sort of amused perplexity outwardly everything was the same but their inner relations were completely changed alexei alexandrovich a man of great power in the world of politics felt himself helpless in this matter like an ox with head bent submissively he waited the fall of the poleax which he felt was lifted over him every time he began to think about it he felt that he must try once more that by kindness tenderness and persuasion there was still hope of saving her of bringing her back to herself and every day he was on the verge of talking to her but every time he began he felt that the spirit of evil and deceit which had taken possession of her had possession of him too and he talked to her in a tone quite unlike that which he had meant to use involuntarily he talked to her in his habitual tone of bantering at anyone who should say what he was saying and in that tone it was impossible to say to her what the occasion demanded

 that which to vronsky had been for almost a whole year the one absorbing desire of his life replacing all his old desires that which to anna had been an impossible terrible and for that very reason a more entrancing dream of happiness that desire had been fulfilled he stood before her pale his lower jaw quivering and besought her to be calm without himself knowing how or why 
 anna anna he said with a quivering voice anna for sake 
 but the louder he spoke the lower she cast down her once proud and gay but now head and she bowed down and sank from the sofa where she was sitting down on the floor at his feet she would have fallen on the carpet if he had not held her 
 my god forgive me she said sobbing pressing his hands to her bosom 
 she felt so sinful so guilty that nothing was left her but to humiliate herself and beg forgiveness and as now there was no one in her life but him to him too she addressed her prayer for forgiveness looking at him she had a physical sense of her humiliation and she could say nothing more and he felt as a murderer must feel when he beholds the body he has robbed of life that body robbed by him of life was their love the first stage of their love there was something awful and revolting in the memory of what had been bought at this fearful price of shame shame at her spiritual nakedness crushed her and infected him but in spite of all the horror before the body of his victim he must hack it to pieces hide the body must use what the murderer had gained by his murder 
 and as the murderer with fury and as it were with passion falls on the body and drags it and hacks at it so he covered her face and shoulders with kisses she held his hand and did not stir yes these kisses that is what has been bought by this shame yes and this one hand which will always be mine the hand of my accomplice she lifted up that hand and kissed it he sank on his knees and tried to see her face but she hid it and said nothing at last as though making an effort over herself she got up and pushed him away her face was still as beautiful but it was only the more pitiful for that 
 all is over she said i have nothing but you remember that 
 i can never forget what is my whole life for one instant of this happiness 
 happiness she said with horror and loathing and her horror unconsciously infected him for sake not a word not a word more 
 she rose quickly and moved away from him 
 not a word more she repeated and with a look of chill despair incomprehensible to him she parted from him she felt that at that moment she could not put into words the sense of shame of rapture and of horror at this stepping into a new life and she did not want to speak of it to vulgarize this feeling by inappropriate words but later too and the next day and the day after she still found no words in which she could express the complexity of those feelings indeed she could not even find thoughts in which she could clearly think out all that was in her soul 
 she said to herself no just now i think of it later on when i am calmer but this calm for thoughts never came every time the thought rose of what she had done and what would happen to her and what she ought to do a horror came over her and she drove those thoughts away 
 later later she said when i am calmer 
 but in her dreams when she had no control over her thoughts her position presented itself to her in all its hideous nakedness one dream haunted her almost every night she dreamed that both were husbands at once that both were lavishing caresses on her alexei alexandrovich was weeping kissing her hands and saying how happy we are now and alexei vronsky was there too and he too was her husband and she was marveling that it had once seemed impossible to her was explaining to them laughing that this was ever so much simpler and that now both of them were happy and contented but this dream weighed on her like a nightmare and she would awake from it in terror

 in the early days after his return from moscow whenever levin shuddered and grew red remembering the disgrace of his rejection he would say to himself this was just how i used to shudder and blush thinking everything utterly lost when i was flunked in physics and did not get promoted and this is also how i thought myself utterly ruined after i had mismanaged that affair of my with which i had been entrusted and yet now that the years have passed i recall it and wonder that it could distress me so much it will be the same thing with this trouble as well time will go by and i shall not mind this either 
 but three months had passed and he had not left off minding about it and it was as painful for him to think of it now as it had been during those first days he could not be at peace because after dreaming so long of family life and feeling himself so ripe for it he was still not married and was farther than ever from marriage he was painfully conscious himself as were all about him that at his years it is not good that man should be alone he remembered how before starting for moscow he had once said to his cowherd nicolai a simplehearted peasant to whom he liked to talk well nicolai i mean to get married and how nicolai had promptly answered as of a matter on which there could be no possible doubt and high time too konstantin dmitrich but marriage had now become farther off than ever the place was taken and whenever he tried to imagine any of the girls he knew in that place he felt that it was utterly impossible moreover the recollection of the rejection and the part he had played in the affair tortured him with shame however often he told himself that he was in no wise to blame in it that recollection like other similarly humiliating recollections made him wince and blush there had been in his past as in every actions recognized by him as bad for which his conscience ought to have tormented him but the recollection of these evil actions was far from causing him as much suffering as these trivial but humiliating recollections these wounds never healed and with these recollections was now ranged his rejection and the sorry plight in which he must have appeared to others that evening yet time and labor were doing their work bitter recollections were more and more being covered up by the incidents inconspicuous ones but important of his country life every week he thought less often of kitty he was impatiently looking forward to the news that she was married or just going to be married hoping that such news would like having a tooth out completely cure him 
 meanwhile spring came on beautiful and kindly without the delays and treacheries incident to spring one of those rare springs in which plants beasts and man rejoice alike this lovely spring roused levin still more and strengthened him in his resolution of renouncing all his past and building up his lonely life firmly and independently though many of the plans with which he had returned to the country had not been carried out his most important resolution that of purity of life had nevertheless been kept by him he was free from that shame which had usually harassed him after a fall and he could look everyone straight in the face in february he had received a letter from marya nikolaevna telling him that his brother health was getting worse but that he would not take advice and in consequence of this letter levin went to moscow to his and succeeded in persuading him to see a doctor and to go to a watering place abroad he succeeded so well in persuading his brother and in lending him money for the journey without irritating him that he was satisfied with himself on that score in addition to his farming which called for special attention in spring in addition to reading levin had begun that winter a work on agriculture the plan of which turned on taking into account the character of the laborer on the land as one of the unalterable data of the question like the climate and the soil and consequently deducing all the principles of scientific culture not simply from the data of soil and climate but from the data of soil climate and a certain unalterable character of the laborer thus in spite of his solitude or in consequence of his solitude life was exceedingly full save that on rare occasions he suffered from an unsatisfied desire to communicate his stray ideas to someone besides agathya mikhailovna with her indeed he not infrequently fell into discussions upon physics the theory of agriculture and especially philosophy philosophy was agathya favorite subject

 chapter 
 
 levin put on his big boots and for the first time a cloth overcoat instead of his fur cloak and went out to look after his farm stepping over streams of water that flashed in the sunshine and dazzled his eyes and stepping one minute on ice and the next into sticky mud 
 spring is the time of plans and projects and as he came out into the farmyard levin like a tree in spring that knows not what form will be taken by the young shoots and twigs imprisoned in its swelling buds hardly knew what undertakings he was going to launch upon now in the farmwork that was so dear to him but he felt that he was full of the most splendid plans and projects first of all he went to the cattle the cows had been let out into their paddock and their smooth sides were already glossy with their new sleek spring coats they basked in the sunshine and lowed to go to the meadow levin gazed admiringly at the cows he knew so intimately to the minutest detail of their condition and gave orders for them to be driven out into the meadow and the calves to be let into the paddock the herdsman ran gaily to get ready for the meadow the cowherd girls picking up their petticoats ran splashing through the mud with bare legs still white not yet brown from the sun waving brushwood in their hands chasing the calves that frolicked in the mirth of spring 
 after admiring the increase of that year which were particularly fine the early calves were the size of a cow and daughter at three months old was as big as a yearling levin gave orders for a trough to be brought out and hay to be put in the racks but it appeared that since the paddock had not been used during the winter the racks made in the autumn were broken he sent for the carpenter who according to his orders ought to have been at work at the threshing machine but it appeared that the carpenter was repairing the harrows which ought to have been repaired before lent this was very annoying to levin it was annoying to come upon that everlasting slovenliness in the farmwork against which he had been striving with all his might for so many years the racks as he ascertained being not wanted in winter had been carried to the cart horses stable and there broken as they were of light construction only meant for foddering calves moreover it was apparent also that the harrows and all the agricultural implements which he had directed to be looked over and repaired in the winter for which very purpose he had hired three carpenters had not been put into repair and the harrows were being repaired when they ought to have been harrowing the field levin sent for his bailiff but immediately went off himself to look for him the bailiff beaming all over like everything that day in a sheepskin bordered with astrakhan came out of the barn twisting a bit of straw in his hands 
 why the carpenter at the threshing machine 
 oh i meant to tell you yesterday the harrows want repairing here time they got to work in the fields 
 but what were they doing in the winter then 
 but what did you want the carpenter for 
 where are the racks for the calves paddock 
 i ordered them to be got ready what would you have with those people said the bailiff with a wave of his hand 
 not those people but this bailiff said levin getting angry why what do i keep you for he cried but bethinking himself that this would not help matters he stopped short in the middle of a sentence and merely sighed well what do you say can sowing begin he asked after a pause 
 behind turkino tomorrow or next day they might begin 
 and the clover 
 sent vassilii and mishka sowing it only i know if manage to get through so slushy 
 how many dessiatinas 
 six 
 why not sow all cried levin 
 that they were only sowing the clover on six dessiatinas not in all the twenty was still more annoying to him clover as he knew both from books and from his own experience never did well except when it was sown as early as possible almost in the snow and yet levin could never get this done 
 no one to send what would you do with such people three turned up and semion 
 well you should have taken some men from the chaffcutter 
 and so i have as it is 
 where are the peasants then 
 five are making compote which meant compost and four are shifting the oats for fear of being touched konstantin dmitrich 
 levin knew very well that touching meant that his english seed oats were already spoiled again they had not done as he had ordered 
 why but i told you during lent to put in pipes he cried 
 be put out we shall get it all done in time 
 levin made an angry gesture and went into the granary to glance at the oats and then to the stable the oats were not yet spoiled but the laborers were carrying the oats in spades when they might simply let them slide down into the lower granary and arranging for this to be done and taking two laborers from there for sowing clover levin got over the vexation his bailiff had caused him indeed it was such a lovely day that one could not be angry 
 ignat he called to the coachman who with his sleeves tucked up was washing the carriage wheels saddle 
 which sir 
 well let it be kolpik 
 yes sir 
 while they were saddling his horse levin again called the bailiff who was hanging about in sight to make it up with him and began talking to him about the spring operations before them and his plans for the farming 
 the wagons were to begin carting manure earlier so as to get all done before the early mowing and the plowing of the outlying land was to go on without a break so as to let it lie black fallow and furrowed and the moving to be all done by hired labor not on 
 the bailiff listened attentively and obviously made an effort to approve of his projects but still he had that look levin knew so well that always irritated him a look of hopelessness and despondency that look said all very well but as god wills 
 nothing mortified levin so much as that tone but it was the tone common to all the bailiffs he had ever had they had all taken that attitude to his plans and so now he was not angered by it but mortified and felt all the more roused to struggle against this apparently elemental force continually ranged against him for which he could find no other name than as god wills 
 if we can manage it konstantin dmitrich said the bailiff 
 why you manage it 
 we positively must have fifteen laborers more and they turn up there were some here today asking seventy roubles for the summer 
 levin was silent again he was brought face to face with that opposing force he knew that however much they tried they could not hire more than forty perhaps or laborers for a reasonable sum some forty had been taken on and there were no more but still he could not help struggling against it 
 send to sury to chefirovka if they come we must look for them 
 send to be sure said vassilii fiodorovich despondently but then there are the horses not good for much 
 get some more i know of course levin added laughing you always want to do with as little and as poor a quality as possible but this year not going to let you have things your own way see to everything myself 
 why i think you take much rest as it is it cheers us up to work under the eye 
 so sowing clover behind the birch dale go and have a look at them he said mounting the little bay cob kolpik who was led up by the coachman 
 you get across the stream konstantin dmitrich the coachman shouted 
 all right go by the forest 
 and levin rode through the slush of the farmyard to the gate and out into the open country his good little horse after his long inactivity ambling easily snorting over the pools and asking as it were for guidance 
 if levin had felt happy before in the cattle pens and farmyard he felt happier yet in the open country swaying rhythmically with the ambling paces of his good little cob drinking in the warm yet fresh scent of the snow and the air as he rode through his forest over the crumbling wasted snow still left in parts and covered with dissolving tracks he rejoiced over every tree with the moss reviving on its bark and the buds swelling on its shoots when he came out of the forest in the immense plain before him his winter fields stretched in an unbroken carpet of green without one bare place or swamp only spotted here and there in the hollows with patches of melting snow he was not put out of temper even by the sight of the peasants horse and colt trampling down his young grass he told a peasant he met to drive them out nor by the sarcastic and stupid reply of the peasant ipat whom he met on the way and asked well ipat shall we soon be sowing we must get the plowing done first konstantin dmitrich answered ipat the farther he rode the happier he became and plans for the land rose to his mind each better than the last to plant all his fields with hedges along the southern borders so that the snow should not lie under them to divide them up into six fields of tillage and three for pasture and hay to build a cattle yard at the further end of the estate and to dig a pond and to construct movable pens for the cattle as a means of manuring the land and then three hundred dessiatinas of wheat one hundred of potatoes and one hundred and fifty of clover and not a dessiatina exhausted 
 absorbed in such dreams carefully keeping his horse by the hedges so as not to trample his young winter fields he rode up to the laborers who had been sent to sow clover a telega with the seed in it was standing not at the edge but in the middle of the tillage and the winter corn had been torn up by the wheels and trampled by the horse both the laborers were sitting in the hedge probably smoking a pipe turn and turn about the earth in the telega with which the seed was mixed was not crushed to powder but crusted together or adhering in clods seeing the master the laborer vassilii went toward the telega while mishka set to work sowing this was not as it should be but with the laborers levin seldom lost his temper when vassilii came up levin told him to lead the horse to the hedge 
 never mind sir spring up again responded vassilii 
 please argue said levin but do as told 
 yes sir answered vassilii and he took the head what a sowing konstantin dmitrich he said ingratiatingly only a work to get about a fellow drags thirty pounds of earth at every step 
 why is it you have earth not sifted said levin 
 well we crumble it up answered vassilii taking up some seed and rolling the earth in his palms 
 vassilii was not to blame for their having fired up his telega with unsifted earth but still it was annoying 
 levin had already more than once tried a way he knew for stifling his anger and turning all that seemed dark right again and he tried that way now he watched how mishka strode along swinging the huge clods of earth that clung to each foot and getting off his horse he took the sieve from vassilii and started sowing himself 
 where did you stop 
 vassilii pointed to the mark with his foot and levin went forward as best he could scattering the seed on the land walking was as difficult as on a bog and by the time levin had ended the row he was in a great heat and stopping gave the sieve over to vassilii 
 well master when here mind you scold me for this row said vassilii 
 eh said levin cheerily already feeling the effect of his method 
 why see in the summertime look different look you where i sowed last spring how i did work at it i do my best konstantin dmitrich see as i would for my own father i like botchwork myself nor would i let another man do it good for the master is good for us too it does heart good said vassilii pointing to look over yonder 
 a lovely spring vassilii 
 why a spring such as even the old men remember the like of i was up home my father there has sown wheat too three osminas of it he was saying you tell it from rye 
 have you been sowing wheat long 
 why sir it was you taught us the year before last you gave me two measures we sold about one chetvert and sowed three osminas 
 well mind you crumble up the clods said levin going toward his horse and keep an eye on mishka and if a good crop you shall have half a rouble for every dessiatina 
 thank you kindly we are very well content sir with your treatment as it is 
 levin got on his horse and rode toward the field where last clover was and the one which was plowed ready for the spring corn 
 the crop of clover coming up in the stubble was magnificent it had revived already and stood up vividly green through the broken stalks of last wheat the horse sank in up to the pasterns and he drew each hoof with a sucking sound out of the ground over the plowland the riding was utterly impossible the horse could only keep a foothold where there was ice and in the thawing furrows he sank in deep at each step the plowland was in splendid condition in a couple of days it would be fit for harrowing and sowing everything was capital everything was cheering levin rode back across the streams hoping the water would have gone down and he did in fact get across and startled two ducks there must be woodcock here too he thought and just as he reached the turning homewards he met the forest keeper who confirmed his theory about the woodcock 
 levin went home at a trot so as to have time to eat his dinner and get his gun ready for the evening

 chapter 
 
 levin put on his big boots and for the first time a cloth overcoat instead of his fur cloak and went out to look after his farm stepping over streams of water that flashed in the sunshine and dazzled his eyes and stepping one minute on ice and the next into sticky mud 
 spring is the time of plans and projects and as he came out into the farmyard levin like a tree in spring that knows not what form will be taken by the young shoots and twigs imprisoned in its swelling buds hardly knew what undertakings he was going to launch upon now in the farmwork that was so dear to him but he felt that he was full of the most splendid plans and projects first of all he went to the cattle the cows had been let out into their paddock and their smooth sides were already glossy with their new sleek spring coats they basked in the sunshine and lowed to go to the meadow levin gazed admiringly at the cows he knew so intimately to the minutest detail of their condition and gave orders for them to be driven out into the meadow and the calves to be let into the paddock the herdsman ran gaily to get ready for the meadow the cowherd girls picking up their petticoats ran splashing through the mud with bare legs still white not yet brown from the sun waving brushwood in their hands chasing the calves that frolicked in the mirth of spring 
 after admiring the increase of that year which were particularly fine the early calves were the size of a cow and daughter at three months old was as big as a yearling levin gave orders for a trough to be brought out and hay to be put in the racks but it appeared that since the paddock had not been used during the winter the racks made in the autumn were broken he sent for the carpenter who according to his orders ought to have been at work at the threshing machine but it appeared that the carpenter was repairing the harrows which ought to have been repaired before lent this was very annoying to levin it was annoying to come upon that everlasting slovenliness in the farmwork against which he had been striving with all his might for so many years the racks as he ascertained being not wanted in winter had been carried to the cart horses stable and there broken as they were of light construction only meant for foddering calves moreover it was apparent also that the harrows and all the agricultural implements which he had directed to be looked over and repaired in the winter for which very purpose he had hired three carpenters had not been put into repair and the harrows were being repaired when they ought to have been harrowing the field levin sent for his bailiff but immediately went off himself to look for him the bailiff beaming all over like everything that day in a sheepskin bordered with astrakhan came out of the barn twisting a bit of straw in his hands 
 why the carpenter at the threshing machine 
 oh i meant to tell you yesterday the harrows want repairing here time they got to work in the fields 
 but what were they doing in the winter then 
 but what did you want the carpenter for 
 where are the racks for the calves paddock 
 i ordered them to be got ready what would you have with those people said the bailiff with a wave of his hand 
 not those people but this bailiff said levin getting angry why what do i keep you for he cried but bethinking himself that this would not help matters he stopped short in the middle of a sentence and merely sighed well what do you say can sowing begin he asked after a pause

 as he rode up to the house in the happiest frame of mind levin heard the bell ring at the side of the principal entrance of the house 
 yes someone from the railway station he thought just the time to be here from the moscow train who could it be what if brother nikolai he did say i may go to the waters or i may come down to you he felt dismayed and vexed for the first minute that his brother presence should come to his happy mood of spring but he felt ashamed of the feeling and at once he opened as it were the arms of his soul and with a softened feeling of joy and expectation he now hoped with all his heart that it was his brother he spurred on his horse and as he rode out from behind the acacias he saw a hired troika from the railway station and a gentleman in a fur coat it was not his brother oh if it were only some pleasant person one could talk to a little he thought 
 ah cried levin joyfully flinging up both his hands a delightful visitor ah how glad i am to see you he shouted recognizing stepan arkadyevich 
 i shall find out for certain whether married or when going to be married he thought 
 and on that delicious spring day he felt that the thought of her did not hurt him at all 
 expect me did you said stepan arkadyevich getting out of the sleigh splashed with mud on the bridge of his nose on his cheek and on his eyebrows but radiant with health and good spirits come primarily to see you he said embracing and kissing him secondly to have some stand shooting and thirdly to sell the forest at ergushovo 
 delightful what a spring having how ever did you get along in a sleigh 
 in a wagon it would have been worse still konstantin dmitrievich answered the driver who knew him 
 well very very glad to see you said levin with a genuine smile of childlike delight 
 levin led his friend to the guest room where stepan things were also carried a bag a gun in a case a satchel for cigars leaving him there to wash and change his clothes levin went off to the countinghouse to speak about the plowing and the clover agathya mikhailovna always very anxious for the credit of the house met him in the hall with inquiries about dinner 
 do just as you like only let it be as soon as possible he said and went to the bailiff 
 when he came back stepan arkadyevich washed and combed came out of his room with a beaming smile and they went upstairs together 
 well i am glad i managed to get away to you now i shall understand what the mysterious business is that you are always absorbed in here no really i envy you what a house how splendid it all is so bright so cheerful said stepan arkadyevich forgetting that it was not always spring and fine weather as on this day and your old nurse is simply charming a pretty maid in an apron might be even more agreeable perhaps but for your severe monastic style it does very well 
 stepan arkadyevich imparted to him many interesting bits of news especially interesting to levin was the news that his brother sergei ivanovich was intending to spend the summer with him in the country 
 not one word did stepan arkadyevich say in reference to kitty and the shcherbatskys he merely gave him greetings from his wife levin was grateful to him for his delicacy and rejoiced exceedingly over his guest as always happened with him during his solitude a mass of ideas and feelings had been accumulating within him which he could not communicate to those about him and now he poured out upon stepan arkadyevich his poetic joy over the spring and his failures and plans for the land and his thoughts and criticisms on the books he had been reading and the idea of his own book the basis of which really was though he was unaware of it himself a criticism of all the old books on agriculture stepan arkadyevich always charming understanding everything at the slightest reference was particularly charming on this visit and levin noticed in him a special tenderness as it were and a new tone of respect that flattered him 
 the efforts of agathya mikhailovna and the cook to have the dinner particularly good only ended in the two famished friends attacking the preliminary course eating a great deal of bread and butter salt goose and salted mushrooms and in finally ordering the soup to be served without the accompaniment of little patties with which the cook had particularly meant to impress their visitor but though stepan arkadyevich was accustomed to very different dinners he thought everything excellent the herb brandy and the bread and the butter and above all the salt goose and the mushrooms and the nettle soup and the chicken in white sauce and the white crimean wine everything was excellent and marvelous 
 splendid splendid he said lighting a fat cigar after the roast i feel as if coming to you i had landed on a peaceful shore after the noise and jolting of a steamer and so you maintain that the laborer himself is an element to be studied and to regulate the choice of methods in agriculture of course an ignorant outsider but i should fancy theory and its application will have its influence on the laborer too 
 yes but wait a bit not talking of political economy talking of the science of agriculture it ought to be like the natural sciences and to observe given phenomena and the laborer in his economic ethnographical 
 at that instant agathya mikhailovna came in with jam 
 oh agathya fiodorovna said stepan arkadyevich kissing the tips of his plump fingers what salt goose what herb brandy what do you think it time to start kostia he added 
 levin looked out of the window at the sun sinking behind the bare treetops of the forest 
 yes time he said kouzma get ready the wide droshky and he ran downstairs 
 stepan arkadyevich going down carefully took the canvas cover off his varnished gun case with his own hands and opening it began to get ready his expensive gun kouzma who already scented a big tip never left stepan side and put on him both his stockings and boots a task which stepan arkadyevich readily left to him 
 kostia give orders that if the merchant riabinin comes i told him to come today to be shown in and asked to wait for me 
 why do you mean to say selling the forest to riabinin 
 yes do you know him 
 to be sure i do i have had to do business with him positively and definitively 
 stepan arkadyevich laughed positively and definitively were the favorite words 
 yes wonderfully funny the way he talks she knows where her going he added patting laska who hung about levin whining and licking his hands his boots and his gun 
 the droshky was already at the steps when they went out 
 i told them to bring the droshky round though not far to go or would you rather walk 
 no better drive said stepan arkadyevich getting into the droshky he sat down tucked the rug round him and lighted a cigar how is it you smoke a cigar is a sort of thing not exactly a pleasure but the crown and outward sign of pleasure come this is life how splendid it is this is how i should like to live 
 why who prevents you said levin smiling 
 no a lucky man got everything you like you like horses and you have them dogs you have them shooting you have it farming you have it 
 perhaps because i rejoice in what i have and fret for what i said levin thinking of kitty 
 stepan arkadyevich comprehended looked at him but said nothing 
 levin was grateful to oblonsky for noticing with his tact that he dreaded conversation about the shcherbatskys and so saying nothing about them but now levin was longing to find out about that which was tormenting him so yet had not the courage to begin 
 come tell me how things are going with you said levin bethinking himself that it was not good of him to think only of himself 
 stepan eyes sparkled merrily 
 you admit i know that one can be fond of new rolls when one has had ration of bread to your mind a crime but i count life as life without love he said taking question in his own way what am i to do made that way and really one does so little harm to anyone and gives oneself so much pleasure 
 what is there something new then queried levin 
 yes my boy there is there do you see you know the type of women women such as one sees in dreams well these women are sometimes to be met with in reality and these women are terrible woman you know is such a subject that no matter how much you study it always perfectly new 
 well then it would be better not to study it 
 no some mathematician has said that enjoyment lies in the search for truth not in the finding of it 
 levin listened in silence and in spite of all the efforts he made he could not in the least enter into the feelings of his friend and understand his sentiments and the charm of studying such women

 the efforts of agathya mikhailovna and the cook to have the dinner particularly good only ended in the two famished friends attacking the preliminary course eating a great deal of bread and butter salt goose and salted mushrooms and in finally ordering the soup to be served without the accompaniment of little patties with which the cook had particularly meant to impress their visitor but though stepan arkadyevich was accustomed to very different dinners he thought everything excellent the herb brandy and the bread and the butter and above all the salt goose and the mushrooms and the nettle soup and the chicken in white sauce and the white crimean wine everything was excellent and marvelous 
 splendid splendid he said lighting a fat cigar after the roast i feel as if coming to you i had landed on a peaceful shore after the noise and jolting of a steamer and so you maintain that the laborer himself is an element to be studied and to regulate the choice of methods in agriculture of course an ignorant outsider but i should fancy theory and its application will have its influence on the laborer too 
 yes but wait a bit not talking of political economy talking of the science of agriculture it ought to be like the natural sciences and to observe given phenomena and the laborer in his economic ethnographical 
 at that instant agathya mikhailovna came in with jam 
 oh agathya fiodorovna said stepan arkadyevich kissing the tips of his plump fingers what salt goose what herb brandy what do you think it time to start kostia he added 
 levin looked out of the window at the sun sinking behind the bare treetops of the forest 
 yes time he said kouzma get ready the wide droshky and he ran downstairs 
 stepan arkadyevich going down carefully took the canvas cover off his varnished gun case with his own hands and opening it began to get ready his expensive gun kouzma who already scented a big tip never left stepan side and put on him both his stockings and boots a task which stepan arkadyevich readily left to him 
 kostia give orders that if the merchant riabinin comes i told him to come today to be shown in and asked to wait for me 
 why do you mean to say selling the forest to riabinin 
 yes do you know him 
 to be sure i do i have had to do business with him positively and definitively 
 stepan arkadyevich laughed positively and definitively were the favorite words 
 yes wonderfully funny the way he talks she knows where her going he added patting laska who hung about levin whining and licking his hands his boots and his gun 
 the droshky was already at the steps when they went out 
 i told them to bring the droshky round though not far to go or would you rather walk 
 no better drive said stepan arkadyevich getting into the droshky he sat down tucked the rug round him and lighted a cigar how is it you smoke a cigar is a sort of thing not exactly a pleasure but the crown and outward sign of pleasure come this is life how splendid it is this is how i should like to live 
 why who prevents you said levin smiling 
 no a lucky man got everything you like you like horses and you have them dogs you have them shooting you have it farming you have it 
 perhaps because i rejoice in what i have and fret for what i said levin thinking of kitty 
 stepan arkadyevich comprehended looked at him but said nothing 
 levin was grateful to oblonsky for noticing with his tact that he dreaded conversation about the shcherbatskys and so saying nothing about them but now levin was longing to find out about that which was tormenting him so yet had not the courage to begin 
 come tell me how things are going with you said levin bethinking himself that it was not good of him to think only of himself 
 stepan eyes sparkled merrily 
 you admit i know that one can be fond of new rolls when one has had ration of bread to your mind a crime but i count life as life without love he said taking question in his own way what am i to do made that way and really one does so little harm to anyone and gives oneself so much pleasure 
 what is there something new then queried levin 
 yes my boy there is there do you see you know the type of women women such as one sees in dreams well these women are sometimes to be met with in reality and these women are terrible woman you know is such a subject that no matter how much you study it always perfectly new 
 well then it would be better not to study it 
 no some mathematician has said that enjoyment lies in the search for truth not in the finding of it 
 levin listened in silence and in spite of all the efforts he made he could not in the least enter into the feelings of his friend and understand his sentiments and the charm of studying such women

 the place fixed on for the stand shooting was not far above a stream in a little aspen copse on reaching the copse levin got out of the droshky and led oblonsky to a corner of a mossy swampy glade already quite free from snow he went back himself to a double birch tree on the other side and leaning his gun on the fork of a dead lower branch he took off his full overcoat fastened his belt again and worked his arms to see if they were free 
 gray old laska who had followed them sat down warily opposite him and pricked up her ears the sun was setting behind a thick forest and in the glow of sunset the birch trees dotted about in the aspen copse stood out clearly with their hanging twigs and their buds swollen almost to bursting 
 from the thickest parts of the copse where the snow still remained came the faint sound of narrow winding streamlets of water running away tiny birds twittered and now and then fluttered from tree to tree 
 in the pauses of complete stillness there came the rustle of last leaves stirred by the thawing of the earth and the growth of grasses 
 imagine one can hear and see the grass growing levin said to himself noticing a wet aspen leaf moving beside a blade of young grass he stood listened and gazed sometimes down at the wet mossy ground sometimes at laska listening all alert sometimes at the sea of bare treetops that stretched on the slope below him sometimes at the darkening sky covered with white streaks of cloud a hawk flew high over a forest far away with a slow sweep of its wings another flew with exactly the same motion in the same direction and vanished the birds twittered more and more loudly and busily in the thicket an owl hooted not far off and laska starting stepped cautiously a few steps forward and putting her head on one side began to listen intently beyond the stream was heard the cuckoo twice she uttered her usual call and then became hoarse hurried and broke down 
 imagine the cuckoo already said stepan arkadyevich coming out from behind a bush 
 yes i hear it answered levin reluctantly breaking the stillness with his voice which sounded disagreeable to himself now coming 
 stepan figure again went behind the bush and levin saw nothing but the bright flash of a match followed by the red glow and blue smoke of a cigarette 
 tchk tchk came the snapping sound of stepan arkadyevich cocking his gun 
 that cry asked oblonsky drawing attention to a prolonged cry as though a colt were whinnying in a high voice in play 
 oh you know it a buck hare but enough talking listen here it comes almost shrieked levin cocking his gun 
 they heard a shrill whistle in the distance and in the exact time so well known to the sportsman two seconds later another a third and after the third whistle the hoarse guttural cry could be heard 
 levin looked about him to right and to left and there just facing him against the dusky blue sky above the confused mass of tender shoots of the aspens he saw the flying bird it was flying straight toward him the guttural cry like the even tearing of some strong stuff sounded close to his ear the long beak and neck of the bird could be seen and at the very instant when levin was taking aim behind the bush where oblonsky stood there was a flash of red lightning the bird dropped like an arrow and darted upward again again came the red flash and the sound of a blow and fluttering its wings as though trying to keep up in the air the bird paused stopped still an instant and fell with a heavy splash to the slushy ground 
 can i possibly have missed it shouted stepan arkadyevich who could not see for the smoke 
 here it is said levin pointing to laska who with one ear pricked up wagging the tip of her shaggy tail was coming slowly back as though she would prolong the pleasure and seemingly smiling was bringing the dead bird to her master well glad you were successful said levin who at the same time had a sense of envy that he had not succeeded in shooting the woodcock 
 it was a bad shot from the right barrel responded stepan arkadyevich loading his gun sh here it comes 
 the shrill whistles rapidly following one another were heard again two woodcocks playing and chasing one another and only whistling not crying flew straight at the very heads of the sportsmen there was the report of four shots and like swallows the woodcocks turned swift somersaults in the air and vanished from sight 
 the stand shooting was capital stepan arkadyevich shot two more birds and levin two of which one was not found it began to get dark venus bright and silvery shone with her soft light low down in the west behind the birch trees and high up in the east twinkled the red fires of somber arcturus over his head levin made out the stars of the great bear and lost them again the woodcocks had ceased flying but levin resolved to stay a little longer till venus which he saw below a branch of birch should be above it and the stars of the great bear should be perfectly plain venus had risen above the branch and the chariot of the great bear with its shaft was now all plainly visible against the dark blue sky yet still he waited 
 it time to go home said stepan arkadyevich 
 it was quite still now in the copse and not a bird was stirring 
 stay a little while answered levin 
 as you like 
 they were standing now about fifteen paces from one another 
 stiva said levin unexpectedly how is it you tell me whether your married yet or when going to be 
 levin felt so resolute and serene that no answer he fancied could affect him but he had never dreamed of the answer which stepan arkadyevich made 
 never thought of being married and thinking of it but very ill and the doctors have sent her abroad positively afraid she may not live 
 what cried levin very ill what is wrong with her how is she 
 while they were speaking laska with ears pricked up was looking upward at the sky and reproachfully at them 
 what a time they have chosen to gab she was thinking there it comes here it is yes sure enough miss it thought laska 
 but at that very instant both suddenly heard a shrill whistle which as it were smote on their ears and both suddenly seized their guns and two flashes gleamed and two bangs sounded at the very same instant the woodcock flying high above instantly folded its wings and fell into a thicket bending down the delicate shoots 
 splendid together cried levin and he ran with laska into the thicket to look for the woodcock 
 oh yes what was it that was unpleasant he recollected yes ill well it be helped very sorry he thought 
 found it she a clever girl he said taking the warm bird from mouth and packing it into the almost full gamebag got it stiva he shouted

 on the way home levin asked all the details of illness and of the shcherbatskys plans and though he would have been ashamed to admit it he was pleased at what he heard he was pleased that there was still hope and still more pleased that she who had made him suffer should be suffering so much but when stepan arkadyevich began to speak of the causes of illness and mentioned name levin cut him short 
 i have no right whatever to know family matters and to tell the truth no interest in them either 
 stepan arkadyevich smiled a barely perceptible smile catching the instantaneous change he knew so well in face which had become as gloomy as it had been bright a minute before 
 have you quite settled about the forest with riabinin asked levin 
 yes all settled the price is magnificent thousand eight straightaway and the rest in six years been bothering about it for ever so long no one would give more 
 then as good as given away your forest for nothing said levin gloomily 
 how do you mean for nothing said stepan arkadyevich with a smile knowing that nothing would be right in eyes now 
 because the forest is worth at least five hundred roubles the dessiatina answered levin 
 oh these farmers said stepan arkadyevich playfully your tone of contempt for us poor townsfolk but when it comes to business we are better at it than anyone i assure you i have reckoned it all out he said and the forest is fetching a very good price so much so that afraid of this crying off in fact you know not timber forest said stepan arkadyevich hoping by this distinction to convince levin completely of the unfairness of his doubts but for the most part firewood and it run to more than thirty sazhenes of wood per dessiatina and paying me at the rate of two hundred roubles the dessiatina 
 levin smiled contemptuously i know he thought that fashion not only in him but in all city people who after being twice in ten years in the country pick up two or three phrases and use them in season and out of season firmly persuaded that they know all about it timber run to thirty sazhenes the dessiatina he says those words without understanding them himself 
 i attempt to teach you what you write about in your office said he and if need arose i should come to you to ask about it but so positive you know all the lore of the forest difficult have you counted the trees 
 how count the trees said stepan arkadyevich laughing still trying to draw his friend out of his ill temper count sands of seas and rays of stars though could some higher power 
 oh well the higher power of riabinin can not a single merchant ever buys a forest without counting the trees unless they get it given them for nothing as doing now i know your forest i go there every year shooting and your worth five hundred a dessiatina paid down while giving you two hundred by installments so that in fact making him a present of thirty thousand 
 come let your imagination run away with you said stepan arkadyevich piteously why was it none would give it then 
 why because he has an understanding with the merchants bought them off had to do with all of them i know them not merchants you know speculators he look at a bargain that gave him ten fifteen per cent profit but holds back to buy a worth for twenty kopecks 
 well enough of it out of temper 
 not in the least said levin gloomily as they drove up to the house 
 at the steps there stood a trap tightly covered with iron and leather with a sleek horse tightly harnessed with broad collar straps in the trap sat the chubby tightly belted overseer who served riabinin as coachman riabinin himself was already in the house and met the friends in the hall riabinin was a tall thinnish man with mustache and a projecting chin and prominent eyes he was dressed in a blue coat with buttons below the waist at the back and wore high boots wrinkled over the ankles and straight over the calf with big galoshes drawn over them he mopped his face with his handkerchief and wrapping himself in his coat which sat extremely well as it was he greeted them with a smile holding out his hand to stepan arkadyevich as though he wanted to catch something 
 so here you are said stepan arkadyevich giving him his hand capital 
 i did not venture to disregard your commands though the road was extremely bad i positively covered the whole way at a walk but i am here on time konstantin dmitrich my respects he turned to levin trying to seize his hand too but levin scowling made as though he did not notice his hand and took out the woodcocks your honors have been diverting yourselves with the chase what kind of bird may it be pray added riabinin looking contemptuously at the woodcocks a great delicacy i suppose and he shook his head disapprovingly as though he had grave doubts whether this game were worth the candle 
 would you like to go into my study levin said in french to stepan arkadyevich scowling morosely go into my study you can talk there 
 quite so wherever you please said riabinin with supercilious dignity as though wishing to make it felt that others might be in difficulties as to how to behave but that he could never be in any difficulty about anything 
 on entering the study riabinin looked about as it was a habit of his as though seeking a holy image but when he had found it he did not cross himself he scanned the bookcases and bookshelves and with the same dubious air with which he had regarded the woodcocks he smiled superciliously and shook his head disapprovingly as though by no means willing to allow that this game either were worth the candle 
 well have you brought the money asked oblonsky sit down 
 oh trouble about the money come to see you to talk it over 
 what is there to talk over but do sit down 
 i mind if i do said riabinin sitting down and leaning his elbows on the back of his armchair in a position of the intensest discomfort to himself you must knock it down a bit prince it would be a sin otherwise as for the money it is ready definitively to the last kopeck as for money down be no hitch there 
 levin who had meanwhile been putting his gun away in the cupboard was just going out of the door but catching the words he stopped 
 why got the forest for nothing as it is he said he came to me too late or have fixed the price for him 
 riabinin got up and in silence with a smile he looked up at levin 
 konstantin dmitrievich is very close he said with a smile turning to stepan arkadyevich definitively no dealing with him i was bargaining for some wheat of him and a pretty price i offered too 
 why should i give you mine for nothing i pick it up off the ground nor did i steal it either 
 mercy on us nowadays positively no chance at all of stealing with the definitively open courts and everything done in style nowadays no question of stealing we are just talking things over like gentlemen his asking too much for the forest i make both ends meet over it i must ask for a little concession 
 but is the thing settled between you or it if settled useless haggling but if it said levin buy the forest 
 the smile vanished at once from face a hawklike greedy cruel expression was left upon it with rapid bony fingers he unbuttoned his coat revealing a large shirt bronze waistcoat buttons and a watch chain and quickly pulled out a fat old pocketbook 
 here you are the forest is mine he said crossing himself quickly and holding out his hand take the money my forest way of doing business he haggle over every copper he added scowling and waving the pocketbook 
 i be in a hurry if i were you said levin 
 come really said oblonsky in surprise given my word you know 
 levin went out of the room slamming the door riabinin looked toward the door and shook his head with a smile 
 all youthfulness definitively nothing but childishness why buying it upon my honor simply believe me for the glory of it that riabinin and no one else should have bought the copse of oblonsky and as to the profits why i must make what god gives my witness if you would kindly sign the title deed 
 within an hour the merchant carefully stroking his wrapper down and hooking up his coat with the agreement in his pocket seated himself in his tightly covered trap and drove homeward 
 ugh these gentlefolk he said to the overseer they are all made alike a fine lot 
 so responded the overseer handing him the reins and buttoning the leather apron but can i congratulate you on the purchase mikhail ignatich

 on the way home levin asked all the details of illness and of the shcherbatskys plans and though he would have been ashamed to admit it he was pleased at what he heard he was pleased that there was still hope and still more pleased that she who had made him suffer should be suffering so much but when stepan arkadyevich began to speak of the causes of illness and mentioned name levin cut him short 
 i have no right whatever to know family matters and to tell the truth no interest in them either 
 stepan arkadyevich smiled a barely perceptible smile catching the instantaneous change he knew so well in face which had become as gloomy as it had been bright a minute before 
 have you quite settled about the forest with riabinin asked levin 
 yes all settled the price is magnificent thousand eight straightaway and the rest in six years been bothering about it for ever so long no one would give more 
 then as good as given away your forest for nothing said levin gloomily 
 how do you mean for nothing said stepan arkadyevich with a smile knowing that nothing would be right in eyes now 
 because the forest is worth at least five hundred roubles the dessiatina answered levin 
 oh these farmers said stepan arkadyevich playfully your tone of contempt for us poor townsfolk but when it comes to business we are better at it than anyone i assure you i have reckoned it all out he said and the forest is fetching a very good price so much so that afraid of this crying off in fact you know not timber forest said stepan arkadyevich hoping by this distinction to convince levin completely of the unfairness of his doubts but for the most part firewood and it run to more than thirty sazhenes of wood per dessiatina and paying me at the rate of two hundred roubles the dessiatina 
 levin smiled contemptuously i know he thought that fashion not only in him but in all city people who after being twice in ten years in the country pick up two or three phrases and use them in season and out of season firmly persuaded that they know all about it timber run to thirty sazhenes the dessiatina he says those words without understanding them himself 
 i attempt to teach you what you write about in your office said he and if need arose i should come to you to ask about it but so positive you know all the lore of the forest difficult have you counted the trees 
 how count the trees said stepan arkadyevich laughing still trying to draw his friend out of his ill temper count sands of seas and rays of stars though could some higher power 
 oh well the higher power of riabinin can not a single merchant ever buys a forest without counting the trees unless they get it given them for nothing as doing now i know your forest i go there every year shooting and your worth five hundred a dessiatina paid down while giving you two hundred by installments so that in fact making him a present of thirty thousand 
 come let your imagination run away with you said stepan arkadyevich piteously why was it none would give it then 
 why because he has an understanding with the merchants bought them off had to do with all of them i know them not merchants you know speculators he look at a bargain that gave him ten fifteen per cent profit but holds back to buy a worth for twenty kopecks 
 well enough of it out of temper 
 not in the least said levin gloomily as they drove up to the house 
 at the steps there stood a trap tightly covered with iron and leather with a sleek horse tightly harnessed with broad collar straps in the trap sat the chubby tightly belted overseer who served riabinin as coachman riabinin himself was already in the house and met the friends in the hall riabinin was a tall thinnish man with mustache and a projecting chin and prominent eyes he was dressed in a blue coat with buttons below the waist at the back and wore high boots wrinkled over the ankles and straight over the calf with big galoshes drawn over them he mopped his face with his handkerchief and wrapping himself in his coat which sat extremely well as it was he greeted them with a smile holding out his hand to stepan arkadyevich as though he wanted to catch something

 stepan arkadyevich went upstairs with his pocket bulging with notes which the merchant had paid him for three months in advance the business of the forest was over the money in his pocket their shooting had been excellent and stepan arkadyevich was in the happiest frame of mind and therefore felt especially anxious to dissipate the that had come upon levin he wanted to finish the day at supper as pleasantly as it had been begun 
 levin certainly was out of humor and in spite of all his desire to be affectionate and cordial to his charming guest he could not control his mood the aftereffects of the intoxication of the news that kitty was not married had gradually begun to work upon him 
 kitty was not married and was ill and ill from love for a man who had slighted her this offense as it were rebounded upon him vronsky had slighted her and she had slighted him levin consequently vronsky had the right to despise levin and therefore he was his enemy but all this levin did not think of he vaguely felt that there was something in it insulting to him and he was not angry now at what had disturbed him but he fell foul of everything that presented itself the stupid sale of the forest the fraud practised upon oblonsky and concluded in his house exasperated him 
 well finished he said meeting stepan arkadyevich upstairs would you like supper 
 well i say no to it what an appetite i get in the country wonderful why you offer riabinin something 
 oh damn him 
 still how you do treat him said oblonsky you even shake hands with him why not shake hands with him 
 because i shake hands with a waiter and a a hundred times better than he is 
 what a reactionist you are really what about the amalgamation of classes said oblonsky 
 anyone who likes it is welcome to it but it sickens me 
 a downright reactionist i see 
 really i have never considered what i am i am konstantin levin and nothing else 
 and konstantin levin very much out of temper said stepan arkadyevich smiling 
 yes i am out of temper and do you know why because excuse me of your stupid sale 
 stepan arkadyevich frowned like one who feels himself teased and attacked for no fault of his own 
 come enough about that he said when did anybody ever sell anything without being told immediately after the sale it was worth much more but when one wants to sell no one will give anything no i see a grudge against that unlucky riabinin 
 maybe i have and do you know why say again that a reactionist or some other terrible word but all the same it does annoy and anger me to see on all sides the impoverishing of the nobility to which i belong and in spite of the amalgamation of classes glad to belong and their impoverishment is not due to living in luxury that would be nothing living in good style the proper thing for noblemen only the nobles who know how to do it now the peasants about us buy land and i mind that the gentleman does nothing while the peasant works and supplants the idle man as it should be and i welcome the peasant but i do mind seeing the process of impoverishment from a sort of i know what to call it innocence here a polish lessee bought for half its value a magnificent estate from a lady who lives in nice and there a merchant leases land worth ten roubles in rent the dessiatina for one rouble here for no kind of reason made that cheat a present of thirty thousand roubles 
 well what should i have done counted every tree 
 of course they must be counted you count them but riabinin did children will have means of livelihood and education while yours like as not 
 well you must excuse me but something mean in this counting we have our business and they have theirs and they must make their profit anyway the done and an end of it and here come some fried eggs my favorite dish and agathya mikhailovna will give us that marvelous herb brandy 
 stepan arkadyevich sat down at the table and began jollying agathya mikhailovna assuring her that it was long since he had tasted such a dinner and such a supper 
 well you praise it at any rate said agathya mikhailovna but konstantin dmitrievich no matter what you give him even a crust of bread will just eat it and walk away 
 though levin tried to control himself he was gloomy and silent he wanted to put one question to stepan arkadyevich but he could not bring himself to the point and could not find the words or the moment in which to put it stepan arkadyevich had gone down to his room undressed again washed and attired in a nightshirt with goffered frills had got into bed but levin still lingered in his room talking of various trifling matters and not daring to ask what he wanted to know 
 how wonderfully they make the soap he said gazing at a piece of soap he was unwrapping which agathya mikhailovna had placed in readiness for the guest but a brand which oblonsky did not use just look why a work of art 
 yes brought to such a pitch of perfection nowadays said stepan arkadyevich with a moist and blissful yawn the theater for instance and the entertainments he yawned the electric light everywhere 
 yes the electric light said levin yes oh and vronsky now he asked suddenly laying down the soap 
 vronsky said stepan arkadyevich checking his yawn in peterburg he left soon after you did and been once in moscow since and do you know kostia tell you the truth he went on leaning his elbow on the table and with his hand propping up his handsome ruddy face in which his humid sleepy eyes shone like stars your own fault you took fright at the sight of your rival but as i told you at the time i say which had the better chance why you fight it out i told you at the time that he yawned inwardly without opening his mouth 
 does he know or he that i did propose levin wondered gazing at him yes something humbugging something diplomatic in his face and feeling he was blushing he looked stepan arkadyevich straight in the face without speaking 
 if there was anything on her side at that time it was nothing but a superficial attraction pursued oblonsky his being such a perfect aristocrat you know and his future position in society had an influence not with her but with her mother 
 levin scowled the humiliation of his rejection stung him to the heart as though it were a fresh wound he had only just received but he was at home and the walls of home are a support 
 wait wait he began interrupting oblonsky you talk of his being an aristocrat but allow me to ask what it consists of that aristocracy of vronsky or of anybody else beside which i can be looked down upon you consider vronsky an aristocrat but i a man whose father crawled up from nothing at all by intrigue and whose mother god knows whom she mixed up with no excuse me but i consider myself aristocratic and people like me who can point back in the past to three or four honorable generations of their family of the highest degree of breeding talent and intellect of course are another matter and have never curried favor with anyone never depended on anyone for anything like my father and my grandfather and i know many such you think it mean of me to count the trees in my forest while you make riabinin a present of thirty thousand but you get from the government your liferent and i know what while i shall not and so i prize come to me from my ancestors or has been won by hard work we are aristocrats and not those who can only exist by favor of the powerful ones of this earth and who can be bought for twenty kopecks 
 well but whom are you attacking i agree with you said stepan arkadyevich sincerely and genially though he was aware that in the class of those who could be bought for twenty kopecks levin was reckoning him as well animation gave him genuine pleasure whom are you attacking a good deal of what you say is not true about vronsky of course but i talk about that i tell you straight out if i were you i should go back with me to moscow and 
 no i know whether you know it or not but i care and i tell you i did propose and was rejected and katerina alexandrovna is nothing now to me but a painful and humiliating reminiscence 
 why what nonsense 
 but we talk about it please forgive me if been nasty said levin now that he had opened his heart he became as he had been in the morning not angry with me stiva please be angry he said and smiling he took his hand 
 of course not not a bit nor is there any reason to be glad spoken openly and do you know stand shooting in the morning is usually good why not go i might go without sleeping straight from shooting to the station

 although all inner life was absorbed in his passion his external life unalterably and inevitably followed along the old accustomed lines of his social and regimental ties and interests the interests of his regiment took an important place in life both because he was fond of the regiment and still more because the regiment was fond of him they were not only fond of vronsky in his regiment they respected him too and were proud of him proud that this man with his immense wealth his brilliant education and abilities and the path open before him to every kind of success distinction and ambition had disregarded all that and of all the interests of life had the interests of his regiment and his comrades nearest to his heart vronsky was aware of his comrades view of him and in addition to his liking for that sort of life he felt bound to keep up that reputation 
 it need not be said that he did not speak of his love to any of his comrades nor did he betray his secret even in the wildest drinking bouts though indeed he was never so drunk as to lose all control of himself and he closed the mouths of any of his thoughtless comrades who attempted to allude to his liaison but in spite of that his love was known to all the town everyone guessed with more or less certainty at his relations with madame karenina the majority of the younger men envied him for just what was the most irksome factor in his love the exalted position of karenin and the consequent transparency to society of their liaison 
 the greater number of the young women who envied anna and had long been weary of having her called righteous rejoiced at the fulfillment of their predictions and were only waiting for a decisive turn in public opinion to fall upon her with all the weight of their scorn they were already making ready their handfuls of mud to cast at her when the right moment arrived the greater number of the people and certain great personages were displeased at the prospect of the impending scandal in society 
 mother on hearing of his liaison was at first pleased by it because nothing to her mind gave such a finishing touch to a brilliant young man as a liaison in the highest society she was pleased too that madame karenina who had so taken her fancy and had talked so much of her son was after all just like all the other pretty and decent women according to the countess ideas but she had heard of late that her son had refused a position offered him of great importance to his career simply in order to remain in the regiment where could be constantly seeing madame karenina she heard that great personages were displeased with him on this account and she changed her opinion she was vexed too that from all she could learn of this liaison it was not that brilliant graceful worldly liaison which she would have welcomed but a sort of desperate passion so she was told which might well lead him into follies she had not seen him since his abrupt departure from moscow and she sent her elder son to bid him to come to her 
 this elder brother too was displeased with his younger brother he did not distinguish what sort of love his might be big or little passionate or passionless pure or impure he kept a ballet girl himself though he was the father of a family so he was rather indulgent but he knew that this love displeased those whom it was necessary to please and therefore he did not approve of his conduct 
 besides the service and society vronsky had another great interest horses he was passionately fond of horses 
 that year races and a steeplechase had been arranged for the officers vronsky had put his name down bought a thoroughbred english mare and in spite of his love he was looking forward to the races with intense though reserved excitement 
 these two passions did not interfere with one another on the contrary he needed occupation and distraction quite apart from his love so as to recruit and rest himself from the violent emotions that agitated him

 mother on hearing of his liaison was at first pleased by it because nothing to her mind gave such a finishing touch to a brilliant young man as a liaison in the highest society she was pleased too that madame karenina who had so taken her fancy and had talked so much of her son was after all just like all the other pretty and decent women according to the countess ideas but she had heard of late that her son had refused a position offered him of great importance to his career simply in order to remain in the regiment where could be constantly seeing madame karenina she heard that great personages were displeased with him on this account and she changed her opinion she was vexed too that from all she could learn of this liaison it was not that brilliant graceful worldly liaison which she would have welcomed but a sort of desperate passion so she was told which might well lead him into follies she had not seen him since his abrupt departure from moscow and she sent her elder son to bid him to come to her 
 this elder brother too was displeased with his younger brother he did not distinguish what sort of love his might be big or little passionate or passionless pure or impure he kept a ballet girl himself though he was the father of a family so he was rather indulgent but he knew that this love displeased those whom it was necessary to please and therefore he did not approve of his conduct 
 besides the service and society vronsky had another great interest horses he was passionately fond of horses 
 that year races and a steeplechase had been arranged for the officers vronsky had put his name down bought a thoroughbred english mare and in spite of his love he was looking forward to the races with intense though reserved excitement 
 these two passions did not interfere with one another on the contrary he needed occupation and distraction quite apart from his love so as to recruit and rest himself from the violent emotions that agitated him

 ah responded iashvin 
 iashvin a gambler and a rake a man not merely without any principles but of immoral principles iashvin was greatest friend in the regiment vronsky liked him both for his exceptional physical strength which he showed for the most part by being able to drink like a fish and to do without sleep without being in the slightest degree affected by it and for his great strength of character which he showed in his relations with his comrades and superior officers commanding both fear and respect and also at cards when he would play for tens of thousands and however much he might have drunk always with such skill and decision that he was reckoned the best player in the english club vronsky respected and liked iashvin particularly because he felt iashvin liked him not for his name and his money but for himself and of all men he was the only one with whom vronsky would have liked to speak of his love he felt that iashvin in spite of his apparent contempt for every sort of feeling was the only man who could so he fancied comprehend the intense passion which now filled his whole life moreover he felt certain that iashvin as it was took no delight in gossip and scandal and interpreted his feeling rightly that is to say knew and believed that this passion was not a joke not a pastime but something more serious and important 
 vronsky had never spoken to him of his passion but he was aware that he knew all about it and that he put the right interpretation on it and he was glad to see this in his eyes

 chapter 
 
 the temporary stable a wooden booth had been put up close to the racecourse and there his mare was to have been taken the previous day he had not yet seen her there during the last few days he had not ridden her out for exercise himself but had put her in the charge of the trainer and so now he absolutely did not know in what condition his mare had arrived yesterday or was in today he had scarcely got out of his carriage when his stableboy groom recognizing the carriage some way off called the trainer a englishman in high boots and a short jacket except for a tuft below his chin came to meet him walking with the uncouth gait of a jockey turning his elbows out and swaying from side to side 
 well vronsky asked in english 
 all right sir the voice responded somewhere far down in his throat better not go in he added touching his hat put a muzzle on her and the fidgety better not go in excite the mare 
 no going in i want to look at her 
 come along then said the englishman frowning and speaking with his mouth shut and with swinging elbows he went on in front with his disjointed gait 
 they went into the little yard in front of the shed the stableboy on duty spruce and smart in his holiday attire met them with a broom in his hand and followed them in the shed there were five horses in their separate stalls and vronsky knew that his chief rival gladiator a very tall chestnut horse had been brought there and must be standing among them even more than his mare vronsky longed to see gladiator whom he had never seen but vronsky knew that by the etiquette of the racecourse it was not merely impossible for him to see the horse but improper even to ask questions about him just as he was passing along the passage the boy opened the door into the second horsebox on the left and vronsky caught a glimpse of a big chestnut horse with white legs he knew that this was gladiator but with the feeling of a man turning away from the sight of another open letter he turned round and went into stall 
 the stall belonging to mak i never can say the name is here said the englishman over his shoulder pointing his thumb toward stall 
 makhotin yes my most serious rival said vronsky 
 if you were riding him said the englishman bet on you 
 more nervous while the other is more powerful said vronsky smiling at the compliment to his riding 
 in a steeplechase it all depends on riding and on pluck said the englishman 
 of pluck that is energy and courage vronsky did not merely feel that he had enough what was of far more importance he was firmly convinced that no one in the world could have more of this pluck than he had 
 you think i want more sweating down 
 oh no answered the englishman please speak loud the fidgety he added nodding toward the horse box before which they were standing and from which came the sound of restless stamping in the straw 
 he opened the door and vronsky went into the horse box dimly lighted by one little window in the horse box stood a dark bay mare with a muzzle on shifting her feet on the fresh straw looking round him in the twilight of the horse box vronsky unconsciously took in once more in a comprehensive glance all the points of his favorite mare was an animal of medium size not altogether free from reproach from a point of view she was all over though her chest was extremely prominent in front it was narrow her hindquarters were a little drooping and in her forelegs and still more in her hind legs there was a noticeable curvature the muscles of both hind legs and forelegs were not very thick but across her shoulders the mare was exceptionally broad a peculiarity specially striking now that she was lean from training the bones of her legs below the knees looked no thicker than a finger from in front but were extraordinarily thick seen from the side she looked altogether except across the shoulders apparently pinched in at the sides and pressed out in depth but she had in the highest degree the quality that makes all defects forgotten that quality was blood the blood that tells as the english expression has it the muscles stood up sharply under the network of sinews covered with the delicate mobile skin soft as satin and they were hard as bone her head with prominent bright spirited eyes broadened out at the open nostrils that showed the red blood in the cartilage within about all her figure and especially her head there was a certain expression of energy and at the same time of softness she was one of those creatures which seem devoid of speech only because the mechanism of their mouths does not allow of it 
 to vronsky at any rate it seemed that she understood all he felt at that moment as he looked at her 
 directly vronsky went toward her she drew in a deep breath and turning back her prominent eye tin the white looked bloodshot she started at the approaching figures from the opposite side shaking her muzzle and shifting lightly from one leg to the other 
 there you see how fidgety she is said the englishman 
 whoa darling whoa said vronsky going up to the mare and speaking soothingly to her 
 but the nearer he came the more excited she grew only when he stood by her head she was suddenly quieter while the muscles quivered under her soft delicate coat vronsky patted her strong neck straightened over her sharp withers a stray lock of her mane that had fallen on the other side and moved his face near her dilated nostrils transparent as a wing she drew a loud breath and snorted out through her tense nostrils started pricked up her sharp ear and put out her strong black lip toward vronsky as though she would nip hold of his sleeve but remembering the muzzle she shook it and again began restlessly stamping her shapely legs one after the other 
 calm down darling calm down he said patting her again over her hindquarters and with a glad sense that his mare was in the best possible condition he went out of the horse box 
 the excitement had infected vronsky he felt that his heart was throbbing and that he too like the mare longed to move to bite it was both fearful and delicious 
 well i rely on you then he said to the englishman six on the ground 
 all right said the englishman oh where are you going my lord he asked suddenly using the title my lord which he scarcely ever used 
 vronsky in amazement raised his head and stared as he knew how to stare not into the eyes but at his forehead astounded at the impertinence of his question but realizing that in asking this the englishman had been looking at him not as an employer but as a jockey he answered 
 got to go to i shall be home within an hour 
 how often asked that question today he said to himself and he blushed a thing which rarely happened to him the englishman looked gravely at him and as though he too knew where vronsky was going he added 
 the great thing is to keep quiet before a race said he get out of temper or upset about anything 
 all right answered vronsky smiling and jumping into his carriage he told the man to drive to peterhof 
 before he had driven many paces away the dark clouds that had been threatening rain all day broke and there was a heavy downpour of rain 
 what a pity thought vronsky putting up the roof of the carriage it was muddy before now it will be a perfect swamp as he sat in solitude in the closed carriage he took out his letter and his note and read them through 
 yes it was the same thing over and over again everyone his mother his brother everyone thought fit to interfere in the affairs of his heart this interference aroused in him a feeling of angry hatred a feeling he had rarely known before what business is it of theirs why does everybody feel called upon to concern himself about me and why do they worry me so just because they see that this is something they understand if it were a common vulgar worldly intrigue they would have left me alone they feel that this is something different that this is not a mere pastime that this woman is dearer to me than life and this is incomprehensible and why it annoys them whatever our destiny is or may be we have made it ourselves and we do not complain of it he said in the word we linking himself with anna no they must needs teach us how to live they an idea of what happiness is they know that without our love there is for us neither happiness nor unhappiness no life at all he thought 
 he was angry with all of them for their interference just because he felt in his soul that they all these people were right he felt that the love that bound him to anna was not a momentary impulse which would pass as worldly intrigues do pass leaving no other traces in the life of either save pleasant or unpleasant memories he felt all the torture of his own position and hers all the difficulty in store for them conspicuous as they were in the eye of all the world in concealing their love in lying and deceiving and in lying deceiving feigning and continually thinking of others when the passion that united them was so intense that they were both oblivious of everything else save their love 
 he vividly recalled all the constantly recurring instances of inevitable necessity for lying and deceit which were so against his natural bent he recalled particularly vividly the shame he had more than once detected in her at this necessity for lying and deceit and he experienced the strange feeling that had sometimes come upon him since his relations with anna this was a feeling of loathing for something whether for alexei alexandrovich or for himself or for the whole world he could not have said but he always drove away this strange feeling now too he shook it off and continued the thread of his thoughts 
 yes she was unhappy before but proud and at peace and now she cannot be at peace and feel secure in her dignity though she does not show it yes we must put an end to it he decided 
 and for the first time the idea clearly presented itself that it was essential to put an end to this false position and the sooner the better abandon everything must we she and i and hide ourselves somewhere alone with our love he said to himself

 the temporary stable a wooden booth had been put up close to the racecourse and there his mare was to have been taken the previous day he had not yet seen her there during the last few days he had not ridden her out for exercise himself but had put her in the charge of the trainer and so now he absolutely did not know in what condition his mare had arrived yesterday or was in today he had scarcely got out of his carriage when his stableboy groom recognizing the carriage some way off called the trainer a englishman in high boots and a short jacket except for a tuft below his chin came to meet him walking with the uncouth gait of a jockey turning his elbows out and swaying from side to side 
 well vronsky asked in english 
 all right sir the voice responded somewhere far down in his throat better not go in he added touching his hat put a muzzle on her and the fidgety better not go in excite the mare 
 no going in i want to look at her 
 come along then said the englishman frowning and speaking with his mouth shut and with swinging elbows he went on in front with his disjointed gait 
 they went into the little yard in front of the shed the stableboy on duty spruce and smart in his holiday attire met them with a broom in his hand and followed them in the shed there were five horses in their separate stalls and vronsky knew that his chief rival gladiator a very tall chestnut horse had been brought there and must be standing among them even more than his mare vronsky longed to see gladiator whom he had never seen but vronsky knew that by the etiquette of the racecourse it was not merely impossible for him to see the horse but improper even to ask questions about him just as he was passing along the passage the boy opened the door into the second horsebox on the left and vronsky caught a glimpse of a big chestnut horse with white legs he knew that this was gladiator but with the feeling of a man turning away from the sight of another open letter he turned round and went into stall 
 the stall belonging to mak i never can say the name is here said the englishman over his shoulder pointing his thumb toward stall 
 makhotin yes my most serious rival said vronsky 
 if you were riding him said the englishman bet on you 
 more nervous while the other is more powerful said vronsky smiling at the compliment to his riding 
 in a steeplechase it all depends on riding and on pluck said the englishman 
 of pluck that is energy and courage vronsky did not merely feel that he had enough what was of far more importance he was firmly convinced that no one in the world could have more of this pluck than he had 
 you think i want more sweating down 
 oh no answered the englishman please speak loud the fidgety he added nodding toward the horse box before which they were standing and from which came the sound of restless stamping in the straw 
 he opened the door and vronsky went into the horse box dimly lighted by one little window in the horse box stood a dark bay mare with a muzzle on shifting her feet on the fresh straw looking round him in the twilight of the horse box vronsky unconsciously took in once more in a comprehensive glance all the points of his favorite mare was an animal of medium size not altogether free from reproach from a point of view she was all over though her chest was extremely prominent in front it was narrow her hindquarters were a little drooping and in her forelegs and still more in her hind legs there was a noticeable curvature the muscles of both hind legs and forelegs were not very thick but across her shoulders the mare was exceptionally broad a peculiarity specially striking now that she was lean from training the bones of her legs below the knees looked no thicker than a finger from in front but were extraordinarily thick seen from the side she looked altogether except across the shoulders apparently pinched in at the sides and pressed out in depth but she had in the highest degree the quality that makes all defects forgotten that quality was blood the blood that tells as the english expression has it the muscles stood up sharply under the network of sinews covered with the delicate mobile skin soft as satin and they were hard as bone her head with prominent bright spirited eyes broadened out at the open nostrils that showed the red blood in the cartilage within about all her figure and especially her head there was a certain expression of energy and at the same time of softness she was one of those creatures which seem devoid of speech only because the mechanism of their mouths does not allow of it 
 to vronsky at any rate it seemed that she understood all he felt at that moment as he looked at her 
 directly vronsky went toward her she drew in a deep breath and turning back her prominent eye tin the white looked bloodshot she started at the approaching figures from the opposite side shaking her muzzle and shifting lightly from one leg to the other 
 there you see how fidgety she is said the englishman 
 whoa darling whoa said vronsky going up to the mare and speaking soothingly to her 
 but the nearer he came the more excited she grew only when he stood by her head she was suddenly quieter while the muscles quivered under her soft delicate coat vronsky patted her strong neck straightened over her sharp withers a stray lock of her mane that had fallen on the other side and moved his face near her dilated nostrils transparent as a wing she drew a loud breath and snorted out through her tense nostrils started pricked up her sharp ear and put out her strong black lip toward vronsky as though she would nip hold of his sleeve but remembering the muzzle she shook it and again began restlessly stamping her shapely legs one after the other 
 calm down darling calm down he said patting her again over her hindquarters and with a glad sense that his mare was in the best possible condition he went out of the horse box 
 the excitement had infected vronsky he felt that his heart was throbbing and that he too like the mare longed to move to bite it was both fearful and delicious 
 well i rely on you then he said to the englishman six on the ground 
 all right said the englishman oh where are you going my lord he asked suddenly using the title my lord which he scarcely ever used 
 vronsky in amazement raised his head and stared as he knew how to stare not into the eyes but at his forehead astounded at the impertinence of his question but realizing that in asking this the englishman had been looking at him not as an employer but as a jockey he answered 
 got to go to i shall be home within an hour 
 how often asked that question today he said to himself and he blushed a thing which rarely happened to him the englishman looked gravely at him and as though he too knew where vronsky was going he added 
 the great thing is to keep quiet before a race said he get out of temper or upset about anything 
 all right answered vronsky smiling and jumping into his carriage he told the man to drive to peterhof 
 before he had driven many paces away the dark clouds that had been threatening rain all day broke and there was a heavy downpour of rain 
 what a pity thought vronsky putting up the roof of the carriage it was muddy before now it will be a perfect swamp as he sat in solitude in the closed carriage he took out his letter and his note and read them through 
 yes it was the same thing over and over again everyone his mother his brother everyone thought fit to interfere in the affairs of his heart this interference aroused in him a feeling of angry hatred a feeling he had rarely known before what business is it of theirs why does everybody feel called upon to concern himself about me and why do they worry me so just because they see that this is something they understand if it were a common vulgar worldly intrigue they would have left me alone they feel that this is something different that this is not a mere pastime that this woman is dearer to me than life and this is incomprehensible and why it annoys them whatever our destiny is or may be we have made it ourselves and we do not complain of it he said in the word we linking himself with anna no they must needs teach us how to live they an idea of what happiness is they know that without our love there is for us neither happiness nor unhappiness no life at all he thought 
 he was angry with all of them for their interference just because he felt in his soul that they all these people were right he felt that the love that bound him to anna was not a momentary impulse which would pass as worldly intrigues do pass leaving no other traces in the life of either save pleasant or unpleasant memories he felt all the torture of his own position and hers all the difficulty in store for them conspicuous as they were in the eye of all the world in concealing their love in lying and deceiving and in lying deceiving feigning and continually thinking of others when the passion that united them was so intense that they were both oblivious of everything else save their love 
 he vividly recalled all the constantly recurring instances of inevitable necessity for lying and deceit which were so against his natural bent he recalled particularly vividly the shame he had more than once detected in her at this necessity for lying and deceit and he experienced the strange feeling that had sometimes come upon him since his relations with anna this was a feeling of loathing for something whether for alexei alexandrovich or for himself or for the whole world he could not have said but he always drove away this strange feeling now too he shook it off and continued the thread of his thoughts 
 yes she was unhappy before but proud and at peace and now she cannot be at peace and feel secure in her dignity though she does not show it yes we must put an end to it he decided 
 and for the first time the idea clearly presented itself that it was essential to put an end to this false position and the sooner the better abandon everything must we she and i and hide ourselves somewhere alone with our love he said to himself

 chapter 
 
 the shower did not last long and by the time vronsky arrived his shaft horse trotting at full speed and dragging the off horses galloping through the mud with their reins hanging loose the sun had peeped out again the roofs of the summer villas and the old lime trees in the gardens on both sides of the high street sparkled with wet brilliance and from the twigs came a pleasant drip and from the roofs rushing streams of water he thought no more of shower spoiling the racecourse but was now rejoicing because thanks to the rain he would be sure to find her at home and alone as he knew that alexei alexandrovich who had lately returned from a watering place had not moved from peterburg 
 hoping to find her alone vronsky alighted as he always did to avoid attracting attention before crossing the bridge and walked to the house he did not go up the steps to the street door but went into the court 
 has your master come he asked a gardener 
 no sir the mistress is at home but will you please go to the front door there are servants there the gardener answered open the door 
 no go in from the garden 
 and feeling satisfied that she was alone and wanting to take her by surprise since he had not promised to be there today and she would certainly not expect him to come before the races he walked holding his sword and stepping cautiously over the sandy path bordered with flowers to the terrace that looked out upon the garden vronsky forgot now all that he had thought on the way of the hardships and difficulties of his position he thought of nothing but that he would see her directly not in imagination but living all of her as she was in reality he was just going in stepping on his whole foot so as not to make a noise up the worn steps of the terrace when he suddenly remembered what he always forgot and what caused the most torturing side of his relations with her her son with his questioning and as he fancied hostile eyes 
 this boy was more often than anyone else a check upon their freedom when he was present both vronsky and anna did not merely avoid speaking of anything that they could not have repeated before everyone they did not even allow themselves to refer by hints to anything the boy did not understand they had made no agreement about this it had been settled of itself they would have felt it as wounding themselves to deceive the child in his presence they talked like acquaintances but in spite of this caution vronsky often saw the intent bewildered glance fixed upon him and a strange shyness uncertainty at one time there was friendliness at another coldness and reserve in the manner to him as though the child felt that between this man and his mother there existed some important bond the significance of which he could not understand 
 as a matter of fact the boy did feel that he could not understand this relation and he tried painfully yet was unable to make clear to himself what feeling he ought to have for this man with a keen instinct for every manifestation of feeling he saw distinctly that his father his governess his nurse all not merely disliked vronsky but looked on him with horror and aversion though they never said anything about him while his mother looked on him as her greatest friend 
 what does it mean who is he how ought i to love him if i know my fault either stupid or a naughty boy thought the child and this was what caused his dubious inquiring sometimes hostile expression and the shyness and uncertainty which vronsky found so irksome this presence always and infallibly called up in vronsky that strange feeling of inexplicable loathing which he had experienced of late this presence called up both in vronsky and in anna a feeling akin to the feeling of a sailor who sees by the compass that the direction in which he is swiftly moving is far from the right one but that to arrest his motion is not in his power that every instant is carrying him farther and farther away and that to admit to himself his deviation from the right direction is tantamount to admitting his certain ruin 
 this child with his innocent outlook upon life was the compass that showed them the point at which they had departed from what they knew yet did not want to know 
 this time seriozha was not at home and she was completely alone she was sitting on the terrace waiting for the return of her son who had gone out for a stroll and had been caught in the rain she had sent out a manservant and a maid to look for him and was sitting here waiting for them dressed in a white gown deeply embroidered she was sitting in a corner of the terrace behind some flowers and did not hear him bending her curly dark head she pressed her forehead against a cool watering pot that stood on the parapet and both her lovely hands with the rings he knew so well clasped the pot the beauty of her whole figure her head her neck her hands struck vronsky every time as something new and unexpected he stood still gazing at her in ecstasy but directly he would have made a step to come nearer to her she was aware of his presence pushed away the watering pot and turned her flushed face toward him 
 the matter are you unwell he said to her in french going up to her he would have run to her but remembering that there might be outsiders he looked round toward the balcony door and reddened as he always reddened feeling that he had to be afraid and be on his guard 
 no quite well she said getting up and squeezing his outstretched hand tightly i did not expect thee 
 my god what cold hands he said 
 you startled me she said alone and expecting seriozha out for a walk come from this direction 
 but in spite of her efforts to be calm her lips were quivering 
 forgive me for coming but i pass the day without seeing you he went on speaking french as he always did to avoid using the stiff russian plural form so impossibly frigid between them and the dangerously intimate singular 
 forgive for what so glad 
 but ill or worried he went on without letting go her hands and bending over her what were you thinking of 
 always of the same thing she said with a smile 
 she spoke the truth if ever at any moment she had been asked what she was thinking of she could have answered truly of the same thing of her happiness and her unhappiness she was thinking just when he came upon her of this why was it she wondered that to others to betsy for instance she knew of her secret connection with tushkevich all this was so easy while to her it was such torture today this thought gained special poignancy from certain other considerations she asked him about the races he answered her questions and seeing that she was agitated trying to calm her he began telling her in the simplest tone the details of his preparations for the races 
 shall i tell him or not she thought looking into his calm affable eyes he is so happy so absorbed in his races that he understand as he should he understand all the significance of this event to us 
 but you told me what you were thinking of when i came in he said interrupting his narrative pray tell me 
 she did not answer and bending her head a little she looked inquiringly at him from under her brows her eyes shining under their long lashes her hand shook as it played with a leaf she had picked he saw it and his face expressed that utter subjection that slavish devotion which had done so much to win her 
 i see something has happened do you suppose i can be at peace knowing you have a trouble i am not sharing tell me for sake he repeated imploringly 
 yes i be able to forgive him if he does not realize all the significance of it better not tell why put him to the proof she thought still staring at him in the same way and feeling that her hand that held the leaf was trembling more and more 
 for sake he repeated taking her hand 
 shall i tell you 
 yes yes yes 
 i am pregnant she said softly and slowly 
 the leaf in her hand shook more violently but she did not take her eyes off him watching how he would take it he turned pale would have said something but stopped he dropped her hand and his head sank on his breast yes he realizes all the significance of the fact she thought and gratefully she pressed his hand 
 but she was mistaken in thinking he realized the significance of the news as she a woman realized it on hearing it he felt come upon him with tenfold intensity that strange feeling of loathing of someone but at the same time he realized that the turning point he had been longing for had come now that it was impossible to go on concealing things from her husband and it was inevitable in one way or another that they should soon put an end to their unnatural position but besides that her emotion physically affected him in the same way he looked at her with a look of submissive tenderness kissed her hand got up and in silence paced up and down the terrace 
 yes he said going up to her resolutely neither you nor i have looked on our relations as a passing amusement and now our fate is sealed it is absolutely necessary to put an end he looked round as he spoke to the deception in which we are living 
 put an end put an end how alexei she said softly 
 she was calmer now and her face lighted up with a tender smile 
 leave your husband and make our life one 
 it is one as it is she answered scarcely audibly 
 yes but completely completely 
 but how alexei tell me how she said in melancholy mockery at the hopelessness of her own situation is there any way out of such a situation am i not the wife of my husband 
 there is a way out of every situation we must take our stand he said better than the situation in which living of course i see how you torture yourself over everything the world and your son and your husband 
 oh not over my husband she said with a plain smile i know him i think of him he exist 
 not speaking sincerely i know you you worry about him too 
 oh he even know she said and suddenly a hot flush came over her face her cheeks her brow her neck crimsoned and tears of shame came into her eyes but let us not even talk of him
