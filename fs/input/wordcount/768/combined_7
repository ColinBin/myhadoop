 socrates glaucon 
 with these words i was thinking that i had made an end of the discussion but the end in truth proved to be only a beginning for glaucon who is always the most pugnacious of men was dissatisfied at thrasymachus retirement he wanted to have the battle out so he said to me socrates do you wish really to persuade us or only to seem to have persuaded us that to be just is always better than to be unjust 
 i should wish really to persuade you i replied if i could 
 then you certainly have not succeeded let me ask you now how would you arrange goods are there not some which we welcome for their own sakes and independently of their consequences as for example harmless pleasures and enjoyments which delight us at the time although nothing follows from them 
 i agree in thinking that there is such a class i replied 
 is there not also a second class of goods such as knowledge sight health which are desirable not only in themselves but also for their results 
 certainly i said 
 and would you not recognize a third class such as gymnastic and the care of the sick and the art also the various ways of these do us good but we regard them as disagreeable and no one would choose them for their own sakes but only for the sake of some reward or result which flows from them 
 there is i said this third class also but why do you ask 
 because i want to know in which of the three classes you would place justice 
 in the highest class i replied among those goods which he who would be happy desires both for their own sake and for the sake of their results 
 then the many are of another mind they think that justice is to be reckoned in the troublesome class among goods which are to be pursued for the sake of rewards and of reputation but in themselves are disagreeable and rather to be avoided 
 i know i said that this is their manner of thinking and that this was the thesis which thrasymachus was maintaining just now when he censured justice and praised injustice but i am too stupid to be convinced by him 
 i wish he said that you would hear me as well as him and then i shall see whether you and i agree for thrasymachus seems to me like a snake to have been charmed by your voice sooner than he ought to have been but to my mind the nature of justice and injustice have not yet been made clear setting aside their rewards and results i want to know what they are in themselves and how they inwardly work in the soul if you please then i will revive the argument of thrasymachus and first i will speak of the nature and origin of justice according to the common view of them secondly i will show that all men who practise justice do so against their will of necessity but not as a good and thirdly i will argue that there is reason in this view for the life of the unjust is after all better far than the life of the just if what they say is true socrates since i myself am not of their opinion but still i acknowledge that i am perplexed when i hear the voices of thrasymachus and myriads of others dinning in my ears and on the other hand i have never yet heard the superiority of justice to injustice maintained by any one in a satisfactory way i want to hear justice praised in respect of itself then i shall be satisfied and you are the person from whom i think that i am most likely to hear this and therefore i will praise the unjust life to the utmost of my power and my manner of speaking will indicate the manner in which i desire to hear you too praising justice and censuring injustice will you say whether you approve of my proposal 
 indeed i do nor can i imagine any theme about which a man of sense would oftener wish to converse 
 i am delighted he replied to hear you say so and shall begin by speaking as i proposed of the nature and origin of justice 
 glaucon 
 they say that to do injustice is by nature good to suffer injustice evil but that the evil is greater than the good and so when men have both done and suffered injustice and have had experience of both not being able to avoid the one and obtain the other they think that they had better agree among themselves to have neither hence there arise laws and mutual covenants and that which is ordained by law is termed by them lawful and just this they affirm to be the origin and nature of justice it is a mean or compromise between the best of all which is to do injustice and not be punished and the worst of all which is to suffer injustice without the power of retaliation and justice being at a middle point between the two is tolerated not as a good but as the lesser evil and honoured by reason of the inability of men to do injustice for no man who is worthy to be called a man would ever submit to such an agreement if he were able to resist he would be mad if he did such is the received account socrates of the nature and origin of justice 
 now that those who practise justice do so involuntarily and because they have not the power to be unjust will best appear if we imagine something of this kind having given both to the just and the unjust power to do what they will let us watch and see whither desire will lead them then we shall discover in the very act the just and unjust man to be proceeding along the same road following their interest which all natures deem to be their good and are only diverted into the path of justice by the force of law the liberty which we are supposing may be most completely given to them in the form of such a power as is said to have been possessed by gyges the ancestor of croesus the lydian according to the tradition gyges was a shepherd in the service of the king of lydia there was a great storm and an earthquake made an opening in the earth at the place where he was feeding his flock amazed at the sight he descended into the opening where among other marvels he beheld a hollow brazen horse having doors at which he stooping and looking in saw a dead body of stature as appeared to him more than human and having nothing on but a gold ring this he took from the finger of the dead and reascended now the shepherds met together according to custom that they might send their monthly report about the flocks to the king into their assembly he came having the ring on his finger and as he was sitting among them he chanced to turn the collet of the ring inside his hand when instantly he became invisible to the rest of the company and they began to speak of him as if he were no longer present he was astonished at this and again touching the ring he turned the collet outwards and reappeared he made several trials of the ring and always with the same he turned the collet inwards he became invisible when outwards he reappeared whereupon he contrived to be chosen one of the messengers who were sent to the court where as soon as he arrived he seduced the queen and with her help conspired against the king and slew him and took the kingdom suppose now that there were two such magic rings and the just put on one of them and the unjust the man can be imagined to be of such an iron nature that he would stand fast in justice no man would keep his hands off what was not his own when he could safely take what he liked out of the market or go into houses and lie with any one at his pleasure or kill or release from prison whom he would and in all respects be like a god among men then the actions of the just would be as the actions of the unjust they would both come at last to the same point and this we may truly affirm to be a great proof that a man is just not willingly or because he thinks that justice is any good to him individually but of necessity for wherever any one thinks that he can safely be unjust there he is unjust for all men believe in their hearts that injustice is far more profitable to the individual than justice and he who argues as i have been supposing will say that they are right if you could imagine any one obtaining this power of becoming invisible and never doing any wrong or touching what was he would be thought by the to be a most wretched idiot although they would praise him to one faces and keep up appearances with one another from a fear that they too might suffer injustice enough of this 
 now if we are to form a real judgment of the life of the just and unjust we must isolate them there is no other way and how is the isolation to be effected i answer let the unjust man be entirely unjust and the just man entirely just nothing is to be taken away from either of them and both are to be perfectly furnished for the work of their respective lives first let the unjust be like other distinguished masters of craft like the skilful pilot or physician who knows intuitively his own powers and keeps within their limits and who if he fails at any point is able to recover himself so let the unjust make his unjust attempts in the right way and lie hidden if he means to be great in his injustice he who is found out is nobody for the highest reach of injustice is to be deemed just when you are not therefore i say that in the perfectly unjust man we must assume the most perfect injustice there is to be no deduction but we must allow him while doing the most unjust acts to have acquired the greatest reputation for justice if he have taken a false step he must be able to recover himself he must be one who can speak with effect if any of his deeds come to light and who can force his way where force is required his courage and strength and command of money and friends and at his side let us place the just man in his nobleness and simplicity wishing as aeschylus says to be and not to seem good there must be no seeming for if he seem to be just he will be honoured and rewarded and then we shall not know whether he is just for the sake of justice or for the sake of honours and rewards therefore let him be clothed in justice only and have no other covering and he must be imagined in a state of life the opposite of the former let him be the best of men and let him be thought the worst then he will have been put to the proof and we shall see whether he will be affected by the fear of infamy and its consequences and let him continue thus to the hour of death being just and seeming to be unjust when both have reached the uttermost extreme the one of justice and the other of injustice let judgment be given which of them is the happier of the two 
 socrates glaucon 
 heavens my dear glaucon i said how energetically you polish them up for the decision first one and then the other as if they were two statues 
 i do my best he said and now that we know what they are like there is no difficulty in tracing out the sort of life which awaits either of them this i will proceed to describe but as you may think the description a little too coarse i ask you to suppose socrates that the words which follow are not mine let me put them into the mouths of the eulogists of injustice they will tell you that the just man who is thought unjust will be scourged racked bound will have his eyes burnt out and at last after suffering every kind of evil he will be impaled then he will understand that he ought to seem only and not to be just the words of aeschylus may be more truly spoken of the unjust than of the just for the unjust is pursuing a reality he does not live with a view to appearances he wants to be really unjust and not to seem only 
 his mind has a soil deep and fertile 
 out of which spring his prudent counsels in the first place he is thought just and therefore bears rule in the city he can marry whom he will and give in marriage to whom he will also he can trade and deal where he likes and always to his own advantage because he has no misgivings about injustice and at every contest whether in public or private he gets the better of his antagonists and gains at their expense and is rich and out of his gains he can benefit his friends and harm his enemies moreover he can offer sacrifices and dedicate gifts to the gods abundantly and magnificently and can honour the gods or any man whom he wants to honour in a far better style than the just and therefore he is likely to be dearer than they are to the gods and thus socrates gods and men are said to unite in making the life of the unjust better than the life of the just 
 adeimantus socrates 
 i was going to say something in answer to glaucon when adeimantus his brother interposed socrates he said you do not suppose that there is nothing more to be urged 
 why what else is there i answered 
 the strongest point of all has not been even mentioned he replied 
 well then according to the proverb let brother help brother if he fails in any part do you assist him although i must confess that glaucon has already said quite enough to lay me in the dust and take from me the power of helping justice 
 adeimantus 
 nonsense he replied but let me add something more there is another side to argument about the praise and censure of justice and injustice which is equally required in order to bring out what i believe to be his meaning parents and tutors are always telling their sons and their wards that they are to be just but why not for the sake of justice but for the sake of character and reputation in the hope of obtaining for him who is reputed just some of those offices marriages and the like which glaucon has enumerated among the advantages accruing to the unjust from the reputation of justice more however is made of appearances by this class of persons than by the others for they throw in the good opinion of the gods and will tell you of a shower of benefits which the heavens as they say rain upon the pious and this accords with the testimony of the noble hesiod and homer the first of whom says that the gods make the oaks of the just 
 to hear acorns at their summit and bees i the middle 
 and the sheep the bowed down bowed the with the their fleeces and many other blessings of a like kind are provided for them and homer has a very similar strain for he speaks of one whose fame is 
 as the fame of some blameless king who like a god 
 maintains justice to whom the black earth brings forth 
 wheat and barley whose trees are bowed with fruit 
 and his sheep never fail to bear and the sea gives him fish still grander are the gifts of heaven which musaeus and his son vouchsafe to the just they take them down into the world below where they have the saints lying on couches at a feast everlastingly drunk crowned with garlands their idea seems to be that an immortality of drunkenness is the highest meed of virtue some extend their rewards yet further the posterity as they say of the faithful and just shall survive to the third and fourth generation this is the style in which they praise justice but about the wicked there is another strain they bury them in a slough in hades and make them carry water in a sieve also while they are yet living they bring them to infamy and inflict upon them the punishments which glaucon described as the portion of the just who are reputed to be unjust nothing else does their invention supply such is their manner of praising the one and censuring the other 
 once more socrates i will ask you to consider another way of speaking about justice and injustice which is not confined to the poets but is found in prose writers the universal voice of mankind is always declaring that justice and virtue are honourable but grievous and toilsome and that the pleasures of vice and injustice are easy of attainment and are only censured by law and opinion they say also that honesty is for the most part less profitable than dishonesty and they are quite ready to call wicked men happy and to honour them both in public and private when they are rich or in any other way influential while they despise and overlook those who may be weak and poor even though acknowledging them to be better than the others but most extraordinary of all is their mode of speaking about virtue and the gods they say that the gods apportion calamity and misery to many good men and good and happiness to the wicked and mendicant prophets go to rich doors and persuade them that they have a power committed to them by the gods of making an atonement for a own or his sins by sacrifices or charms with rejoicings and feasts and they promise to harm an enemy whether just or unjust at a small cost with magic arts and incantations binding heaven as they say to execute their will and the poets are the authorities to whom they appeal now smoothing the path of vice with the words of hesiod 
 vice may be had in abundance without trouble the way is smooth and her is near but before virtue the gods have set toil and a tedious and uphill road then citing homer as a witness that the gods may be influenced by men for he also says 
 the gods too may he turned from their purpose and men pray to them and avert their wrath by sacrifices and soothing entreaties and by libations and the odour of fat when they have sinned and transgressed and they produce a host of books written by musaeus and orpheus who were children of the moon and the muses that is what they say according to which they perform their ritual and persuade not only individuals but whole cities that expiations and atonements for sin may be made by sacrifices and amusements which fill a vacant hour and are equally at the service of the living and the dead the latter sort they call mysteries and they redeem us from the pains of hell but if we neglect them no one knows what awaits us 
 he proceeded and now when the young hear all this said about virtue and vice and the way in which gods and men regard them how are their minds likely to be affected my dear socrates those of them i mean who are quickwitted and like bees on the wing light on every flower and from all that they hear are prone to draw conclusions as to what manner of persons they should be and in what way they should walk if they would make the best of life probably the youth will say to himself in the words of pindar 
 can i by justice or by crooked ways of deceit ascend a loftier tower which may he a fortress to me all my days for what men say is that if i am really just and am not also thought just profit there is none but the pain and loss on the other hand are unmistakable but if though unjust i acquire the reputation of justice a heavenly life is promised to me since then as philosophers prove appearance tyrannizes over truth and is lord of happiness to appearance i must devote myself i will describe around me a picture and shadow of virtue to be the vestibule and exterior of my house behind i will trail the subtle and crafty fox as archilochus greatest of sages recommends but i hear some one exclaiming that the concealment of wickedness is often difficult to which i answer nothing great is easy nevertheless the argument indicates this if we would be happy to be the path along which we should proceed with a view to concealment we will establish secret brotherhoods and political clubs and there are professors of rhetoric who teach the art of persuading courts and assemblies and so partly by persuasion and partly by force i shall make unlawful gains and not be punished still i hear a voice saying that the gods cannot be deceived neither can they be compelled but what if there are no gods or suppose them to have no care of human things why in either case should we mind about concealment and even if there are gods and they do care about us yet we know of them only from tradition and the genealogies of the poets and these are the very persons who say that they may be influenced and turned by sacrifices and soothing entreaties and by offerings let us be consistent then and believe both or neither if the poets speak truly why then we had better be unjust and offer of the fruits of injustice for if we are just although we may escape the vengeance of heaven we shall lose the gains of injustice but if we are unjust we shall keep the gains and by our sinning and praying and praying and sinning the gods will be propitiated and we shall not be punished but there is a world below in which either we or our posterity will suffer for our unjust deeds yes my friend will be the reflection but there are mysteries and atoning deities and these have great power that is what mighty cities declare and the children of the gods who were their poets and prophets bear a like testimony 
 on what principle then shall we any longer choose justice rather than the worst injustice when if we only unite the latter with a deceitful regard to appearances we shall fare to our mind both with gods and men in life and after death as the most numerous and the highest authorities tell us knowing all this socrates how can a man who has any superiority of mind or person or rank or wealth be willing to honour justice or indeed to refrain from laughing when he hears justice praised and even if there should be some one who is able to disprove the truth of my words and who is satisfied that justice is best still he is not angry with the unjust but is very ready to forgive them because he also knows that men are not just of their own free will unless peradventure there be some one whom the divinity within him may have inspired with a hatred of injustice or who has attained knowledge of the truth but no other man he only blames injustice who owing to cowardice or age or some weakness has not the power of being unjust and this is proved by the fact that when he obtains the power he immediately becomes unjust as far as he can be 
 the cause of all this socrates was indicated by us at the beginning of the argument when my brother and i told you how astonished we were to find that of all the professing panegyrists of justice beginning with the ancient heroes of whom any memorial has been preserved to us and ending with the men of our own time no one has ever blamed injustice or praised justice except with a view to the glories honours and benefits which flow from them no one has ever adequately described either in verse or prose the true essential nature of either of them abiding in the soul and invisible to any human or divine eye or shown that of all the things of a soul which he has within him justice is the greatest good and injustice the greatest evil had this been the universal strain had you sought to persuade us of this from our youth upwards we should not have been on the watch to keep one another from doing wrong but every one would have been his own watchman because afraid if he did wrong of harbouring in himself the greatest of evils i dare say that thrasymachus and others would seriously hold the language which i have been merely repeating and words even stronger than these about justice and injustice grossly as i conceive perverting their true nature but i speak in this vehement manner as i must frankly confess to you because i want to hear from you the opposite side and i would ask you to show not only the superiority which justice has over injustice but what effect they have on the possessor of them which makes the one to be a good and the other an evil to him and please as glaucon requested of you to exclude reputations for unless you take away from each of them his true reputation and add on the false we shall say that you do not praise justice but the appearance of it we shall think that you are only exhorting us to keep injustice dark and that you really agree with thrasymachus in thinking that justice is good and the interest of the stronger and that injustice is a own profit and interest though injurious to the weaker now as you have admitted that justice is one of that highest class of goods which are desired indeed for their results but in a far greater degree for their own sakes like sight or hearing or knowledge or health or any other real and natural and not merely conventional good i would ask you in your praise of justice to regard one point only i mean the essential good and evil which justice and injustice work in the possessors of them let others praise justice and censure injustice magnifying the rewards and honours of the one and abusing the other that is a manner of arguing which coming from them i am ready to tolerate but from you who have spent your whole life in the consideration of this question unless i hear the contrary from your own lips i expect something better and therefore i say not only prove to us that justice is better than injustice but show what they either of them do to the possessor of them which makes the one to be a good and the other an evil whether seen or unseen by gods and men 
 socrates adeimantus 
 i had always admired the genius of glaucon and adeimantus but on hearing these words i was quite delighted and said sons of an illustrious father that was not a bad beginning of the elegiac verses which the admirer of glaucon made in honour of you after you had distinguished yourselves at the battle of megara 
 sons of ariston he sang divine offspring of an illustrious hero the epithet is very appropriate for there is something truly divine in being able to argue as you have done for the superiority of injustice and remaining unconvinced by your own arguments and i do believe that you are not convinced this i infer from your general character for had i judged only from your speeches i should have mistrusted you but now the greater my confidence in you the greater is my difficulty in knowing what to say for i am in a strait between two on the one hand i feel that i am unequal to the task and my inability is brought home to me by the fact that you were not satisfied with the answer which i made to thrasymachus proving as i thought the superiority which justice has over injustice and yet i cannot refuse to help while breath and speech remain to me i am afraid that there would be an impiety in being present when justice is evil spoken of and not lifting up a hand in her defence and therefore i had best give such help as i can 
 glaucon and the rest entreated me by all means not to let the question drop but to proceed in the investigation they wanted to arrive at the truth first about the nature of justice and injustice and secondly about their relative advantages i told them what i really thought that the enquiry would be of a serious nature and would require very good eyes seeing then i said that we are no great wits i think that we had better adopt a method which i may illustrate thus suppose that a person had been asked by some one to read small letters from a distance and it occurred to some one else that they might be found in another place which was larger and in which the letters were larger if they were the same and he could read the larger letters first and then proceed to the lesser this would have been thought a rare piece of good fortune 
 very true said adeimantus but how does the illustration apply to our enquiry 
 i will tell you i replied justice which is the subject of our enquiry is as you know sometimes spoken of as the virtue of an individual and sometimes as the virtue of a state 
 true he replied 
 and is not a state larger than an individual 
 it is 
 then in the larger the quantity of justice is likely to be larger and more easily discernible i propose therefore that we enquire into the nature of justice and injustice first as they appear in the state and secondly in the individual proceeding from the greater to the lesser and comparing them 
 that he said is an excellent proposal 
 and if we imagine the state in process of creation we shall see the justice and injustice of the state in process of creation also 
 i dare say 
 when the state is completed there may be a hope that the object of our search will be more easily discovered 
 yes far more easily 
 but ought we to attempt to construct one i said for to do so as i am inclined to think will be a very serious task reflect therefore 
 i have reflected said adeimantus and am anxious that you should proceed 
 a state i said arises as i conceive out of the needs of mankind no one is but all of us have many wants can any other origin of a state be imagined 
 there can i be no other 
 then as we have many wants and many persons are needed to supply them one takes a helper for one purpose and another for another and when these partners and helpers are gathered together in one habitation the body of inhabitants is termed a state 
 true he said 
 and they exchange with one another and one gives and another receives under the idea that the exchange will be for their good 
 very true 
 then i said let us begin and create in idea a state and yet the true creator is necessity who is the mother of our invention 
 of course he replied 
 now the first and greatest of necessities is food which is the condition of life and existence 
 certainly 
 the second is a dwelling and the third clothing and the like 
 true 
 and now let us see how our city will be able to supply this great demand we may suppose that one man is a husbandman another a builder some one else a weaver shall we add to them a shoemaker or perhaps some other purveyor to our bodily wants 
 quite right 
 the barest notion of a state must include four or five men 
 clearly 
 and how will they proceed will each bring the result of his labours into a common stock the individual husbandman for example producing for four and labouring four times as long and as much as he need in the provision of food with which he supplies others as well as himself or will he have nothing to do with others and not be at the trouble of producing for them but provide for himself alone a fourth of the food in a fourth of the time and in the remaining of his time be employed in making a house or a coat or a pair of shoes having no partnership with others but supplying himself all his own wants 
 adeimantus thought that he should aim at producing food only and not at producing everything 
 probably i replied that would be the better way and when i hear you say this i am myself reminded that we are not all alike there are diversities of natures among us which are adapted to different occupations 
 very true 
 and will you have a work better done when the workman has many occupations or when he has only one 
 when he has only one 
 further there can be no doubt that a work is spoilt when not done at the right time 
 no doubt 
 for business is not disposed to wait until the doer of the business is at leisure but the doer must follow up what he is doing and make the business his first object 
 he must 
 and if so we must infer that all things are produced more plentifully and easily and of a better quality when one man does one thing which is natural to him and does it at the right time and leaves other things 
 undoubtedly 
 then more than four citizens will be required for the husbandman will not make his own plough or mattock or other implements of agriculture if they are to be good for anything neither will the builder make his tools and he too needs many and in like manner the weaver and shoemaker 
 true 
 then carpenters and smiths and many other artisans will be sharers in our little state which is already beginning to grow 
 true 
 yet even if we add neatherds shepherds and other herdsmen in order that our husbandmen may have oxen to plough with and builders as well as husbandmen may have draught cattle and curriers and weavers fleeces and hides still our state will not be very large 
 that is true yet neither will it be a very small state which contains all these 
 then again there is the situation of the city to find a place where nothing need be imported is impossible 
 impossible 
 then there must be another class of citizens who will bring the required supply from another city 
 there must 
 but if the trader goes having nothing which they require who would supply his need he will come back 
 that is certain 
 and therefore what they produce at home must be not only enough for themselves but such both in quantity and quality as to accommodate those from whom their wants are supplied 
 very true 
 then more husbandmen and more artisans will be required 
 they will 
 not to mention the importers and exporters who are called merchants 
 yes 
 then we shall want merchants 
 we shall 
 and if merchandise is to be carried over the sea skilful sailors will also be needed and in considerable numbers 
 yes in considerable numbers 
 then again within the city how will they exchange their productions to secure such an exchange was as you will remember one of our principal objects when we formed them into a society and constituted a state 
 clearly they will buy and sell 
 then they will need a and a for purposes of exchange 
 certainly 
 suppose now that a husbandman or an artisan brings some production to market and he comes at a time when there is no one to exchange with him is he to leave his calling and sit idle in the 
 not at all he will find people there who seeing the want undertake the office of salesmen in states they are commonly those who are the weakest in bodily strength and therefore of little use for any other purpose their duty is to be in the market and to give money in exchange for goods to those who desire to sell and to take money from those who desire to buy 
 this want then creates a class of in our state is not retailer the term which is applied to those who sit in the engaged in buying and selling while those who wander from one city to another are called merchants 
 yes he said 
 and there is another class of servants who are intellectually hardly on the level of companionship still they have plenty of bodily strength for labour which accordingly they sell and are called if i do not mistake hirelings hire being the name which is given to the price of their labour 
 true 
 then hirelings will help to make up our population 
 yes 
 and now adeimantus is our state matured and perfected 
 i think so 
 where then is justice and where is injustice and in what part of the state did they spring up 
 probably in the dealings of these citizens with one another cannot imagine that they are more likely to be found anywhere else 
 i dare say that you are right in your suggestion i said we had better think the matter out and not shrink from the enquiry 
 let us then consider first of all what will be their way of life now that we have thus established them will they not produce corn and wine and clothes and shoes and build houses for themselves and when they are housed they will work in summer commonly stripped and barefoot but in winter substantially clothed and shod they will feed on and flour of wheat baking and kneading them making noble cakes and loaves these they will serve up on a mat of reeds or on clean leaves themselves reclining the while upon beds strewn with yew or myrtle and they and their children will feast drinking of the wine which they have made wearing garlands on their heads and hymning the praises of the gods in happy converse with one another and they will take care that their families do not exceed their means having an eye to poverty or war 
 socrates glaucon 
 but said glaucon interposing you have not given them a relish to their meal 
 true i replied i had forgotten of course they must have a and olives and cheese and they will boil roots and herbs such as country people prepare for a dessert we shall give them figs and peas and beans and they will roast and acorns at the fire drinking in moderation and with such a diet they may be expected to live in peace and health to a good old age and bequeath a similar life to their children after them 
 yes socrates he said and if you were providing for a city of pigs how else would you feed the beasts 
 but what would you have glaucon i replied 
 why he said you should give them the ordinary conveniences of life people who are to be comfortable are accustomed to lie on sofas and dine off tables and they should have sauces and sweets in the modern style 
 yes i said now i understand the question which you would have me consider is not only how a state but how a luxurious state is created and possibly there is no harm in this for in such a state we shall be more likely to see how justice and injustice originate in my opinion the true and healthy constitution of the state is the one which i have described but if you wish also to see a state at fever heat i have no objection for i suspect that many will not be satisfied with the simpler way of way they will be for adding sofas and tables and other furniture also dainties and perfumes and incense and courtesans and cakes all these not of one sort only but in every variety we must go beyond the necessaries of which i was at first speaking such as houses and clothes and shoes the arts of the painter and the embroiderer will have to be set in motion and gold and ivory and all sorts of materials must be procured 
 true he said 
 then we must enlarge our borders for the original healthy state is no longer sufficient now will the city have to fill and swell with a multitude of callings which are not required by any natural want such as the whole tribe of hunters and actors of whom one large class have to do with forms and colours another will be the votaries of music poets and their attendant train of rhapsodists players dancers contractors also makers of divers kinds of articles including dresses and we shall want more servants will not tutors be also in request and nurses wet and dry tirewomen and barbers as well as confectioners and cooks and swineherds too who were not needed and therefore had no place in the former edition of our state but are needed now they must not be forgotten and there will be animals of many other kinds if people eat them 
 certainly 
 and living in this way we shall have much greater need of physicians than before 
 much greater 
 and the country which was enough to support the original inhabitants will be too small now and not enough 
 quite true 
 then a slice of our neighbours land will be wanted by us for pasture and tillage and they will want a slice of ours if like ourselves they exceed the limit of necessity and give themselves up to the unlimited accumulation of wealth 
 that socrates will be inevitable 
 and so we shall go to war glaucon shall we not 
 most certainly he replied 
 then without determining as yet whether war does good or harm thus much we may affirm that now we have discovered war to be derived from causes which are also the causes of almost all the evils in states private as well as public 
 undoubtedly 
 and our state must once more enlarge and this time the will be nothing short of a whole army which will have to go out and fight with the invaders for all that we have as well as for the things and persons whom we were describing above 
 why he said are they not capable of defending themselves 
 no i said not if we were right in the principle which was acknowledged by all of us when we were framing the state the principle as you will remember was that one man cannot practise many arts with success 
 very true he said 
 but is not war an art 
 certainly 
 and an art requiring as much attention as shoemaking 
 quite true 
 and the shoemaker was not allowed by us to be husbandman or a weaver a builder in order that we might have our shoes well made but to him and to every other worker was assigned one work for which he was by nature fitted and at that he was to continue working all his life long and at no other he was not to let opportunities slip and then he would become a good workman now nothing can be more important than that the work of a soldier should be well done but is war an art so easily acquired that a man may be a warrior who is also a husbandman or shoemaker or other artisan although no one in the world would be a good dice or draught player who merely took up the game as a recreation and had not from his earliest years devoted himself to this and nothing else 
 no tools will make a man a skilled workman or master of defence nor be of any use to him who has not learned how to handle them and has never bestowed any attention upon them how then will he who takes up a shield or other implement of war become a good fighter all in a day whether with or any other kind of troops 
 yes he said the tools which would teach men their own use would be beyond price 
 and the higher the duties of the guardian i said the more time and skill and art and application will be needed by him 
 no doubt he replied 
 will he not also require natural aptitude for his calling 
 certainly 
 then it will be our duty to select if we can natures which are fitted for the task of guarding the city 
 it will 
 and the selection will be no easy matter i said but we must be brave and do our best 
 we must 
 is not the noble youth very like a dog in respect of guarding and watching 
 what do you mean 
 i mean that both of them ought to be quick to see and swift to overtake the enemy when they see him and strong too if when they have caught him they have to fight with him 
 all these qualities he replied will certainly be required by them 
 well and your guardian must be brave if he is to fight well 
 certainly 
 and is he likely to be brave who has no spirit whether horse or dog or any other animal have you never observed how invincible and unconquerable is spirit and how the presence of it makes the soul of any creature to be absolutely fearless and indomitable 
 i have 
 then now we have a clear notion of the bodily qualities which are required in the guardian 
 true 
 and also of the mental ones his soul is to be full of spirit 
 yes 
 but are not these spirited natures apt to be savage with one another and with everybody else 
 a difficulty by no means easy to overcome he replied 
 whereas i said they ought to be dangerous to their enemies and gentle to their friends if not they will destroy themselves without waiting for their enemies to destroy them 
 true he said 
 what is to be done then i said how shall we find a gentle nature which has also a great spirit for the one is the contradiction of the other 
 true 
 he will not be a good guardian who is wanting in either of these two qualities and yet the combination of them appears to be impossible and hence we must infer that to be a good guardian is impossible 
 i am afraid that what you say is true he replied 
 here feeling perplexed i began to think over what had preceded my friend i said no wonder that we are in a perplexity for we have lost sight of the image which we had before us 
 what do you mean he said 
 i mean to say that there do exist natures gifted with those opposite qualities 
 and where do you find them 
 many animals i replied furnish examples of them our friend the dog is a very good one you know that dogs are perfectly gentle to their familiars and acquaintances and the reverse to strangers 
 yes i know 
 then there is nothing impossible or out of the order of nature in our finding a guardian who has a similar combination of qualities 
 certainly not 
 would not he who is fitted to be a guardian besides the spirited nature need to have the qualities of a philosopher 
 i do not apprehend your meaning 
 the trait of which i am speaking i replied may be also seen in the dog and is remarkable in the animal 
 what trait 
 why a dog whenever he sees a stranger is angry when an acquaintance he welcomes him although the one has never done him any harm nor the other any good did this never strike you as curious 
 the matter never struck me before but i quite recognise the truth of your remark 
 and surely this instinct of the dog is very charming your dog is a true philosopher 
 why 
 why because he distinguishes the face of a friend and of an enemy only by the criterion of knowing and not knowing and must not an animal be a lover of learning who determines what he likes and dislikes by the test of knowledge and ignorance 
 most assuredly 
 and is not the love of learning the love of wisdom which is philosophy 
 they are the same he replied 
 and may we not say confidently of man also that he who is likely to be gentle to his friends and acquaintances must by nature be a lover of wisdom and knowledge 
 that we may safely affirm 
 then he who is to be a really good and noble guardian of the state will require to unite in himself philosophy and spirit and swiftness and strength 
 undoubtedly 
 then we have found the desired natures and now that we have found them how are they to be reared and educated is not this enquiry which may be expected to throw light on the greater enquiry which is our final end how do justice and injustice grow up in states for we do not want either to omit what is to the point or to draw out the argument to an inconvenient length 
 socrates adeimantus 
 adeimantus thought that the enquiry would be of great service to us 
 then i said my dear friend the task must not be given up even if somewhat long 
 certainly not 
 come then and let us pass a leisure hour in and our story shall be the education of our heroes 
 by all means 
 and what shall be their education can we find a better than the traditional sort and this has two divisions gymnastic for the body and music for the soul 
 true 
 shall we begin education with music and go on to gymnastic afterwards 
 by all means 
 and when you speak of music do you include literature or not 
 i do 
 and literature may be either true or false 
 yes 
 and the young should be trained in both kinds and we begin with the false 
 i do not understand your meaning he said 
 you know i said that we begin by telling children stories which though not wholly destitute of truth are in the main fictitious and these stories are told them when they are not of an age to learn gymnastics 
 very true 
 that was my meaning when i said that we must teach music before gymnastics 
 quite right he said 
 you know also that the beginning is the most important part of any work especially in the case of a young and tender thing for that is the time at which the character is being formed and the desired impression is more readily taken 
 quite true 
 and shall we just carelessly allow children to hear any casual tales which may be devised by casual persons and to receive into their minds ideas for the most part the very opposite of those which we should wish them to have when they are grown up 
 we cannot 
 then the first thing will be to establish a censorship of the writers of fiction and let the censors receive any tale of fiction which is good and reject the bad and we will desire mothers and nurses to tell their children the authorised ones only let them fashion the mind with such tales even more fondly than they mould the body with their hands but most of those which are now in use must be discarded 
 of what tales are you speaking he said 
 you may find a model of the lesser in the greater i said for they are necessarily of the same type and there is the same spirit in both of them 
 very likely he replied but i do not as yet know what you would term the greater 
 those i said which are narrated by homer and hesiod and the rest of the poets who have ever been the great of mankind 
 but which stories do you mean he said and what fault do you find with them 
 a fault which is most serious i said the fault of telling a lie and what is more a bad lie 
 but when is this fault committed 
 whenever an erroneous representation is made of the nature of gods and heroes as when a painter paints a portrait not having the shadow of a likeness to the original 
 yes he said that sort of thing is certainly very blamable but what are the stories which you mean 
 first of all i said there was that greatest of all lies in high places which the poet told about uranus and which was a bad lie too i mean what hesiod says that uranus did and how cronus retaliated on him the doings of cronus and the sufferings which in turn his son inflicted upon him even if they were true ought certainly not to be lightly told to young and thoughtless persons if possible they had better be buried in silence but if there is an absolute necessity for their mention a chosen few might hear them in a mystery and they should sacrifice not a common eleusinian pig but some huge and unprocurable victim and then the number of the hearers will be very few indeed 
 why yes said he those stories are extremely objectionable 
 yes adeimantus they are stories not to be repeated in our state the young man should not be told that in committing the worst of crimes he is far from doing anything outrageous and that even if he chastises his father when does wrong in whatever manner he will only be following the example of the first and greatest among the gods 
 i entirely agree with you he said in my opinion those stories are quite unfit to be repeated 
 neither if we mean our future guardians to regard the habit of quarrelling among themselves as of all things the basest should any word be said to them of the wars in heaven and of the plots and fightings of the gods against one another for they are not true no we shall never mention the battles of the giants or let them be embroidered on garments and we shall be silent about the innumerable other quarrels of gods and heroes with their friends and relatives if they would only believe us we would tell them that quarrelling is unholy and that never up to this time has there been any quarrel between citizens this is what old men and old women should begin by telling children and when they grow up the poets also should be told to compose for them in a similar spirit but the narrative of hephaestus binding here his mother or how on another occasion zeus sent him flying for taking her part when she was being beaten and all the battles of the gods in homer these tales must not be admitted into our state whether they are supposed to have an allegorical meaning or not for a young person cannot judge what is allegorical and what is literal anything that he receives into his mind at that age is likely to become indelible and unalterable and therefore it is most important that the tales which the young first hear should be models of virtuous thoughts 
 there you are right he replied but if any one asks where are such models to be found and of what tales are you speaking how shall we answer him 
 i said to him you and i adeimantus at this moment are not poets but founders of a state now the founders of a state ought to know the general forms in which poets should cast their tales and the limits which must be observed by them but to make the tales is not their business 
 very true he said but what are these forms of theology which you mean 
 something of this kind i replied god is always to be represented as he truly is whatever be the sort of poetry epic lyric or tragic in which the representation is given 
 right 
 and is he not truly good and must he not be represented as such 
 certainly 
 and no good thing is hurtful 
 no indeed 
 and that which is not hurtful hurts not 
 certainly not 
 and that which hurts not does no evil 
 no 
 and can that which does no evil be a cause of evil 
 impossible 
 and the good is advantageous 
 yes 
 and therefore the cause of 
 yes 
 it follows therefore that the good is not the cause of all things but of the good only 
 assuredly 
 then god if he be good is not the author of all things as the many assert but he is the cause of a few things only and not of most things that occur to men for few are the goods of human life and many are the evils and the good is to be attributed to god alone of the evils the causes are to be sought elsewhere and not in him 
 that appears to me to be most true he said 
 then we must not listen to homer or to any other poet who is guilty of the folly of saying that two casks lie at the threshold of zeus full of lots one of good the other of evil lots and that he to whom zeus gives a mixture of the two sometimes meets with evil fortune at other times with good but that he to whom is given the cup of unmingled ill 
 him wild hunger drives the beauteous earth and again 
 zeus who is the dispenser of good and evil to us and if any one asserts that the violation of oaths and treaties which was really the work of pandarus was brought about by athene and zeus or that the strife and contention of the gods was instigated by themis and zeus he shall not have our approval neither will we allow our young men to hear the words of aeschylus that god plants guilt among men when he desires utterly to destroy a house and if a poet writes of the sufferings of niobe the subject of the tragedy in which these iambic verses occur or of the house of pelops or of the trojan war or on any similar theme either we must not permit him to say that these are the works of god or if they are of god he must devise some explanation of them such as we are seeking he must say that god did what was just and right and they were the better for being punished but that those who are punished are miserable and that god is the author of their misery the poet is not to be permitted to say though he may say that the wicked are miserable because they require to be punished and are benefited by receiving punishment from god but that god being good is the author of evil to any one is to be strenuously denied and not to be said or sung or heard in verse or prose by any one whether old or young in any commonwealth such a fiction is suicidal ruinous impious 
 i agree with you he replied and am ready to give my assent to the law 
 let this then be one of our rules and principles concerning the gods to which our poets and reciters will be expected to conform that god is not the author of all things but of good only 
 that will do he said 
 and what do you think of a second principle shall i ask you whether god is a magician and of a nature to appear insidiously now in one shape and now in another sometimes himself changing and passing into many forms sometimes deceiving us with the semblance of such transformations or is he one and the same immutably fixed in his own proper image 
 i cannot answer you he said without more thought 
 well i said but if we suppose a change in anything that change must be effected either by the thing itself or by some other thing 
 most certainly 
 and things which are at their best are also least liable to be altered or discomposed for example when healthiest and strongest the human frame is least liable to be affected by meats and drinks and the plant which is in the fullest vigour also suffers least from winds or the heat of the sun or any similar causes 
 of course 
 and will not the bravest and wisest soul be least confused or deranged by any external influence 
 true 
 and the same principle as i should suppose applies to all composite things furniture houses garments when good and well made they are least altered by time and circumstances 
 very true 
 then everything which is good whether made by art or nature or both is least liable to suffer change from without 
 true 
 but surely god and the things of god are in every way perfect 
 of course they are 
 then he can hardly be compelled by external influence to take many shapes 
 he cannot 
 but may he not change and transform himself 
 clearly he said that must be the case if he is changed at all 
 and will he then change himself for the better and fairer or for the worse and more unsightly 
 if he change at all he can only change for the worse for we cannot suppose him to be deficient either in virtue or beauty 
 very true adeimantus but then would any one whether god or man desire to make himself worse 
 impossible 
 then it is impossible that god should ever be willing to change being as is supposed the fairest and best that is conceivable every god remains absolutely and for ever in his own form 
 that necessarily follows he said in my judgment 
 then i said my dear friend let none of the poets tell us that 
 the gods taking the disguise of strangers from other lands walk up and down cities in all sorts of forms and let no one slander proteus and thetis neither let any one either in tragedy or in any other kind of poetry introduce here disguised in the likeness of a priestess asking an alms 
 for the daughters of inachus the river of argos let us have no more lies of that sort neither must we have mothers under the influence of the poets scaring their children with a bad version of these myths telling how certain gods as they say go about by night in the likeness of so many strangers and in divers forms but let them take heed lest they make cowards of their children and at the same time speak blasphemy against the gods 
 heaven forbid he said 
 but although the gods are themselves unchangeable still by witchcraft and deception they may make us think that they appear in various forms 
 perhaps he replied 
 well but can you imagine that god will be willing to lie whether in word or deed or to put forth a phantom of himself 
 i cannot say he replied 
 do you not know i said that the true lie if such an expression may be allowed is hated of gods and men 
 what do you mean he said 
 i mean that no one is willingly deceived in that which is the truest and highest part of himself or about the truest and highest matters there above all he is most afraid of a lie having possession of him 
 still he said i do not comprehend you 
 the reason is i replied that you attribute some profound meaning to my words but i am only saying that deception or being deceived or uninformed about the highest realities in the highest part of themselves which is the soul and in that part of them to have and to hold the lie is what mankind least like that i say is what they utterly detest 
 there is nothing more hateful to them 
 and as i was just now remarking this ignorance in the soul of him who is deceived may be called the true lie for the lie in words is only a kind of imitation and shadowy image of a previous affection of the soul not pure unadulterated falsehood am i not right 
 perfectly right 
 the true lie is hated not only by the gods but also by men 
 yes 
 whereas the lie in words is in certain cases useful and not hateful in dealing with enemies that would be an instance or again when those whom we call our friends in a fit of madness or illusion are going to do some harm then it is useful and is a sort of medicine or preventive also in the tales of mythology of which we were just now speaking because we do not know the truth about ancient times we make falsehood as much like truth as we can and so turn it to account 
 very true he said 
 but can any of these reasons apply to god can we suppose that he is ignorant of antiquity and therefore has recourse to invention 
 that would be ridiculous he said 
 then the lying poet has no place in our idea of god 
 i should say not 
 or perhaps he may tell a lie because he is afraid of enemies 
 that is inconceivable 
 but he may have friends who are senseless or mad 
 but no mad or senseless person can be a friend of god 
 then no motive can be imagined why god should lie 
 none whatever 
 then the superhuman and divine is absolutely incapable of falsehood 
 yes 
 then is god perfectly simple and true both in word and deed he changes not he deceives not either by sign or word by dream or waking vision 
 your thoughts he said are the reflection of my own 
 you agree with me then i said that this is the second type or form in which we should write and speak about divine things the gods are not magicians who transform themselves neither do they deceive mankind in any way 
 i grant that 
 then although we are admirers of homer we do not admire the lying dream which zeus sends to agamemnon neither will we praise the verses of aeschylus in which thetis says that apollo at her nuptials 
 was celebrating in song her fair progeny whose days were to he long and to know no sickness and when he had spoken of my lot as in all things blessed of heaven he raised a note of triumph and cheered my soul and i thought that the word of phoebus being divine and full of prophecy would not fail and now he himself who uttered the strain he who was present at the banquet and who said this he it is who has slain my son 
 these are the kind of sentiments about the gods which will arouse our anger and he who utters them shall be refused a chorus neither shall we allow teachers to make use of them in the instruction of the young meaning as we do that our guardians as far as men can be should be true worshippers of the gods and like them 
 i entirely agree be said in these principles and promise to make them my laws

 book iii 
 
 socrates adeimantus 
 such then i said are our principles of theology some tales are to be told and others are not to be told to our disciples from their youth upwards if we mean them to honour the gods and their parents and to value friendship with one another 
 yes and i think that our principles are right he said 
 but if they are to be courageous must they not learn other lessons besides these and lessons of such a kind as will take away the fear of death can any man be courageous who has the fear of death in him 
 certainly not he said 
 and can he be fearless of death or will he choose death in battle rather than defeat and slavery who believes the world below to be real and terrible 
 impossible 
 then we must assume a control over the narrators of this class of tales as well as over the others and beg them not simply to but rather to commend the world below intimating to them that their descriptions are untrue and will do harm to our future warriors 
 that will be our duty he said 
 then i said we shall have to obliterate many obnoxious passages beginning with the verses 
 i would rather he a serf on the land of a poor and portionless man than rule over all the dead who have come to nought we must also expunge the verse which tells us how pluto feared 
 lest the mansions grim and squalid which the gods abhor should he seen both of mortals and immortals and again 
 o heavens verily in the house of hades there is soul and ghostly form but no mind at all again of tiresias 
 to him even after death did persephone grant mind that he alone should be wise but the other souls are flitting shades again 
 the soul flying from the limbs had gone to hades lamentng her fate leaving manhood and youth again 
 and the soul with shrilling cry passed like smoke beneath the earth and 
 as bats in hollow of mystic cavern whenever any of the has dropped out of the string and falls from the rock fly shrilling and cling to one another so did they with shrilling cry hold together as they moved and we must beg homer and the other poets not to be angry if we strike out these and similar passages not because they are unpoetical or unattractive to the popular ear but because the greater the poetical charm of them the less are they meet for the ears of boys and men who are meant to be free and who should fear slavery more than death 
 undoubtedly 
 also we shall have to reject all the terrible and appalling names describe the world below cocytus and styx ghosts under the earth and sapless shades and any similar words of which the very mention causes a shudder to pass through the inmost soul of him who hears them i do not say that these horrible stories may not have a use of some kind but there is a danger that the nerves of our guardians may be rendered too excitable and effeminate by them 
 there is a real danger he said 
 then we must have no more of them 
 true 
 another and a nobler strain must be composed and sung by us 
 clearly 
 and shall we proceed to get rid of the weepings and wailings of famous men 
 they will go with the rest 
 but shall we be right in getting rid of them reflect our principle is that the good man will not consider death terrible to any other good man who is his comrade 
 yes that is our principle 
 and therefore he will not sorrow for his departed friend as though he had suffered anything terrible 
 he will not 
 such an one as we further maintain is sufficient for himself and his own happiness and therefore is least in need of other men 
 true he said 
 and for this reason the loss of a son or brother or the deprivation of fortune is to him of all men least terrible 
 assuredly 
 and therefore he will be least likely to lament and will bear with the greatest equanimity any misfortune of this sort which may befall him 
 yes he will feel such a misfortune far less than another 
 then we shall be right in getting rid of the lamentations of famous men and making them over to women and not even to women who are good for anything or to men of a baser sort that those who are being educated by us to be the defenders of their country may scorn to do the like 
 that will be very right 
 then we will once more entreat homer and the other poets not to depict achilles who is the son of a goddess first lying on his side then on his back and then on his face then starting up and sailing in a frenzy along the shores of the barren sea now taking the sooty ashes in both his hands and pouring them over his head or weeping and wailing in the various modes which homer has delineated nor should he describe priam the kinsman of the gods as praying and beseeching 
 rolling in the dirt calling each man loudly by his name still more earnestly will we beg of him at all events not to introduce the gods lamenting and saying 
 alas my misery alas that i bore the harvest to my sorrow but if he must introduce the gods at any rate let him not dare so completely to misrepresent the greatest of the gods as to make him say 
 o heavens with my eyes verily i behold a dear friend of mine chased round and round the city and my heart is sorrowful or again 
 woe is me that i am fated to have sarpedon dearest of men to me subdued at the hands of patroclus the son of menoetius for if my sweet adeimantus our youth seriously listen to such unworthy representations of the gods instead of laughing at them as they ought hardly will any of them deem that he himself being but a man can be dishonoured by similar actions neither will he rebuke any inclination which may arise in his mind to say and do the like and instead of having any shame or he will be always whining and lamenting on slight occasions 
 yes he said that is most true 
 yes i replied but that surely is what ought not to be as the argument has just proved to us and by that proof we must abide until it is disproved by a better 
 it ought not to be 
 neither ought our guardians to be given to laughter for a fit of laughter which has been indulged to excess almost always produces a violent reaction 
 so i believe 
 then persons of worth even if only mortal men must not be represented as overcome by laughter and still less must such a representation of the gods be allowed 
 still less of the gods as you say he replied 
 then we shall not suffer such an expression to be used about the gods as that of homer when he describes how 
 inextinguishable laughter arose among the blessed gods when they saw hephaestus bustling about the mansion on your views we must not admit them 
 on my views if you like to father them on me that we must not admit them is certain 
 again truth should be highly valued if as we were saying a lie is useless to the gods and useful only as a medicine to men then the use of such medicines should be restricted to physicians private individuals have no business with them 
 clearly not he said 
 then if any one at all is to have the privilege of lying the rulers of the state should be the persons and they in their dealings either with enemies or with their own citizens may be allowed to lie for the public good but nobody else should meddle with anything of the kind and although the rulers have this privilege for a private man to lie to them in return is to be deemed a more heinous fault than for the patient or the pupil of a gymnasium not to speak the truth about his own bodily illnesses to the physician or to the trainer or for a sailor not to tell the captain what is happening about the ship and the rest of the crew and how things are going with himself or his fellow sailors 
 most true he said 
 if then the ruler catches anybody beside himself lying in the state 
 any of the craftsmen whether he priest or physician or carpenter he will punish him for introducing a practice which is equally subversive and destructive of ship or state 
 most certainly he said if our idea of the state is ever carried out 
 in the next place our youth must be temperate 
 certainly 
 are not the chief elements of temperance speaking generally obedience to commanders and in sensual pleasures 
 true 
 then we shall approve such language as that of diomede in homer 
 friend sit still and obey my word and the verses which follow 
 the greeks marched breathing prowess 
 in silent awe of their leaders and other sentiments of the same kind 
 we shall 
 what of this line 
 o heavy with wine who hast the eyes of a dog and the heart of a stag and of the words which follow would you say that these or any similar impertinences which private individuals are supposed to address to their rulers whether in verse or prose are well or ill spoken 
 they are ill spoken 
 they may very possibly afford some amusement but they do not conduce to temperance and therefore they are likely to do harm to our young men you would agree with me there 
 yes 
 and then again to make the wisest of men say that nothing in his opinion is more glorious than 
 when the tables are full of bread and meat and the carries round wine which he draws from the bowl and pours into the cups is it fit or conducive to temperance for a young man to hear such words or the verse 
 the saddest of fates is to die and meet destiny from hunger what would you say again to the tale of zeus who while other gods and men were asleep and he the only person awake lay devising plans but forgot them all in a moment through his lust and was so completely overcome at the sight of here that he would not even go into the hut but wanted to lie with her on the ground declaring that he had never been in such a state of rapture before even when they first met one another 
 without the knowledge of their parents or that other tale of how hephaestus because of similar goings on cast a chain around ares and aphrodite 
 indeed he said i am strongly of opinion that they ought not to hear that sort of thing 
 but any deeds of endurance which are done or told by famous men these they ought to see and hear as for example what is said in the verses 
 he smote his breast and thus reproached his heart 
 endure my heart far worse hast thou endured 
 certainly he said 
 in the next place we must not let them be receivers of gifts or lovers of money 
 certainly not 
 neither must we sing to them of 
 gifts persuading gods and persuading reverend kings neither is phoenix the tutor of achilles to be approved or deemed to have given his pupil good counsel when he told him that he should take the gifts of the greeks and assist them but that without a gift he should not lay aside his anger neither will we believe or acknowledge achilles himself to have been such a lover of money that he took or that when he had received payment he restored the dead body of hector but that without payment he was unwilling to do so 
 undoubtedly he said these are not sentiments which can be approved 
 loving homer as i do i hardly like to say that in attributing these feelings to achilles or in believing that they are truly to him he is guilty of downright impiety as little can i believe the narrative of his insolence to apollo where he says 
 thou hast wronged me o most abominable of deities verily i would he even with thee if i had only the power or his insubordination to the on whose divinity he is ready to lay hands or his offering to the dead patroclus of his own hair which had been previously dedicated to the other spercheius and that he actually performed this vow or that he dragged hector round the tomb of patroclus and slaughtered the captives at the pyre of all this i cannot believe that he was guilty any more than i can allow our citizens to believe that he the wise pupil the son of a goddess and of peleus who was the gentlest of men and third in descent from zeus was so disordered in his wits as to be at one time the slave of two seemingly inconsistent passions meanness not untainted by avarice combined with overweening contempt of gods and men 
 you are quite right he replied 
 and let us equally refuse to believe or allow to be repeated the tale of theseus son of poseidon or of peirithous son of zeus going forth as they did to perpetrate a horrid rape or of any other hero or son of a god daring to do such impious and dreadful things as they falsely ascribe to them in our day and let us further compel the poets to declare either that these acts were not done by them or that they were not the sons of gods both in the same breath they shall not be permitted to affirm we will not have them trying to persuade our youth that the gods are the authors of evil and that heroes are no better than which as we were saying are neither pious nor true for we have already proved that evil cannot come from the gods 
 assuredly not 
 and further they are likely to have a bad effect on those who hear them for everybody will begin to excuse his own vices when he is convinced that similar wickednesses are always being perpetrated by 
 the kindred of the gods the relatives of zeus whose ancestral altar the attar of zeus is aloft in air on the peak of ida and who have 
 the blood of deities yet flowing in their veins and therefore let us put an end to such tales lest they engender laxity of morals among the young 
 by all means he replied 
 but now that we are determining what classes of subjects are or are not to be spoken of let us see whether any have been omitted by us the manner in which gods and demigods and heroes and the world below should be treated has been already laid down 
 very true 
 and what shall we say about men that is clearly the remaining portion of our subject 
 clearly so 
 but we are not in a condition to answer this question at present my friend 
 why not 
 because if i am not mistaken we shall have to say that about men poets and are guilty of making the gravest misstatements when they tell us that wicked men are often happy and the good miserable and that injustice is profitable when undetected but that justice is a own loss and gain these things we shall forbid them to utter and command them to sing and say the opposite 
 to be sure we shall he replied 
 but if you admit that i am right in this then i shall maintain that you have implied the principle for which we have been all along contending 
 i grant the truth of your inference 
 that such things are or are not to be said about men is a question which we cannot determine until we have discovered what justice is and how naturally advantageous to the possessor whether he seems to be just or not 
 most true he said 
 enough of the subjects of poetry let us now speak of the style and when this has been considered both matter and manner will have been completely treated 
 i do not understand what you mean said adeimantus 
 then i must make you understand and perhaps i may be more intelligible if i put the matter in this way you are aware i suppose that all mythology and poetry is a narration of events either past present or to come 
 certainly he replied 
 and narration may be either simple narration or imitation or a union of the two 
 that again he said i do not quite understand 
 i fear that i must be a ridiculous teacher when i have so much difficulty in making myself apprehended like a bad speaker therefore i will not take the whole of the subject but will break a piece off in illustration of my meaning you know the first lines of the iliad in which the poet says that chryses prayed agamemnon to release his daughter and that agamemnon flew into a passion with him whereupon chryses failing of his object invoked the anger of the god against the achaeans now as far as these lines 
 and he prayed all the greeks but especially the two sons of atreus the chiefs of the people the poet is speaking in his own person he never leads us to suppose that he is any one else but in what follows he takes the person of chryses and then he does all that he can to make us believe that the speaker is not homer but the aged priest himself and in this double form he has cast the entire narrative of the events which occurred at troy and in ithaca and throughout the odyssey 
 yes 
 and a narrative it remains both in the speeches which the poet recites from time to time and in the intermediate passages 
 quite true 
 but when the poet speaks in the person of another may we not say that he assimilates his style to that of the person who as he informs you is going to speak 
 certainly 
 and this assimilation of himself to another either by the use of voice or gesture is the imitation of the person whose character he assumes 
 of course 
 then in this case the narrative of the poet may be said to proceed by way of imitation 
 very true 
 or if the poet everywhere appears and never conceals himself then again the imitation is dropped and his poetry becomes simple narration however in order that i may make my meaning quite clear and that you may no more say i understand i will show how the change might be effected if homer had said the priest came having his ransom in his hands supplicating the achaeans and above all the kings and then if instead of speaking in the person of chryses he had continued in his own person the words would have been not imitation but simple narration the passage would have run as follows i am no poet and therefore i drop the metre the priest came and prayed the gods on behalf of the greeks that they might capture troy and return safely home but begged that they would give him back his daughter and take the ransom which he brought and respect the god thus he spoke and the other greeks revered the priest and assented but agamemnon was wroth and bade him depart and not come again lest the staff and chaplets of the god should be of no avail to him the daughter of chryses should not be released he said she should grow old with him in argos and then he told him to go away and not to provoke him if he intended to get home unscathed and the old man went away in fear and silence and when he had left the camp he called upon apollo by his many names reminding him of everything which he had done pleasing to him whether in building his temples or in offering sacrifice and praying that his good deeds might be returned to him and that the achaeans might expiate his tears by the arrows of the god and so on in this way the whole becomes simple narrative 
 i understand he said 
 or you may suppose the opposite case that the intermediate passages are omitted and the dialogue only left 
 that also he said i understand you mean for example as in tragedy 
 you have conceived my meaning perfectly and if i mistake not what you failed to apprehend before is now made clear to you that poetry and mythology are in some cases wholly imitative instances of this are supplied by tragedy and comedy there is likewise the opposite style in which the my poet is the only speaker of this the dithyramb affords the best example and the combination of both is found in epic and in several other styles of poetry do i take you with me 
 yes he said i see now what you meant 
 i will ask you to remember also what i began by saying that we had done with the subject and might proceed to the style 
 yes i remember 
 in saying this i intended to imply that we must come to an understanding about the mimetic art whether the poets in narrating their stories are to be allowed by us to imitate and if so whether in whole or in part and if the latter in what parts or should all imitation be prohibited 
 you mean i suspect to ask whether tragedy and comedy shall be admitted into our state 
 yes i said but there may be more than this in question i really do not know as yet but whither the argument may blow thither we go 
 and go we will he said 
 then adeimantus let me ask you whether our guardians ought to be imitators or rather has not this question been decided by the rule already laid down that one man can only do one thing well and not many and that if he attempt many he will altogether fall of gaining much reputation in any 
 certainly 
 and this is equally true of imitation no one man can imitate many things as well as he would imitate a single one 
 he cannot 
 then the same person will hardly be able to play a serious part in life and at the same time to be an imitator and imitate many other parts as well for even when two species of imitation are nearly allied the same persons cannot succeed in both as for example the writers of tragedy and comedy did you not just now call them imitations 
 yes i did and you are right in thinking that the same persons cannot succeed in both 
 any more than they can be rhapsodists and actors at once 
 true 
 neither are comic and tragic actors the same yet all these things are but imitations 
 they are so 
 and human nature adeimantus appears to have been coined into yet smaller pieces and to be as incapable of imitating many things well as of performing well the actions of which the imitations are copies 
 quite true he replied 
 if then we adhere to our original notion and bear in mind that our guardians setting aside every other business are to dedicate themselves wholly to the maintenance of freedom in the state making this their craft and engaging in no work which does not bear on this end they ought not to practise or imitate anything else if they imitate at all they should imitate from youth upward only those characters which are suitable to their profession the courageous temperate holy free and the like but they should not depict or be skilful at imitating any kind of illiberality or baseness lest from imitation they should come to be what they imitate did you never observe how imitations beginning in early youth and continuing far into life at length grow into habits and become a second nature affecting body voice and mind 
 yes certainly he said 
 then i said we will not allow those for whom we profess a care and of whom we say that they ought to be good men to imitate a woman whether young or old quarrelling with her husband or striving and vaunting against the gods in conceit of her happiness or when she is in affliction or sorrow or weeping and certainly not one who is in sickness love or labour 
 very right he said 
 neither must they represent slaves male or female performing the offices of slaves 
 they must not 
 and surely not bad men whether cowards or any others who do the reverse of what we have just been prescribing who scold or mock or revile one another in drink or out of in drink or or who in any other manner sin against themselves and their neighbours in word or deed as the manner of such is neither should they be trained to imitate the action or speech of men or women who are mad or bad for madness like vice is to be known but not to be practised or imitated 
 very true he replied 
 neither may they imitate smiths or other artificers or oarsmen or boatswains or the like 
 how can they he said when they are not allowed to apply their minds to the callings of any of these 
 nor may they imitate the neighing of horses the bellowing of bulls the murmur of rivers and roll of the ocean thunder and all that sort of thing 
 nay he said if madness be forbidden neither may they copy the behaviour of madmen 
 you mean i said if i understand you aright that there is one sort of narrative style which may be employed by a truly good man when he has anything to say and that another sort will be used by a man of an opposite character and education 
 and which are these two sorts he asked 
 suppose i answered that a just and good man in the course of a narration comes on some saying or action of another good man i should imagine that he will like to personate him and will not be ashamed of this sort of imitation he will be most ready to play the part of the good man when he is acting firmly and wisely in a less degree when he is overtaken by illness or love or drink or has met with any other disaster but when he comes to a character which is unworthy of him he will not make a study of that he will disdain such a person and will assume his likeness if at all for a moment only when he is performing some good action at other times he will be ashamed to play a part which he has never practised nor will he like to fashion and frame himself after the baser models he feels the employment of such an art unless in jest to be beneath him and his mind revolts at it 
 so i should expect he replied 
 then he will adopt a mode of narration such as we have illustrated out of homer that is to say his style will be both imitative and narrative but there will be very little of the former and a great deal of the latter do you agree 
 certainly he said that is the model which such a speaker must necessarily take 
 but there is another sort of character who will narrate anything and the worse lie is the more unscrupulous he will be nothing will be too bad for him and he will be ready to imitate anything not as a joke but in right good earnest and before a large company as i was just now saying he will attempt to represent the roll of thunder the noise of wind and hall or the creaking of wheels and pulleys and the various sounds of flutes pipes trumpets and all sorts of instruments he will bark like a dog bleat like a sheep or crow like a cock his entire art will consist in imitation of voice and gesture and there will be very little narration 
 that he said will be his mode of speaking 
 these then are the two kinds of style 
 yes 
 and you would agree with me in saying that one of them is simple and has but slight changes and if the harmony and rhythm are also chosen for their simplicity the result is that the speaker if hc speaks correctly is always pretty much the same in style and he will keep within the limits of a single harmony for the changes are not great and in like manner he will make use of nearly the same rhythm 
 that is quite true he said 
 whereas the other requires all sorts of harmonies and all sorts of rhythms if the music and the style are to correspond because the style has all sorts of changes 
 that is also perfectly true he replied 
 and do not the two styles or the mixture of the two comprehend all poetry and every form of expression in words no one can say anything except in one or other of them or in both together 
 they include all he said 
 and shall we receive into our state all the three styles or one only of the two unmixed styles or would you include the mixed 
 i should prefer only to admit the pure imitator of virtue 
 yes i said adeimantus but the mixed style is also very charming and indeed the pantomimic which is the opposite of the one chosen by you is the most popular style with children and their attendants and with the world in general 
 i do not deny it 
 but i suppose you would argue that such a style is unsuitable to our state in which human nature is not twofold or manifold for one man plays one part only 
 yes quite unsuitable 
 and this is the reason why in our state and in our state only we shall find a shoemaker to be a shoemaker and not a pilot also and a husbandman to be a husbandman and not a dicast also and a soldier a soldier and not a trader also and the same throughout 
 true he said 
 and therefore when any one of these pantomimic gentlemen who are so clever that they can imitate anything comes to us and makes a proposal to exhibit himself and his poetry we will fall down and worship him as a sweet and holy and wonderful being but we must also inform him that in our state such as he are not permitted to exist the law will not allow them and so when we have anointed him with myrrh and set a garland of wool upon his head we shall send him away to another city for we mean to employ for our souls health the rougher and severer poet or who will imitate the style of the virtuous only and will follow those models which we prescribed at first when we began the education of our soldiers 
 we certainly will he said if we have the power 
 then now my friend i said that part of music or literary education which relates to the story or myth may be considered to be finished for the matter and manner have both been discussed 
 i think so too he said 
 next in order will follow melody and song 
 that is obvious 
 every one can see already what we ought to say about them if we are to be consistent with ourselves 
 socrates glaucon 
 i fear said glaucon laughing that the words every one hardly includes me for i cannot at the moment say what they should be though i may guess 
 at any rate you can tell that a song or ode has three parts the words the melody and the rhythm that degree of knowledge i may presuppose 
 yes he said so much as that you may 
 and as for the words there surely be no difference words between words which are and which are not set to music both will conform to the same laws and these have been already determined by us 
 yes 
 and the melody and rhythm will depend upon the words 
 certainly 
 we were saying when we spoke of the that we had no need of lamentations and strains of sorrow 
 true 
 and which are the harmonies expressive of sorrow you are musical and can tell me 
 the harmonies which you mean are the mixed or tenor lydian and the or bass lydian and such like 
 these then i said must be banished even to women who have a character to maintain they are of no use and much less to men certainly 
 in the next place drunkenness and softness and indolence are utterly unbecoming the character of our guardians 
 utterly unbecoming 
 and which are the soft or drinking harmonies 
 the ionian he replied and the lydian they are termed relaxed 
 well and are these of any military use 
 quite the reverse he replied and if so the dorian and the phrygian are the only ones which you have left 
 i answered of the harmonies i know nothing but i want to have one warlike to sound the note or accent which a brave man utters in the hour of danger and stern resolve or when his cause is failing and he is going to wounds or death or is overtaken by some other evil and at every such crisis meets the blows of fortune with firm step and a determination to endure and another to be used by him in times of peace and freedom of action when there is no pressure of necessity and he is seeking to persuade god by prayer or man by instruction and admonition or on the other hand when he is expressing his willingness to yield to persuasion or entreaty or admonition and which represents him when by prudent conduct he has attained his end not carried away by his success but acting moderately and wisely under the circumstances and acquiescing in the event these two harmonies i ask you to leave the strain of necessity and the strain of freedom the strain of the unfortunate and the strain of the fortunate the strain of courage and the strain of temperance these i say leave 
 and these he replied are the dorian and phrygian harmonies of which i was just now speaking 
 then i said if these and these only are to be used in our songs and melodies we shall not want multiplicity of notes or a panharmonic scale 
 i suppose not 
 then we shall not maintain the artificers of lyres with three corners and complex scales or the makers of any other instruments 
 certainly not 
 but what do you say to and would you admit them into our state when you reflect that in this composite use of harmony the flute is worse than all the stringed instruments put together even the panharmonic music is only an imitation of the flute 
 clearly not 
 there remain then only the lyre and the harp for use in the city and the shepherds may have a pipe in the country 
 that is surely the conclusion to be drawn from the argument 
 the preferring of apollo and his instruments to marsyas and his instruments is not at all strange i said 
 not at all he replied 
 and so by the dog of egypt we have been unconsciously purging the state which not long ago we termed luxurious 
 and we have done wisely he replied 
 then let us now finish the purgation i said next in order to harmonies rhythms will naturally follow and they should be subject to the same rules for we ought not to seek out complex systems of metre or metres of every kind but rather to discover what rhythms are the expressions of a courageous and harmonious life and when we have found them we shall adapt the foot and the melody to words having a like spirit not the words to the foot and melody to say what these rhythms are will be your duty you must teach me them as you have already taught me the harmonies 
 but indeed he replied i cannot tell you i only know that there are some three principles of rhythm out of which metrical systems are framed just as in sounds there are four notes out of which all the harmonies are composed that is an observation which i have made but of what sort of lives they are severally the imitations i am unable to say 
 then i said we must take damon into our counsels and he will tell us what rhythms are expressive of meanness or insolence or fury or other unworthiness and what are to be reserved for the expression of opposite feelings and i think that i have an indistinct recollection of his mentioning a complex cretic rhythm also a dactylic or heroic and he arranged them in some manner which i do not quite understand making the rhythms equal in the rise and fall of the foot long and short alternating and unless i am mistaken he spoke of an iambic as well as of a trochaic rhythm and assigned to them short and long quantities also in some cases he appeared to praise or censure the movement of the foot quite as much as the rhythm or perhaps a combination of the two for i am not certain what he meant these matters however as i was saying had better be referred to damon himself for the analysis of the subject would be difficult you know 
 rather so i should say 
 but there is no difficulty in seeing that grace or the absence of grace is an effect of good or bad rhythm 
 none at all 
 and also that good and bad rhythm naturally assimilate to a good and bad style and that harmony and discord in like manner follow style for our principle is that rhythm and harmony are regulated by the words and not the words by them 
 just so he said they should follow the words 
 and will not the words and the character of the style depend on the temper of the soul 
 yes 
 and everything else on the style 
 yes 
 then beauty of style and harmony and grace and good rhythm depend on simplicity i mean the true simplicity of a rightly and nobly ordered mind and character not that other simplicity which is only an euphemism for folly 
 very true he replied 
 and if our youth are to do their work in life must they not make these graces and harmonies their perpetual aim 
 they must 
 and surely the art of the painter and every other creative and constructive art are full of them weaving embroidery architecture and every kind of manufacture also nature animal and vegetable in all of them there is grace or the absence of grace and ugliness and discord and inharmonious motion are nearly allied to ill words and ill nature as grace and harmony are the twin sisters of goodness and virtue and bear their likeness 
 that is quite true he said 
 but shall our superintendence go no further and are the poets only to be required by us to express the image of the good in their works on pain if they do anything else of expulsion from our state or is the same control to be extended to other artists and are they also to be prohibited from exhibiting the opposite forms of vice and intemperance and meanness and indecency in sculpture and building and the other creative arts and is he who cannot conform to this rule of ours to be prevented from practising his art in our state lest the taste of our citizens be corrupted by him we would not have our guardians grow up amid images of moral deformity as in some noxious pasture and there browse and feed upon many a baneful herb and flower day by day little by little until they silently gather a festering mass of corruption in their own soul let our artists rather be those who are gifted to discern the true nature of the beautiful and graceful then will our youth dwell in a land of health amid fair sights and sounds and receive the good in everything and beauty the effluence of fair works shall flow into the eye and ear like a breeze from a purer region and insensibly draw the soul from earliest years into likeness and sympathy with the beauty of reason 
 there can be no nobler training than that he replied 
 and therefore i said glaucon musical training is a more potent instrument than any other because rhythm and harmony find their way into the inward places of the soul on which they mightily fasten imparting grace and making the soul of him who is rightly educated graceful or of him who is ungraceful and also because he who has received this true education of the inner being will most shrewdly perceive omissions or faults in art and nature and with a true taste while he praises and rejoices over and receives into his soul the good and becomes noble and good he will justly blame and hate the bad now in the days of his youth even before he is able to know the reason why and when reason comes he will recognise and salute the friend with whom his education has made him long familiar 
 yes he said i quite agree with you in thinking that our youth should be trained in music and on the grounds which you mention 
 just as in learning to read i said we were satisfied when we knew the letters of the alphabet which are very few in all their recurring sizes and combinations not slighting them as unimportant whether they occupy a space large or small but everywhere eager to make them out and not thinking ourselves perfect in the art of reading until we recognise them wherever they are found 
 true 
 or as we recognise the reflection of letters in the water or in a mirror only when we know the letters themselves the same art and study giving us the knowledge of both 
 exactly 
 even so as i maintain neither we nor our guardians whom we have to educate can ever become musical until we and they know the essential forms in all their combinations and can recognise them and their images wherever they are found not slighting them either in small things or great but believing them all to be within the sphere of one art and study 
 most assuredly 
 and when a beautiful soul harmonises with a beautiful form and the two are cast in one mould that will be the fairest of sights to him who has an eye to see it 
 the fairest indeed 
 and the fairest is also the loveliest 
 that may be assumed 
 and the man who has the spirit of harmony will be most in love with the loveliest but he will not love him who is of an inharmonious soul 
 that is true he replied if the deficiency be in his soul but if there be any merely bodily defect in another he will be patient of it and will love all the same 
 i perceive i said that you have or have had experiences of this sort and i agree but let me ask you another question has excess of pleasure any affinity to temperance 
 how can that be he replied pleasure deprives a man of the use of his faculties quite as much as pain 
 or any affinity to virtue in general 
 none whatever 
 any affinity to wantonness and intemperance 
 yes the greatest 
 and is there any greater or keener pleasure than that of sensual love 
 no nor a madder 
 whereas true love is a love of beauty and order temperate and harmonious 
 quite true he said 
 then no intemperance or madness should be allowed to approach true love 
 certainly not 
 then mad or intemperate pleasure must never be allowed to come near the lover and his beloved neither of them can have any part in it if their love is of the right sort 
 no indeed socrates it must never come near them 
 then i suppose that in the city which we are founding you would make a law to the effect that a friend should use no other familiarity to his love than a father would use to his son and then only for a noble purpose and he must first have the consent and this rule is to limit him in all his intercourse and he is never to be seen going further or if he exceeds he is to be deemed guilty of coarseness and bad taste 
 i quite agree he said 
 thus much of music which makes a fair ending for what should be the end of music if not the love of beauty 
 i agree he said 
 after music comes gymnastic in which our youth are next to be trained 
 certainly 
 gymnastic as well as music should begin in early years the training in it should be careful and should continue through life now my belief is and this is a matter upon which i should like to have your opinion in confirmation of my own but my own belief is not that the good body by any bodily excellence improves the soul but on the contrary that the good soul by her own excellence improves the body as far as this may be possible what do you say 
 yes i agree 
 then to the mind when adequately trained we shall be right in handing over the more particular care of the body and in order to avoid prolixity we will now only give the general outlines of the subject 
 very good 
 that they must abstain from intoxication has been already remarked by us for of all persons a guardian should be the last to get drunk and not know where in the world he is 
 yes he said that a guardian should require another guardian to take care of him is ridiculous indeed 
 but next what shall we say of their food for the men are in training for the great contest of all are they not 
 yes he said 
 and will the habit of body of our ordinary athletes be suited to them 
 why not 
 i am afraid i said that a habit of body such as they have is but a sleepy sort of thing and rather perilous to health do you not observe that these athletes sleep away their lives and are liable to most dangerous illnesses if they depart in ever so slight a degree from their customary regimen 
 yes i do 
 then i said a finer sort of training will be required for our warrior athletes who are to be like wakeful dogs and to see and hear with the utmost keenness amid the many changes of water and also of food of summer heat and winter cold which they will have to endure when on a campaign they must not be liable to break down in health 
 that is my view 
 the really excellent gymnastic is twin sister of that simple music which we were just now describing 
 how so 
 why i conceive that there is a gymnastic which like our music is simple and good and especially the military gymnastic 
 what do you mean 
 my meaning may be learned from homer he you know feeds his heroes at their feasts when they are campaigning on soldiers fare they have no fish although they are on the shores of the hellespont and they are not allowed boiled meats but only roast which is the food most convenient for soldiers requiring only that they should light a fire and not involving the trouble of carrying about pots and pans 
 true 
 and i can hardly be mistaken in saying that sweet sauces are nowhere mentioned in homer in proscribing them however he is not singular all professional athletes are well aware that a man who is to be in good condition should take nothing of the kind 
 yes he said and knowing this they are quite right in not taking them 
 then you would not approve of syracusan dinners and the refinements of sicilian cookery 
 i think not 
 nor if a man is to be in condition would you allow him to have a corinthian girl as his fair friend 
 certainly not 
 neither would you approve of the delicacies as they are thought of athenian confectionery 
 certainly not 
 all such feeding and living may be rightly compared by us to melody and song composed in the panharmonic style and in all the rhythms exactly 
 there complexity engendered license and here disease whereas simplicity in music was the parent of temperance in the soul and simplicity in gymnastic of health in the body 
 most true he said 
 but when intemperance and disease multiply in a state halls of justice and medicine are always being opened and the arts of the doctor and the lawyer give themselves airs finding how keen is the interest which not only the slaves but the freemen of a city take about them 
 of course 
 and yet what greater proof can there be of a bad and disgraceful state of education than this that not only artisans and the meaner sort of people need the skill of physicians and judges but also those who would profess to have had a liberal education is it not disgraceful and a great sign of want of that a man should have to go abroad for his law and physic because he has none of his own at home and must therefore surrender himself into the hands of other men whom he makes lords and judges over him 
 of all things he said the most disgraceful 
 would you say most i replied when you consider that there is a further stage of the evil in which a man is not only a litigant passing all his days in the courts either as plaintiff or defendant but is actually led by his bad taste to pride himself on his litigiousness he imagines that he is a master in dishonesty able to take every crooked turn and wriggle into and out of every hole bending like a withy and getting out of the way of justice and all for what in order to gain small points not worth mentioning he not knowing that so to order his life as to be able to do without a napping judge is a far higher and nobler sort of thing is not that still more disgraceful 
 yes he said that is still more disgraceful 
 well i said and to require the help of medicine not when a wound has to be cured or on occasion of an epidemic but just because by indolence and a habit of life such as we have been describing men fill themselves with waters and winds as if their bodies were a marsh compelling the ingenious sons of asclepius to find more names for diseases such as flatulence and catarrh is not this too a disgrace 
 yes he said they do certainly give very strange and newfangled names to diseases 
 yes i said and i do not believe that there were any such diseases in the days of asclepius and this i infer from the circumstance that the hero eurypylus after he has been wounded in homer drinks a posset of pramnian wine well besprinkled with and grated cheese which are certainly inflammatory and yet the sons of asclepius who were at the trojan war do not blame the damsel who gives him the drink or rebuke patroclus who is treating his case 
 well he said that was surely an extraordinary drink to be given to a person in his condition 
 not so extraordinary i replied if you bear in mind that in former days as is commonly said before the time of herodicus the guild of asclepius did not practise our present system of medicine which may be said to educate diseases but herodicus being a trainer and himself of a sickly constitution by a combination of training and doctoring found out a way of torturing first and chiefly himself and secondly the rest of the world 
 how was that he said 
 by the invention of lingering death for he had a mortal disease which he perpetually tended and as recovery was out of the question he passed his entire life as a valetudinarian he could do nothing but attend upon himself and he was in constant torment whenever he departed in anything from his usual regimen and so dying hard by the help of science he struggled on to old age 
 a rare reward of his skill 
 yes i said a reward which a man might fairly expect who never understood that if asclepius did not instruct his descendants in valetudinarian arts the omission arose not from ignorance or inexperience of such a branch of medicine but because he knew that in all states every individual has an occupation to which he must attend and has therefore no leisure to spend in continually being ill this we remark in the case of the artisan but ludicrously enough do not apply the same rule to people of the richer sort 
 how do you mean he said 
 i mean this when a carpenter is ill he asks the physician for a rough and ready cure an emetic or a purge or a cautery or the knife these are his remedies and if some one prescribes for him a course of dietetics and tells him that he must swathe and swaddle his head and all that sort of thing he replies at once that he has no time to be ill and that he sees no good in a life which is spent in nursing his disease to the neglect of his customary employment and therefore bidding to this sort of physician he resumes his ordinary habits and either gets well and lives and does his business or if his constitution falls he dies and has no more trouble 
 yes he said and a man in his condition of life ought to use the art of medicine thus far only 
 has he not i said an occupation and what profit would there be in his life if he were deprived of his occupation 
 quite true he said 
 but with the rich man this is otherwise of him we do not say that he has any specially appointed work which he must perform if he would live 
 he is generally supposed to have nothing to do 
 then you never heard of the saying of phocylides that as soon as a man has a livelihood he should practise virtue 
 nay he said i think that he had better begin somewhat sooner 
 let us not have a dispute with him about this i said but rather ask ourselves is the practice of virtue obligatory on the rich man or can he live without it and if obligatory on him then let us raise a further question whether this dieting of disorders which is an impediment to the application of the mind t in carpentering and the mechanical arts does not equally stand in the way of the sentiment of phocylides 
 of that he replied there can be no doubt such excessive care of the body when carried beyond the rules of gymnastic is most inimical to the practice of virtue 
 yes indeed i replied and equally incompatible with the management of a house an army or an office of state and what is most important of all irreconcilable with any kind of study or thought or there is a constant suspicion that headache and giddiness are to be ascribed to philosophy and hence all practising or making trial of virtue in the higher sense is absolutely stopped for a man is always fancying that he is being made ill and is in constant anxiety about the state of his body 
 yes likely enough 
 and therefore our politic asclepius may be supposed to have exhibited the power of his art only to persons who being generally of healthy constitution and habits of life had a definite ailment such as these he cured by purges and operations and bade them live as usual herein consulting the interests of the state but bodies which disease had penetrated through and through he would not have attempted to cure by gradual processes of evacuation and infusion he did not want to lengthen out lives or to have weak fathers begetting weaker sons if a man was not able to live in the ordinary way he had no business to cure him for such a cure would have been of no use either to himself or to the state 
 then he said you regard asclepius as a statesman 
 clearly and his character is further illustrated by his sons note that they were heroes in the days of old and practised the medicines of which i am speaking at the siege of troy you will remember how when pandarus wounded menelaus they 
 sucked the blood out of the wound and sprinkled soothing remedies but they never prescribed what the patient was afterwards to eat or drink in the case of menelaus any more than in the case of eurypylus the remedies as they conceived were enough to heal any man who before he was wounded was healthy and regular in habits and even though he did happen to drink a posset of pramnian wine he might get well all the same but they would have nothing to do with unhealthy and intemperate subjects whose lives were of no use either to themselves or others the art of medicine was not designed for their good and though they were as rich as midas the sons of asclepius would have declined to attend them 
 they were very acute persons those sons of asclepius 
 naturally so i replied nevertheless the tragedians and pindar disobeying our behests although they acknowledge that asclepius was the son of apollo say also that he was bribed into healing a rich man who was at the point of death and for this reason he was struck by lightning but we in accordance with the principle already affirmed by us will not believe them when they tell us both if he was the son of a god we maintain that hd was not avaricious or if he was avaricious he was not the son of a god 
 all that socrates is excellent but i should like to put a question to you ought there not to be good physicians in a state and are not the best those who have treated the greatest number of constitutions good and bad and are not the best judges in like manner those who are acquainted with all sorts of moral natures 
 yes i said i too would have good judges and good physicians but do you know whom i think good 
 will you tell me 
 i will if i can let me however note that in the same question you join two things which are not the same 
 how so he asked 
 why i said you join physicians and judges now the most skilful physicians are those who from their youth upwards have combined with the knowledge of their art the greatest experience of disease they had better not be robust in health and should have had all manner of diseases in their own persons for the body as i conceive is not the instrument with which they cure the body in that case we could not allow them ever to be or to have been sickly but they cure the body with the mind and the mind which has become and is sick can cure nothing 
 that is very true he said 
 but with the judge it is otherwise since he governs mind by mind he ought not therefore to have been trained among vicious minds and to have associated with them from youth upwards and to have gone through the whole calendar of crime only in order that he may quickly infer the crimes of others as he might their bodily diseases from his own the honourable mind which is to form a healthy judgment should have had no experience or contamination of evil habits when young and this is the reason why in youth good men often appear to be simple and are easily practised upon by the dishonest because they have no examples of what evil is in their own souls 
 yes he said they are far too apt to be deceived 
 therefore i said the judge should not be young he should have learned to know evil not from his own soul but from late and long observation of the nature of evil in others knowledge should be his guide not personal experience 
 yes he said that is the ideal of a judge 
 yes i replied and he will be a good man which is my answer to your question for he is good who has a good soul but the cunning and suspicious nature of which we spoke he who has committed many crimes and fancies himself to be a master in wickedness when he is amongst his fellows is wonderful in the precautions which he takes because he judges of them by himself but when he gets into the company of men of virtue who have the experience of age he appears to be a fool again owing to his unseasonable suspicions he cannot recognise an honest man because he has no pattern of honesty in himself at the same time as the bad are more numerous than the good and he meets with them oftener he thinks himself and is by others thought to be rather wise than foolish 
 most true he said 
 then the good and wise judge whom we are seeking is not this man but the other for vice cannot know virtue too but a virtuous nature educated by time will acquire a knowledge both of virtue and vice the virtuous and not the vicious man has wisdom in my opinion 
 and in mine also 
 this is the sort of medicine and this is the sort of law which you sanction in your state they will minister to better natures giving health both of soul and of body but those who are diseased in their bodies they will leave to die and the corrupt and incurable souls they will put an end to themselves 
 that is clearly the best thing both for the patients and for the state 
 and thus our youth having been educated only in that simple music which as we said inspires temperance will be reluctant to go to law 
 clearly 
 and the musician who keeping to the same track is content to practise the simple gymnastic will have nothing to do with medicine unless in some extreme case 
 that i quite believe 
 the very exercises and tolls which he undergoes are intended to stimulate the spirited element of his nature and not to increase his strength he will not like common athletes use exercise and regimen to develop his muscles 
 very right he said 
 neither are the two arts of music and gymnastic really designed as is often supposed the one for the training of the soul the other fir the training of the body 
 what then is the real object of them 
 i believe i said that the teachers of both have in view chiefly the improvement of the soul 
 how can that be he asked 
 did you never observe i said the effect on the mind itself of exclusive devotion to gymnastic or the opposite effect of an exclusive devotion to music 
 in what way shown he said 
 the one producing a temper of hardness and ferocity the other of softness and effeminacy i replied 
 yes he said i am quite aware that the mere athlete becomes too much of a savage and that the mere musician is melted and softened beyond what is good for him 
 yet surely i said this ferocity only comes from spirit which if rightly educated would give courage but if too much intensified is liable to become hard and brutal 
 that i quite think 
 on the other hand the philosopher will have the quality of gentleness and this also when too much indulged will turn to softness but if educated rightly will be gentle and moderate 
 true 
 and in our opinion the guardians ought to have both these qualities 
 assuredly 
 and both should be in harmony 
 beyond question 
 and the harmonious soul is both temperate and courageous 
 yes 
 and the inharmonious is cowardly and boorish 
 very true 
 and when a man allows music to play upon him and to pour into his soul through the funnel of his ears those sweet and soft and melancholy airs of which we were just now speaking and his whole life is passed in warbling and the delights of song in the first stage of the process the passion or spirit which is in him is tempered like iron and made useful instead of brittle and useless but if he carries on the softening and soothing process in the next stage he begins to melt and waste until he has wasted away his spirit and cut out the sinews of his soul and he becomes a feeble warrior 
 very true 
 if the element of spirit is naturally weak in him the change is speedily accomplished but if he have a good deal then the power of music weakening the spirit renders him excitable on the least provocation he flames up at once and is speedily extinguished instead of having spirit he grows irritable and passionate and is quite impracticable 
 exactly 
 and so in gymnastics if a man takes violent exercise and is a great feeder and the reverse of a great student of music and philosophy at first the high condition of his body fills him with pride and spirit and lie becomes twice the man that he was 
 certainly 
 and what happens if he do nothing else and holds no verse with the muses does not even that intelligence which there may be in him having no taste of any sort of learning or enquiry or thought or culture grow feeble and dull and blind his mind never waking up or receiving nourishment and his senses not being purged of their mists 
 true he said 
 and he ends by becoming a hater of philosophy uncivilized never using the weapon of persuasion he is like a wild beast all violence and fierceness and knows no other way of dealing and he lives in all ignorance and evil conditions and has no sense of propriety and grace 
 that is quite true he said 
 and as there are two principles of human nature one the spirited and the other the philosophical some god as i should say has given mankind two arts answering to them and only indirectly to the soul and body in order that these two principles like the strings of an instrument may be relaxed or drawn tighter until they are duly harmonised 
 that appears to be the intention 
 and he who mingles music with gymnastic in the fairest proportions and best attempers them to the soul may be rightly called the true musician and harmonist in a far higher sense than the tuner of the strings 
 you are quite right socrates 
 and such a presiding genius will be always required in our state if the government is to last 
 yes he will be absolutely necessary 
 such then are our principles of nurture and education where would be the use of going into further details about the dances of our citizens or about their hunting and coursing their gymnastic and equestrian contests for these all follow the general principle and having found that we shall have no difficulty in discovering them 
 i dare say that there will be no difficulty 
 very good i said then what is the next question must we not ask who are to be rulers and who subjects 
 certainly 
 there can be no doubt that the elder must rule the younger 
 clearly 
 and that the best of these must rule 
 that is also clear 
 now are not the best husbandmen those who are most devoted to husbandry 
 yes 
 and as we are to have the best of guardians for our city must they not be those who have most the character of guardians 
 yes 
 and to this end they ought to be wise and efficient and to have a special care of the state 
 true 
 and a man will be most likely to care about that which he loves 
 to be sure 
 and he will be most likely to love that which he regards as having the same interests with himself and that of which the good or evil fortune is supposed by him at any time most to affect his own 
 very true he replied 
 then there must be a selection let us note among the guardians those who in their whole life show the greatest eagerness to do what is for the good of their country and the greatest repugnance to do what is against her interests 
 those are the right men 
 and they will have to be watched at every age in order that we may see whether they preserve their resolution and never under the influence either of force or enchantment forget or cast off their sense of duty to the state 
 how cast off he said 
 i will explain to you i replied a resolution may go out of a mind either with his will or against his will with his will when he gets rid of a falsehood and learns better against his will whenever he is deprived of a truth 
 i understand he said the willing loss of a resolution the meaning of the unwilling i have yet to learn 
 why i said do you not see that men are unwillingly deprived of good and willingly of evil is not to have lost the truth an evil and to possess the truth a good and you would agree that to conceive things as they are is to possess the truth 
 yes he replied i agree with you in thinking that mankind are deprived of truth against their will 
 and is not this involuntary deprivation caused either by theft or force or enchantment 
 still he replied i do not understand you 
 i fear that i must have been talking darkly like the tragedians i only mean that some men are changed by persuasion and that others forget argument steals away the hearts of one class and time of the other and this i call theft now you understand me 
 yes 
 those again who are forced are those whom the violence of some pain or grief compels to change their opinion 
 i understand he said and you are quite right 
 and you would also acknowledge that the enchanted are those who change their minds either under the softer influence of pleasure or the sterner influence of fear 
 yes he said everything that deceives may be said to enchant 
 therefore as i was just now saying we must enquire who are the best guardians of their own conviction that what they think the interest of the state is to be the rule of their lives we must watch them from their youth upwards and make them perform actions in which they are most likely to forget or to be deceived and he who remembers and is not deceived is to be selected and he who falls in the trial is to be rejected that will be the way 
 yes 
 and there should also be toils and pains and conflicts prescribed for them in which they will be made to give further proof of the same qualities 
 very right he replied 
 and then i said we must try them with enchantments that is the third sort of test and see what will be their behaviour like those who take colts amid noise and tumult to see if they are of a timid nature so must we take our youth amid terrors of some kind and again pass them into pleasures and prove them more thoroughly than gold is proved in the furnace that we may discover whether they are armed against all enchantments and of a noble bearing always good guardians of themselves and of the music which they have learned and retaining under all circumstances a rhythmical and harmonious nature such as will be most serviceable to the individual and to the state and he who at every age as boy and youth and in mature life has come out of the trial victorious and pure shall be appointed a ruler and guardian of the state he shall be honoured in life and death and shall receive sepulture and other memorials of honour the greatest that we have to give but him who fails we must reject i am inclined to think that this is the sort of way in which our rulers and guardians should be chosen and appointed i speak generally and not with any pretension to exactness 
 and speaking generally i agree with you he said 
 and perhaps the word guardian in the fullest sense ought to be applied to this higher class only who preserve us against foreign enemies and maintain peace among our citizens at home that the one may not have the will or the others the power to harm us the young men whom we before called guardians may be more properly designated auxiliaries and supporters of the principles of the rulers 
 i agree with you he said 
 how then may we devise one of those needful falsehoods of which we lately spoke just one royal lie which may deceive the rulers if that be possible and at any rate the rest of the city 
 what sort of lie he said 
 nothing new i replied only an old phoenician tale of what has often occurred before now in other places as the poets say and have made the world believe though not in our time and i do not know whether such an event could ever happen again or could now even be made probable if it did 
 how your words seem to hesitate on your lips 
 you will not wonder i replied at my hesitation when you have heard 
 speak he said and fear not 
 well then i will speak although i really know not how to look you in the face or in what words to utter the audacious fiction which i propose to communicate gradually first to the rulers then to the soldiers and lastly to the people they are to be told that their youth was a dream and the education and training which they received from us an appearance only in reality during all that time they were being formed and fed in the womb of the earth where they themselves and their arms and appurtenances were manufactured when they were completed the earth their mother sent them up and so their country being their mother and also their nurse they are bound to advise for her good and to defend her against attacks and her citizens they are to regard as children of the earth and their own brothers 
 you had good reason he said to be ashamed of the lie which you were going to tell 
 true i replied but there is more coming i have only told you half citizens we shall say to them in our tale you are brothers yet god has framed you differently some of you have the power of command and in the composition of these he has mingled gold wherefore also they have the greatest honour others he has made of silver to be auxillaries others again who are to be husbandmen and craftsmen he has composed of brass and iron and the species will generally be preserved in the children but as all are of the same original stock a golden parent will sometimes have a silver son or a silver parent a golden son and god proclaims as a first principle to the rulers and above all else that there is nothing which should so anxiously guard or of which they are to be such good guardians as of the purity of the race they should observe what elements mingle in their off spring for if the son of a golden or silver parent has an admixture of brass and iron then nature orders a transposition of ranks and the eye of the ruler must not be pitiful towards the child because he has to descend in the scale and become a husbandman or artisan just as there may be sons of artisans who having an admixture of gold or silver in them are raised to honour and become guardians or auxiliaries for an oracle says that when a man of brass or iron guards the state it will be destroyed such is the tale is there any possibility of making our citizens believe in it 
 not in the present generation he replied there is no way of accomplishing this but their sons may be made to believe in the tale and their sons sons and posterity after them 
 i see the difficulty i replied yet the fostering of such a belief will make them care more for the city and for one another enough however of the fiction which may now fly abroad upon the wings of rumour while we arm our heroes and lead them forth under the command of their rulers let them look round and select a spot whence they can best suppress insurrection if any prove refractory within and also defend themselves against enemies who like wolves may come down on the fold from without there let them encamp and when they have encamped let them sacrifice to the proper gods and prepare their dwellings 
 just so he said 
 and their dwellings must be such as will shield them against the cold of winter and the heat of summer 
 i suppose that you mean houses he replied 
 yes i said but they must be the houses of soldiers and not of 
 what is the difference he said 
 that i will endeavour to explain i replied to keep watchdogs who from want of discipline or hunger or some evil habit or evil habit or other would turn upon the sheep and worry them and behave not like dogs but wolves would be a foul and monstrous thing in a shepherd 
 truly monstrous he said 
 and therefore every care must be taken that our auxiliaries being stronger than our citizens may not grow to be too much for them and become savage tyrants instead of friends and allies 
 yes great care should be taken 
 and would not a really good education furnish the best safeguard 
 but they are already he replied 
 i cannot be so confident my dear glaucon i said i am much certain that they ought to be and that true education whatever that may be will have the greatest tendency to civilize and humanize them in their relations to one another and to those who are under their protection 
 very true he replied 
 and not only their education but their habitations and all that belongs to them should be such as will neither impair their virtue as guardians nor tempt them to prey upon the other citizens any man of sense must acknowledge that 
 he must 
 then let us consider what will be their way of life if they are to realize our idea of them in the first place none of them should have any property of his own beyond what is absolutely necessary neither should they have a private house or store closed against any one who has a mind to enter their provisions should be only such as are required by trained warriors who are men of temperance and courage they should agree to receive from the citizens a fixed rate of pay enough to meet the expenses of the year and no more and they will go and live together like soldiers in a camp gold and silver we will tell them that they have from god the diviner metal is within them and they have therefore no need of the dross which is current among men and ought not to pollute the divine by any such earthly admixture for that commoner metal has been the source of many unholy deeds but their own is undefiled and they alone of all the citizens may not touch or handle silver or gold or be under the same roof with them or wear them or drink from them and this will be their salvation and they will be the saviours of the state but should they ever acquire homes or lands or moneys of their own they will become housekeepers and husbandmen instead of guardians enemies and tyrants instead of allies of the other citizens hating and being hated plotting and being plotted against they will pass their whole life in much greater terror of internal than of external enemies and the hour of ruin both to themselves and to the rest of the state will be at hand for all which reasons may we not say that thus shall our state be ordered and that these shall be the regulations appointed by us for guardians concerning their houses and all other matters other 
 yes said glaucon

 book iii 
 
 socrates adeimantus 
 such then i said are our principles of theology some tales are to be told and others are not to be told to our disciples from their youth upwards if we mean them to honour the gods and their parents and to value friendship with one another 
 yes and i think that our principles are right he said 
 but if they are to be courageous must they not learn other lessons besides these and lessons of such a kind as will take away the fear of death can any man be courageous who has the fear of death in him 
 certainly not he said 
 and can he be fearless of death or will he choose death in battle rather than defeat and slavery who believes the world below to be real and terrible 
 impossible 
 then we must assume a control over the narrators of this class of tales as well as over the others and beg them not simply to but rather to commend the world below intimating to them that their descriptions are untrue and will do harm to our future warriors 
 that will be our duty he said 
 then i said we shall have to obliterate many obnoxious passages beginning with the verses 
 i would rather he a serf on the land of a poor and portionless man than rule over all the dead who have come to nought we must also expunge the verse which tells us how pluto feared 
 lest the mansions grim and squalid which the gods abhor should he seen both of mortals and immortals and again 
 o heavens verily in the house of hades there is soul and ghostly form but no mind at all again of tiresias 
 to him even after death did persephone grant mind that he alone should be wise but the other souls are flitting shades again 
 the soul flying from the limbs had gone to hades lamentng her fate leaving manhood and youth again 
 and the soul with shrilling cry passed like smoke beneath the earth and 
 as bats in hollow of mystic cavern whenever any of the has dropped out of the string and falls from the rock fly shrilling and cling to one another so did they with shrilling cry hold together as they moved and we must beg homer and the other poets not to be angry if we strike out these and similar passages not because they are unpoetical or unattractive to the popular ear but because the greater the poetical charm of them the less are they meet for the ears of boys and men who are meant to be free and who should fear slavery more than death 
 undoubtedly 
 also we shall have to reject all the terrible and appalling names describe the world below cocytus and styx ghosts under the earth and sapless shades and any similar words of which the very mention causes a shudder to pass through the inmost soul of him who hears them i do not say that these horrible stories may not have a use of some kind but there is a danger that the nerves of our guardians may be rendered too excitable and effeminate by them 
 there is a real danger he said 
 then we must have no more of them 
 true 
 another and a nobler strain must be composed and sung by us 
 clearly 
 and shall we proceed to get rid of the weepings and wailings of famous men 
 they will go with the rest 
 but shall we be right in getting rid of them reflect our principle is that the good man will not consider death terrible to any other good man who is his comrade 
 yes that is our principle 
 and therefore he will not sorrow for his departed friend as though he had suffered anything terrible 
 he will not 
 such an one as we further maintain is sufficient for himself and his own happiness and therefore is least in need of other men 
 true he said 
 and for this reason the loss of a son or brother or the deprivation of fortune is to him of all men least terrible 
 assuredly 
 and therefore he will be least likely to lament and will bear with the greatest equanimity any misfortune of this sort which may befall him 
 yes he will feel such a misfortune far less than another 
 then we shall be right in getting rid of the lamentations of famous men and making them over to women and not even to women who are good for anything or to men of a baser sort that those who are being educated by us to be the defenders of their country may scorn to do the like 
 that will be very right 
 then we will once more entreat homer and the other poets not to depict achilles who is the son of a goddess first lying on his side then on his back and then on his face then starting up and sailing in a frenzy along the shores of the barren sea now taking the sooty ashes in both his hands and pouring them over his head or weeping and wailing in the various modes which homer has delineated nor should he describe priam the kinsman of the gods as praying and beseeching 
 rolling in the dirt calling each man loudly by his name still more earnestly will we beg of him at all events not to introduce the gods lamenting and saying 
 alas my misery alas that i bore the harvest to my sorrow but if he must introduce the gods at any rate let him not dare so completely to misrepresent the greatest of the gods as to make him say 
 o heavens with my eyes verily i behold a dear friend of mine chased round and round the city and my heart is sorrowful or again 
 woe is me that i am fated to have sarpedon dearest of men to me subdued at the hands of patroclus the son of menoetius for if my sweet adeimantus our youth seriously listen to such unworthy representations of the gods instead of laughing at them as they ought hardly will any of them deem that he himself being but a man can be dishonoured by similar actions neither will he rebuke any inclination which may arise in his mind to say and do the like and instead of having any shame or he will be always whining and lamenting on slight occasions 
 yes he said that is most true 
 yes i replied but that surely is what ought not to be as the argument has just proved to us and by that proof we must abide until it is disproved by a better 
 it ought not to be 
 neither ought our guardians to be given to laughter for a fit of laughter which has been indulged to excess almost always produces a violent reaction 
 so i believe 
 then persons of worth even if only mortal men must not be represented as overcome by laughter and still less must such a representation of the gods be allowed 
 still less of the gods as you say he replied 
 then we shall not suffer such an expression to be used about the gods as that of homer when he describes how 
 inextinguishable laughter arose among the blessed gods when they saw hephaestus bustling about the mansion on your views we must not admit them 
 on my views if you like to father them on me that we must not admit them is certain 
 again truth should be highly valued if as we were saying a lie is useless to the gods and useful only as a medicine to men then the use of such medicines should be restricted to physicians private individuals have no business with them 
 clearly not he said 
 then if any one at all is to have the privilege of lying the rulers of the state should be the persons and they in their dealings either with enemies or with their own citizens may be allowed to lie for the public good but nobody else should meddle with anything of the kind and although the rulers have this privilege for a private man to lie to them in return is to be deemed a more heinous fault than for the patient or the pupil of a gymnasium not to speak the truth about his own bodily illnesses to the physician or to the trainer or for a sailor not to tell the captain what is happening about the ship and the rest of the crew and how things are going with himself or his fellow sailors 
 most true he said 
 if then the ruler catches anybody beside himself lying in the state 
 any of the craftsmen whether he priest or physician or carpenter he will punish him for introducing a practice which is equally subversive and destructive of ship or state 
 most certainly he said if our idea of the state is ever carried out 
 in the next place our youth must be temperate 
 certainly 
 are not the chief elements of temperance speaking generally obedience to commanders and in sensual pleasures 
 true 
 then we shall approve such language as that of diomede in homer 
 friend sit still and obey my word and the verses which follow 
 the greeks marched breathing prowess 
 in silent awe of their leaders and other sentiments of the same kind 
 we shall 
 what of this line 
 o heavy with wine who hast the eyes of a dog and the heart of a stag and of the words which follow would you say that these or any similar impertinences which private individuals are supposed to address to their rulers whether in verse or prose are well or ill spoken 
 they are ill spoken 
 they may very possibly afford some amusement but they do not conduce to temperance and therefore they are likely to do harm to our young men you would agree with me there 
 yes 
 and then again to make the wisest of men say that nothing in his opinion is more glorious than 
 when the tables are full of bread and meat and the carries round wine which he draws from the bowl and pours into the cups is it fit or conducive to temperance for a young man to hear such words or the verse 
 the saddest of fates is to die and meet destiny from hunger what would you say again to the tale of zeus who while other gods and men were asleep and he the only person awake lay devising plans but forgot them all in a moment through his lust and was so completely overcome at the sight of here that he would not even go into the hut but wanted to lie with her on the ground declaring that he had never been in such a state of rapture before even when they first met one another 
 without the knowledge of their parents or that other tale of how hephaestus because of similar goings on cast a chain around ares and aphrodite 
 indeed he said i am strongly of opinion that they ought not to hear that sort of thing 
 but any deeds of endurance which are done or told by famous men these they ought to see and hear as for example what is said in the verses 
 he smote his breast and thus reproached his heart 
 endure my heart far worse hast thou endured 
 certainly he said 
 in the next place we must not let them be receivers of gifts or lovers of money 
 certainly not 
 neither must we sing to them of 
 gifts persuading gods and persuading reverend kings neither is phoenix the tutor of achilles to be approved or deemed to have given his pupil good counsel when he told him that he should take the gifts of the greeks and assist them but that without a gift he should not lay aside his anger neither will we believe or acknowledge achilles himself to have been such a lover of money that he took or that when he had received payment he restored the dead body of hector but that without payment he was unwilling to do so 
 undoubtedly he said these are not sentiments which can be approved 
 loving homer as i do i hardly like to say that in attributing these feelings to achilles or in believing that they are truly to him he is guilty of downright impiety as little can i believe the narrative of his insolence to apollo where he says 
 thou hast wronged me o most abominable of deities verily i would he even with thee if i had only the power or his insubordination to the on whose divinity he is ready to lay hands or his offering to the dead patroclus of his own hair which had been previously dedicated to the other spercheius and that he actually performed this vow or that he dragged hector round the tomb of patroclus and slaughtered the captives at the pyre of all this i cannot believe that he was guilty any more than i can allow our citizens to believe that he the wise pupil the son of a goddess and of peleus who was the gentlest of men and third in descent from zeus was so disordered in his wits as to be at one time the slave of two seemingly inconsistent passions meanness not untainted by avarice combined with overweening contempt of gods and men 
 you are quite right he replied 
 and let us equally refuse to believe or allow to be repeated the tale of theseus son of poseidon or of peirithous son of zeus going forth as they did to perpetrate a horrid rape or of any other hero or son of a god daring to do such impious and dreadful things as they falsely ascribe to them in our day and let us further compel the poets to declare either that these acts were not done by them or that they were not the sons of gods both in the same breath they shall not be permitted to affirm we will not have them trying to persuade our youth that the gods are the authors of evil and that heroes are no better than which as we were saying are neither pious nor true for we have already proved that evil cannot come from the gods 
 assuredly not 
 and further they are likely to have a bad effect on those who hear them for everybody will begin to excuse his own vices when he is convinced that similar wickednesses are always being perpetrated by 
 the kindred of the gods the relatives of zeus whose ancestral altar the attar of zeus is aloft in air on the peak of ida and who have 
 the blood of deities yet flowing in their veins and therefore let us put an end to such tales lest they engender laxity of morals among the young 
 by all means he replied 
 but now that we are determining what classes of subjects are or are not to be spoken of let us see whether any have been omitted by us the manner in which gods and demigods and heroes and the world below should be treated has been already laid down 
 very true 
 and what shall we say about men that is clearly the remaining portion of our subject 
 clearly so 
 but we are not in a condition to answer this question at present my friend 
 why not 
 because if i am not mistaken we shall have to say that about men poets and are guilty of making the gravest misstatements when they tell us that wicked men are often happy and the good miserable and that injustice is profitable when undetected but that justice is a own loss and gain these things we shall forbid them to utter and command them to sing and say the opposite 
 to be sure we shall he replied 
 but if you admit that i am right in this then i shall maintain that you have implied the principle for which we have been all along contending 
 i grant the truth of your inference 
 that such things are or are not to be said about men is a question which we cannot determine until we have discovered what justice is and how naturally advantageous to the possessor whether he seems to be just or not 
 most true he said 
 enough of the subjects of poetry let us now speak of the style and when this has been considered both matter and manner will have been completely treated 
 i do not understand what you mean said adeimantus 
 then i must make you understand and perhaps i may be more intelligible if i put the matter in this way you are aware i suppose that all mythology and poetry is a narration of events either past present or to come 
 certainly he replied 
 and narration may be either simple narration or imitation or a union of the two 
 that again he said i do not quite understand 
 i fear that i must be a ridiculous teacher when i have so much difficulty in making myself apprehended like a bad speaker therefore i will not take the whole of the subject but will break a piece off in illustration of my meaning you know the first lines of the iliad in which the poet says that chryses prayed agamemnon to release his daughter and that agamemnon flew into a passion with him whereupon chryses failing of his object invoked the anger of the god against the achaeans now as far as these lines 
 and he prayed all the greeks but especially the two sons of atreus the chiefs of the people the poet is speaking in his own person he never leads us to suppose that he is any one else but in what follows he takes the person of chryses and then he does all that he can to make us believe that the speaker is not homer but the aged priest himself and in this double form he has cast the entire narrative of the events which occurred at troy and in ithaca and throughout the odyssey 
 yes 
 and a narrative it remains both in the speeches which the poet recites from time to time and in the intermediate passages 
 quite true 
 but when the poet speaks in the person of another may we not say that he assimilates his style to that of the person who as he informs you is going to speak 
 certainly 
 and this assimilation of himself to another either by the use of voice or gesture is the imitation of the person whose character he assumes 
 of course 
 then in this case the narrative of the poet may be said to proceed by way of imitation 
 very true 
 or if the poet everywhere appears and never conceals himself then again the imitation is dropped and his poetry becomes simple narration however in order that i may make my meaning quite clear and that you may no more say i understand i will show how the change might be effected if homer had said the priest came having his ransom in his hands supplicating the achaeans and above all the kings and then if instead of speaking in the person of chryses he had continued in his own person the words would have been not imitation but simple narration the passage would have run as follows i am no poet and therefore i drop the metre the priest came and prayed the gods on behalf of the greeks that they might capture troy and return safely home but begged that they would give him back his daughter and take the ransom which he brought and respect the god thus he spoke and the other greeks revered the priest and assented but agamemnon was wroth and bade him depart and not come again lest the staff and chaplets of the god should be of no avail to him the daughter of chryses should not be released he said she should grow old with him in argos and then he told him to go away and not to provoke him if he intended to get home unscathed and the old man went away in fear and silence and when he had left the camp he called upon apollo by his many names reminding him of everything which he had done pleasing to him whether in building his temples or in offering sacrifice and praying that his good deeds might be returned to him and that the achaeans might expiate his tears by the arrows of the god and so on in this way the whole becomes simple narrative 
 i understand he said 
 or you may suppose the opposite case that the intermediate passages are omitted and the dialogue only left 
 that also he said i understand you mean for example as in tragedy 
 you have conceived my meaning perfectly and if i mistake not what you failed to apprehend before is now made clear to you that poetry and mythology are in some cases wholly imitative instances of this are supplied by tragedy and comedy there is likewise the opposite style in which the my poet is the only speaker of this the dithyramb affords the best example and the combination of both is found in epic and in several other styles of poetry do i take you with me 
 yes he said i see now what you meant 
 i will ask you to remember also what i began by saying that we had done with the subject and might proceed to the style 
 yes i remember 
 in saying this i intended to imply that we must come to an understanding about the mimetic art whether the poets in narrating their stories are to be allowed by us to imitate and if so whether in whole or in part and if the latter in what parts or should all imitation be prohibited 
 you mean i suspect to ask whether tragedy and comedy shall be admitted into our state 
 yes i said but there may be more than this in question i really do not know as yet but whither the argument may blow thither we go 
 and go we will he said 
 then adeimantus let me ask you whether our guardians ought to be imitators or rather has not this question been decided by the rule already laid down that one man can only do one thing well and not many and that if he attempt many he will altogether fall of gaining much reputation in any 
 certainly 
 and this is equally true of imitation no one man can imitate many things as well as he would imitate a single one 
 he cannot 
 then the same person will hardly be able to play a serious part in life and at the same time to be an imitator and imitate many other parts as well for even when two species of imitation are nearly allied the same persons cannot succeed in both as for example the writers of tragedy and comedy did you not just now call them imitations 
 yes i did and you are right in thinking that the same persons cannot succeed in both 
 any more than they can be rhapsodists and actors at once 
 true 
 neither are comic and tragic actors the same yet all these things are but imitations 
 they are so 
 and human nature adeimantus appears to have been coined into yet smaller pieces and to be as incapable of imitating many things well as of performing well the actions of which the imitations are copies 
 quite true he replied 
 if then we adhere to our original notion and bear in mind that our guardians setting aside every other business are to dedicate themselves wholly to the maintenance of freedom in the state making this their craft and engaging in no work which does not bear on this end they ought not to practise or imitate anything else if they imitate at all they should imitate from youth upward only those characters which are suitable to their profession the courageous temperate holy free and the like but they should not depict or be skilful at imitating any kind of illiberality or baseness lest from imitation they should come to be what they imitate did you never observe how imitations beginning in early youth and continuing far into life at length grow into habits and become a second nature affecting body voice and mind 
 yes certainly he said 
 then i said we will not allow those for whom we profess a care and of whom we say that they ought to be good men to imitate a woman whether young or old quarrelling with her husband or striving and vaunting against the gods in conceit of her happiness or when she is in affliction or sorrow or weeping and certainly not one who is in sickness love or labour 
 very right he said 
 neither must they represent slaves male or female performing the offices of slaves 
 they must not 
 and surely not bad men whether cowards or any others who do the reverse of what we have just been prescribing who scold or mock or revile one another in drink or out of in drink or or who in any other manner sin against themselves and their neighbours in word or deed as the manner of such is neither should they be trained to imitate the action or speech of men or women who are mad or bad for madness like vice is to be known but not to be practised or imitated 
 very true he replied 
 neither may they imitate smiths or other artificers or oarsmen or boatswains or the like 
 how can they he said when they are not allowed to apply their minds to the callings of any of these 
 nor may they imitate the neighing of horses the bellowing of bulls the murmur of rivers and roll of the ocean thunder and all that sort of thing 
 nay he said if madness be forbidden neither may they copy the behaviour of madmen 
 you mean i said if i understand you aright that there is one sort of narrative style which may be employed by a truly good man when he has anything to say and that another sort will be used by a man of an opposite character and education 
 and which are these two sorts he asked 
 suppose i answered that a just and good man in the course of a narration comes on some saying or action of another good man i should imagine that he will like to personate him and will not be ashamed of this sort of imitation he will be most ready to play the part of the good man when he is acting firmly and wisely in a less degree when he is overtaken by illness or love or drink or has met with any other disaster but when he comes to a character which is unworthy of him he will not make a study of that he will disdain such a person and will assume his likeness if at all for a moment only when he is performing some good action at other times he will be ashamed to play a part which he has never practised nor will he like to fashion and frame himself after the baser models he feels the employment of such an art unless in jest to be beneath him and his mind revolts at it 
 so i should expect he replied 
 then he will adopt a mode of narration such as we have illustrated out of homer that is to say his style will be both imitative and narrative but there will be very little of the former and a great deal of the latter do you agree 
 certainly he said that is the model which such a speaker must necessarily take 
 but there is another sort of character who will narrate anything and the worse lie is the more unscrupulous he will be nothing will be too bad for him and he will be ready to imitate anything not as a joke but in right good earnest and before a large company as i was just now saying he will attempt to represent the roll of thunder the noise of wind and hall or the creaking of wheels and pulleys and the various sounds of flutes pipes trumpets and all sorts of instruments he will bark like a dog bleat like a sheep or crow like a cock his entire art will consist in imitation of voice and gesture and there will be very little narration 
 that he said will be his mode of speaking 
 these then are the two kinds of style 
 yes 
 and you would agree with me in saying that one of them is simple and has but slight changes and if the harmony and rhythm are also chosen for their simplicity the result is that the speaker if hc speaks correctly is always pretty much the same in style and he will keep within the limits of a single harmony for the changes are not great and in like manner he will make use of nearly the same rhythm 
 that is quite true he said 
 whereas the other requires all sorts of harmonies and all sorts of rhythms if the music and the style are to correspond because the style has all sorts of changes 
 that is also perfectly true he replied 
 and do not the two styles or the mixture of the two comprehend all poetry and every form of expression in words no one can say anything except in one or other of them or in both together 
 they include all he said 
 and shall we receive into our state all the three styles or one only of the two unmixed styles or would you include the mixed 
 i should prefer only to admit the pure imitator of virtue 
 yes i said adeimantus but the mixed style is also very charming and indeed the pantomimic which is the opposite of the one chosen by you is the most popular style with children and their attendants and with the world in general 
 i do not deny it 
 but i suppose you would argue that such a style is unsuitable to our state in which human nature is not twofold or manifold for one man plays one part only 
 yes quite unsuitable 
 and this is the reason why in our state and in our state only we shall find a shoemaker to be a shoemaker and not a pilot also and a husbandman to be a husbandman and not a dicast also and a soldier a soldier and not a trader also and the same throughout 
 true he said 
 and therefore when any one of these pantomimic gentlemen who are so clever that they can imitate anything comes to us and makes a proposal to exhibit himself and his poetry we will fall down and worship him as a sweet and holy and wonderful being but we must also inform him that in our state such as he are not permitted to exist the law will not allow them and so when we have anointed him with myrrh and set a garland of wool upon his head we shall send him away to another city for we mean to employ for our souls health the rougher and severer poet or who will imitate the style of the virtuous only and will follow those models which we prescribed at first when we began the education of our soldiers 
 we certainly will he said if we have the power 
 then now my friend i said that part of music or literary education which relates to the story or myth may be considered to be finished for the matter and manner have both been discussed 
 i think so too he said 
 next in order will follow melody and song 
 that is obvious 
 every one can see already what we ought to say about them if we are to be consistent with ourselves 
 socrates glaucon 
 i fear said glaucon laughing that the words every one hardly includes me for i cannot at the moment say what they should be though i may guess 
 at any rate you can tell that a song or ode has three parts the words the melody and the rhythm that degree of knowledge i may presuppose 
 yes he said so much as that you may 
 and as for the words there surely be no difference words between words which are and which are not set to music both will conform to the same laws and these have been already determined by us 
 yes 
 and the melody and rhythm will depend upon the words 
 certainly 
 we were saying when we spoke of the that we had no need of lamentations and strains of sorrow 
 true 
 and which are the harmonies expressive of sorrow you are musical and can tell me 
 the harmonies which you mean are the mixed or tenor lydian and the or bass lydian and such like 
 these then i said must be banished even to women who have a character to maintain they are of no use and much less to men certainly 
 in the next place drunkenness and softness and indolence are utterly unbecoming the character of our guardians 
 utterly unbecoming 
 and which are the soft or drinking harmonies 
 the ionian he replied and the lydian they are termed relaxed 
 well and are these of any military use 
 quite the reverse he replied and if so the dorian and the phrygian are the only ones which you have left 
 i answered of the harmonies i know nothing but i want to have one warlike to sound the note or accent which a brave man utters in the hour of danger and stern resolve or when his cause is failing and he is going to wounds or death or is overtaken by some other evil and at every such crisis meets the blows of fortune with firm step and a determination to endure and another to be used by him in times of peace and freedom of action when there is no pressure of necessity and he is seeking to persuade god by prayer or man by instruction and admonition or on the other hand when he is expressing his willingness to yield to persuasion or entreaty or admonition and which represents him when by prudent conduct he has attained his end not carried away by his success but acting moderately and wisely under the circumstances and acquiescing in the event these two harmonies i ask you to leave the strain of necessity and the strain of freedom the strain of the unfortunate and the strain of the fortunate the strain of courage and the strain of temperance these i say leave 
 and these he replied are the dorian and phrygian harmonies of which i was just now speaking 
 then i said if these and these only are to be used in our songs and melodies we shall not want multiplicity of notes or a panharmonic scale 
 i suppose not 
 then we shall not maintain the artificers of lyres with three corners and complex scales or the makers of any other instruments 
 certainly not 
 but what do you say to and would you admit them into our state when you reflect that in this composite use of harmony the flute is worse than all the stringed instruments put together even the panharmonic music is only an imitation of the flute 
 clearly not 
 there remain then only the lyre and the harp for use in the city and the shepherds may have a pipe in the country 
 that is surely the conclusion to be drawn from the argument 
 the preferring of apollo and his instruments to marsyas and his instruments is not at all strange i said 
 not at all he replied 
 and so by the dog of egypt we have been unconsciously purging the state which not long ago we termed luxurious 
 and we have done wisely he replied 
 then let us now finish the purgation i said next in order to harmonies rhythms will naturally follow and they should be subject to the same rules for we ought not to seek out complex systems of metre or metres of every kind but rather to discover what rhythms are the expressions of a courageous and harmonious life and when we have found them we shall adapt the foot and the melody to words having a like spirit not the words to the foot and melody to say what these rhythms are will be your duty you must teach me them as you have already taught me the harmonies 
 but indeed he replied i cannot tell you i only know that there are some three principles of rhythm out of which metrical systems are framed just as in sounds there are four notes out of which all the harmonies are composed that is an observation which i have made but of what sort of lives they are severally the imitations i am unable to say 
 then i said we must take damon into our counsels and he will tell us what rhythms are expressive of meanness or insolence or fury or other unworthiness and what are to be reserved for the expression of opposite feelings and i think that i have an indistinct recollection of his mentioning a complex cretic rhythm also a dactylic or heroic and he arranged them in some manner which i do not quite understand making the rhythms equal in the rise and fall of the foot long and short alternating and unless i am mistaken he spoke of an iambic as well as of a trochaic rhythm and assigned to them short and long quantities also in some cases he appeared to praise or censure the movement of the foot quite as much as the rhythm or perhaps a combination of the two for i am not certain what he meant these matters however as i was saying had better be referred to damon himself for the analysis of the subject would be difficult you know 
 rather so i should say 
 but there is no difficulty in seeing that grace or the absence of grace is an effect of good or bad rhythm 
 none at all 
 and also that good and bad rhythm naturally assimilate to a good and bad style and that harmony and discord in like manner follow style for our principle is that rhythm and harmony are regulated by the words and not the words by them 
 just so he said they should follow the words 
 and will not the words and the character of the style depend on the temper of the soul 
 yes 
 and everything else on the style 
 yes 
 then beauty of style and harmony and grace and good rhythm depend on simplicity i mean the true simplicity of a rightly and nobly ordered mind and character not that other simplicity which is only an euphemism for folly 
 very true he replied 
 and if our youth are to do their work in life must they not make these graces and harmonies their perpetual aim 
 they must 
 and surely the art of the painter and every other creative and constructive art are full of them weaving embroidery architecture and every kind of manufacture also nature animal and vegetable in all of them there is grace or the absence of grace and ugliness and discord and inharmonious motion are nearly allied to ill words and ill nature as grace and harmony are the twin sisters of goodness and virtue and bear their likeness 
 that is quite true he said 
 but shall our superintendence go no further and are the poets only to be required by us to express the image of the good in their works on pain if they do anything else of expulsion from our state or is the same control to be extended to other artists and are they also to be prohibited from exhibiting the opposite forms of vice and intemperance and meanness and indecency in sculpture and building and the other creative arts and is he who cannot conform to this rule of ours to be prevented from practising his art in our state lest the taste of our citizens be corrupted by him we would not have our guardians grow up amid images of moral deformity as in some noxious pasture and there browse and feed upon many a baneful herb and flower day by day little by little until they silently gather a festering mass of corruption in their own soul let our artists rather be those who are gifted to discern the true nature of the beautiful and graceful then will our youth dwell in a land of health amid fair sights and sounds and receive the good in everything and beauty the effluence of fair works shall flow into the eye and ear like a breeze from a purer region and insensibly draw the soul from earliest years into likeness and sympathy with the beauty of reason 
 there can be no nobler training than that he replied 
 and therefore i said glaucon musical training is a more potent instrument than any other because rhythm and harmony find their way into the inward places of the soul on which they mightily fasten imparting grace and making the soul of him who is rightly educated graceful or of him who is ungraceful and also because he who has received this true education of the inner being will most shrewdly perceive omissions or faults in art and nature and with a true taste while he praises and rejoices over and receives into his soul the good and becomes noble and good he will justly blame and hate the bad now in the days of his youth even before he is able to know the reason why and when reason comes he will recognise and salute the friend with whom his education has made him long familiar 
 yes he said i quite agree with you in thinking that our youth should be trained in music and on the grounds which you mention 
 just as in learning to read i said we were satisfied when we knew the letters of the alphabet which are very few in all their recurring sizes and combinations not slighting them as unimportant whether they occupy a space large or small but everywhere eager to make them out and not thinking ourselves perfect in the art of reading until we recognise them wherever they are found 
 true 
 or as we recognise the reflection of letters in the water or in a mirror only when we know the letters themselves the same art and study giving us the knowledge of both 
 exactly 
 even so as i maintain neither we nor our guardians whom we have to educate can ever become musical until we and they know the essential forms in all their combinations and can recognise them and their images wherever they are found not slighting them either in small things or great but believing them all to be within the sphere of one art and study 
 most assuredly 
 and when a beautiful soul harmonises with a beautiful form and the two are cast in one mould that will be the fairest of sights to him who has an eye to see it 
 the fairest indeed 
 and the fairest is also the loveliest 
 that may be assumed 
 and the man who has the spirit of harmony will be most in love with the loveliest but he will not love him who is of an inharmonious soul 
 that is true he replied if the deficiency be in his soul but if there be any merely bodily defect in another he will be patient of it and will love all the same 
 i perceive i said that you have or have had experiences of this sort and i agree but let me ask you another question has excess of pleasure any affinity to temperance 
 how can that be he replied pleasure deprives a man of the use of his faculties quite as much as pain 
 or any affinity to virtue in general 
 none whatever 
 any affinity to wantonness and intemperance 
 yes the greatest 
 and is there any greater or keener pleasure than that of sensual love 
 no nor a madder 
 whereas true love is a love of beauty and order temperate and harmonious 
 quite true he said 
 then no intemperance or madness should be allowed to approach true love 
 certainly not 
 then mad or intemperate pleasure must never be allowed to come near the lover and his beloved neither of them can have any part in it if their love is of the right sort 
 no indeed socrates it must never come near them 
 then i suppose that in the city which we are founding you would make a law to the effect that a friend should use no other familiarity to his love than a father would use to his son and then only for a noble purpose and he must first have the consent and this rule is to limit him in all his intercourse and he is never to be seen going further or if he exceeds he is to be deemed guilty of coarseness and bad taste 
 i quite agree he said 
 thus much of music which makes a fair ending for what should be the end of music if not the love of beauty 
 i agree he said 
 after music comes gymnastic in which our youth are next to be trained 
 certainly 
 gymnastic as well as music should begin in early years the training in it should be careful and should continue through life now my belief is and this is a matter upon which i should like to have your opinion in confirmation of my own but my own belief is not that the good body by any bodily excellence improves the soul but on the contrary that the good soul by her own excellence improves the body as far as this may be possible what do you say 
 yes i agree 
 then to the mind when adequately trained we shall be right in handing over the more particular care of the body and in order to avoid prolixity we will now only give the general outlines of the subject 
 very good 
 that they must abstain from intoxication has been already remarked by us for of all persons a guardian should be the last to get drunk and not know where in the world he is 
 yes he said that a guardian should require another guardian to take care of him is ridiculous indeed 
 but next what shall we say of their food for the men are in training for the great contest of all are they not 
 yes he said 
 and will the habit of body of our ordinary athletes be suited to them 
 why not 
 i am afraid i said that a habit of body such as they have is but a sleepy sort of thing and rather perilous to health do you not observe that these athletes sleep away their lives and are liable to most dangerous illnesses if they depart in ever so slight a degree from their customary regimen 
 yes i do 
 then i said a finer sort of training will be required for our warrior athletes who are to be like wakeful dogs and to see and hear with the utmost keenness amid the many changes of water and also of food of summer heat and winter cold which they will have to endure when on a campaign they must not be liable to break down in health 
 that is my view 
 the really excellent gymnastic is twin sister of that simple music which we were just now describing 
 how so 
 why i conceive that there is a gymnastic which like our music is simple and good and especially the military gymnastic 
 what do you mean 
 my meaning may be learned from homer he you know feeds his heroes at their feasts when they are campaigning on soldiers fare they have no fish although they are on the shores of the hellespont and they are not allowed boiled meats but only roast which is the food most convenient for soldiers requiring only that they should light a fire and not involving the trouble of carrying about pots and pans 
 true 
 and i can hardly be mistaken in saying that sweet sauces are nowhere mentioned in homer in proscribing them however he is not singular all professional athletes are well aware that a man who is to be in good condition should take nothing of the kind 
 yes he said and knowing this they are quite right in not taking them 
 then you would not approve of syracusan dinners and the refinements of sicilian cookery 
 i think not 
 nor if a man is to be in condition would you allow him to have a corinthian girl as his fair friend 
 certainly not 
 neither would you approve of the delicacies as they are thought of athenian confectionery 
 certainly not 
 all such feeding and living may be rightly compared by us to melody and song composed in the panharmonic style and in all the rhythms exactly 
 there complexity engendered license and here disease whereas simplicity in music was the parent of temperance in the soul and simplicity in gymnastic of health in the body 
 most true he said 
 but when intemperance and disease multiply in a state halls of justice and medicine are always being opened and the arts of the doctor and the lawyer give themselves airs finding how keen is the interest which not only the slaves but the freemen of a city take about them 
 of course 
 and yet what greater proof can there be of a bad and disgraceful state of education than this that not only artisans and the meaner sort of people need the skill of physicians and judges but also those who would profess to have had a liberal education is it not disgraceful and a great sign of want of that a man should have to go abroad for his law and physic because he has none of his own at home and must therefore surrender himself into the hands of other men whom he makes lords and judges over him 
 of all things he said the most disgraceful 
 would you say most i replied when you consider that there is a further stage of the evil in which a man is not only a litigant passing all his days in the courts either as plaintiff or defendant but is actually led by his bad taste to pride himself on his litigiousness he imagines that he is a master in dishonesty able to take every crooked turn and wriggle into and out of every hole bending like a withy and getting out of the way of justice and all for what in order to gain small points not worth mentioning he not knowing that so to order his life as to be able to do without a napping judge is a far higher and nobler sort of thing is not that still more disgraceful 
 yes he said that is still more disgraceful 
 well i said and to require the help of medicine not when a wound has to be cured or on occasion of an epidemic but just because by indolence and a habit of life such as we have been describing men fill themselves with waters and winds as if their bodies were a marsh compelling the ingenious sons of asclepius to find more names for diseases such as flatulence and catarrh is not this too a disgrace 
 yes he said they do certainly give very strange and newfangled names to diseases 
 yes i said and i do not believe that there were any such diseases in the days of asclepius and this i infer from the circumstance that the hero eurypylus after he has been wounded in homer drinks a posset of pramnian wine well besprinkled with and grated cheese which are certainly inflammatory and yet the sons of asclepius who were at the trojan war do not blame the damsel who gives him the drink or rebuke patroclus who is treating his case 
 well he said that was surely an extraordinary drink to be given to a person in his condition 
 not so extraordinary i replied if you bear in mind that in former days as is commonly said before the time of herodicus the guild of asclepius did not practise our present system of medicine which may be said to educate diseases but herodicus being a trainer and himself of a sickly constitution by a combination of training and doctoring found out a way of torturing first and chiefly himself and secondly the rest of the world 
 how was that he said 
 by the invention of lingering death for he had a mortal disease which he perpetually tended and as recovery was out of the question he passed his entire life as a valetudinarian he could do nothing but attend upon himself and he was in constant torment whenever he departed in anything from his usual regimen and so dying hard by the help of science he struggled on to old age 
 a rare reward of his skill 
 yes i said a reward which a man might fairly expect who never understood that if asclepius did not instruct his descendants in valetudinarian arts the omission arose not from ignorance or inexperience of such a branch of medicine but because he knew that in all states every individual has an occupation to which he must attend and has therefore no leisure to spend in continually being ill this we remark in the case of the artisan but ludicrously enough do not apply the same rule to people of the richer sort 
 how do you mean he said 
 i mean this when a carpenter is ill he asks the physician for a rough and ready cure an emetic or a purge or a cautery or the knife these are his remedies and if some one prescribes for him a course of dietetics and tells him that he must swathe and swaddle his head and all that sort of thing he replies at once that he has no time to be ill and that he sees no good in a life which is spent in nursing his disease to the neglect of his customary employment and therefore bidding to this sort of physician he resumes his ordinary habits and either gets well and lives and does his business or if his constitution falls he dies and has no more trouble 
 yes he said and a man in his condition of life ought to use the art of medicine thus far only 
 has he not i said an occupation and what profit would there be in his life if he were deprived of his occupation 
 quite true he said 
 but with the rich man this is otherwise of him we do not say that he has any specially appointed work which he must perform if he would live 
 he is generally supposed to have nothing to do 
 then you never heard of the saying of phocylides that as soon as a man has a livelihood he should practise virtue 
 nay he said i think that he had better begin somewhat sooner 
 let us not have a dispute with him about this i said but rather ask ourselves is the practice of virtue obligatory on the rich man or can he live without it and if obligatory on him then let us raise a further question whether this dieting of disorders which is an impediment to the application of the mind t in carpentering and the mechanical arts does not equally stand in the way of the sentiment of phocylides 
 of that he replied there can be no doubt such excessive care of the body when carried beyond the rules of gymnastic is most inimical to the practice of virtue 
 yes indeed i replied and equally incompatible with the management of a house an army or an office of state and what is most important of all irreconcilable with any kind of study or thought or there is a constant suspicion that headache and giddiness are to be ascribed to philosophy and hence all practising or making trial of virtue in the higher sense is absolutely stopped for a man is always fancying that he is being made ill and is in constant anxiety about the state of his body 
 yes likely enough 
 and therefore our politic asclepius may be supposed to have exhibited the power of his art only to persons who being generally of healthy constitution and habits of life had a definite ailment such as these he cured by purges and operations and bade them live as usual herein consulting the interests of the state but bodies which disease had penetrated through and through he would not have attempted to cure by gradual processes of evacuation and infusion he did not want to lengthen out lives or to have weak fathers begetting weaker sons if a man was not able to live in the ordinary way he had no business to cure him for such a cure would have been of no use either to himself or to the state 
 then he said you regard asclepius as a statesman 
 clearly and his character is further illustrated by his sons note that they were heroes in the days of old and practised the medicines of which i am speaking at the siege of troy you will remember how when pandarus wounded menelaus they 
 sucked the blood out of the wound and sprinkled soothing remedies but they never prescribed what the patient was afterwards to eat or drink in the case of menelaus any more than in the case of eurypylus the remedies as they conceived were enough to heal any man who before he was wounded was healthy and regular in habits and even though he did happen to drink a posset of pramnian wine he might get well all the same but they would have nothing to do with unhealthy and intemperate subjects whose lives were of no use either to themselves or others the art of medicine was not designed for their good and though they were as rich as midas the sons of asclepius would have declined to attend them 
 they were very acute persons those sons of asclepius 
 naturally so i replied nevertheless the tragedians and pindar disobeying our behests although they acknowledge that asclepius was the son of apollo say also that he was bribed into healing a rich man who was at the point of death and for this reason he was struck by lightning but we in accordance with the principle already affirmed by us will not believe them when they tell us both if he was the son of a god we maintain that hd was not avaricious or if he was avaricious he was not the son of a god 
 all that socrates is excellent but i should like to put a question to you ought there not to be good physicians in a state and are not the best those who have treated the greatest number of constitutions good and bad and are not the best judges in like manner those who are acquainted with all sorts of moral natures 
 yes i said i too would have good judges and good physicians but do you know whom i think good 
 will you tell me 
 i will if i can let me however note that in the same question you join two things which are not the same 
 how so he asked 
 why i said you join physicians and judges now the most skilful physicians are those who from their youth upwards have combined with the knowledge of their art the greatest experience of disease they had better not be robust in health and should have had all manner of diseases in their own persons for the body as i conceive is not the instrument with which they cure the body in that case we could not allow them ever to be or to have been sickly but they cure the body with the mind and the mind which has become and is sick can cure nothing 
 that is very true he said 
 but with the judge it is otherwise since he governs mind by mind he ought not therefore to have been trained among vicious minds and to have associated with them from youth upwards and to have gone through the whole calendar of crime only in order that he may quickly infer the crimes of others as he might their bodily diseases from his own the honourable mind which is to form a healthy judgment should have had no experience or contamination of evil habits when young and this is the reason why in youth good men often appear to be simple and are easily practised upon by the dishonest because they have no examples of what evil is in their own souls 
 yes he said they are far too apt to be deceived 
 therefore i said the judge should not be young he should have learned to know evil not from his own soul but from late and long observation of the nature of evil in others knowledge should be his guide not personal experience 
 yes he said that is the ideal of a judge 
 yes i replied and he will be a good man which is my answer to your question for he is good who has a good soul but the cunning and suspicious nature of which we spoke he who has committed many crimes and fancies himself to be a master in wickedness when he is amongst his fellows is wonderful in the precautions which he takes because he judges of them by himself but when he gets into the company of men of virtue who have the experience of age he appears to be a fool again owing to his unseasonable suspicions he cannot recognise an honest man because he has no pattern of honesty in himself at the same time as the bad are more numerous than the good and he meets with them oftener he thinks himself and is by others thought to be rather wise than foolish 
 most true he said 
 then the good and wise judge whom we are seeking is not this man but the other for vice cannot know virtue too but a virtuous nature educated by time will acquire a knowledge both of virtue and vice the virtuous and not the vicious man has wisdom in my opinion 
 and in mine also 
 this is the sort of medicine and this is the sort of law which you sanction in your state they will minister to better natures giving health both of soul and of body but those who are diseased in their bodies they will leave to die and the corrupt and incurable souls they will put an end to themselves 
 that is clearly the best thing both for the patients and for the state 
 and thus our youth having been educated only in that simple music which as we said inspires temperance will be reluctant to go to law 
 clearly 
 and the musician who keeping to the same track is content to practise the simple gymnastic will have nothing to do with medicine unless in some extreme case 
 that i quite believe 
 the very exercises and tolls which he undergoes are intended to stimulate the spirited element of his nature and not to increase his strength he will not like common athletes use exercise and regimen to develop his muscles 
 very right he said 
 neither are the two arts of music and gymnastic really designed as is often supposed the one for the training of the soul the other fir the training of the body 
 what then is the real object of them 
 i believe i said that the teachers of both have in view chiefly the improvement of the soul 
 how can that be he asked 
 did you never observe i said the effect on the mind itself of exclusive devotion to gymnastic or the opposite effect of an exclusive devotion to music 
 in what way shown he said 
 the one producing a temper of hardness and ferocity the other of softness and effeminacy i replied 
 yes he said i am quite aware that the mere athlete becomes too much of a savage and that the mere musician is melted and softened beyond what is good for him 
 yet surely i said this ferocity only comes from spirit which if rightly educated would give courage but if too much intensified is liable to become hard and brutal 
 that i quite think 
 on the other hand the philosopher will have the quality of gentleness and this also when too much indulged will turn to softness but if educated rightly will be gentle and moderate 
 true 
 and in our opinion the guardians ought to have both these qualities 
 assuredly 
 and both should be in harmony 
 beyond question 
 and the harmonious soul is both temperate and courageous 
 yes 
 and the inharmonious is cowardly and boorish 
 very true 
 and when a man allows music to play upon him and to pour into his soul through the funnel of his ears those sweet and soft and melancholy airs of which we were just now speaking and his whole life is passed in warbling and the delights of song in the first stage of the process the passion or spirit which is in him is tempered like iron and made useful instead of brittle and useless but if he carries on the softening and soothing process in the next stage he begins to melt and waste until he has wasted away his spirit and cut out the sinews of his soul and he becomes a feeble warrior 
 very true 
 if the element of spirit is naturally weak in him the change is speedily accomplished but if he have a good deal then the power of music weakening the spirit renders him excitable on the least provocation he flames up at once and is speedily extinguished instead of having spirit he grows irritable and passionate and is quite impracticable 
 exactly 
 and so in gymnastics if a man takes violent exercise and is a great feeder and the reverse of a great student of music and philosophy at first the high condition of his body fills him with pride and spirit and lie becomes twice the man that he was 
 certainly 
 and what happens if he do nothing else and holds no verse with the muses does not even that intelligence which there may be in him having no taste of any sort of learning or enquiry or thought or culture grow feeble and dull and blind his mind never waking up or receiving nourishment and his senses not being purged of their mists 
 true he said 
 and he ends by becoming a hater of philosophy uncivilized never using the weapon of persuasion he is like a wild beast all violence and fierceness and knows no other way of dealing and he lives in all ignorance and evil conditions and has no sense of propriety and grace 
 that is quite true he said 
 and as there are two principles of human nature one the spirited and the other the philosophical some god as i should say has given mankind two arts answering to them and only indirectly to the soul and body in order that these two principles like the strings of an instrument may be relaxed or drawn tighter until they are duly harmonised 
 that appears to be the intention 
 and he who mingles music with gymnastic in the fairest proportions and best attempers them to the soul may be rightly called the true musician and harmonist in a far higher sense than the tuner of the strings 
 you are quite right socrates 
 and such a presiding genius will be always required in our state if the government is to last 
 yes he will be absolutely necessary 
 such then are our principles of nurture and education where would be the use of going into further details about the dances of our citizens or about their hunting and coursing their gymnastic and equestrian contests for these all follow the general principle and having found that we shall have no difficulty in discovering them 
 i dare say that there will be no difficulty 
 very good i said then what is the next question must we not ask who are to be rulers and who subjects 
 certainly 
 there can be no doubt that the elder must rule the younger 
 clearly 
 and that the best of these must rule 
 that is also clear 
 now are not the best husbandmen those who are most devoted to husbandry 
 yes 
 and as we are to have the best of guardians for our city must they not be those who have most the character of guardians 
 yes 
 and to this end they ought to be wise and efficient and to have a special care of the state 
 true 
 and a man will be most likely to care about that which he loves 
 to be sure 
 and he will be most likely to love that which he regards as having the same interests with himself and that of which the good or evil fortune is supposed by him at any time most to affect his own 
 very true he replied 
 then there must be a selection let us note among the guardians those who in their whole life show the greatest eagerness to do what is for the good of their country and the greatest repugnance to do what is against her interests 
 those are the right men 
 and they will have to be watched at every age in order that we may see whether they preserve their resolution and never under the influence either of force or enchantment forget or cast off their sense of duty to the state 
 how cast off he said 
 i will explain to you i replied a resolution may go out of a mind either with his will or against his will with his will when he gets rid of a falsehood and learns better against his will whenever he is deprived of a truth 
 i understand he said the willing loss of a resolution the meaning of the unwilling i have yet to learn 
 why i said do you not see that men are unwillingly deprived of good and willingly of evil is not to have lost the truth an evil and to possess the truth a good and you would agree that to conceive things as they are is to possess the truth 
 yes he replied i agree with you in thinking that mankind are deprived of truth against their will 
 and is not this involuntary deprivation caused either by theft or force or enchantment 
 still he replied i do not understand you 
 i fear that i must have been talking darkly like the tragedians i only mean that some men are changed by persuasion and that others forget argument steals away the hearts of one class and time of the other and this i call theft now you understand me 
 yes 
 those again who are forced are those whom the violence of some pain or grief compels to change their opinion 
 i understand he said and you are quite right 
 and you would also acknowledge that the enchanted are those who change their minds either under the softer influence of pleasure or the sterner influence of fear 
 yes he said everything that deceives may be said to enchant 
 therefore as i was just now saying we must enquire who are the best guardians of their own conviction that what they think the interest of the state is to be the rule of their lives we must watch them from their youth upwards and make them perform actions in which they are most likely to forget or to be deceived and he who remembers and is not deceived is to be selected and he who falls in the trial is to be rejected that will be the way 
 yes 
 and there should also be toils and pains and conflicts prescribed for them in which they will be made to give further proof of the same qualities 
 very right he replied 
 and then i said we must try them with enchantments that is the third sort of test and see what will be their behaviour like those who take colts amid noise and tumult to see if they are of a timid nature so must we take our youth amid terrors of some kind and again pass them into pleasures and prove them more thoroughly than gold is proved in the furnace that we may discover whether they are armed against all enchantments and of a noble bearing always good guardians of themselves and of the music which they have learned and retaining under all circumstances a rhythmical and harmonious nature such as will be most serviceable to the individual and to the state and he who at every age as boy and youth and in mature life has come out of the trial victorious and pure shall be appointed a ruler and guardian of the state he shall be honoured in life and death and shall receive sepulture and other memorials of honour the greatest that we have to give but him who fails we must reject i am inclined to think that this is the sort of way in which our rulers and guardians should be chosen and appointed i speak generally and not with any pretension to exactness 
 and speaking generally i agree with you he said 
 and perhaps the word guardian in the fullest sense ought to be applied to this higher class only who preserve us against foreign enemies and maintain peace among our citizens at home that the one may not have the will or the others the power to harm us the young men whom we before called guardians may be more properly designated auxiliaries and supporters of the principles of the rulers 
 i agree with you he said 
 how then may we devise one of those needful falsehoods of which we lately spoke just one royal lie which may deceive the rulers if that be possible and at any rate the rest of the city 
 what sort of lie he said 
 nothing new i replied only an old phoenician tale of what has often occurred before now in other places as the poets say and have made the world believe though not in our time and i do not know whether such an event could ever happen again or could now even be made probable if it did 
 how your words seem to hesitate on your lips 
 you will not wonder i replied at my hesitation when you have heard 
 speak he said and fear not 
 well then i will speak although i really know not how to look you in the face or in what words to utter the audacious fiction which i propose to communicate gradually first to the rulers then to the soldiers and lastly to the people they are to be told that their youth was a dream and the education and training which they received from us an appearance only in reality during all that time they were being formed and fed in the womb of the earth where they themselves and their arms and appurtenances were manufactured when they were completed the earth their mother sent them up and so their country being their mother and also their nurse they are bound to advise for her good and to defend her against attacks and her citizens they are to regard as children of the earth and their own brothers 
 you had good reason he said to be ashamed of the lie which you were going to tell 
 true i replied but there is more coming i have only told you half citizens we shall say to them in our tale you are brothers yet god has framed you differently some of you have the power of command and in the composition of these he has mingled gold wherefore also they have the greatest honour others he has made of silver to be auxillaries others again who are to be husbandmen and craftsmen he has composed of brass and iron and the species will generally be preserved in the children but as all are of the same original stock a golden parent will sometimes have a silver son or a silver parent a golden son and god proclaims as a first principle to the rulers and above all else that there is nothing which should so anxiously guard or of which they are to be such good guardians as of the purity of the race they should observe what elements mingle in their off spring for if the son of a golden or silver parent has an admixture of brass and iron then nature orders a transposition of ranks and the eye of the ruler must not be pitiful towards the child because he has to descend in the scale and become a husbandman or artisan just as there may be sons of artisans who having an admixture of gold or silver in them are raised to honour and become guardians or auxiliaries for an oracle says that when a man of brass or iron guards the state it will be destroyed such is the tale is there any possibility of making our citizens believe in it 
 not in the present generation he replied there is no way of accomplishing this but their sons may be made to believe in the tale and their sons sons and posterity after them 
 i see the difficulty i replied yet the fostering of such a belief will make them care more for the city and for one another enough however of the fiction which may now fly abroad upon the wings of rumour while we arm our heroes and lead them forth under the command of their rulers let them look round and select a spot whence they can best suppress insurrection if any prove refractory within and also defend themselves against enemies who like wolves may come down on the fold from without there let them encamp and when they have encamped let them sacrifice to the proper gods and prepare their dwellings 
 just so he said 
 and their dwellings must be such as will shield them against the cold of winter and the heat of summer 
 i suppose that you mean houses he replied 
 yes i said but they must be the houses of soldiers and not of 
 what is the difference he said 
 that i will endeavour to explain i replied to keep watchdogs who from want of discipline or hunger or some evil habit or evil habit or other would turn upon the sheep and worry them and behave not like dogs but wolves would be a foul and monstrous thing in a shepherd 
 truly monstrous he said 
 and therefore every care must be taken that our auxiliaries being stronger than our citizens may not grow to be too much for them and become savage tyrants instead of friends and allies 
 yes great care should be taken 
 and would not a really good education furnish the best safeguard 
 but they are already he replied 
 i cannot be so confident my dear glaucon i said i am much certain that they ought to be and that true education whatever that may be will have the greatest tendency to civilize and humanize them in their relations to one another and to those who are under their protection 
 very true he replied 
 and not only their education but their habitations and all that belongs to them should be such as will neither impair their virtue as guardians nor tempt them to prey upon the other citizens any man of sense must acknowledge that 
 he must 
 then let us consider what will be their way of life if they are to realize our idea of them in the first place none of them should have any property of his own beyond what is absolutely necessary neither should they have a private house or store closed against any one who has a mind to enter their provisions should be only such as are required by trained warriors who are men of temperance and courage they should agree to receive from the citizens a fixed rate of pay enough to meet the expenses of the year and no more and they will go and live together like soldiers in a camp gold and silver we will tell them that they have from god the diviner metal is within them and they have therefore no need of the dross which is current among men and ought not to pollute the divine by any such earthly admixture for that commoner metal has been the source of many unholy deeds but their own is undefiled and they alone of all the citizens may not touch or handle silver or gold or be under the same roof with them or wear them or drink from them and this will be their salvation and they will be the saviours of the state but should they ever acquire homes or lands or moneys of their own they will become housekeepers and husbandmen instead of guardians enemies and tyrants instead of allies of the other citizens hating and being hated plotting and being plotted against they will pass their whole life in much greater terror of internal than of external enemies and the hour of ruin both to themselves and to the rest of the state will be at hand for all which reasons may we not say that thus shall our state be ordered and that these shall be the regulations appointed by us for guardians concerning their houses and all other matters other 
 yes said glaucon

 book iv 
 
 adeimantus socrates 
 here adeimantus interposed a question how would you answer socrates said he if a person were to say that you are making these people miserable and that they are the cause of their own unhappiness the city in fact belongs to them but they are none the better for it whereas other men acquire lands and build large and handsome houses and have everything handsome about them offering sacrifices to the gods on their own account and practising hospitality moreover as you were saying just now they have gold and silver and all that is usual among the favourites of fortune but our poor citizens are no better than mercenaries who are quartered in the city and are always mounting guard 
 yes i said and you may add that they are only fed and not paid in addition to their food like other men and therefore they cannot if they would take a journey of pleasure they have no money to spend on a mistress or any other luxurious fancy which as the world goes is thought to be happiness and many other accusations of the same nature might be added 
 but said he let us suppose all this to be included in the charge 
 you mean to ask i said what will be our answer 
 yes 
 if we proceed along the old path my belief i said is that we shall find the answer and our answer will be that even as they are our guardians may very likely be the happiest of men but that our aim in founding the state was not the disproportionate happiness of any one class but the greatest happiness of the whole we thought that in a state which is ordered with a view to the good of the whole we should be most likely to find justice and in the state injustice and having found them we might then decide which of the two is the happier at present i take it we are fashioning the happy state not piecemeal or with a view of making a few happy citizens but as a whole and we will proceed to view the opposite kind of state suppose that we were painting a statue and some one came up to us and said why do you not put the most beautiful colours on the most beautiful parts of the body the eyes ought to be purple but you have made them black to him we might fairly answer sir you would not surely have us beautify the eyes to such a degree that they are no longer eyes consider rather whether by giving this and the other features their due proportion we make the whole beautiful and so i say to you do not compel us to assign to the guardians a sort of happiness which will make them anything but guardians for we too can clothe our husbandmen in royal apparel and set crowns of gold on their heads and bid them till the ground as much as they like and no more our potters also might be allowed to repose on couches and feast by the fireside passing round the winecup while their wheel is conveniently at hand and working at pottery only as much as they like in this way we might make every class then as you imagine the whole state would be happy but do not put this idea into our heads for if we listen to you the husbandman will be no longer a husbandman the potter will cease to be a potter and no one will have the character of any distinct class in the state now this is not of much consequence where the corruption of society and pretension to be what you are not is confined to cobblers but when the guardians of the laws and of the government are only seemingly and not real guardians then see how they turn the state upside down and on the other hand they alone have the power of giving order and happiness to the state we mean our guardians to be true saviours and not the destroyers of the state whereas our opponent is thinking of peasants at a festival who are enjoying a life of revelry not of citizens who are doing their duty to the state but if so we mean different things and he is speaking of something which is not a state and therefore we must consider whether in appointing our guardians we would look to their greatest happiness individually or whether this principle of happiness does not rather reside in the state as a whole but the latter be the truth then the guardians and auxillaries and all others equally with them must be compelled or induced to do their own work in the best way and thus the whole state will grow up in a noble order and the several classes will receive the proportion of happiness which nature assigns to them 
 i think that you are quite right 
 i wonder whether you will agree with another remark which occurs to me 
 what may that be 
 there seem to be two causes of the deterioration of the arts 
 what are they 
 wealth i said and poverty 
 how do they act 
 the process is as follows when a potter becomes rich will he think you any longer take the same pains with his art 
 certainly not 
 he will grow more and more indolent and careless 
 very true 
 and the result will be that he becomes a worse potter 
 yes he greatly deteriorates 
 but on the other hand if he has no money and cannot provide himself tools or instruments he will not work equally well himself nor will he teach his sons or apprentices to work equally well 
 certainly not 
 then under the influence either of poverty or of wealth workmen and their work are equally liable to degenerate 
 that is evident 
 here then is a discovery of new evils i said against which the guardians will have to watch or they will creep into the city unobserved 
 what evils 
 wealth i said and poverty the one is the parent of luxury and indolence and the other of meanness and viciousness and both of discontent 
 that is very true he replied but still i should like to know socrates how our city will be able to go to war especially against an enemy who is rich and powerful if deprived of the sinews of war 
 there would certainly be a difficulty i replied in going to war with one such enemy but there is no difficulty where there are two of them 
 how so he asked 
 in the first place i said if we have to fight our side will be trained warriors fighting against an army of rich men 
 that is true he said 
 and do you not suppose adeimantus that a single boxer who was perfect in his art would easily be a match for two stout and gentlemen who were not boxers 
 hardly if they came upon him at once 
 what not i said if he were able to run away and then turn and strike at the one who first came up and supposing he were to do this several times under the heat of a scorching sun might he not being an expert overturn more than one stout personage 
 certainly he said there would be nothing wonderful in that 
 and yet rich men probably have a greater superiority in the science and practice of boxing than they have in military qualities 
 likely enough 
 then we may assume that our athletes will be able to fight with two or three times their own number 
 i agree with you for i think you right 
 and suppose that before engaging our citizens send an embassy to one of the two cities telling them what is the truth silver and gold we neither have nor are permitted to have but you may do you therefore come and help us in war of and take the spoils of the other city who on hearing these words would choose to fight against lean wiry dogs rather th than with the dogs on their side against fat and tender sheep 
 that is not likely and yet there might be a danger to the poor state if the wealth of many states were to be gathered into one 
 but how simple of you to use the term state at all of any but our own 
 why so 
 you ought to speak of other states in the plural number not one of them is a city but many cities as they say in the game for indeed any city however small is in fact divided into two one the city of the poor the other of the rich these are at war with one another and in either there are many smaller divisions and you would be altogether beside the mark if you treated them all as a single state but if you deal with them as many and give the wealth or power or persons of the one to the others you will always have a great many friends and not many enemies and your state while the wise order which has now been prescribed continues to prevail in her will be the greatest of states i do not mean to say in reputation or appearance but in deed and truth though she number not more than a thousand defenders a single state which is her equal you will hardly find either among hellenes or barbarians though many that appear to be as great and many times greater 
 that is most true he said 
 and what i said will be the best limit for our rulers to fix when they are considering the size of the state and the amount of territory which they are to include and beyond which they will not go 
 what limit would you propose 
 i would allow the state to increase so far as is consistent with unity that i think is the proper limit 
 very good he said 
 here then i said is another order which will have to be conveyed to our guardians let our city be accounted neither large nor small but one and 
 and surely said he this is not a very severe order which we impose upon them 
 and the other said i of which we were speaking before is lighter still i mean the duty of degrading the offspring of the guardians when inferior and of elevating into the rank of guardians the offspring of the lower classes when naturally superior the intention was that in the case of the citizens generally each individual should be put to the use for which nature which nature intended him one to one work and then every man would do his own business and be one and not many and so the whole city would be one and not many 
 yes he said that is not so difficult 
 the regulations which we are prescribing my good adeimantus are not as might be supposed a number of great principles but trifles all if care be taken as the saying is of the one great thing a thing however which i would rather call not great but sufficient for our purpose 
 what may that be he asked 
 education i said and nurture if our citizens are well educated and grow into sensible men they will easily see their way through all these as well as other matters which i omit such for example as marriage the possession of women and the procreation of children which will all follow the general principle that friends have all things in common as the proverb says 
 that will be the best way of settling them 
 also i said the state if once started well moves with accumulating force like a wheel for good nurture and education implant good constitutions and these good constitutions taking root in a good education improve more and more and this improvement affects the breed in man as in other animals 
 very possibly he said 
 then to sum up this is the point to which above all the attention of our rulers should be directed that music and gymnastic be preserved in their original form and no innovation made they must do their utmost to maintain them intact and when any one says that mankind most regard 
 the newest song which the singers have they will be afraid that he may be praising not new songs but a new kind of song and this ought not to be praised or conceived to be the meaning of the poet for any musical innovation is full of danger to the whole state and ought to be prohibited so damon tells me and i can quite believe says that when modes of music change of the state always change with them 
 yes said adeimantus and you may add my suffrage to and your own 
 then i said our guardians must lay the foundations of their fortress in music 
 yes he said the lawlessness of which you speak too easily steals in 
 yes i replied in the form of amusement and at first sight it appears harmless 
 why yes he said and there is no harm were it not that little by little this spirit of licence finding a home imperceptibly penetrates into manners and customs whence issuing with greater force it invades contracts between man and man and from contracts goes on to laws and constitutions in utter recklessness ending at last socrates by an overthrow of all rights private as well as public 
 is that true i said 
 that is my belief he replied 
 then as i was saying our youth should be trained from the first in a stricter system for if amusements become lawless and the youths themselves become lawless they can never grow up into and virtuous citizens 
 very true he said 
 and when they have made a good beginning in play and by the help of music have gained the habit of good order then this habit of order in a manner how unlike the lawless play of the others will accompany them in all their actions and be a principle of growth to them and if there be any fallen places a principle in the state will raise them up again 
 very true he said 
 thus educated they will invent for themselves any lesser rules which their predecessors have altogether neglected 
 what do you mean 
 i mean such things as these when the young are to be silent before their elders how they are to show respect to them by standing and making them sit what honour is due to parents what garments or shoes are to be worn the mode of dressing the hair deportment and manners in general you would agree with me 
 yes 
 but there is i think small wisdom in legislating about such matters i doubt if it is ever done nor are any precise written enactments about them likely to be lasting 
 impossible 
 it would seem adeimantus that the direction in which education starts a man will determine his future life does not like always attract like 
 to be sure 
 until some one rare and grand result is reached which may be good and may be the reverse of good 
 that is not to be denied 
 and for this reason i said i shall not attempt to legislate further about them 
 naturally enough he replied 
 well and about the business of the agora dealings and the ordinary dealings between man and man or again about agreements with the commencement with artisans about insult and injury of the commencement of actions and the appointment of juries what would you say there may also arise questions about any impositions and extractions of market and harbour dues which may be required and in general about the regulations of markets police harbours and the like but oh heavens shall we condescend to legislate on any of these particulars 
 i think he said that there is no need to impose laws about them on good men what regulations are necessary they will find out soon enough for themselves 
 yes i said my friend if god will only preserve to them the laws which we have given them 
 and without divine help said adeimantus they will go on for ever making and mending their laws and their lives in the hope of attaining perfection 
 you would compare them i said to those invalids who having no will not leave off their habits of intemperance 
 exactly 
 yes i said and what a delightful life they lead they are always doctoring and increasing and complicating their disorders and always fancying that they will be cured by any nostrum which anybody advises them to try 
 such cases are very common he said with invalids of this sort 
 yes i replied and the charming thing is that they deem him their worst enemy who tells them the truth which is simply that unless they give up eating and drinking and wenching and idling neither drug nor cautery nor spell nor amulet nor any other remedy will avail 
 charming he replied i see nothing charming in going into a passion with a man who tells you what is right 
 these gentlemen i said do not seem to be in your good graces 
 assuredly not 
 nor would you praise the behaviour of states which act like the men whom i was just now describing for are there not states in which the citizens are forbidden under pain of death to alter the constitution and yet he who most sweetly courts those who live under this regime and indulges them and fawns upon them and is skilful in anticipating and gratifying their humours is held to be a great and good statesman do not these states resemble the persons whom i was describing 
 yes he said the states are as bad as the men and i am very far from praising them 
 but do you not admire i said the coolness and dexterity of these ready ministers of political corruption 
 yes he said i do but not of all of them for there are some whom the applause of the multitude has deluded into the belief that they are really statesmen and these are not much to be admired 
 what do you mean i said you should have more feeling for them when a man cannot measure and a great many others who cannot measure declare that he is four cubits high can he help believing what they say 
 nay he said certainly not in that case 
 well then do not be angry with them for are they not as good as a play trying their hand at paltry reforms such as i was describing they are always fancying that by legislation they will make an end of frauds in contracts and the other rascalities which i was mentioning not knowing that they are in reality cutting off the heads of a hydra 
 yes he said that is just what they are doing 
 i conceive i said that the true legislator will not trouble himself with this class of enactments whether concerning laws or the constitution either in an or in a state for in the former they are quite useless and in the latter there will be no difficulty in devising them and many of them will naturally flow out of our previous regulations 
 what then he said is still remaining to us of the work of legislation 
 nothing to us i replied but to apollo the god of delphi there remains the ordering of the greatest and noblest and chiefest things of all 
 which are they he said 
 the institution of temples and sacrifices and the entire service of gods demigods and heroes also the ordering of the repositories of the dead and the rites which have to be observed by him who would propitiate the inhabitants of the world below these are matters of which we are ignorant ourselves and as founders of a city we should be unwise in trusting them to any interpreter but our ancestral deity he is the god who sits in the center on the navel of the earth and he is the interpreter of religion to all mankind 
 you are right and we will do as you propose 
 but where amid all this is justice son of ariston tell me where now that our city has been made habitable light a candle and search and get your brother and polemarchus and the rest of our friends to help and let us see where in it we can discover justice and where injustice and in what they differ from one another and which of them the man who would be happy should have for his portion whether seen or unseen by gods and men 
 socrates glaucon 
 nonsense said glaucon did you not promise to search yourself saying that for you not to help justice in her need would be an impiety 
 i do not deny that i said so and as you remind me i will be as good as my word but you must join 
 we will he replied 
 well then i hope to make the discovery in this way i mean to begin with the assumption that our state if rightly ordered is perfect 
 that is most certain 
 and being perfect is therefore wise and valiant and temperate and just 
 that is likewise clear 
 and whichever of these qualities we find in the state the one which is not found will be the residue 
 very good 
 if there were four things and we were searching for one of them wherever it might be the one sought for might be known to us from the first and there would be no further trouble or we might know the other three first and then the fourth would clearly be the one left 
 very true he said 
 and is not a similar method to be pursued about the virtues which are also four in number 
 clearly 
 first among the virtues found in the state wisdom comes into view and in this i detect a certain peculiarity 
 what is that 
 the state which we have been describing is said to be wise as being good in counsel 
 very true 
 and good counsel is clearly a kind of knowledge for not by ignorance but by knowledge do men counsel well 
 clearly 
 and the kinds of knowledge in a state are many and diverse 
 of course 
 there is the knowledge of the carpenter but is that the sort of knowledge which gives a city the title of wise and good in counsel 
 certainly not that would only give a city the reputation of skill in carpentering 
 then a city is not to be called wise because possessing a knowledge which counsels for the best about wooden implements 
 certainly not 
 nor by reason of a knowledge which advises about brazen pots i said nor as possessing any other similar knowledge 
 not by reason of any of them he said 
 nor yet by reason of a knowledge which cultivates the earth that would give the city the name of agricultural 
 yes 
 well i said and is there any knowledge in our recently founded state among any of the citizens which advises not about any particular thing in the state but about the whole and considers how a state can best deal with itself and with other states 
 there certainly is 
 and what is knowledge and among whom is it found i asked 
 it is the knowledge of the guardians he replied and found among those whom we were just now describing as perfect guardians 
 and what is the name which the city derives from the possession of this sort of knowledge 
 the name of good in counsel and truly wise 
 and will there be in our city more of these true guardians or more smiths 
 the smiths he replied will be far more numerous 
 will not the guardians be the smallest of all the classes who receive a name from the profession of some kind of knowledge 
 much the smallest 
 and so by reason of the smallest part or class and of the knowledge which resides in this presiding and ruling part of itself the whole state being thus constituted according to nature will be wise and this which has the only knowledge worthy to be called wisdom has been ordained by nature to be of all classes the least 
 most true 
 thus then i said the nature and place in the state of one of the four virtues has somehow or other been discovered 
 and in my humble opinion very satisfactorily discovered he replied 
 again i said there is no difficulty in seeing the nature of courage and in what part that quality resides which gives the name of courageous to the state 
 how do you mean 
 why i said every one who calls any state courageous or cowardly will be thinking of the part which fights and goes out to war on the behalf 
 no one he replied would ever think of any other 
 certainly not 
 the rest of the citizens may be courageous or may be cowardly but their courage or cowardice will not as i conceive have the effect of making the city either the one or the other 
 the city will be courageous in virtue of a portion of herself which preserves under all circumstances that opinion about the nature of things to be feared and not to be feared in which our legislator educated them and this is what you term courage 
 i should like to hear what you are saying once more for i do not think that i perfectly understand you 
 i mean that courage is a kind of salvation 
 salvation of what 
 of the opinion respecting things to be feared what they are and of what nature which the law implants through education and i mean by the words under all circumstances to intimate that in pleasure or in pain or under the influence of desire or fear a man preserves and does not lose this opinion shall i give you an illustration 
 if you please 
 you know i said that dyers when they want to dye wool for making the true begin by selecting their white colour first this they prepare and dress with much care and pains in order that the white ground may take the purple hue in full perfection the dyeing then proceeds and whatever is dyed in this manner becomes a fast colour and no washing either with lyes or without them can take away the bloom but when the ground has not been duly prepared you will have noticed how poor is the look either of purple or of any other colour 
 yes he said i know that they have a and ridiculous appearance 
 then now i said you will understand what our object was in selecting our soldiers and educating them in music and gymnastic we were contriving influences which would prepare them to take the dye of the laws in perfection and the colour of their opinion about dangers and of every other opinion was to be indelibly fixed by their nurture and training not to be washed away by such potent lyes as pleasure mightier agent far in washing the soul than any soda or lye or by sorrow fear and desire the mightiest of all other solvents and this sort of universal saving power of true opinion in conformity with law about real and false dangers i call and maintain to be courage unless you disagree 
 but i agree he replied for i suppose that you mean to exclude mere uninstructed courage such as that of a wild beast or of a slave this in your opinion is not the courage which the law ordains and ought to have another name 
 most certainly 
 then i may infer courage to be such as you describe 
 why yes said i you may and if you add the words of a citizen you will not be far wrong hereafter if you like we will carry the examination further but at present we are we w seeking not for courage but justice and for the purpose of our enquiry we have said enough 
 you are right he replied 
 two virtues remain to be discovered in the temperance and then justice which is the end of our search 
 very true 
 now can we find justice without troubling ourselves about temperance 
 i do not know how that can be accomplished he said nor do i desire that justice should be brought to light and temperance lost sight of and therefore i wish that you would do me the favour of considering temperance first 
 certainly i replied i should not be justified in refusing your request 
 then consider he said 
 yes i replied i will and as far as i can at present see the virtue of temperance has more of the nature of harmony and symphony than the preceding 
 how so he asked 
 temperance i replied is the ordering or controlling of certain pleasures and desires this is curiously enough implied in the saying of a man being his own master and other traces of the same notion may be found in language 
 no doubt he said 
 there is something ridiculous in the expression master of himself for the master is also the servant and the servant the master and in all these modes of speaking the same person is denoted 
 certainly 
 the meaning is i believe that in the human soul there is a better and also a worse principle and when the better has the worse under control then a man is said to be master of himself and this is a term of praise but when owing to evil education or association the better principle which is also the smaller is overwhelmed by the greater mass of the worse in this case he is blamed and is called the slave of self and unprincipled 
 yes there is reason in that 
 and now i said look at our newly created state and there you will find one of these two conditions realised for the state as you will acknowledge may be justly called master of itself if the words temperance and truly express the rule of the better part over the worse 
 yes he said i see that what you say is true 
 let me further note that the manifold and complex pleasures and desires and pains are generally found in children and women and servants and in the freemen so called who are of the lowest and more numerous class 
 certainly he said 
 whereas the simple and moderate desires which follow reason and are under the guidance of mind and true opinion are to be found only in a few and those the best born and best educated 
 very true these two as you may perceive have a place in our state and the meaner desires of the are held down by the virtuous desires and wisdom of the few 
 that i perceive he said 
 then if there be any city which may be described as master of its own pleasures and desires and master of itself ours may claim such a designation 
 certainly he replied 
 it may also be called temperate and for the same reasons 
 yes 
 and if there be any state in which rulers and subjects will be agreed as to the question who are to rule that again will be our state 
 undoubtedly 
 and the citizens being thus agreed among themselves in which class will temperance be found in the rulers or in the subjects 
 in both as i should imagine he replied 
 do you observe that we were not far wrong in our guess that temperance was a sort of harmony 
 why so 
 why because temperance is unlike courage and wisdom each of which resides in a part only the one making the state wise and the other valiant not so temperance which extends to the whole and runs through all the notes of the scale and produces a harmony of the weaker and the stronger and the middle class whether you suppose them to be stronger or weaker in wisdom or power or numbers or wealth or anything else most truly then may we deem temperance to be the agreement of the naturally superior and inferior as to the right to rule of either both in states and individuals 
 i entirely agree with you 
 and so i said we may consider three out of the four virtues to have been discovered in our state the last of those qualities which make a state virtuous must be justice if we only knew what that was 
 the inference is obvious 
 the time then has arrived glaucon when like huntsmen we should surround the cover and look sharp that justice does not steal away and pass out of sight and escape us for beyond a doubt she is somewhere in this country watch therefore and strive to catch a sight of her and if you see her first let me know 
 would that i could but you should regard me rather as a follower who has just eyes enough to see what you show him that is about as much as i am good for 
 offer up a prayer with me and follow 
 i will but you must show me the way 
 here is no path i said and the wood is dark and perplexing still we must push on 
 let us push on 
 here i saw something halloo i said i begin to perceive a track and i believe that the quarry will not escape 
 good news he said 
 truly i said we are stupid fellows 
 why so 
 why my good sir at the beginning of our enquiry ages ago there was justice tumbling out at our feet and we never saw her nothing could be more ridiculous like people who go about looking for what they have in their hands that was the way with us we looked not at what we were seeking but at what was far off in the distance and therefore i suppose we missed her 
 what do you mean 
 i mean to say that in reality for a long time past we have been talking of justice and have failed to recognise her 
 i grow impatient at the length of your exordium 
 well then tell me i said whether i am right or not you remember the original principle which we were always laying down at the foundation of the state that one man should practise one thing only the thing to which his nature was best adapted now justice is this principle or a part of it 
 yes we often said that one man should do one thing only 
 further we affirmed that justice was doing own business and not being a busybody we said so again and again and many others have said the same to us 
 yes we said so 
 then to do own business in a certain way may be assumed to be justice can you tell me whence i derive this inference 
 i cannot but i should like to be told 
 because i think that this is the only virtue which remains in the state when the other virtues of temperance and courage and wisdom are abstracted and that this is the ultimate cause and condition of the existence of all of them and while remaining in them is also their preservative and we were saying that if the three were discovered by us justice would be the fourth or remaining one 
 that follows of necessity 
 if we are asked to determine which of these four qualities by its presence contributes most to the excellence of the state whether the agreement of rulers and subjects or the preservation in the soldiers of the opinion which the law ordains about the true nature of dangers or wisdom and watchfulness in the rulers or whether this other which i am mentioning and which is found in children and women slave and freeman artisan ruler subject the quality i mean of every one doing his own work and not being a busybody would claim the palm the question is not so easily answered 
 certainly he replied there would be a difficulty in saying which 
 then the power of each individual in the state to do his own work appears to compete with the other political virtues wisdom temperance courage 
 yes he said 
 and the virtue which enters into this competition is justice 
 exactly 
 let us look at the question from another point of view are not the rulers in a state those to whom you would entrust the office of determining suits at law 
 certainly 
 and are suits decided on any other ground but that a man may neither take what is nor be deprived of what is his own 
 yes that is their principle 
 which is a just principle 
 yes 
 then on this view also justice will be admitted to be the having and doing what is a own and belongs to him 
 very true 
 think now and say whether you agree with me or not suppose a carpenter to be doing the business of a cobbler or a cobbler of a carpenter and suppose them to exchange their implements or their duties or the same person to be doing the work of both or whatever be the change do you think that any great harm would result to the state 
 not much 
 but when the cobbler or any other man whom nature designed to be a trader having his heart lifted up by wealth or strength or the number of his followers or any like advantage attempts to force his way into the class of warriors or a warrior into that of legislators and guardians for which he is unfitted and either to take the implements or the duties of the other or when one man is trader legislator and warrior all in one then i think you will agree with me in saying that this interchange and this meddling of one with another is the ruin of the state 
 most true 
 seeing then i said that there are three distinct classes any meddling of one with another or the change of one into another is the greatest harm to the state and may be most justly termed 
 precisely 
 and the greatest degree of to own city would be termed by you injustice 
 certainly 
 this then is injustice and on the other hand when the trader the auxiliary and the guardian each do their own business that is justice and will make the city just 
 i agree with you 
 we will not i said be as yet but if on trial this conception of justice be verified in the individual as well as in the state there will be no longer any room for doubt if it be not verified we must have a fresh enquiry first let us complete the old investigation which we began as you remember under the impression that if we could previously examine justice on the larger scale there would be less difficulty in discerning her in the individual that larger example appeared to be the state and accordingly we constructed as good a one as we could knowing well that in the good state justice would be found let the discovery which we made be now applied to the individual if they agree we shall be satisfied or if there be a difference in the individual we will come back to the state and have another trial of the theory the friction of the two when rubbed together may possibly strike a light in which justice will shine forth and the vision which is then revealed we will fix in our souls 
 that will be in regular course let us do as you say 
 i proceeded to ask when two things a greater and less are called by the same name are they like or unlike in so far as they are called the same 
 like he replied 
 the just man then if we regard the idea of justice only will be like the just state 
 he will 
 and a state was thought by us to be just when the three classes in the state severally did their own business and also thought to be temperate and valiant and wise by reason of certain other affections and qualities of these same classes 
 true he said 
 and so of the individual we may assume that he has the same three principles in his own soul which are found in the state and he may be rightly described in the same terms because he is affected in the same manner 
 certainly he said 
 once more then o my friend we have alighted upon an easy question whether the soul has these three principles or not 
 an easy question nay rather socrates the proverb holds that hard is the good 
 very true i said and i do not think that the method which we are employing is at all adequate to the accurate solution of this question the true method is another and a longer one still we may arrive at a solution not below the level of the previous enquiry 
 may we not be satisfied with that he said under the circumstances i am quite content 
 i too i replied shall be extremely well satisfied 
 then faint not in pursuing the speculation he said 
 must we not acknowledge i said that in each of us there are the same principles and habits which there are in the state and that from the individual they pass into the state how else can they come there take the quality of passion or spirit it would be ridiculous to imagine that this quality when found in states is not derived from the individuals who are supposed to possess it the thracians scythians and in general the northern nations and the same may be said of the love of knowledge which is the special characteristic of our part of the world or of the love of money which may with equal truth be attributed to the phoenicians and egyptians 
 exactly so he said 
 there is no difficulty in understanding this 
 none whatever 
 but the question is not quite so easy when we proceed to ask whether these principles are three or one whether that is to say we learn with one part of our nature are angry with another and with a third part desire the satisfaction of our natural appetites or whether the whole soul comes into play in each sort of action to determine that is the difficulty 
 yes he said there lies the difficulty 
 then let us now try and determine whether they are the same or different 
 how can we he asked 
 i replied as follows the same thing clearly cannot act or be acted upon in the same part or in relation to the same thing at the same time in contrary ways and therefore whenever this contradiction occurs in things apparently the same we know that they are really not the same but different 
 good 
 for example i said can the same thing be at rest and in motion at the same time in the same part 
 impossible 
 still i said let us have a more precise statement of terms lest we should hereafter fall out by the way imagine the case of a man who is standing and also moving his hands and his head and suppose a person to say that one and the same person is in motion and at rest at the same such a mode of speech we should object and should rather say that one part of him is in motion while another is at rest 
 very true 
 and suppose the objector to refine still further and to draw the nice distinction that not only parts of tops but whole tops when they spin round with their pegs fixed on the spot are at rest and in motion at the same time and he may say the same of anything which revolves in the same spot his objection would not be admitted by us because in such cases things are not at rest and in motion in the same parts of themselves we should rather say that they have both an axis and a circumference and that the axis stands still for there is no deviation from the perpendicular and that the circumference goes round but if while revolving the axis inclines either to the right or left forwards or backwards then in no point of view can they be at rest 
 that is the correct mode of describing them he replied 
 then none of these objections will confuse us or incline us to believe that the same thing at the same time in the same part or in relation to the same thing can act or be acted upon in contrary ways 
 certainly not according to my way of thinking 
 yet i said that we may not be compelled to examine all such objections and prove at length that they are untrue let us assume their absurdity and go forward on the understanding that hereafter if this assumption turn out to be untrue all the consequences which follow shall be withdrawn 
 yes he said that will be the best way 
 well i said would you not allow that assent and dissent desire and aversion attraction and repulsion are all of them opposites whether they are regarded as active or passive for that makes no difference in the fact of their opposition 
 yes he said they are opposites 
 well i said and hunger and thirst and the desires in general and again willing and wishing all these you would refer to the classes already mentioned you would say would you not that the soul of him who desires is seeking after the object of his desires or that he is drawing to himself the thing which he wishes to possess or again when a person wants anything to be given him his mind longing for the realisation of his desires intimates his wish to have it by a nod of assent as if he had been asked a question 
 very true 
 and what would you say of unwillingness and dislike and the absence of desire should not these be referred to the opposite class of repulsion and rejection 
 certainly 
 admitting this to be true of desire generally let us suppose a particular class of desires and out of these we will select hunger and thirst as they are termed which are the most obvious of them 
 let us take that class he said 
 the object of one is food and of the other drink 
 yes 
 and here comes the point is not thirst the desire which the soul has of drink and of drink only not of drink qualified by anything else for example warm or cold or much or little or in a word drink of any particular sort but if the thirst be accompanied by heat then the desire is of cold drink or if accompanied by cold then of warm drink or if the thirst be excessive then the drink which is desired will be excessive or if not great the quantity of drink will also be small but thirst pure and simple will desire drink pure and simple which is the natural satisfaction of thirst as food is of hunger 
 yes he said the simple desire is as you say in every case of the simple object and the qualified desire of the qualified object 
 but here a confusion may arise and i should wish to guard against an opponent starting up and saying that no man desires drink only but good drink or food only but good food for good is the universal object of desire and thirst being a desire will necessarily be thirst after good drink and the same is true of every other desire 
 yes he replied the opponent might have something to say 
 nevertheless i should still maintain that of relatives some have a quality attached to either term of the relation others are simple and have their correlatives simple 
 i do not know what you mean 
 well you know of course that the greater is relative to the less 
 certainly 
 and the much greater to the much less 
 yes 
 and the sometime greater to the sometime less and the greater that is to be to the less that is to be 
 certainly he said 
 and so of more and less and of other correlative terms such as the double and the half or again the heavier and the lighter the swifter and the slower and of hot and cold and of any other relatives is not this true of all of them 
 yes 
 and does not the same principle hold in the sciences the object of science is knowledge assuming that to be the true definition but the object of a particular science is a particular kind of knowledge i mean for example that the science of is a kind of knowledge which is defined and distinguished from other kinds and is therefore termed architecture 
 certainly 
 because it has a particular quality which no other has 
 yes 
 and it has this particular quality because it has an object of a particular kind and this is true of the other arts and sciences 
 yes 
 now then if i have made myself clear you will understand my original meaning in what i said about relatives my meaning was that if one term of a relation is taken alone the other is taken alone if one term is qualified the other is also qualified i do not mean to say that relatives may not be disparate or that the science of health is healthy or of disease necessarily diseased or that the sciences of good and evil are therefore good and evil but only that when the term science is no longer used absolutely but has a qualified object which in this case is the nature of health and disease it becomes defined and is hence called not merely science but the science of medicine 
 i quite understand and i think as you do 
 would you not say that thirst is one of these essentially relative terms having clearly a relation 
 yes thirst is relative to drink 
 and a certain kind of thirst is relative to a certain kind of drink but thirst taken alone is neither of much nor little nor of good nor bad nor of any particular kind of drink but of drink only 
 certainly 
 then the soul of the thirsty one in so far as he is thirsty desires only drink for this he yearns and tries to obtain it 
 that is plain 
 and if you suppose something which pulls a thirsty soul away from drink that must be different from the thirsty principle which draws him like a beast to drink for as we were saying the same thing cannot at the same time with the same part of itself act in contrary ways about the same 
 impossible 
 no more than you can say that the hands of the archer push and pull the bow at the same time but what you say is that one hand pushes and the other pulls 
 exactly so he replied 
 and might a man be thirsty and yet unwilling to drink 
 yes he said it constantly happens 
 and in such a case what is one to say would you not say that there was something in the soul bidding a man to drink and something else forbidding him which is other and stronger than the principle which bids him 
 i should say so 
 and the forbidding principle is derived from reason and that which bids and attracts proceeds from passion and disease 
 clearly 
 then we may fairly assume that they are two and that they differ from one another the one with which man reasons we may call the rational principle of the soul the other with which he loves and hungers and thirsts and feels the flutterings of any other desire may be termed the irrational or appetitive the ally of sundry pleasures and satisfactions 
 yes he said we may fairly assume them to be different 
 then let us finally determine that there are two principles existing in the soul and what of passion or spirit is it a third or akin to one of the preceding 
 i should be inclined to say akin to desire 
 well i said there is a story which i remember to have heard and in which i put faith the story is that leontius the son of aglaion coming up one day from the piraeus under the north wall on the outside observed some dead bodies lying on the ground at the place of execution he felt a desire to see them and also a dread and abhorrence of them for a time he struggled and covered his eyes but at length the desire got the better of him and forcing them open he ran up to the dead bodies saying look ye wretches take your fill of the fair sight 
 i have heard the story myself he said 
 the moral of the tale is that anger at times goes to war with desire as though they were two distinct things 
 yes that is the meaning he said 
 and are there not many other cases in which we observe that when a desires violently prevail over his reason he reviles himself and is angry at the violence within him and that in this struggle which is like the struggle of factions in a state his spirit is on the side of his reason but for the passionate or spirited element to take part with the desires when reason that she should not be opposed is a sort of thing which thing which i believe that you never observed occurring in yourself nor as i should imagine in any one else 
 certainly not 
 suppose that a man thinks he has done a wrong to another the nobler he is the less able is he to feel indignant at any suffering such as hunger or cold or any other pain which the injured person may inflict upon him these he deems to be just and as i say his anger refuses to be excited by them 
 true he said 
 but when he thinks that he is the sufferer of the wrong then he boils and chafes and is on the side of what he believes to be justice and because he suffers hunger or cold or other pain he is only the more determined to persevere and conquer his noble spirit will not be quelled until he either slays or is slain or until he hears the voice of the shepherd that is reason bidding his dog bark no more 
 the illustration is perfect he replied and in our state as we were saying the auxiliaries were to be dogs and to hear the voice of the rulers who are their shepherds 
 i perceive i said that you quite understand me there is however a further point which i wish you to consider 
 what point 
 you remember that passion or spirit appeared at first sight to be a kind of desire but now we should say quite the contrary for in the conflict of the soul spirit is arrayed on the side of the rational principle 
 most assuredly 
 but a further question arises is passion different from reason also or only a kind of reason in which latter case instead of three principles in the soul there will only be two the rational and the concupiscent or rather as the state was composed of three classes traders auxiliaries counsellors so may there not be in the individual soul a third element which is passion or spirit and when not corrupted by bad education is the natural auxiliary of reason 
 yes he said there must be a third 
 yes i replied if passion which has already been shown to be different from desire turn out also to be different from reason 
 but that is easily proved we may observe even in young children that they are full of spirit almost as soon as they are born whereas some of them never seem to attain to the use of reason and most of them late enough 
 excellent i said and you may see passion equally in brute animals which is a further proof of the truth of what you are saying and we may once more appeal to the words of homer which have been already quoted by us 
 he smote his breast and thus rebuked his soul for in this verse homer has clearly supposed the power which reasons about the better and worse to be different from the unreasoning anger which is rebuked by it 
 very true he said 
 and so after much tossing we have reached land and are fairly agreed that the same principles which exist in the state exist also in the individual and that they are three in number 
 exactly 
 must we not then infer that the individual is wise in the same way and in virtue of the same quality which makes the state wise 
 certainly 
 also that the same quality which constitutes courage in the state constitutes courage in the individual and that both the state and the individual bear the same relation to all the other virtues 
 assuredly 
 and the individual will be acknowledged by us to be just in the same way in which the state is just 
 that follows of course 
 we cannot but remember that the justice of the state consisted in each of the three classes doing the work of its own class 
 we are not very likely to have forgotten he said 
 we must recollect that the individual in whom the several qualities of his nature do their own work will be just and will do his own work 
 yes he said we must remember that too 
 and ought not the rational principle which is wise and has the care of the whole soul to rule and the passionate or spirited principle to be the subject and ally 
 certainly 
 and as we were saying the united influence of music and gymnastic will bring them into accord nerving and sustaining the reason with noble words and lessons and moderating and soothing and civilizing the wildness of passion by harmony and rhythm 
 quite true he said 
 and these two thus nurtured and educated and having learned truly to know their own functions will rule over the concupiscent which in each of us is the largest part of the soul and by nature most insatiable of gain over this they will keep guard lest waxing great and strong with the fulness of bodily pleasures as they are termed the concupiscent soul no longer confined to her own sphere should attempt to enslave and rule those who are not her subjects and overturn the whole life of man 
 very true he said 
 both together will they not be the best defenders of the whole soul and the whole body against attacks from without the one counselling and the other fighting under his leader and courageously executing his commands and counsels 
 true 
 and he is to be deemed courageous whose spirit retains in pleasure and in pain the commands of reason about what he ought or ought not to fear 
 right he replied 
 and him we call wise who has in him that little part which rules and which proclaims these commands that part too being supposed to have a knowledge of what is for the interest of each of the three parts and of the whole 
 assuredly 
 and would you not say that he is temperate who has these same elements in friendly harmony in whom the one ruling principle of reason and the two subject ones of spirit and desire are equally agreed that reason ought to rule and do not rebel 
 certainly he said that is the true account of temperance whether in the state or individual 
 and surely i said we have explained again and again how and by virtue of what quality a man will be just 
 that is very certain 
 and is justice dimmer in the individual and is her form different or is she the same which we found her to be in the state 
 there is no difference in my opinion he said 
 because if any doubt is still lingering in our minds a few commonplace instances will satisfy us of the truth of what i am saying 
 what sort of instances do you mean 
 if the case is put to us must we not admit that the just state or the man who is trained in the principles of such a state will be less likely than the unjust to make away with a deposit of gold or silver would any one deny this 
 no one he replied 
 will the just man or citizen ever be guilty of sacrilege or theft or treachery either to his friends or to his country 
 never 
 neither will he ever break faith where there have been oaths or agreements 
 impossible 
 no one will be less likely to commit adultery or to dishonour his father and mother or to fall in his religious duties 
 no one 
 and the reason is that each part of him is doing its own business whether in ruling or being ruled 
 exactly so 
 are you satisfied then that the quality which makes such men and such states is justice or do you hope to discover some other 
 not i indeed 
 then our dream has been realised and the suspicion which we entertained at the beginning of our work of construction that some divine power must have conducted us to a primary form of justice has now been verified 
 yes certainly 
 and the division of labour which required the carpenter and the shoemaker and the rest of the citizens to be doing each his own business and not was a shadow of justice and for that reason it was of use 
 clearly 
 but in reality justice was such as we were describing being concerned however not with the outward man but with the inward which is the true self and concernment of man for the just man does not permit the several elements within him to interfere with one another or any of them to do the work of others he sets in order his own inner life and is his own master and his own law and at peace with himself and when he has bound together the three principles within him which may be compared to the higher lower and middle notes of the scale and the intermediate intervals when he has bound all these together and is no longer many but has become one entirely temperate and perfectly adjusted nature then he proceeds to act if he has to act whether in a matter of property or in the treatment of the body or in some affair of politics or private business always thinking and calling that which preserves and with this harmonious condition just and good action and the knowledge which presides over it wisdom and that which at any time impairs this condition he will call unjust action and the opinion which presides over it ignorance 
 you have said the exact truth socrates 
 very good and if we were to affirm that we had discovered the just man and the just state and the nature of justice in each of them we should not be telling a falsehood 
 most certainly not 
 may we say so then 
 let us say so 
 and now i said injustice has to be considered 
 clearly 
 must not injustice be a strife which arises among the three principles a meddlesomeness and interference and rising up of a part of the soul against the whole an assertion of unlawful authority which is made by a rebellious subject against a true prince of whom he is the natural vassal what is all this confusion and delusion but injustice and intemperance and cowardice and ignorance and every form of vice 
 exactly so 
 and if the nature of justice and injustice be known then the meaning of acting unjustly and being unjust or again of acting justly will also be perfectly clear 
 what do you mean he said 
 why i said they are like disease and health being in the soul just what disease and health are in the body 
 how so he said 
 why i said that which is healthy causes health and that which is unhealthy causes disease 
 yes 
 and just actions cause justice and unjust actions cause injustice 
 that is certain 
 and the creation of health is the institution of a natural order and government of one by another in the parts of the body and the creation of disease is the production of a state of things at variance with this natural order 
 true 
 and is not the creation of justice the institution of a natural order and government of one by another in the parts of the soul and the creation of injustice the production of a state of things at variance with the natural order 
 exactly so he said 
 then virtue is the health and beauty and of the soul and vice the disease and weakness and deformity of the same 
 true 
 and do not good practices lead to virtue and evil practices to vice 
 assuredly 
 still our old question of the comparative advantage of justice and injustice has not been answered which is the more profitable to be just and act justly and practise virtue whether seen or unseen of gods and men or to be unjust and act unjustly if only unpunished and unreformed 
 in my judgment socrates the question has now become ridiculous we know that when the bodily constitution is gone life is no longer endurable though pampered with all kinds of meats and drinks and having all wealth and all power and shall we be told that when the very essence of the vital principle is undermined and corrupted life is still worth having to a man if only he be allowed to do whatever he likes with the single exception that he is not to acquire justice and virtue or to escape from injustice and vice assuming them both to be such as we have described 
 yes i said the question is as you say ridiculous still as we are near the spot at which we may see the truth in the clearest manner with our own eyes let us not faint by the way 
 certainly not he replied 
 come up hither i said and behold the various forms of vice those of them i mean which are worth looking at 
 i am following you he replied proceed 
 i said the argument seems to have reached a height from which as from some tower of speculation a man may look down and see that virtue is one but that the forms of vice are innumerable there being four special ones which are deserving of note 
 what do you mean he said 
 i mean i replied that there appear to be as many forms of the soul as there are distinct forms of the state 
 how many 
 there are five of the state and five of the soul i said 
 what are they 
 the first i said is that which we have been describing and which may be said to have two names monarchy and aristocracy accordingly as rule is exercised by one distinguished man or by many 
 true he replied 
 but i regard the two names as describing one form only for whether the government is in the hands of one or many if the governors have been trained in the manner which we have supposed the fundamental laws of the state will be maintained 
 that is true he replied
