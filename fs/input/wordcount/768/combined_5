 book one 
 chapter i 
 
 well prince so genoa and lucca are now just family estates of the buonapartes but i warn you if you tell me that this means war if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that antichrist i really believe he is antichrist i will have nothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend no longer my faithful slave as you call yourself but how do you do i see i have frightened you sit down and tell me all the news 
 it was in july and the speaker was the anna pavlovna scherer maid of honor and favorite of the empress marya fedorovna with these words she greeted prince vasili kuragin a man of high rank and importance who was the first to arrive at her reception anna pavlovna had had a cough for some days she was as she said suffering from la grippe grippe being then a new word in st petersburg used only by the elite 
 all her invitations without exception written in french and delivered by a footman that morning ran as follows 
 if you have nothing better to do count or prince and if the prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible i shall be very charmed to see you tonight between and annette scherer 
 heavens what a virulent attack replied the prince not in the least disconcerted by this reception he had just entered wearing an embroidered court uniform knee breeches and shoes and had stars on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face he spoke in that refined french in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought and with the gentle patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance who had grown old in society and at court he went up to anna pavlovna kissed her hand presenting to her his bald scented and shining head and complacently seated himself on the sofa 
 first of all dear friend tell me how you are set your mind at rest said he without altering his tone beneath the politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be discerned 
 can one be well while suffering morally can one be calm in times like these if one has any feeling said anna pavlovna you are staying the whole evening i hope 
 and the fete at the english today is wednesday i must put in an appearance there said the prince my daughter is coming for me to take me there 
 i thought fete had been canceled i confess all these festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome 
 if they had known that you wished it the entertainment would have been put off said the prince who like a clock by force of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed 
 tease well and what has been decided about dispatch you know everything 
 what can one say about it replied the prince in a cold listless tone what has been decided they have decided that buonaparte has burnt his boats and i believe that we are ready to burn ours 
 prince vasili always spoke languidly like an actor repeating a stale part anna pavlovna scherer on the contrary despite her forty years overflowed with animation and impulsiveness to be an enthusiast had become her social vocation and sometimes even when she did not feel like it she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the expectations of those who knew her the subdued smile which though it did not suit her faded features always played round her lips expressed as in a spoiled child a continual consciousness of her charming defect which she neither wished nor could nor considered it necessary to correct 
 in the midst of a conversation on political matters anna pavlovna burst out 
 oh speak to me of austria perhaps i understand things but austria never has wished and does not wish for war she is betraying us russia alone must save europe our gracious sovereign recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it that is the one thing i have faith in our good and wonderful sovereign has to perform the noblest role on earth and he is so virtuous and noble that god will not forsake him he will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra of revolution which has become more terrible than ever in the person of this murderer and villain we alone must avenge the blood of the just one whom i ask you can we rely on england with her commercial spirit will not and cannot understand the emperor loftiness of soul she has refused to evacuate malta she wanted to find and still seeks some secret motive in our actions what answer did novosiltsev get none the english have not understood and cannot understand the of our emperor who wants nothing for himself but only desires the good of mankind and what have they promised nothing and what little they have promised they will not perform prussia has always declared that buonaparte is invincible and that all europe is powerless before him and i believe a word that hardenburg says or haugwitz either this famous prussian neutrality is just a trap i have faith only in god and the lofty destiny of our adored monarch he will save europe 
 she suddenly paused smiling at her own impetuosity 
 i think said the prince with a smile that if you had been sent instead of our dear wintzingerode you would have captured the king of consent by assault you are so eloquent will you give me a cup of tea 
 in a moment a propos she added becoming calm again i am expecting two very interesting men tonight le vicomte de mortemart who is connected with the montmorencys through the rohans one of the best french families he is one of the genuine emigres the good ones and also the abbe morio do you know that profound thinker he has been received by the emperor had you heard 
 i shall be delighted to meet them said the prince but tell me he added with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurred to him though the question he was about to ask was the chief motive of his visit is it true that the dowager empress wants baron funke to be appointed first secretary at vienna the baron by all accounts is a poor creature 
 prince vasili wished to obtain this post for his son but others were trying through the dowager empress marya fedorovna to secure it for the baron 
 anna pavlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor anyone else had a right to criticize what the empress desired or was pleased with 
 baron funke has been recommended to the dowager empress by her sister was all she said in a dry and mournful tone 
 as she named the empress anna face suddenly assumed an expression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with sadness and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious patroness she added that her majesty had deigned to show baron funke beaucoup and again her face clouded over with sadness 
 the prince was silent and looked indifferent but with the womanly and courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her anna pavlovna wished both to rebuke him for daring to speak he had done of a man recommended to the empress and at the same time to console him so she said 
 now about your family do you know that since your daughter came out everyone has been enraptured by her they say she is amazingly beautiful 
 the prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude 
 i often think she continued after a short pause drawing nearer to the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political and social topics were ended and the time had come for intimate conversation i often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life are distributed why has fate given you two such splendid children i speak of anatole your youngest i like him she added in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows two such charming children and really you appreciate them less than anyone and so you deserve to have them 
 and she smiled her ecstatic smile 
 i help it said the prince lavater would have said i lack the bump of paternity 
 joke i mean to have a serious talk with you do you know i am dissatisfied with your younger son between ourselves and her face assumed its melancholy expression he was mentioned at her and you were pitied 
 the prince answered nothing but she looked at him significantly awaiting a reply he frowned 
 what would you have me do he said at last you know i did all a father could for their education and they have both turned out fools hippolyte is at least a quiet fool but anatole is an active one that is the only difference between them he said this smiling in a way more natural and animated than usual so that the wrinkles round his mouth very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse and unpleasant 
 and why are children born to such men as you if you were not a father there would be nothing i could reproach you with said anna pavlovna looking up pensively 
 i am your faithful slave and to you alone i can confess that my children are the bane of my life it is the cross i have to bear that is how i explain it to myself it be helped 
 he said no more but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a gesture anna pavlovna meditated 
 have you never thought of marrying your prodigal son anatole she asked they say old maids have a mania for matchmaking and though i feel that weakness in myself as know a little person who is very unhappy with her father she is a relation of yours princess mary bolkonskaya 
 prince vasili did not reply though with the quickness of memory and perception befitting a man of the world he indicated by a movement of the head that he was considering this information 
 do you know he said at last evidently unable to check the sad current of his thoughts that anatole is costing me forty thousand rubles a year and he went on after a pause what will it be in five years if he goes on like this presently he added what we fathers have to put up with is this princess of yours rich 
 her father is very rich and stingy he lives in the country he is the prince bolkonski who had to retire from the army under the late emperor and was nicknamed the king of prussia he is very clever but eccentric and a bore the poor girl is very unhappy she has a brother i think you know him he married lise meinen lately he is an of and will be here tonight 
 listen dear annette said the prince suddenly taking anna hand and for some reason drawing it downwards arrange that affair for me and i shall always be your most devoted slave slafe wigh an f as a village elder of mine writes in his reports she is rich and of good family and all i want 
 and with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him he raised the maid of hand to his lips kissed it and swung it to and fro as he lay back in his armchair looking in another direction 
 attendez said anna pavlovna reflecting speak to lise young wife this very evening and perhaps the thing can be arranged it shall be on your behalf that start my apprenticeship as old maid

 first of all dear friend tell me how you are set your mind at rest said he without altering his tone beneath the politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be discerned 
 can one be well while suffering morally can one be calm in times like these if one has any feeling said anna pavlovna you are staying the whole evening i hope 
 and the fete at the english today is wednesday i must put in an appearance there said the prince my daughter is coming for me to take me there 
 i thought fete had been canceled i confess all these festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome 
 if they had known that you wished it the entertainment would have been put off said the prince who like a clock by force of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed 
 tease well and what has been decided about dispatch you know everything 
 what can one say about it replied the prince in a cold listless tone what has been decided they have decided that buonaparte has burnt his boats and i believe that we are ready to burn ours 
 prince vasili always spoke languidly like an actor repeating a stale part anna pavlovna scherer on the contrary despite her forty years overflowed with animation and impulsiveness to be an enthusiast had become her social vocation and sometimes even when she did not feel like it she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the expectations of those who knew her the subdued smile which though it did not suit her faded features always played round her lips expressed as in a spoiled child a continual consciousness of her charming defect which she neither wished nor could nor considered it necessary to correct 
 in the midst of a conversation on political matters anna pavlovna burst out 
 oh speak to me of austria perhaps i understand things but austria never has wished and does not wish for war she is betraying us russia alone must save europe our gracious sovereign recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it that is the one thing i have faith in our good and wonderful sovereign has to perform the noblest role on earth and he is so virtuous and noble that god will not forsake him he will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra of revolution which has become more terrible than ever in the person of this murderer and villain we alone must avenge the blood of the just one whom i ask you can we rely on england with her commercial spirit will not and cannot understand the emperor loftiness of soul she has refused to evacuate malta she wanted to find and still seeks some secret motive in our actions what answer did novosiltsev get none the english have not understood and cannot understand the of our emperor who wants nothing for himself but only desires the good of mankind and what have they promised nothing and what little they have promised they will not perform prussia has always declared that buonaparte is invincible and that all europe is powerless before him and i believe a word that hardenburg says or haugwitz either this famous prussian neutrality is just a trap i have faith only in god and the lofty destiny of our adored monarch he will save europe 
 she suddenly paused smiling at her own impetuosity 
 i think said the prince with a smile that if you had been sent instead of our dear wintzingerode you would have captured the king of consent by assault you are so eloquent will you give me a cup of tea 
 in a moment a propos she added becoming calm again i am expecting two very interesting men tonight le vicomte de mortemart who is connected with the montmorencys through the rohans one of the best french families he is one of the genuine emigres the good ones and also the abbe morio do you know that profound thinker he has been received by the emperor had you heard 
 i shall be delighted to meet them said the prince but tell me he added with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurred to him though the question he was about to ask was the chief motive of his visit is it true that the dowager empress wants baron funke to be appointed first secretary at vienna the baron by all accounts is a poor creature 
 prince vasili wished to obtain this post for his son but others were trying through the dowager empress marya fedorovna to secure it for the baron 
 anna pavlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor anyone else had a right to criticize what the empress desired or was pleased with 
 baron funke has been recommended to the dowager empress by her sister was all she said in a dry and mournful tone 
 as she named the empress anna face suddenly assumed an expression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with sadness and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious patroness she added that her majesty had deigned to show baron funke beaucoup and again her face clouded over with sadness 
 the prince was silent and looked indifferent but with the womanly and courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her anna pavlovna wished both to rebuke him for daring to speak he had done of a man recommended to the empress and at the same time to console him so she said 
 now about your family do you know that since your daughter came out everyone has been enraptured by her they say she is amazingly beautiful 
 the prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude 
 i often think she continued after a short pause drawing nearer to the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political and social topics were ended and the time had come for intimate conversation i often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life are distributed why has fate given you two such splendid children i speak of anatole your youngest i like him she added in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows two such charming children and really you appreciate them less than anyone and so you deserve to have them 
 and she smiled her ecstatic smile 
 i help it said the prince lavater would have said i lack the bump of paternity 
 joke i mean to have a serious talk with you do you know i am dissatisfied with your younger son between ourselves and her face assumed its melancholy expression he was mentioned at her and you were pitied 
 the prince answered nothing but she looked at him significantly awaiting a reply he frowned 
 what would you have me do he said at last you know i did all a father could for their education and they have both turned out fools hippolyte is at least a quiet fool but anatole is an active one that is the only difference between them he said this smiling in a way more natural and animated than usual so that the wrinkles round his mouth very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse and unpleasant 
 and why are children born to such men as you if you were not a father there would be nothing i could reproach you with said anna pavlovna looking up pensively 
 i am your faithful slave and to you alone i can confess that my children are the bane of my life it is the cross i have to bear that is how i explain it to myself it be helped 
 he said no more but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a gesture anna pavlovna meditated 
 have you never thought of marrying your prodigal son anatole she asked they say old maids have a mania for matchmaking and though i feel that weakness in myself as know a little person who is very unhappy with her father she is a relation of yours princess mary bolkonskaya 
 prince vasili did not reply though with the quickness of memory and perception befitting a man of the world he indicated by a movement of the head that he was considering this information 
 do you know he said at last evidently unable to check the sad current of his thoughts that anatole is costing me forty thousand rubles a year and he went on after a pause what will it be in five years if he goes on like this presently he added what we fathers have to put up with is this princess of yours rich 
 her father is very rich and stingy he lives in the country he is the prince bolkonski who had to retire from the army under the late emperor and was nicknamed the king of prussia he is very clever but eccentric and a bore the poor girl is very unhappy she has a brother i think you know him he married lise meinen lately he is an of and will be here tonight 
 listen dear annette said the prince suddenly taking anna hand and for some reason drawing it downwards arrange that affair for me and i shall always be your most devoted slave slafe wigh an f as a village elder of mine writes in his reports she is rich and of good family and all i want 
 and with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him he raised the maid of hand to his lips kissed it and swung it to and fro as he lay back in his armchair looking in another direction 
 attendez said anna pavlovna reflecting speak to lise young wife this very evening and perhaps the thing can be arranged it shall be on your behalf that start my apprenticeship as old maid

 i have just returned from a visit to my solitary neighbour that i shall be troubled with this is certainly a beautiful country in all england i do not believe that i could have fixed on a situation so completely removed from the stir of society a perfect heaven and mr heathcliff and i are such a suitable pair to divide the desolation between us a capital fellow he little imagined how my heart warmed towards him when i beheld his black eyes withdraw so suspiciously under their brows as i rode up and when his fingers sheltered themselves with a jealous resolution still farther in his waistcoat as i announced my name 
 mr heathcliff i said 
 a nod was the answer 
 mr lockwood your new tenant sir i do myself the honour of calling as soon as possible after my arrival to express the hope that i have not inconvenienced you by my perseverance in soliciting the occupation of thrushcross grange i heard yesterday you had had some thoughts 
 thrushcross grange is my own sir he interrupted wincing i should not allow anyone to inconvenience me if i could hinder in 
 the walk in was uttered with closed teeth and expressed the sentiment go to the deuce even the gate over which he leant manifested no sympathizing movement to the words and i think that circumstance determined me to accept the invitation i felt interested in a man who seemed more exaggeratedly reserved than myself 
 when he saw my breast fairly pushing the barrier he did put out his hand to unchain it and then sullenly preceded me up the causeway calling as we entered the court joseph take mr horse and bring up some wine 
 here we have the whole establishment of domestics i suppose was the reflection suggested by this compound order 
 no wonder the grass grows up between the flags and cattle are the only 
 joseph was an elderly nay an old man very old perhaps though hale and sinewy the lord help us he soliloquized in an undertone of peevish displeasure while relieving me of my horse looking meantime in my face so sourly that i charitably conjectured he must have need of divine aid to digest his dinner and his pious ejaculation had no reference to my unexpected advent 
 wuthering heights is the name of mr dwelling wuthering being a significant provincial adjective descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather pure bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times indeed one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way as if craving alms of the sun happily the architect had foresight to build it strong the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall and the corners defended with large jutting stones 
 before passing the threshold i paused to admire a quantity of grotesque carving lavished over the front and especially about the principal door above which among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless little boys i detected the date and the name hareton earnshaw i would have made a few comments and requested a short history of the place from the surly owner but his attitude at the door appeared to demand my speedy entrance or complete departure and i had no desire to aggravate his impatience previous to inspecting the penetralium 
 one step brought us into the family without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house preeminently it includes kitchen and parlour generally but i believe at wuthering heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least i distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and i observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls one end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof the latter had never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge the floor was of smooth white stone the chairs primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade in an arch under the dresser reposed a huge bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other dogs haunted other recesses 
 the apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as belonging to a homely northern farmer with a stubborn countenance and stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee breeches and gaiters such an individual seated in his armchair his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills if you go at the right time after dinner but mr heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living he is a gipsy in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly perhaps yet not looking amiss with his negligence because he has an erect and handsome figure and rather morose possibly some people might suspect him of a degree of pride i have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort i know by instinct his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of manifestations of mutual kindliness love and hate equally under cover and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again no running on too fast i bestow my own attributes over liberally on him mr heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a acquaintance to those which actuate me let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar my dear mother used to say i should never have a comfortable home and only last summer i proved myself perfectly unworthy of one 
 while enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea coast i was thrown into the company of a most fascinating creature a real goddess in my eyes as long as she took no notice of me i never told my love vocally still if looks have language the merest idiot might have guessed i was over head and ears she understood me at last and looked a sweetest of all imaginable looks and what did i do i confess it with icily into myself like a snail at every glance retired colder and further till finally the poor innocent was led to doubt her own senses and overwhelmed with confusion at her supposed mistake persuaded her mamma to decamp by this curious turn of disposition i have gained the reputation of deliberate heartlessness how undeserved i alone can appreciate 
 i took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which my landlord advanced and filled up an interval of silence by attempting to caress the canine mother who had left her nursery and was sneaking wolfishly to the back of my legs her lip curled up and her white teeth watering for a snatch my caress provoked a long guttural gnarl 
 better let the dog alone growled mr heathcliff in unison checking fiercer demonstrations with a punch of his foot not accustomed to be kept for a pet then striding to a side door he shouted again joseph 
 joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar but gave no intimation of ascending so his master dived down to him leaving me the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements not anxious to come in contact with their fangs i sat still but imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults i unfortunately indulged in winking and making faces at the trio and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees i flung her back and hastened to interpose the table between us this proceeding roused the whole hive half a dozen fiends of various sizes and ages issued from hidden dens to the common centre i felt my heels and peculiar subjects of assault and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as i could with the poker i was constrained to demand aloud assistance from some of the household in peace 
 mr heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious phlegm i think they moved one second faster than usual though the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping happily an inhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch a lusty dame with gown bare arms and cheeks rushed into the midst of us flourishing a and used that weapon and her tongue to such purpose that the storm subsided magically and she only remained heaving like a sea after a high wind when her master entered on the scene

 chapter one 
 
 christmas be christmas without any presents grumbled jo lying on the rug 
 so dreadful to be poor sighed meg looking down at her old dress 
 i think fair for some girls to have plenty of pretty things and other girls nothing at all added little amy with an injured got father and mother and each other said beth contentedly from her corner 
 the four young faces on which the firelight shone brightened at the cheerful words but darkened again as jo said sadly we got father and shall not have him for a long time she say perhaps never but each silently added it thinking of father far away where the fighting was 
 nobody spoke for a minute then meg said in an altered tone you know the reason mother proposed not having any presents this christmas was because it is going to be a hard winter for everyone and she thinks we ought not to spend money for pleasure when our men are suffering so in the army we do much but we can make our little sacrifices and ought to do it gladly but i am afraid i and meg shook her head as she thought regretfully of all the pretty things she wanted 
 but i think the little we should spend would do any good each got a dollar and the army be much helped by our giving that i agree not to expect anything from mother or you but i do want to buy undine and sintram for myself wanted it so long said jo who was a bookworm 
 i planned to spend mine in new music said beth with a little sigh which no one heard but the hearth brush and kettle holder 
 i shall get a nice box of drawing pencils i really need them said amy decidedly 
 mother say anything about our money and she wish us to give up everything each buy what we want and have a little fun sure we work hard enough to earn it cried jo examining the heels of her shoes in a gentlemanly manner 
 i know i those tiresome children nearly all day when longing to enjoy myself at home began meg in the complaining tone again 
 you have half such a hard time as i do said jo how would you like to be shut up for hours with a nervous fussy old lady who keeps you trotting is never satisfied and worries you till you ready to fly out the window or cry 
 naughty to fret but i do think washing dishes and keeping things tidy is the worst work in the world it makes me cross and my hands get so stiff i practice well at all and beth looked at her rough hands with a sigh that any one could hear that time 
 i believe any of you suffer as i do cried amy for you have to go to school with impertinent girls who plague you if you know your lessons and laugh at your dresses and label your father if he rich and insult you when your nose nice 
 if you mean libel say so and not talk about labels as if papa was a pickle bottle advised jo laughing 
 i know what i mean and you be statirical about it proper to use good words and improve your vocabilary returned amy with dignity 
 peck at one another children you wish we had the money papa lost when we were little jo dear me how happy and good be if we had no worries said meg who could remember better times 
 you said the other day you thought we were a deal happier than the king children for they were fighting and fretting all the time in spite of their money 
 so i did beth well i think we are for though we do have to work we make fun of ourselves and are a pretty jolly set as jo would say 
 jo does use such slang words observed amy with a reproving look at the long figure stretched on the rug 
 o immediately sat up put her hands in her pockets and began to whistle 
 jo so boyish 
 why i do it 
 i detest rude unladylike girls 
 i hate affected chits 
 birds in their little nests agree sang beth the peacemaker with such a funny face that both sharp voices softened to a laugh and the pecking ended for that time 
 really girls you are both to be blamed said meg beginning to lecture in her are old enough to leave off boyish tricks and to behave better josephine it matter so much when you were a little girl but now you are so tall and turn up your hair you should remember that you are a young lady 
 not and if turning up my hair makes me one wear it in two tails till twenty cried jo pulling off her net and shaking down a chestnut mane i hate to think got to grow up and be miss march and wear long gowns and look as prim as a china aster bad enough to be a girl anyway when i like games and work and manners i get over my disappointment in not being a boy and worse than ever now for dying to go and fight with papa and i can only stay home and knit like a poky old woman 
 and jo shook the blue army sock till the needles rattled like castanets and her ball bounded across the room 
 poor jo too bad but it be helped so you must try to be contented with making your name boyish and playing brother to us girls said beth stroking the rough head with a hand that all the dish washing and dusting in the world could not make ungentle in its touch 
 as for you amy continued meg you are altogether to particular and prim your airs are funny now but grow up an affected little goose if you take care i i like your nice manners and refined ways of speaking when you try to be elegant but your absurd words are as bad as slang 
 if jo is a tomboy and amy a goose what am i please asked beth ready to share the lecture 
 a dear and nothing else answered meg warmly and no one contradicted her for the mouse was the pet of the family 
 as young readers like to know how people look we will take this moment to give them a little sketch of the four sisters who sat knitting away in the twilight while the december snow fell quietly without and the fire crackled cheerfully within it was a comfortable room though the carpet was faded and the furniture very plain for a good picture or two hung on the walls books filled the recesses chrysanthemums and christmas roses bloomed in the windows and a pleasant atmosphere of home peace pervaded it 
 margaret the eldest of the four was sixteen and very pretty being plump and fair with large eyes plenty of soft brown hair a sweet mouth and white hands of which she was rather vain fifteen jo was very tall thin and brown and reminded one of a colt for she never seemed to know what to do with her long limbs which were very much in her way she had a decided mouth a comical nose and sharp gray eyes which appeared to see everything and were by turns fierce funny or thoughtful her long thick hair was her one beauty but it was usually bundled into a net to be out of her way round shoulders had jo big hands and feet a flyaway look to her clothes and the uncomfortable appearance of a girl who was rapidly shooting up into a woman and like it elizabeth or beth as everyone called her was a rosy smooth haired girl of thirteen with a shy manner a timid voice and a peaceful expression which was seldom disturbed her father called her little miss tranquility and the name suited her excellently for she seemed to live in a happy world of her own only venturing out to meet the few whom she trusted and loved amy though the youngest was a most important person in her own opinion at least a regular snow maiden with blue eyes and yellow hair curling on her shoulders pale and slender and always carrying herself like a young lady mindful of her manners what the characters of the four sisters were we will leave to be found out 
 the clock struck six and having swept up the hearth beth put a pair of slippers down to warm somehow the sight of the old shoes had a good effect upon the girls for mother was coming and everyone brightened to welcome her meg stopped lecturing and lighted the lamp amy got out of the easy chair without being asked and jo forgot how tired she was as she sat up to hold the slippers nearer to the blaze 
 they are quite worn out marmee must have a new pair 
 i thought get her some with my dollar said beth 
 no i shall cried amy 
 the oldest began meg but jo cut in with a decided the man of the family now papa is away and i shall provide the slippers for he told me to take special care of mother while he was gone 
 tell you what do said beth each get her something for christmas land not get anything for ourselves 
 like you dear what will we get exclaimed jo 
 everyone thought soberly for a minute then meg announced as if the idea was suggested by the sight of her own pretty hands i shall give her a nice pair of gloves 
 army shoes best to be had cried jo some handkerchiefs all hemmed said beth 
 get a little bottle of cologne she likes it and it cost much so have some left to buy my pencils added amy 
 how will we give the things asked meg 
 put them on the table and bring her in and see her open the bundles you remember how we used to do on our birthdays answered jo 
 i used to be so frightened when it was my turn to sit in the chair with the crown on and see you all come marching round to give the presents with a kiss i liked the things and the kisses but it was dreadful to have you sit looking at me while i opened the bundles said beth who was toasting her face and the bread for tea at the same time 
 let marmee think we are getting things for ourselves and then surprise her we must go shopping tomorrow afternoon meg there is so much to do about the play for christmas night said jo marching up and down with her hands behind her back and her nose in the air 
 i mean to act any more after this time getting too old for such things observed meg who was as much a child as ever about frolics 
 you stop i know as long as you can trail round in a white gown with your hair down and wear jewelryyou are the best actress got and be an end of everything if you quit the boards said jo we ought to rehearse tonight come here amy and do the fainting scene for you are as stiff as a poker in that 
 i help it i never saw anyone faint and i choose to make myself all black and blue tumbling flat as you do if i can go down easily drop if i i shall fall into a chair and be graceful i care if hugo does come at me with a pistol returned amy who was not gifted with dramatic power but was chosen because she was small enough to be borne out shrieking by the villain of the piece 
 do it this way clasp your hands so and stagger across the room crying frantically roderigo save me save me and away went jo with a melodramatic scream which was truly thrilling 
 amy followed but she poked her hands out stiffly before her and jerked herself along as if she went by machinery and her ow was more suggestive of pins being run into her than of fear and anguish jo gave a despairing groan and meg laughed outright while beth let her bread burn as she watched the fun with interest no use do the best you can when the time comes and if the audience laughs blame me come on meg 
 then things went smoothly for don pedro defied the world in a speech of two pages without a single break hagar the witch chanted an awful incantation over her kettleful of simmering toads with weird effect roderigo rent his chains asunder manfully and hugo died in agonies of remorse and arsenic with a wild ha ha 
 the best had yet said meg as the dead villain sat up and rubbed his elbows 
 i see how you can write and act such splendid things jo a regular shakespeare exclaimed beth who firmly believed that her sisters were gifted with wonderful genius in all things 
 not quite replied jo modestly i do think the witches curse an operatic tragedy is rather a nice thing but like to try mcbeth if we only had a trapdoor for banquo i always wanted to do the killing part is that a dagger that i see before me muttered jo rolling her eyes and clutching at the air as she had seen a famous tragedian do 
 no the toasting fork with shoe on it instead of the bread cried meg and the rehearsal ended in a general burst of laughter 
 glad to find you so merry my girls said a cheery voice at the door and actors and audience turned to welcome a tall motherly lady with a can i help you look about her which was truly delightful she was not elegantly dressed but a woman and the girls thought the gray cloak and unfashionable bonnet covered the most splendid mother in the world 
 well dearies how have you got on today there was so much to do getting the boxes ready to go tomorrow that i come home to dinner has anyone called beth how is your cold meg jo you look tired to death come and kiss me baby 
 while making these maternal inquiries mrs march got her wet things off her warm slippers on and sitting down in the easy chair drew amy to her lap preparing to enjoy the happiest hour of her busy day the girls flew about trying to make things comfortable each in her own way meg arranged the tea table jo brought wood and set chairs dropping and clattering everything she touched beth trotted to and fro between parlor kitchen quiet and busy while amy gave directions to everyone as she sat with her hands folded 
 as they gathered about the table mrs march said with a particularly happy face got a treat for you after supper 
 a quick bright smile went round like a streak of sunshine beth clapped her hands regardless of the biscuit she held and jo tossed up her napkin crying a letter a letter three cheers for father 
 yes a nice long letter he is well and thinks he shall get through the cold season better than we feared he sends all sorts of loving wishes for christmas and an especial message to you girls said mrs march patting her pocket as if she had got a treasure there 
 hurry and get done stop to quirk your little finger and simper over your plate amy cried jo choking on her tea and dropping her bread butter side down on the carpet in her haste to get at the treat 
 beth ate no more but crept away to sit in her shadowy corner and brood over the delight to come till the others were ready 
 i think it was so splendid in father to go as chaplain when he was too old to be drafted and not strong enough for a soldier said meg warmly 
 i wish i could go as a drummer a its name or a nurse so i could be near him and help him exclaimed jo with a groan 
 it must be very disagreeable to sleep in a tent and eat all sorts of things and drink out of a tin mug sighed amy 
 when will he come home marmee asked beth with a little quiver in her voice 
 not for many months dear unless he is sick he will stay and do his work faithfully as long as he can and we ask for him back a minute sooner than he can be spared now come and hear the letter 
 they all drew to the fire mother in the big chair with beth at her feet meg and amy perched on either arm of the chair and jo leaning on the back where no one would see any sign of emotion if the letter should happen to be touching very few letters were written in those hard times that were not touching especially those which fathers sent home in this one little was said of the hardships endured the dangers faced or the homesickness conquered it was a cheerful hopeful letter full of lively descriptions of camp life marches and military news and only at the end did the heart with fatherly love and longing for the little girls at home 
 give them all of my dear love and a kiss tell them i think of them by day pray for them by night and find my best comfort in their affection at all times a year seems very long to wait before i see them but remind them that while we wait we may all work so that these hard days need not be wasted i know they will remember all i said to them that they will be loving children to you will do their duty faithfully fight their bosom enemies bravely and conquer themselves so beautifully that when i come back to them i may be fonder and prouder than ever of my little women everybody sniffed when they came to that part jo ashamed of the great tear that dropped off the end of her nose and amy never minded the rumpling of her curls as she hid her face on her shoulder and sobbed out i am a selfish girl but truly try to be better so he be disappointed in me 
 we all will cried meg i think too much of my looks and hate to work but any more if i can help it 
 try and be what he loves to call me a little woman and not be rough and wild but do my duty here instead of wanting to be somewhere else said jo thinking that keeping her temper at home was a much harder task than facing a rebel or two down south 
 beth said nothing but wiped away her tears with the blue army sock and began to knit with all her might losing no time in doing the duty that lay nearest her while she resolved in her quiet little soul to be all that father hoped to find her when the year brought round the happy coming home 
 mrs march broke the silence that followed words by saying in her cheery voice do you remember how you used to play pilgrims progress when you were little things nothing delighted you more than to have me tie my piece bags on your backs for burdens give you hats and sticks and rolls of paper and let you travel through the house from the cellar which was the city of destruction up up to the housetop where you had all the lovely things you could collect to make a celestial city 
 what fun it was especially going by the lions fighting apollyon and passing through the valley where the were said jo 
 i liked the place where the bundles fell off and tumbled downstairs said meg 
 i remember much about it except that i was afraid of the cellar and the dark entry and always liked the cake and milk we had up at the top if i too old for such things rather like to play it over again said amy who began to talk of renouncing childish things at the mature age of twelve 
 we never are too old for this my dear because it is a play we are playing all the time in one way or another out burdens are here our road is before us and the longing for goodness and happiness is the guide that leads us through many troubles and mistakes to the peace which is a true celestial city now my little pilgrims suppose you begin again not in play but in earnest and see how far on you can get before father comes home 
 really mother where are our bundles asked amy who was a very literal young lady 
 each of you told what your burden was just now except beth i rather think she got any said her mother 
 yes i have mine is dishes and dusters and envying girls with nice pianos and being afraid of people 
 bundle was such a funny one that everybody wanted to laugh but nobody did for it would have hurt her feelings very much 
 let us do it said meg thoughtfully it is only another name for trying to be good and the story may help us for though we do want to be good hard work and we forget and do our best 
 we were in the slough of despond tonight and mother came and pulled us out as help did in the book we ought to have our roll of directions like christian what shall we do about that asked jo delighted with the fancy which lent a little romance to the very dull task of doing her duty 
 look under your pillows christmas morning and you will find your guidebook replied mrs march 
 they talked over the new plan while old hannah cleared the table then out came the four little work baskets and the needles flew as the girls made sheets for aunt march it was uninteresting sewing but tonight no one grumbled they adopted plan of dividing the long seams into four parts and calling the quarters europe asia africa and america and in that way got on capitally especially when they talked about the different countries as they stitched their way through them 
 at nine they stopped work and sang as usual before they went to bed no one but beth could get much music out of the old piano but she had a way of softly touching the yellow keys and making a pleasant accompaniment to the simple songs they sang meg had a voice like a flute and she and herr mother led the little choir amy chirped like a cricket and jo wandered through the airs at her own sweet will always coming out at the wrong place with a croak or a quaver that spoiled the most pensive tune they had always done this from the time they could lisp 
 crinkle crinkle ittle tar and it had become a household custom for the mother was a born singer the first sound in the morning was her voice as she went about the house singing like a lark and the last sound at night was the same cheery sound for the girls never grew too old for that familiar lullaby

 chapter one 
 
 christmas be christmas without any presents grumbled jo lying on the rug 
 so dreadful to be poor sighed meg looking down at her old dress 
 i think fair for some girls to have plenty of pretty things and other girls nothing at all added little amy with an injured got father and mother and each other said beth contentedly from her corner 
 the four young faces on which the firelight shone brightened at the cheerful words but darkened again as jo said sadly we got father and shall not have him for a long time she say perhaps never but each silently added it thinking of father far away where the fighting was 
 nobody spoke for a minute then meg said in an altered tone you know the reason mother proposed not having any presents this christmas was because it is going to be a hard winter for everyone and she thinks we ought not to spend money for pleasure when our men are suffering so in the army we do much but we can make our little sacrifices and ought to do it gladly but i am afraid i and meg shook her head as she thought regretfully of all the pretty things she wanted 
 but i think the little we should spend would do any good each got a dollar and the army be much helped by our giving that i agree not to expect anything from mother or you but i do want to buy undine and sintram for myself wanted it so long said jo who was a bookworm 
 i planned to spend mine in new music said beth with a little sigh which no one heard but the hearth brush and kettle holder 
 i shall get a nice box of drawing pencils i really need them said amy decidedly 
 mother say anything about our money and she wish us to give up everything each buy what we want and have a little fun sure we work hard enough to earn it cried jo examining the heels of her shoes in a gentlemanly manner 
 i know i those tiresome children nearly all day when longing to enjoy myself at home began meg in the complaining tone again 
 you have half such a hard time as i do said jo how would you like to be shut up for hours with a nervous fussy old lady who keeps you trotting is never satisfied and worries you till you ready to fly out the window or cry 
 naughty to fret but i do think washing dishes and keeping things tidy is the worst work in the world it makes me cross and my hands get so stiff i practice well at all and beth looked at her rough hands with a sigh that any one could hear that time 
 i believe any of you suffer as i do cried amy for you have to go to school with impertinent girls who plague you if you know your lessons and laugh at your dresses and label your father if he rich and insult you when your nose nice 
 if you mean libel say so and not talk about labels as if papa was a pickle bottle advised jo laughing 
 i know what i mean and you be statirical about it proper to use good words and improve your vocabilary returned amy with dignity 
 peck at one another children you wish we had the money papa lost when we were little jo dear me how happy and good be if we had no worries said meg who could remember better times 
 you said the other day you thought we were a deal happier than the king children for they were fighting and fretting all the time in spite of their money 
 so i did beth well i think we are for though we do have to work we make fun of ourselves and are a pretty jolly set as jo would say 
 jo does use such slang words observed amy with a reproving look at the long figure stretched on the rug 
 o immediately sat up put her hands in her pockets and began to whistle 
 jo so boyish 
 why i do it 
 i detest rude unladylike girls 
 i hate affected chits 
 birds in their little nests agree sang beth the peacemaker with such a funny face that both sharp voices softened to a laugh and the pecking ended for that time 
 really girls you are both to be blamed said meg beginning to lecture in her are old enough to leave off boyish tricks and to behave better josephine it matter so much when you were a little girl but now you are so tall and turn up your hair you should remember that you are a young lady 
 not and if turning up my hair makes me one wear it in two tails till twenty cried jo pulling off her net and shaking down a chestnut mane i hate to think got to grow up and be miss march and wear long gowns and look as prim as a china aster bad enough to be a girl anyway when i like games and work and manners i get over my disappointment in not being a boy and worse than ever now for dying to go and fight with papa and i can only stay home and knit like a poky old woman 
 and jo shook the blue army sock till the needles rattled like castanets and her ball bounded across the room 
 poor jo too bad but it be helped so you must try to be contented with making your name boyish and playing brother to us girls said beth stroking the rough head with a hand that all the dish washing and dusting in the world could not make ungentle in its touch 
 as for you amy continued meg you are altogether to particular and prim your airs are funny now but grow up an affected little goose if you take care i i like your nice manners and refined ways of speaking when you try to be elegant but your absurd words are as bad as slang 
 if jo is a tomboy and amy a goose what am i please asked beth ready to share the lecture 
 a dear and nothing else answered meg warmly and no one contradicted her for the mouse was the pet of the family 
 as young readers like to know how people look we will take this moment to give them a little sketch of the four sisters who sat knitting away in the twilight while the december snow fell quietly without and the fire crackled cheerfully within it was a comfortable room though the carpet was faded and the furniture very plain for a good picture or two hung on the walls books filled the recesses chrysanthemums and christmas roses bloomed in the windows and a pleasant atmosphere of home peace pervaded it 
 margaret the eldest of the four was sixteen and very pretty being plump and fair with large eyes plenty of soft brown hair a sweet mouth and white hands of which she was rather vain fifteen jo was very tall thin and brown and reminded one of a colt for she never seemed to know what to do with her long limbs which were very much in her way she had a decided mouth a comical nose and sharp gray eyes which appeared to see everything and were by turns fierce funny or thoughtful her long thick hair was her one beauty but it was usually bundled into a net to be out of her way round shoulders had jo big hands and feet a flyaway look to her clothes and the uncomfortable appearance of a girl who was rapidly shooting up into a woman and like it elizabeth or beth as everyone called her was a rosy smooth haired girl of thirteen with a shy manner a timid voice and a peaceful expression which was seldom disturbed her father called her little miss tranquility and the name suited her excellently for she seemed to live in a happy world of her own only venturing out to meet the few whom she trusted and loved amy though the youngest was a most important person in her own opinion at least a regular snow maiden with blue eyes and yellow hair curling on her shoulders pale and slender and always carrying herself like a young lady mindful of her manners what the characters of the four sisters were we will leave to be found out 
 the clock struck six and having swept up the hearth beth put a pair of slippers down to warm somehow the sight of the old shoes had a good effect upon the girls for mother was coming and everyone brightened to welcome her meg stopped lecturing and lighted the lamp amy got out of the easy chair without being asked and jo forgot how tired she was as she sat up to hold the slippers nearer to the blaze 
 they are quite worn out marmee must have a new pair 
 i thought get her some with my dollar said beth 
 no i shall cried amy 
 the oldest began meg but jo cut in with a decided the man of the family now papa is away and i shall provide the slippers for he told me to take special care of mother while he was gone 
 tell you what do said beth each get her something for christmas land not get anything for ourselves 
 like you dear what will we get exclaimed jo 
 everyone thought soberly for a minute then meg announced as if the idea was suggested by the sight of her own pretty hands i shall give her a nice pair of gloves 
 army shoes best to be had cried jo some handkerchiefs all hemmed said beth 
 get a little bottle of cologne she likes it and it cost much so have some left to buy my pencils added amy 
 how will we give the things asked meg 
 put them on the table and bring her in and see her open the bundles you remember how we used to do on our birthdays answered jo

 let marmee think we are getting things for ourselves and then surprise her we must go shopping tomorrow afternoon meg there is so much to do about the play for christmas night said jo marching up and down with her hands behind her back and her nose in the air 
 i mean to act any more after this time getting too old for such things observed meg who was as much a child as ever about frolics 
 you stop i know as long as you can trail round in a white gown with your hair down and wear jewelryyou are the best actress got and be an end of everything if you quit the boards said jo we ought to rehearse tonight come here amy and do the fainting scene for you are as stiff as a poker in that 
 i help it i never saw anyone faint and i choose to make myself all black and blue tumbling flat as you do if i can go down easily drop if i i shall fall into a chair and be graceful i care if hugo does come at me with a pistol returned amy who was not gifted with dramatic power but was chosen because she was small enough to be borne out shrieking by the villain of the piece 
 do it this way clasp your hands so and stagger across the room crying frantically roderigo save me save me and away went jo with a melodramatic scream which was truly thrilling 
 amy followed but she poked her hands out stiffly before her and jerked herself along as if she went by machinery and her ow was more suggestive of pins being run into her than of fear and anguish jo gave a despairing groan and meg laughed outright while beth let her bread burn as she watched the fun with interest no use do the best you can when the time comes and if the audience laughs blame me come on meg 
 then things went smoothly for don pedro defied the world in a speech of two pages without a single break hagar the witch chanted an awful incantation over her kettleful of simmering toads with weird effect roderigo rent his chains asunder manfully and hugo died in agonies of remorse and arsenic with a wild ha ha 
 the best had yet said meg as the dead villain sat up and rubbed his elbows 
 i see how you can write and act such splendid things jo a regular shakespeare exclaimed beth who firmly believed that her sisters were gifted with wonderful genius in all things 
 not quite replied jo modestly i do think the witches curse an operatic tragedy is rather a nice thing but like to try mcbeth if we only had a trapdoor for banquo i always wanted to do the killing part is that a dagger that i see before me muttered jo rolling her eyes and clutching at the air as she had seen a famous tragedian do 
 no the toasting fork with shoe on it instead of the bread cried meg and the rehearsal ended in a general burst of laughter 
 glad to find you so merry my girls said a cheery voice at the door and actors and audience turned to welcome a tall motherly lady with a can i help you look about her which was truly delightful she was not elegantly dressed but a woman and the girls thought the gray cloak and unfashionable bonnet covered the most splendid mother in the world

 a quick bright smile went round like a streak of sunshine beth clapped her hands regardless of the biscuit she held and jo tossed up her napkin crying a letter a letter three cheers for father

 one last huge flash accompanied by a blast of wind and over 
 body now lies twisted on the ground 
 priests place the body into a stone sarcophagus the nubian 
 slaves lower it into a hole and bury it with sand imhotep then signals to 
 the soldiers who throw their spears at the nubians killing them 
 inhotep 
 
 the slaves were killed 
 priests attack the now unarmed soldiers hacking 
 at them in the flickering darkness as imhotep and the mumia solemnly 
 watches 
 imhotep 
 and the soldiers who killed them 
 were also slain so that no unholy person 
 should ever know the exact location of the 
 burial site 
 the mumia walk off across the sand and then one by one 
 the priests stop their frenzied stabbing and stare off at the 
 vanishing mumia as the last mumia disappears over a distant 
 dune imhotep nods and the priests leap onto 
 grave and begin digging it back up with their hands 
 ext sahara desert night 
 chariots race out into the moonlit desert imhotep leads the way a 
 hearse carries mummy the map of ancient egypt fades up 
 the chariots race across the map 
 imhotep 
 but there was another book the book 
 of the dead which was never opened 
 never to be read for it contained the 
 incantations that could bring a dead body 
 back to life a most unholy thing 
 the chariots arrive at a place marked on the map in hieratic they race up 
 the stone ramp and in through the city gates superimposed across the 
 screen are the words 
 kanunaptm city of the dead 
 imhotep 
 it was hidden at hamunaptra city of 
 the dead inside the statue of anubis so 
 that no such sacrilege might ever disgrace 
 egypt 
 ext hamunaptra anubis site night 
 imhotep pulls an ornate chest out of a secret compartment inside the giant 
 statue of anubis he opens the chest and lifts out the book of the dead 
 made of black stone 
 imhotep 
 but for my love of i 
 was willing to defy the gods 
 int underground necropolis night 
 big hairy rats scurry through the mausoleums and over the headstones of 
 this very large scary underground cemetery a detritus moat surrounds the 
 cemetery muck made out of filthy water and human remains skulls bob in 
 the goop the priests have gathered in a circle their hooded lifeless 
 eyes seem dead to this world their bald heads rock back and forth as they 
 chant a quiet eerie hum heinous creatures in the middle of the circle is 
 a strange twisted altar imhotep has unwrapped gorgeous 
 lifeless body and placed her five sacred canopic jars around her 
 imhotep 
 vital organs were 
 still fresh so a human sacrifice would not 
 need be made 
 as imhotep begins to read from the book of the dead a large swirling hole 
 starts to open in the detritus bog several priests look over at it 
 frightened then quickly look back down and resume chanting a strange mist 
 wafts up out of the swirling hole and over to the jars it passes through 
 them and into body one of the jars shudders the heart 
 inside begins to beat the chanting priests swirling hole wafting mist 
 beating heart and readings are reaching a crescendo 
 eyes suddenly fly open 
 imhotep 
 soul had come back from 
 the dead now all that was needed was to 
 return her organs to their rightful place 
 within her body 
 imhotep lifts a sacrificial knife above breast about to 
 plunge it down the chanting swirling and beating heart climax and 
 when the mumia burst in and storm through the startled priests the head 
 mumia smashes the jar with the beating heart the mist instantly sucks back 
 out of body and implodes back into the swirling hole 
 eyes close dying once again imhotep screams in rage the 
 mumia grab him and his priests 
 imhotep 
 my priests were condemned to be 
 mummified alive 
 int chamber necropolis night 
 inside a chamber imhotep is held by embalmers he 
 cringes at the flickering impressionistic glimpses of his priests being 
 embalmed and mummified alive the embalmers using knives 
 needles and thread calmly perform their ghastly surgery on the screaming 
 priests who are going insane from the procedure 
 a red hot poker is pulled out of a pit of burning coals 
 a head is wedged between two strong boards his eyes widen in 
 terror as an embalmer moves to insert the red hot poker up his nose but 
 just before he does we quickly cut to face horrified as off 
 camera the priest screams 
 we go wide on the chamber all of priests squirm 
 inside their wrappings imhotep is forced to his knees his arms are held 
 back his mouth is pried open 
 imhotep 
 as for me i was condemned to endure 
 the the worst of all ancient curses 
 one so horrible it had never before been 
 bestowed 
 using a pair of tongs an embalmer slowly pulls tongue out of his 
 mouth then places a very sharp knife on top of it tight on 
 eyes as his tongue is apparently cut out the embalmer flings 
 tongue onto the floor the dogs attack and quickly eat 
 it 
 imhotep is wrapped al m only his mouth nostrils and eyes are 
 left free of the slimy bandages detritus muck boils inside a black 
 cauldron embalmers scoop out the fetid muck and apply it to 
 wrappings as he squirms then laid in a wooden coffin inside a stone 
 sarcophagus an embalmer with a bucket steps up and looks into the coffin 
 wild eyes stare back the embalmer empties the bucket over 
 chest dozens of scarabs disgusting dung beetles they scurry 
 across screaming face some vanish into his mouth 
 and up his nostrils 
 inhotep 
 by eating the sacred scarabs i would 
 be cursed to stay alive forever and by 
 eating me they were cursed just the same 
 the lid to the coffin is slammed shut then using a strange 
 ycey the head mumia locks the coffin lid tight the heavy sarcophagus lid 
 is shoved into place and with a loud whoosh seals itself airtight once 
 again the head mumia uses the strange key locking the sarcophagus lid 
 tight 
 imhotep 
 i was to remain sealed inside my 
 sarcophagus the undead for all of eternity 
 the strangely tattooed man carefully collapses the sides of 
 the key turning it into a little puzzle box 
 inhotep 
 they would never allow me to be 
 released for i would arise a walking 
 disease a plague upon mankind an unholy 
 with the strength of ages power 
 over the sands and the glory of 
 invincibility 
 sarcophagus is dropped into a detritus pit the disgusting muck 
 splashes up drools down sides and then is mysteriously sucked into 
 seams vanishing clean 
 inhotep 
 and if i could raise my beloved 
 from her place in hell 
 together we would be an unstoppable 
 infection upon this world the apocalypse 
 the end 
 horrifying screans can be heard coming from inside 
 his sarcophagus as grave diggers shovel dirt onto it the main title is 
 superimposed on the scream the mummy 
 the heavily armed mumia stand guard around grave looking down on 
 the burial site is the huge statue of anubis the god of 
 death it stares at us then begins to decay before bur very eyes aging 
 years in only seconds and then we find ourselves and the decrepit 
 statue of anubis out in the middle of the desert 
 ext sahara hamanaptra ruins day 
 horrifying screams become the screams of a tuareg horseman 
 racing across the desert with two thousand of his warrior brethren armed 
 to the teeth superimposed across the screen are the words tee sarkra 
 
 a mile across the scorching desert two hundred french foreign legionnaires 
 scurry through the ruins preparing for the onslaught our hero is up on 
 the wall his kepi sits at a jaunty angle dashing and handsome this is 
 rick he looks out at the massive screaming horde galloping at 
 him

 they both skid to a stop at the front line as they see the horde of 
 sound of charging horses is deafening gives beni a 
 big cheesy smile 
 
 i was just looking for a good time 
 and when the cowardly legionnaire colonel suddenly panics cuts and 
 runs instantly stiffens 
 
 oh shit steady 
 gives the men around him courage but onward comes the horde hoofs pounding 
 the sand several more legionnaires take off 
 
 steady 
 to himself

 legionnaires beni is one of them 
 
 steady 
 to himself 
 what the hell am i doin 
 the tuaregs set their rifles and take aim steels himself cocks 
 and locks the cartridge in his mouth suddenly snaps he spits it into the 
 sand another beat and then 
 
 fire 
 the legionnaires on the ground fire the rifles report with a crash the 
 blast blows dozens of tuaregs clean off their mounts the prone 
 legionnaires quickly begin to reload 
 
 fire 
 the kneeling legionnaires fire more tuaregs bite the sand the remaining 
 warriors open fire thunder and smoke rip the hot air a third of the 
 legionnaires are killed instantly 
 
 fire 
 the remaining standing legionnaires fire tuaregs spin off their mounts 
 crash to the sand and then the entire tuareg force plows into the ruins 
 and through the legionnaires grabs the barrel of his rifle and 
 starts clubbing riders off their steeds fighting like a man possessed 
 beni on the other hand is bellycrawling across the sand whimpering in 
 full retreat as legionnaires fall dead all around him he crawls through 
 the front gate 
 throws his rifle down and goes for his guns he gun 
 in each hand starts blowing riders off their mounts 
 beni crawls faster and then he spots an open temple doorway amongst the 
 rocks he gets up and sprints for the door as the last of the legionnaires 
 are shot off their feet behind him guns go empty 
 
 
 he turns and runs like hell right through the front gate four tuareg 
 warriors on massive arabians after him hurdles a stone 
 column hits the ground running he spots beni inside the temple doorway 
 trying to close the heavy sandstone door 
 
 hey beni wait up 
 beni has no intention of waiting up he pushes harder

 runs faster beni pushes harder the four horsemen leap the big 
 column and charge after him hoofs pounding

 beni closes the door just as reaches it slams his body 
 into the door it budge

 he turns and bolts off around the rocks running for his life weaving 
 through the ruins the arabians getting closer and closer the pounding 
 hoofs getting louder and louder finally spins around and faces 
 his attackers the four massive horses crash to a stop in front of him 
 the vicious tuaregs raise their rifles to finish him off just 
 stands there exhausted and beaten then he slowly lifts his right hand and gives them the bird 
 and when the horses go all four of them rear up two of 
 the riders are thrown to the ground the horses screech and bellow and 
 snort in fear then buck like fury and away as if the devil 
 himself had scared them the thrown riders get up and race off after their 
 mounts 
 just stands there stunned then he lifts his right hand and 
 checks out his middle finger and then he feels the evil himself and turns 
 around the shattered decrepit statue of anubis stares back at him 
 suddenly the sand begins to shift under feet he starts to 
 back away keeping his eyes on the transforming sand it looks like huge 
 snakes are wiggling and writhing beneath it forming lines and shapes 
 drawing a picture quickly turns and runs off through the 
 ruins the sand stops moving and we can now see that drawn in the sand 
 is a picture of screaming face

 filling the cracks that ran through the door

 taking the time for a number ofthings that important yesterday 
 fade to black 
 in darkness we hear vic damone singing baby as the words one year earlier fade in and out 
 fade in 
 ext suburb early morning 
 flying high above an upper middle class suburb the wide streets are lined with stately elms and sycamores the homes are traditional and coming closer to the ground we pick out a couple of male jogger 
 a different angle on the joggers at level now moving alongside them both in their thirties athletic blandly handsome they pass a street sign that reads robin hood trail 
 suddenly a man comes into view flying aboutthree feet above their heads wearing pajamas and a plaid flannel robe as he passes overhead the joggers look up and wave excitedly like children he flashes them a grin and waves back then he speeds up leaving them behind 
 as the man flies down the street a barking dog runs alongbeneath him jumping into the air trying to catch him the man swoops and dips effortlessly teasing the dog then spots at the end of the street a young boy on a bicycle tossing newspapers onto porches or as close as he can get seeing the flying man the boy tosses a paper high into the air the dog tears off to catch the paper the flying man laughs and shoots upward like been blown out of a cannon grabs the paper and swoops down dropping it lightly on the front porch of a house with distinctive cedar shingle siding and a red front door 
 the boy on the bike watches in admiration the man slowlyfloats by above him and tousles his hair the dog barks the boy throws another newspaper into the air this time even higher than before and the man grins as he prepares to shoot up after it this is going to be fun and we smash cut to 
 int burnham house master bedroom day 
 we hear the harsh buzz of an alarm clock vic damone stillsings baby elsewhere in the house outside a dog is still barking 
 the man we just saw flying through the streets lies sleepingamidst expensive bed linens wearing the same pajamas his hand reaches over and shuts the alarm clock off his eyes remain clamped shut as he tries to hang onto his dream but gone he sighs and opens his eyes 
 this man is lester burnham husband and father with a wide boyish face just beginning to droop around the edges he sits up in bed and rubs his face 
 in a large comfortable bedroom tastefully decorated but not overdone it could be a spread from metropolitan home lester gets out of the bed crosses to a bay window covered with stylish wooden blinds lifts one of the slats with his finger and peers through it 
 his pov a dog the same dog from flying dream barks excitedly at us from behind a white picket fence surrounding the front yard of the house across the street 
 ext burnham house continuous 
 the pov lester looks down at us through the bay window of the house from his dream we recognize the distinctive cedar shingle siding the dog continues to bark 
 lester name is lester burnham forty old in less than a year be burnham house master bath moments later 
 in the shower with lester a waterproof radio plays country music he stands with his face directly in the hot spray eyes shut 
 lester a way dead already 
 angle from outside the shower we see naked body silhouetted through the glass door it becomes apparent he is masturbating 
 lester at me jerking off while i listen to country music i hated this shit when i was growing thing is this is the high point of my day all downhill from here 
 ext burnham house front yard moments later 
 close on a single dewy american beauty rose perfect inshape and color as we pull back a pair of gloved hands with clippers appear and snip the flower off 
 we continue pulling back to discover carolyn burnham in herrose garden in front of the house cutting flowers and placing them in a basket a determined humorless look on her face even now she is perfectly she wears gardening togs and has lots of useful and expensive tools 
 lester my wife carolyn see the way the handle on those pruning shears matches her gardening clogs not an accident 
 in the fenced front yard of the house across the street thefamiliar dog is still barking a athletic man in a conservative suit rolls a blue plastic city garbage container up the driveway to the curb 
 jim bitsy hush 
 lester our neighbor jim 
 a second athletic man in a conservative suitcomes out the front door 
 jim what in the world is wrong with her she had a walk this morning 
 jim and a jerky treat 
 jim spoil her 
 lester the second his lover jim 
 we recognize the two jims as the joggers from dream 
 jim no bark come inside now 
 bitsy suddenly subdued allows jim to usher her inside 
 lester weird they have the same name but really no fault of their own 
 as jim gets into a ford taurus jim crosses the street to greet carolyn 
 jim morning carolyn 
 morning jim i just love your tie that color 
 jim and i just love your roses how do you get them to flourish like that 
 carolynwell tell you egg shells and miracle grow 
 angle on the second floor bay window of the house where lester stands in a bathrobe drying his hair as he looks down at them 
 lester i get exhausted just watching her 
 his pov we hear what saying but facial expressions remain overly animated and cheerful like those of a tv talk show host 
 lester always like this she used to be happy we used to be happy 
 jim pulls the ford taurus into the street jim waves to carolyn jumps inside and they drive off carolyn immediately reverts to her previous resolute expression as she continues cutting flowers 
 lester she have much use for me anymore about the only thing that gets her excited now is money 
 int burnham house bedroom continuous 
 close on a young hands counting dollar bills pulling back we see jane burnham seated at a desk in her bedroom wearing jeans and a tight cotton top with straps as she counts she has the same resolute expression as her mother 
 lester this is my daughter jane only child she takes after her mother in a lot of ways although never admit it 
 having finished counting jane the money togetherthen types something into a computer 
 close on the computer monitor personal banking see the word deposit and the amount as entered then a new total in the balance column 
 jane smiles pleased she stuffs the money into a knapsackhanging on her closet door then looks at herself in a mirror a beat she turns sideways and arches her back so her breasts protrude as much as possible she frowns then turns so facing the mirror and hugs her herself tightly to enhance the appearance of cleavage 
 lester is a pretty typical teenager angry insecure confused i wish i could tell her all going to i want to lie to her 
 we hear a car horn from outside jane grabs her knapsack anda flannel shirt from her closet and starts out

 ext suburb early morning 
 flying high above an upper middle class suburb the wide streets are lined with stately elms and sycamores the homes are traditional and coming closer to the ground we pick out a couple of male jogger 
 a different angle on the joggers at level now moving alongside them both in their thirties athletic blandly handsome they pass a street sign that reads robin hood trail 
 suddenly a man comes into view flying aboutthree feet above their heads wearing pajamas and a plaid flannel robe as he passes overhead the joggers look up and wave excitedly like children he flashes them a grin and waves back then he speeds up leaving them behind 
 as the man flies down the street a barking dog runs alongbeneath him jumping into the air trying to catch him the man swoops and dips effortlessly teasing the dog then spots at the end of the street a young boy on a bicycle tossing newspapers onto porches or as close as he can get seeing the flying man the boy tosses a paper high into the air the dog tears off to catch the paper the flying man laughs and shoots upward like been blown out of a cannon grabs the paper and swoops down dropping it lightly on the front porch of a house with distinctive cedar shingle siding and a red front door 
 the boy on the bike watches in admiration the man slowlyfloats by above him and tousles his hair the dog barks the boy throws another newspaper into the air this time even higher than before and the man grins as he prepares to shoot up after it this is going to be fun and we smash cut to 
 int burnham house master bedroom day 
 we hear the harsh buzz of an alarm clock vic damone stillsings baby elsewhere in the house outside a dog is still barking 
 the man we just saw flying through the streets lies sleepingamidst expensive bed linens wearing the same pajamas his hand reaches over and shuts the alarm clock off his eyes remain clamped shut as he tries to hang onto his dream but gone he sighs and opens his eyes 
 this man is lester burnham husband and father with a wide boyish face just beginning to droop around the edges he sits up in bed and rubs his face 
 in a large comfortable bedroom tastefully decorated but not overdone it could be a spread from metropolitan home lester gets out of the bed crosses to a bay window covered with stylish wooden blinds lifts one of the slats with his finger and peers through it 
 his pov a dog the same dog from flying dream barks excitedly at us from behind a white picket fence surrounding the front yard of the house across the street 
 ext burnham house continuous 
 the pov lester looks down at us through the bay window of the house from his dream we recognize the distinctive cedar shingle siding the dog continues to bark 
 lester name is lester burnham forty old in less than a year be burnham house master bath moments later 
 in the shower with lester a waterproof radio plays country music he stands with his face directly in the hot spray eyes shut 
 lester a way dead already 
 angle from outside the shower we see naked body silhouetted through the glass door it becomes apparent he is masturbating 
 lester at me jerking off while i listen to country music i hated this shit when i was growing thing is this is the high point of my day all downhill from here 
 ext burnham house front yard moments later 
 close on a single dewy american beauty rose perfect inshape and color as we pull back a pair of gloved hands with clippers appear and snip the flower off 
 we continue pulling back to discover carolyn burnham in herrose garden in front of the house cutting flowers and placing them in a basket a determined humorless look on her face even now she is perfectly she wears gardening togs and has lots of useful and expensive tools 
 lester my wife carolyn see the way the handle on those pruning shears matches her gardening clogs not an accident 
 in the fenced front yard of the house across the street thefamiliar dog is still barking a athletic man in a conservative suit rolls a blue plastic city garbage container up the driveway to the curb 
 jim bitsy hush 
 lester our neighbor jim 
 a second athletic man in a conservative suitcomes out the front door 
 jim what in the world is wrong with her she had a walk this morning 
 jim and a jerky treat 
 jim spoil her 
 lester the second his lover jim 
 we recognize the two jims as the joggers from dream 
 jim no bark come inside now 
 bitsy suddenly subdued allows jim to usher her inside 
 lester weird they have the same name but really no fault of their own 
 as jim gets into a ford taurus jim crosses the street to greet carolyn 
 jim morning carolyn 
 morning jim i just love your tie that color 
 jim and i just love your roses how do you get them to flourish like that 
 carolynwell tell you egg shells and miracle grow 
 angle on the second floor bay window of the house where lester stands in a bathrobe drying his hair as he looks down at them 
 lester i get exhausted just watching her 
 his pov we hear what saying but facial expressions remain overly animated and cheerful like those of a tv talk show host 
 lester always like this she used to be happy we used to be happy 
 jim pulls the ford taurus into the street jim waves to carolyn jumps inside and they drive off carolyn immediately reverts to her previous resolute expression as she continues cutting flowers 
 lester she have much use for me anymore about the only thing that gets her excited now is money 
 int burnham house bedroom continuous 
 close on a young hands counting dollar bills pulling back we see jane burnham seated at a desk in her bedroom wearing jeans and a tight cotton top with straps as she counts she has the same resolute expression as her mother 
 lester this is my daughter jane only child she takes after her mother in a lot of ways although never admit it 
 having finished counting jane the money togetherthen types something into a computer 
 close on the computer monitor personal banking see the word deposit and the amount as entered then a new total in the balance column 
 jane smiles pleased she stuffs the money into a knapsackhanging on her closet door then looks at herself in a mirror a beat she turns sideways and arches her back so her breasts protrude as much as possible she frowns then turns so facing the mirror and hugs her herself tightly to enhance the appearance of cleavage 
 lester is a pretty typical teenager angry insecure confused i wish i could tell her all going to i want to lie to her 
 we hear a car horn from outside jane grabs her knapsack anda flannel shirt from her closet and starts out

 chapter 
 
 into the primitive 
 
 
 old longings nomadic leap 
 chafing at chain 
 again from its brumal sleep 
 wakens the ferine strain 
 
 buck did not read the newspapers or he would have known that trouble was brewing not alone for himself but for every tidewater dog strong of muscle and with warm long hair from puget sound to san diego because men groping in the arctic darkness had found a yellow metal and because steamship and transportation companies were booming the find thousands of men were rushing into the northland these men wanted dogs and the dogs they wanted were heavy dogs with strong muscles by which to toil and furry coats to protect them from the frost 
 buck lived at a big house in the santa clara valley judge place it was called it stood back from the road among the trees through which glimpses could be caught of the wide cool veranda that ran around its four sides the house was approached by graveled driveways which wound about through lawns and under the interlacing boughs of tall poplars at the rear things were on even a more spacious scale than at the front there were great stables where a dozen grooms and boys held forth rows of servants cottages an endless and orderly array of outhouses long grape arbors green pastures orchards and berry patches then there was the pumping plant for the artesian well and the big cement tank where judge boys took their morning plunge and kept cool in the hot afternoon 
 and over this great demesne buck ruled here he was born and here he had lived the four years of his life it was true there were other dogs there could not but be other dogs on so vast a place but they did not count they came and went resided in the populous kennels or lived obscurely in the recesses of the house after the fashion of toots the japanese pug or ysabel the mexican hairless strange creatures that rarely put nose out of doors or set foot to ground on the other hand there were the fox terriers a score of them at least who yelped fearful promises at toots and ysabel looking out of the windows at them and protected by a legion of housemaids armed with brooms and mops

 dazed suffering intolerable pain from throat and tongue with the life half throttled out of him buck attempted to face his tormentors but he was thrown down and choked repeatedly till they succeeded in filing the heavy brass collar from off his neck then the rope was removed and he was flung into a crate 
 there he lay for the remainder of the weary night nursing his wrath and wounded pride he could not understand what it all meant what did they want with him these strange men why were they keeping him pent up in this narrow crate he did not know why but he felt oppressed by the vague sense of impending calamity several times during the night he sprang to his feet when the shed door rattled open expecting to see the judge or the boys at least but each time it was the bulging face of the that peered in at him by the sickly light of a tallow candle and each time the joyful bark that trembled in throat was twisted into a savage growl 
 but the let him alone and in the morning four men entered and picked up the crate more tormentors buck decided for they were creatures ragged and unkempt and he stormed and raged at them through the bars they only laughed and poked sticks at him which he promptly assailed with his teeth till he realized that was what they wanted whereupon he lay down sullenly and allowed the crate to be lifted into a wagon then he and the crate in which he was imprisoned began a passage through many hands clerks in the express office took charge of him he was carted about in another wagon a truck carried him with an assortment of boxes and parcels upon a ferry steamer he was trucked off the steamer into a great railway depot and finally he was deposited in an express car 
 for two days and nights this express car was dragged along at the tail of shrieking locomotives and for two days and nights buck neither ate nor drank in his anger he had met the first advances of the express messengers with growls and they had retaliated by teasing him when he flung himself against the bars quivering and frothing they laughed at him and taunted him they growled and barked like detestable dogs mewed and flapped their arms and crowed it was all very silly he knew but therefore the more outrage to his dignity and his anger waxed and waxed he did not mind the hunger so much but the lack of water caused him severe suffering and fanned his wrath to for that matter and finely sensitive the ill treatment had flung him into a fever which was fed by the inflammation of his parched and swollen throat and tongue 
 he was glad for one thing the rope was off his neck that had given them an unfair advantage but now that it was off he would show them they would never get another rope around his neck upon that he was resolved for two days and nights he neither ate nor drank and during those two days and nights of torment he accumulated a fund of wrath that boded ill for whoever first fell foul of him his eyes turned bloodshot and he was metamorphosed into a raging fiend so changed was he that the judge himself would not have recognized him and the express messengers breathed with relief when they bundled him off the train at seattle 
 four men gingerly carried the crate from the wagon into a small back yard a stout man with a red sweater that sagged generously at the neck came out and signed the book for the driver that was the man buck divined the next tormentor and he hurled himself savagely against the bars the man smiled grimly and brought a hatchet and a club 
 you going to take him out now the driver asked 
 sure the man replied driving the hatchet into the crate for a pry 
 there was an instantaneous scattering of the four men who had carried it in and from safe perches on top the wall they prepared to watch the performance 
 buck rushed at the splintering wood sinking his teeth into it surging and wrestling with it wherever the hatchet fell on the outside he was there on the inside snarling and growling as furiously anxious to get out as the man in the red sweater was calmly intent on getting him out 
 now you devil he said when he had made an opening sufficient for the passage of body at the same time he dropped the hatchet and shifted the club to his right hand 
 and buck was truly a devil as he drew himself together for the spring hair bristling mouth foaming a mad glitter in his bloodshot eyes straight at the man he launched his one hundred and forty pounds of fury surcharged with the pent passion of two days and nights in just as his jaws were about to close on the man he received a shock that checked his body and brought his teeth together with an agonizing clip he whirled over fetching the ground on his back and side he had never been struck by a club in his life and did not understand with a snarl that was part bark and more scream he was again on his feet and launched into the air and again the shock came and he was brought crushingly to the ground this time he was aware that it was the club but his madness knew no caution a dozen times he charged and as often the club broke the charge and smashed him down 
 after a particularly fierce blow he crawled to his feet too dazed to rush he staggered limply about the blood flowing from nose and mouth and ears his beautiful coat sprayed and flecked with bloody slaver then the man advanced and deliberately dealt him a frightful blow on the nose all the pain he had endured was nothing compared with the exquisite agony of this with a roar that was almost in its ferocity he again hurled himself at the man but the man shifting the club from right to left cooly caught him by the under jaw at the same time wrenching downward and backward buck described a complete circle in the air and half of another then crashed to the ground on his head and chest 
 for the last time he rushed the man struck the shrewd blow he had purposely withheld for so long and buck crumpled up and went down knocked utterly senseless 
 no slouch at what i say one of the men on the wall cried with enthusiasm 
 druther break cayuses any day and twice on sundays was the reply of the driver as he climbed on the wagon and started the horses 
 senses came back to him but not his strength he lay where he had fallen and from there he watched the man in the red sweater

 as he spoke he fearlessly patted the head he had so mercilessly pounded and though hair involuntarily bristled at touch of the hand he endured it without protest when the man brought him water he drank eagerly and later bolted a generous meal of raw meat chuck by chunk from the hand

 chapter 
 
 into the primitive 
 
 
 old longings nomadic leap 
 chafing at chain 
 again from its brumal sleep 
 wakens the ferine strain 
 
 buck did not read the newspapers or he would have known that trouble was brewing not alone for himself but for every tidewater dog strong of muscle and with warm long hair from puget sound to san diego because men groping in the arctic darkness had found a yellow metal and because steamship and transportation companies were booming the find thousands of men were rushing into the northland these men wanted dogs and the dogs they wanted were heavy dogs with strong muscles by which to toil and furry coats to protect them from the frost 
 buck lived at a big house in the santa clara valley judge place it was called it stood back from the road among the trees through which glimpses could be caught of the wide cool veranda that ran around its four sides the house was approached by graveled driveways which wound about through lawns and under the interlacing boughs of tall poplars at the rear things were on even a more spacious scale than at the front there were great stables where a dozen grooms and boys held forth rows of servants cottages an endless and orderly array of outhouses long grape arbors green pastures orchards and berry patches then there was the pumping plant for the artesian well and the big cement tank where judge boys took their morning plunge and kept cool in the hot afternoon 
 and over this great demesne buck ruled here he was born and here he had lived the four years of his life it was true there were other dogs there could not but be other dogs on so vast a place but they did not count they came and went resided in the populous kennels or lived obscurely in the recesses of the house after the fashion of toots the japanese pug or ysabel the mexican hairless strange creatures that rarely put nose out of doors or set foot to ground on the other hand there were the fox terriers a score of them at least who yelped fearful promises at toots and ysabel looking out of the windows at them and protected by a legion of housemaids armed with brooms and mops 
 but buck was neither house dog nor kennel dog the whole realm was his he plunged into the swimming tank or went hunting with the sons he escorted mollie and alice the daughters on long twilight or early morning rambles on wintry nights he lay at the feet before the roaring library fire he carried the grandsons on his back or rolled them in the grass and guarded their footsteps through wild adventures down to the fountain in the stable yard and even beyond where the paddocks were and the berry patches among the terriers he stalked imperiously and toots and ysabel he utterly ignored for he was over all creeping crawling flying things of judge place humans included
