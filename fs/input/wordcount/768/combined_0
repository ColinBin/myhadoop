 laws 
 by plato 
 translated by benjamin jowett 
 book i 
 
 persons of the dialogue an athenian stranger cleinias acretan megillus a lacedaemonian 
 athenian stranger tell me strangers is a god or some man supposedto be the author of your laws 
 cleinias a god stranger in very truth a god among us cretans heis said to have been zeus but in lacedaemon whence our friend herecomes i believe they would say that apollo is their lawgiver wouldthey not megillus 
 megillus certainly 
 ath and do you cleinias believe as homer tells that every ninthyear minos went to converse with his olympian sire and was inspiredby him to make laws for your cities 
 cle yes that is our tradition and there was rhadamanthus abrother of his with whose name you are familiar he is reputed tohave been the justest of men and we cretans are of opinion that heearned this reputation from his righteous administration of justicewhen he was alive 
 ath yes and a noble reputation it was worthy of a son of zeus asyou and megillus have been trained in these institutions i dare saythat you will not be unwilling to give an account of your governmentand laws on our way we can pass the time pleasantly in about i am told that the distance from cnosus to the cave and templeof zeus is considerable and doubtless there are shady places underthe lofty trees which will protect us from this scorching no longer young we may often stop to rest beneath them and getover the whole journey without difficulty beguiling the time byconversation 
 cle yes stranger and if we proceed onward we shall come to grovesof cypresses which are of rare height and beauty and there are greenmeadows in which we may repose and converse 
 ath very good 
 cle very good indeed and still better when we see them let usmove on cheerily 
 ath i am first i want to know why the law has ordainedthat you shall have common meals and gymnastic exercises and weararms 
 cle i think stranger that the aim of our institutions is easilyintelligible to any one look at the character of our country creteis not like thessaly a large plain and for this reason they havehorsemen in thessaly and we have inequality of the groundin our country is more adapted to locomotion on foot but then if youhave runners you must have light one can carry a heavyweight when running and bows and arrows are convenient because theyare light now all these regulations have been made with a view towar and the legislator appears to me to have looked to this in allhis common meals if i am not mistaken wereinstituted by him for a similar reason because he saw that while theyare in the field the citizens are by the nature of the casecompelled to take their meals together for the sake of mutualprotection he seems to me to have thought the world foolish in notunderstanding that all are always at war with one another and if inwar there ought to be common meals and certain persons regularlyappointed under others to protect an army they should be continued inpeace for what men in general term peace would be said by him to beonly a name in reality every city is in a natural state of war withevery other not indeed proclaimed by heralds but everlasting and ifyou look closely you will find that this was the intention of thecretan legislator all institutions private as well as public werearranged by him with a view to war in giving them he was under theimpression that no possessions or institutions are of any value to himwho is defeated in battle for all the good things of the conqueredpass into the hands of the conquerors 
 ath you appear to me stranger to have been thoroughly trainedin the cretan institutions and to be well informed about them willyou tell me a little more explicitly what is the principle ofgovernment which you would lay down you seem to imagine that a wellgoverned state ought to be so ordered as to conquer all other statesin war am i right in supposing this to be your meaning 
 cle certainly and our lacedaemonian friend if i am notmistaken will agree with me 
 meg why my good friend how could any lacedaemonian say anythingelse 
 ath and is what you say applicable only to states or also tovillages 
 cle to both alike 
 ath the case is the same 
 cle yes 
 ath and in the village will there be the same war of family againstfamily and of individual against individual 
 cle the same 
 ath and should each man conceive himself to be his shall we say 
 cle o athenian of attica i will not call you seem to deserve rather to be named after the goddessherself because you go back to first principles you have thrown alight upon the argument and will now be better able to understandwhat i was just all men are publicly one and each man privately his own 
 ath my good sir what do you mean 
 cle moreover there is a victory and first andbest of victories the lowest and worst of each mangains or sustains at the hands not of another but of himself thisshows that there is a war against ourselves going on within everyone of us 
 ath let us now reverse the order of the argument seeing that everyindividual is either his own superior or his own inferior may wesay that there is the same principle in the house the village andthe state 
 cle you mean that in each of them there is a principle ofsuperiority or inferiority to self 
 ath yes 
 cle you are quite right in asking the question for there certainlyis such a principle and above all in states and the state in whichthe better citizens win a victory over the mob and over the inferiorclasses may be truly said to be better than itself and may bejustly praised where such a victory is gained or censured in theopposite case 
 ath whether the better is ever really conquered by the worse is aquestion which requires more discussion and may be therefore left forthe present but i now quite understand your meaning when you say thatcitizens who are of the same race and live in the same cities mayunjustly conspire and having the superiority in numbers mayovercome and enslave the few just and when they prevail the statemay be truly called its own inferior and therefore bad and whenthey are defeated its own superior and therefore good 
 cle your remark stranger is a paradox and yet we cannot possiblydeny it 
 ath here is another case for a family there maybe several brothers who are the offspring of a single pair verypossibly the majority of them may be unjust and the just may be ina minority 
 cle very possibly 
 ath and you and i ought not to raise a question of words as towhether this family and household are rightly said to be superior whenthey conquer and inferior when they are conquered for we are not nowconsidering what may or may not be the proper or customary way ofspeaking but we are considering the natural principles of right andwrong in laws 
 cle what you say stranger is most true 
 meg quite excellent in my opinion as far as we have gone 
 ath again might there not be a judge over these brethren ofwhom we were speaking 
 cle certainly 
 ath now which would be the better who destroyed thebad and appointed the good to govern themselves or one who whileallowing the good to govern let the bad live and made themvoluntarily submit or third i suppose in the scale of excellencemight be placed a judge who finding the family distracted notonly did not destroy any one but reconciled them to one another forever after and gave them laws which they mutually observed and wasable to keep them friends 
 cle the last would be by far the best sort of judge and legislator 
 ath and yet the aim of all the laws which he gave would be thereverse of war 
 cle very true 
 ath and will he who constitutes the state and orders the life ofman have in view external war or that kind of intestine war calledcivil which no one if he could prevent would like to have occurringin his own state and when occurring every one would wish to bequit of as soon as possible 
 cle he would have the latter chiefly in view 
 ath and would he prefer that this civil war should be terminated bythe destruction of one of the parties and by the victory of theother or that peace and friendship should be andthat being reconciled they should give their attention to foreignenemies 
 cle every one would desire the latter in the case of his own state 
 ath and would not that also be the desire of the legislator 
 cle certainly 
 ath and would not every one always make laws for the sake of thebest 
 cle to be sure 
 ath but war whether external or civil is not the best and theneed of either is to be deprecated but peace with one another andgood will are best nor is the victory of the state over itself to beregarded as a really good thing but as a necessity a man might aswell say that the body was in the best state when sick and purged bymedicine forgetting that there is also a state of the body whichneeds no purge and in like manner no one can be a true he aims at the happiness of the individual or state who looksonly or first of all to external warfare nor will he ever be asound legislator who orders peace for the sake of war and not war forthe sake of peace 
 cle i suppose that there is truth stranger in that remark ofyours and yet i am greatly mistaken if war is not the entire aimand object of our own institutions and also of the lacedaemonian 
 ath i dare say but there is no reason why we should rudely quarrelwith one another about your legislators instead of gently questioningthem seeing that both we and they are equally in earnest pleasefollow me and the argument first i will put forwardtyrtaeus an athenian by birth but also a spartan citizen who of allmen was most eager about war well he says i sing not i carenot about any man even if he were the richest of men andpossessed every good and then he gives a whole list of them if hebe not at all times a brave warrior i imagine that you too musthave heard his poems our lacedaemonian friend has probably heard morethan enough of them 
 meg very true 
 cle and they have found their way from lacedaemon to crete 
 ath come now and let us all join in asking this question oftyrtaeus o most divine poet we will say to him the excellent praisewhich you have bestowed on those who excel in war sufficientlyproves that you are wise and good and i and megillus and cleiniasof cnosus do as i believe entirely agree with you but we shouldlike to be quite sure that we are speaking of the same men tell do you agree with us in thinking that there are two kinds ofwar or what would you say a far inferior man to tyrtaeus wouldhave no difficulty in replying quite truly that war is of two kindsone which is universally called civil war and is as we were justnow saying of all wars the worst the other as we should alladmit in which we fall out with other nations who are of adifferent race is a far milder form of warfare 
 cle certainly far milder 
 ath well now when you praise and blame war in this whom are you praising or blaming and to which kind of war areyou referring i suppose that you must mean foreign war if i am tojudge from expressions of yours in which you say that you abominatethose 
 who refuse to look upon fields of blood and will not draw nearand strike at their we shall naturally go on to say to tyrtaeus as it those who distinguish themselves in external and foreign he must admit this 
 cle evidently 
 ath they are good but we say that there are still better men whosevirtue is displayed in the greatest of all battles and we too havea poet whom we summon as a witness theognis citizen of megara insicily 
 cyrnus he who is faithful in a civil broil is worth his weight ingold and such an one is far better as we affirm than the other in amore difficult kind of war much in the same degree as justice andtemperance and wisdom when united with courage are better thancourage only for a man cannot be faithful and good in civil strifewithout having all virtue but in the war of which tyrtaeus a mercenary soldier will take his stand and be ready to die athis post and yet they are generally and almost without exceptioninsolent unjust violent men and the most senseless of human will ask what the conclusion is and what i am seeking to prove imaintain that the divine legislator of crete like any other who isworthy of consideration will always and above all things in makinglaws have regard to the greatest virtue which according to loyalty in the hour of danger and may be truly called perfectjustice whereas that virtue which tyrtaeus highly praises is wellenough and was praised by the poet at the right time yet in placeand dignity may be said to be only fourth rate 
 cle stranger we are degrading our inspired lawgiver to a rankwhich is far beneath him 
 ath nay i think that we degrade not him but ourselves if weimagine that lycurgus and minos laid down laws both in lacedaemonand crete mainly with a view to war 
 cle what ought we to say then 
 ath what truth and what justice require of us if i am notmistaken when speaking in behalf of divine thelegislator when making his laws had in view not a part only andthis the lowest part of virtue but all virtue and that he devisedclasses of laws answering to the kinds of virtue not in the way inwhich modern inventors of laws make the classes for they onlyinvestigate and offer laws whenever a want is felt and one man hasa class of laws about allotments and heiresses another aboutassaults others about ten thousand other such matters but wemaintain that the right way of examining into laws is to proceed as wehave now done and i admired the spirit of your exposition for youwere quite right in beginning with virtue and saying that this wasthe aim of the giver of the law but i thought that you went wrongwhen you added that all his legislation had a view only to a part andthe least part of virtue and this called forth my subsequent you allow me then to explain how i should have liked to haveheard you expound the matter 
 cle by all means 
 ath you ought to have said cretan laws are withreason famous among the hellenes for they fulfil the object oflaws which is to make those who use them happy and they confer everysort of good now goods are of two kinds there are human and thereare divine goods and the human hang upon the divine and the statewhich attains the greater at the same time acquires the less or nothaving the greater has neither of the lesser goods the first ishealth the second beauty the third strength including swiftnessin running and bodily agility generally and the fourth is wealth notthe blind god pluto but one who is keen of sight if only he haswisdom for his companion for wisdom is chief and leader of the divinedass of goods and next follows temperance and from the union ofthese two with courage springs justice and fourth in the scale ofvirtue is courage all these naturally take precedence of the othergoods and this is the order in which the legislator must placethem and after them he will enjoin the rest of his ordinances onthe citizens with a view to these the human looking to the the divine looking to their leader mind some of his ordinanceswill relate to contracts of marriage which they make one with then to the procreation and education of children both male andfemale the duty of the lawgiver will be to take charge of hiscitizens in youth and age and at every time of life and to givethem punishments and rewards and in reference to all theirintercourse with one another he ought to consider their pains andpleasures and desires and the vehemence of all their passions heshould keep a watch over them and blame and praise them rightly bythe mouth of the laws themselves also with regard to anger andterror and the other perturbations of the soul which arise out ofmisfortune and the deliverances from them which prosperity the experiences which come to men in diseases or in war orpoverty or the opposite of these in all these states he shoulddetermine and teach what is the good and evil of the condition ofeach in the next place the legislator has to be careful how thecitizens make their money and in what way they spend it and to havean eye to their mutual contracts and dissolutions of voluntary or involuntary he should see how they order allthis and consider where justice as well as injustice is found or iswanting in their several dealings with one another and honour thosewho obey the law and impose fixed penalties on those who the round of civil life is ended and the time has come forthe consideration of the proper funeral rites and honours of the the lawgiver reviewing his work will appoint guardians to presideover these who walk by intelligence others by trueopinion only and then mind will bind together all his ordinancesand show them to be in harmony with temperance and justice and notwith wealth or ambition this is the spirit stranger in which iwas and am desirous that you should pursue the subject and i wantto know the nature of all these things and how they are arranged inthe laws of zeus as they are termed and in those of the pythianapollo which minos and lycurgus gave and how the order of them isdiscovered to his eyes who has experience in laws gained either bystudy or habit although they are far from being to therest of mankind like ourselves 
 cle how shall we proceed stranger 
 ath i think that we must begin again as before and firstconsider the habit of courage and then we will go on and discussanother and then another form of virtue if you please in this way weshall have a model of the whole and with these and similar discourseswe will beguile the way and when we have gone through all thevirtues we will show by the grace of god that the institutions ofwhich i was speaking look to virtue 
 meg very good and suppose that you first criticize this praiser ofzeus and the laws of crete 
 ath i will try to criticize you and myself as well as him for theargument is a common concern tell not first the syssitia andsecondly the gymnasia invented by your legislator with a view to war 
 meg yes 
 ath and what comes third and what fourth for that i think isthe sort of enumeration which ought to be made of the remainingparts of virtue no matter whether you call them parts or what theirname is provided the meaning is clear 
 meg then i or any other lacedaemonian would reply that hunting isthird in order 
 ath let us see if we can discover what comes fourth and fifth 
 meg i think that i can get as far as the fouth head which is thefrequent endurance of pain exhibited among us spartans in fights also in stealing with the prospect of getting agood beating there is too the crypteia or secretservice in which wonderful endurance is people wanderover the whole country by day and by night and even in winter havenot a shoe to their foot and are without beds to lie upon and haveto attend upon themselves marvellous too is the endurance which ourcitizens show in their naked exercises contending against the violentsummer heat and there are many similar practices to speak of whichin detail would be endless 
 ath excellent o lacedaemonian stranger but how ought we to definecourage is it to be regarded only as a combat against fears andpains or also against desires and pleasures and againstflatteries which exercise such a tremendous power that they make thehearts even of respectable citizens to melt like wax 
 meg i should say the latter 
 ath in what preceded as you will remember our cnosian friendwas speaking of a man or a city being inferior to younot cleinias 
 cle i was 
 ath now which is in the truest sense inferior the man who isovercome by pleasure or by pain 
 cle i should say the man who is overcome by pleasure for all mendeem him to be inferior in a more disgraceful sense than the otherwho is overcome by pain 
 ath but surely the lawgivers of crete and lacedaemon have notlegislated for a courage which is lame of one leg able only to meetattacks which come from the left but impotent against the insidiousflatteries which come from the right 
 cle able to meet both i should say 
 ath then let me once more ask what institutions have you in eitherof your states which give a taste of pleasures and do not avoidthem any more than they avoid pains but which set a person in themidst of them and compel or induce him by the prospect of reward toget the better of them where is an ordinance about pleasure similarto that about pain to be found in your laws tell me what there isof this nature among is there which makes your citizenequally brave against pleasure and pain conquering what they ought toconquer and superior to the enemies who are most dangerous andnearest home 
 meg i was able to tell you stranger many laws which were directedagainst pain but i do not know that i can point out any great orobvious examples of similar institutions which are concerned withpleasure there are some lesser provisions however which i mightmention 
 cle neither can i show anything of that sort which is at allequally prominent in the cretan laws 
 ath no wonder my dear friends and if as is very likely in oursearch after the true and good one of us may have to censure the lawsof the others we must not be offended but take kindly what anothersays 
 cle you are quite right athenian stranger and we will do as yousay 
 ath at our time of life cleinias there should be no feeling ofirritation 
 cle certainly not 
 ath i will not at present determine whether he who censures thecretan or lacedaemonian polities is right or wrong but i believe thati can tell better than either of you what the many say about them forassuming that you have reasonably good laws one of the best of themwill be the law forbidding any young men to enquire which of themare right or wrong but with one mouth and one voice they must allagree that the laws are all good for they came from god and anyone who says the contrary is not to be listened to but an old man whoremarks any defect in your laws may communicate his observation to aruler or to an equal in years when no young man is present 
 cle exactly so stranger and like a diviner although not there atthe time you seem to me quite to have hit the meaning of thelegislator and to say what is most true 
 ath as there are no young men present and the legislator has givenold men free licence there will be no impropriety in our discussingthese very matters now that we are alone 
 cle true and therefore you may be as free as you like in yourcensure of our laws for there is no discredit in knowing what iswrong he who receives what is said in a generous and friendlyspirit will be all the better for it 
 ath very good however i am not going to say anything against yourlaws until to the best of my ability i have examined them but i amgoing to raise doubts about them for you are the only people known tous whether greek or barbarian whom the legislator commanded toeschew all great pleasures and amusements and never to touch in the matter of pains or fears which we have just beendiscussing he thought that they who from infancy had always avoidedpains and fears and sorrows when they were compelled to face themwould run away from those who were hardened in them and wouldbecome their subjects now the legislator ought to have consideredthat this was equally true of pleasure he should have said tohimself that if our citizens are from their youth upward unacquaintedwith the greatest pleasures and unused to endure amid the temptationsof pleasure and are not disciplined to refrain from all thingsevil the sweet feeling of pleasure will overcome them just as fearwould overcome the former class and in another and even a worsemanner they will be the slaves of those who are able to endure amidpleasures and have had the opportunity of enjoying them they beingoften the worst of mankind one half of their souls will be a other half free and they will not be worthy to be called in thetrue sense men and freemen tell me whether you assent to my words 
 cle on first hearing what you say appears to be the truth butto be hasty in coming to a conclusion about such important matterswould be very childish and simple 
 ath suppose cleinias and megillus that we consider the virtuewhich follows next of those which we intended to discuss for aftercourage comes temperance what institutions shall we find relating totemperance either in crete or lacedaemon which like your militaryinstitutions differ from those of any ordinary state 
 meg that is not an easy question to answer still i should say thatthe common meals and gymnastic exercises have been excellently devisedfor the promotion both of temperance and courage 
 ath there seems to be a difficulty stranger with regard tostates in making words and facts coincide so that there can be nodispute about them as in the human body the regimen which doesgood in one way does harm in another and we can hardly say that anyone course of treatment is adapted to a particular constitution nowthe gymnasia and common meals do a great deal of good and yet theyare a source of evil in civil troubles as is shown in the case of themilesian and boeotian and thurian youth among whom theseinstitutions seem always to have had a tendency to degrade the ancientand natural custom of love below the level not only of man but ofthe beasts the charge may be fairly brought against your cities aboveall others and is true also of most other states which especiallycultivate gymnastics whether such matters are to be regardedjestingly or seriously i think that the pleasure is to be deemednatural which arises out of the intercourse between men and women butthat the intercourse of men with men or of women with women iscontrary to nature and that the bold attempt was originally due tounbridled lust the cretans are always accused of having inventedthe story of ganymede and zeus because they wanted to justifythemselves in the enjoyment of unnatural pleasures by the practiceof the god whom they believe to have been their lawgiver leavingthe story we may observe that any speculation about laws turns almostentirely on pleasure and pain both in states and in are two fountains which nature lets flow and he who drawsfrom them where and when and as much as he ought is happy andthis holds of men and individuals as well as states and hewho indulges in them ignorantly and at the wrong time is thereverse of happy 
 meg i admit stranger that your words are well spoken and ihardly know what to say in answer to you but still i think that thespartan lawgiver was quite right in forbidding pleasure of the cretanlaws i shall leave the defence to my cnosian friend but the lawsof sparta in as far as they relate to pleasure appear to me to bethe best in the world for that which leads mankind in general intothe wildest pleasure and licence and every other folly the law hasclean driven out and neither in the country nor in towns which areunder the control of sparta will you find revelries and the manyincitements of every kind of pleasure which accompany them and anyone who meets a drunken and disorderly person will immediately havehim most severely punished and will not let him off on anypretence not even at the time of a dionysiac festival although ihave remarked that this may happen at your performances on the they are called and among our tarentine colonists i have seenthe whole city drunk at a dionysiac festival but nothing of thesort happens among us 
 ath o lacedaemonian stranger these festivities are praiseworthywhere there is a spirit of endurance but are very senseless when theyare under no regulations in order to retaliate an athenian hasonly to point out the licence which exists among your women to allsuch accusations whether they are brought against the us or you there is one answer which exonerates the practice inquestion from impropriety when a stranger expresses wonder at thesingularity of what he sees any inhabitant will naturally not o stranger this is our custom and you may verylikely have some other custom about the same things now we arespeaking my friends not about men in general but about the meritsand defects of the lawgivers themselves let us then discourse alittle more at length about intoxication which is a very importantsubject and will seriously task the discrimination of the am not speaking of drinking or not drinking wine at all but ofintoxication are we to follow the custom of the scythians andpersians and carthaginians and celts and iberians and are all warlike nations or that of your countrymen for you say altogether abstain but the scythians and men and women drink unmixed wine which they pour on theirgarments and this they think a happy and glorious institution thepersians again are much given to other practices of luxury which youreject but they have more moderation in them than the thracians andscythians 
 meg o best of men we have only to take arms into our hands and wesend all these nations flying before us 
 ath nay my good friend do not say that there have been as therealways will be flights and pursuits of which no account can be therefore we cannot say that victory or defeat in battle affordsmore than a doubtful proof of the goodness or badness of when the greater states conquer and enslave the lesser as thesyracusans have done the locrians who appear to be people in their part of the world or as the athenianshave done the ceans and there are ten thousand other instances of thesame sort of thing all this is not to the point let us endeavourrather to form a conclusion about each institution in itself and saynothing at present of victories and defeats let us only say thatsuch and such a custom is honourable and another not and firstpermit me to tell you how good and bad are to be estimated inreference to these very matters 
 meg how do you mean 
 ath all those who are ready at a notice to praise orcensure any practice which is matter of discussion seem to me toproceed in a wrong way let me give you an illustration of what may suppose a person to be praising wheat as a good kindof food whereupon another person instantly blames wheat without everenquiring into its effect or use or in what way or to whom orwith what or in what state and how wheat is to be given and that isjust what we are doing in this discussion at the very mention ofthe word intoxication one side is ready with their praises and theother with their censures which is absurd for either side adducetheir witnesses and approvers and some of us think that we speak withauthority because we have many witnesses and others because theysee those who abstain conquering in battle and this again is disputedby us now i cannot say that i shall be satisfied if we go ondiscussing each of the remaining laws in the same way and aboutthis very point of intoxication i should like to speak in another i hold to be the right one for if number is to be thecriterion are there not myriads upon myriads of nations ready todispute the point with you who are only two cities 
 meg i shall gladly welcome any method of enquiry which is right 
 ath let me put the matter a person to praise thekeeping of goats and the creatures themselves as capital things tohave and then some one who had seen goats feeding without agoatherd in cultivated spots and doing mischief were to censure agoat or any other animal who has no keeper or a bad keeper wouldthere be any sense or justice in such censure 
 meg certainly not 
 ath does a captain require only to have nautical knowledge in orderto be a good captain whether he is or not what do you say 
 meg i say that he is not a good captain if although he havenautical skill he is liable to 
 ath and what would you say of the commander of an army will hebe able to command merely because he has military skill if he be acoward who when danger comes is sick and drunk with fear 
 meg impossible 
 ath and what if besides being a coward he has no skill 
 meg he is a miserable fellow not fit to be a commander of men butonly of old women 
 ath and what would you say of some one who blames or praises anysort of meeting which is intended by nature to have a ruler and iswell enough when under his presidency the critic however hasnever seen the society meeting together at an orderly feast underthe control of a president but always without a ruler or with a observers of this class praise or blame such meetings arewe to suppose that what they say is of any value 
 meg certainly not if they have never seen or been present atsuch a meeting when rightly ordered 
 ath reflect may not banqueters and banquets be said toconstitute a kind of meeting 
 meg of course 
 ath and did any one ever see this sort of convivial meeting rightlyordered of course you two will answer that you have never seen themat all because they are not customary or lawful in your i have come across many of them in many different places andmoreover i have made enquiries about them wherever i went as i maysay and never did i see or hear of anything of the kind which wascarried on altogether rightly in some few particulars they might beright but in general they were utterly wrong 
 cle what do you mean stranger by this remark explain for we asyou say from our inexperience in such matters might very likelynot know even if they came in our way what was right or wrong insuch societies 
 ath likely enough then let me try to be your instructor you wouldacknowledge would you not that in all gatherings of man kind ofwhatever sort there ought to be a leader 
 cle certainly i should 
 ath and we were saying just now that when men are at war theleader ought to be a brave man 
 cle we were 
 ath the brave man is less likely than the coward to be disturbed byfears 
 cle that again is true 
 ath and if there were a possibility of having a general of anarmy who was absolutely fearless and imperturbable should we not byall means appoint him 
 cle assuredly 
 ath now however we are speaking not of a general who is tocommand an army when foe meets foe in time of war but of one whois to regulate meetings of another sort when friend meets friend intime of peace 
 cle true 
 ath and that sort of meeting if attended with drunkenness isapt to be unquiet 
 cle certainly the reverse of quiet 
 ath in the first place then the revellers as well as the soldierswill require a ruler 
 cle to be sure no men more so 
 ath and we ought if possible to provide them with a quiet ruler 
 cle of course 
 ath and he should be a man who understands society for his duty isto preserve the friendly feelings which exist among the company at thetime and to increase them for the future by his use of the occasion 
 cle very true 
 ath must we not appoint a sober man and a wise to be our masterof the revels for if the ruler of drinkers be himself young anddrunken and not only by some special good fortune willhe be saved from doing some great evil 
 cle it will be by a singular good fortune that he is saved 
 ath now suppose such associations to be framed in the best waypossible in states and that some one blames the very fact of may very likely be right but if he blames a practicewhich he only sees very much mismanaged he shows in the first placethat he is not aware of the mismanagement and also not aware thateverything done in this way will turn out to be wrong because donewithout the superintendence of a sober ruler do you not see that adrunken pilot or a drunken ruler of any sort will ruin in short of which he has the direction 
 cle the last remark is very true stranger and i see quite clearlythe advantage of an army having a good will give victoryin war to his followers which is a very great advantage and so ofother things but i do not see any similar advantage which eitherindividuals or states gain from the good management of a feast andi want you to tell me what great good will be effected supposing thatthis drinking ordinance is duly established 
 ath if you mean to ask what great good accrues to the state fromthe right training of a single youth or of a single thequestion is put in that form we cannot deny that the good is not verygreat in any particular instance but if you ask what is the good ofeducation in general the answer is education makes goodmen and that good men act nobly and conquer their enemies in they are good education certainly gives victory althoughvictory sometimes produces forgetfulness of education for many havegrown insolent from victory in war and this insolence hasengendered in them innumerable evils and many a victory has beenand will be suicidal to the victors but education is never suicidal 
 cle you seem to imply my friend that convivial meetings whenrightly ordered are an important element of education 
 ath certainly i do 
 cle and can you show that what you have been saying is true 
 ath to be absolutely sure of the truth of matters concerningwhich there are many opinions is an attribute of the gods not givento man stranger but i shall be very happy to tell you what ithink especially as we are now proposing to enter on a discussionconcerning laws and constitutions 
 cle your opinion stranger about the questions which are now beingraised is precisely what we want to hear 
 ath very good i will try to find a way of explaining my you shall try to have the gift of understanding me but firstlet me make an apology the athenian citizen is reputed among allthe hellenes to be a great talker whereas sparta is renowned forbrevity and the cretans have more wit than words now i am afraidof appearing to elicit a very long discourse out of very smallmaterials for drinking indeed may appear to be a slight matter andyet is one which cannot be rightly ordered according to correct principles of music these are necessary to anyclear or satisfactory treatment of the subject and music again runsup into education generally and there is much to be said about allthis what would you say then to leaving these matters for thepresent and passing on to some other question of law 
 meg o athenian stranger let me tell you what perhaps you do notknow that our family is the proxenus of your state i imagine thatfrom their earliest youth all boys when they are told that they arethe proxeni of a particular state feel kindly towards their secondand this has certainly been my own feeling i can well remember fromthe days of my boyhood how when any lacedaemonians praised or blamedthe athenians they used to say to megillus how ill or howwell as the case might be has your state treated us and havingalways had to fight your battles against detractors when i heard youassailed i became warmly attached to you and i always like to hearthe athenian tongue spoken the common saying is quite true that agood athenian is more than ordinarily good for he is the only man whois freely and genuinely good by the divine inspiration of his ownnature and is not manufactured therefore be assured that i shalllike to hear you say whatever you have to say 
 cle yes stranger and when you have heard me speak say boldlywhat is in your thoughts let me remind you of a tie which unitesyou to crete you must have heard here the story of the prophetepimenides who was of my family and came to athens ten yearsbefore the persian war in accordance with the response of the offered certain sacrifices which the god commanded theathenians were at that time in dread of the persian invasion and hesaid that for ten years they would not come and that when theycame they would go away again without accomplishing any of theirobjects and would suffer more evil than they inflicted at thattime my forefathers formed ties of hospitality with you thusancient is the friendship which i and my parents have had for you 
 ath you seem to be quite ready to listen and i am also ready toperform as much as i can of an almost impossible task which i willnevertheless attempt at the outset of the discussion let me definethe nature and power of education for this is the way by which ourargument must travel onwards to the god dionysus 
 cle let us proceed if you please 
 ath well then if i tell you what are my notions of you consider whether they satisfy you 
 cle let us hear 
 ath according to my view any one who would be good at anythingmust practise that thing from his youth upwards both in sport andearnest in its several branches for example he who is to be agood builder should play at building houses he who isto be a good husbandman at tilling the ground and those who have thecare of their education should provide them when young with mimictools they should learn beforehand the knowledge which they willafterwards require for their art for example the future carpentershould learn to measure or apply the line in play and the futurewarrior should learn riding or some other exercise for the teacher should endeavour to direct the inclinationsand pleasures by the help of amusements to their final aim inlife the most important part of education is right training in thenursery the soul of the child in his play should be guided to thelove of that sort of excellence in which when he grows up to manhoodhe will have to be perfected do you agree with me thus far 
 cle certainly 
 ath then let us not leave the meaning of education ambiguous at present when we speak in terms of praise or blameabout the of each person we call one man educated andanother uneducated although the uneducated man may be sometimesvery well educated for the calling of a retail trader or of a captainof a ship and the like for we are not speaking of education inthis narrower sense but of that other education in virtue fromyouth upwards which makes a man eagerly pursue the ideal perfectionof citizenship and teaches him how rightly to rule and how to is the only education which upon our view deserves the other sort of training which aims at the acquisition of wealthor bodily strength or mere cleverness apart from intelligence andjustice is mean and illiberal and is not worthy to be callededucation at all but let us not quarrel with one another about aword provided that the proposition which has just been granted holdgood to wit that those who are rightly educated generally becomegood men neither must we cast a slight upon education which is thefirst and fairest thing that the best of men can ever have and liable to take a wrong direction is capable of this work of reformation is the great business of every manwhile he lives 
 cle very true and we entirely agree with you 
 ath and we agreed before that they are good men who are able torule themselves and bad men who are not 
 cle you are quite right 
 ath let me now proceed if i can to clear up the subject alittle further by an illustration which i will offer you 
 cle proceed 
 ath do we not consider each of ourselves to be one 
 cle we do 
 ath and each one of us has in his bosom two counsellors bothfoolish and also antagonistic of which we call the one the other pain 
 cle exactly 
 ath also there are opinions about the future which have thegeneral name of expectations and the specific name of fear whenthe expectation is of pain and of hope when of pleasure andfurther there is reflection about the good or evil of them and embodied in a decree by the state is called law 
 cle i am hardly able to follow you proceed however as if i were 
 meg i am in the like case 
 ath let us look at the matter thus may we not conceive each ofus living beings to be a puppet of the gods either their playthingonly or created with a of the two we cannot certainlyknow but we do know that these affections in us are like cords andstrings which pull us different and opposite ways and to oppositeactions and herein lies the difference between virtue and to the argument there is one among these cords which everyman ought to grasp and never let go but to pull with it against allthe rest and this is the sacred and golden cord of reason calledby us the common law of the state there are others which are hard andof iron but this one is soft because golden and there are severalother kinds now we ought always to cooperate with the lead of thebest which is law for inasmuch as reason is beautiful and not violent her rule must needs have ministers in order to helpthe golden principle in vanquishing the other principles and thus themoral of the tale about our being puppets will not have been lost andthe meaning of the expression superior or inferior to a become clearer and the individual attaining to right reasonin this matter of pulling the strings of the puppet should liveaccording to its rule while the city receiving the same from somegod or from one who has knowledge of these things should embody it ina law to be her guide in her dealings with herself and with otherstates in this way virtue and vice will be more clearly distinguishedby us and when they have become clearer education and otherinstitutions will in like manner become clearer and in particularthat question of convivial entertainment which may seem have been a very trifling matter and to have taken a great manymore words than were necessary 
 cle perhaps however the theme may turn out not to be unworthyof the length of discourse 
 ath very good let us proceed with any enquiry which really bearson our present object 
 cle proceed 
 ath suppose that we give this puppet of ours will be theeffect on him 
 cle having what in view do you ask that question 
 ath nothing as yet but i ask generally when the puppet is broughtto the drink what sort of result is likely to follow i willendeavour to explain my meaning more clearly what i am now askingis the drinking of wine heighten and increase pleasuresand pains and passions and loves 
 cle very greatly 
 ath and are perception and memory and opinion and and increased do not these qualities entirely desert a manif he becomes saturated with drink 
 cle yes they entirely desert him 
 ath does he not return to the state of soul in which he was whena young child 
 cle he does 
 ath then at that time he will have the least control over himself 
 cle the least 
 ath and will he not be in a most wretched plight 
 cle most wretched 
 ath then not only an old man but also a drunkard becomes a secondtime a child 
 cle well said stranger 
 ath is there any argument which will prove to us that we ought toencourage the taste for drinking instead of doing all we can toavoid it 
 cle i suppose that there is you at any rate were just nowsaying that you were ready to maintain such a doctrine 
 ath true i was and i am ready still seeing that you have bothdeclared that you are anxious to hear me 
 cle to sure we are if only for the strangeness of the asserts that a man ought of his own accord to plunge intoutter degradation 
 ath are you speaking of the soul 
 cle yes 
 ath and what would you say about the body my friend are you notsurprised at any one of his own accord bringing upon himselfdeformity leanness ugliness decrepitude 
 cle certainly 
 ath yet when a man goes of his own accord to a shop andtakes medicine is he not aware that soon and for many daysafterwards he will be in a state of body which he would die ratherthan accept as the permanent condition of his life are not thosewho train in gymnasia at first beginning reduced to a state ofweakness 
 cle yes all that is well known 
 ath also that they go of their own accord for the sake of thesubsequent benefit 
 cle very good 
 ath and we may conceive this to be true in the same way of otherpractices 
 cle certainly 
 ath and the same view may be taken of the pastime of drinking we are right in supposing that the same good effect follows 
 cle to be sure 
 ath if such convivialities should turn out to have any advantageequal in importance to that of gymnastic they are in their verynature to be preferred to mere bodily exercise inasmuch as theyhave no accompaniment of pain 
 cle true but i hardly think that we shall be able to discoverany such benefits to be derived from them 
 ath that is just what we must endeavour to show and let me ask youa we not distinguish two kinds of fear which are verydifferent 
 cle what are they 
 ath there is the fear of expected evil 
 cle yes 
 ath and there is the fear of an evil reputation we are afraidof being thought evil because we do or say some dishonourablething which fear we and all men term shame 
 cle certainly 
 ath these are the two fears as i called them one of which isthe opposite of pain and other fears and the opposite also of thegreatest and most numerous sort of pleasures 
 cle very true 
 ath and does not the legislator and every one who is good foranything hold this fear in the greatest honour this is what he termsreverence and the confidence which is the reverse of this he termsinsolence and the latter he always deems to be a very great evil bothto individuals and to states 
 cle true 
 ath does not this kind of fear preserve us in many importantways what is there which so surely gives victory and safety in there are two things which give before fear of disgrace before friends 
 cle there are 
 ath then each of us should be fearless and also fearful and why weshould be either has now been determined 
 cle certainly 
 ath and when we want to make any one fearless we and the law bringhim face to face with many fears 
 cle clearly 
 ath and when we want to make him rightly fearful must we notintroduce him to shameless pleasures and train him to take up armsagainst them and to overcome them or does this principle apply tocourage only and must he who would be perfect in valour fight againstand overcome his own natural if he be unpractisedand inexperienced in such conflicts he will not be half the man whichhe might have are we to suppose that with temperance it isotherwise and that he who has never fought with the shameless andunrighteous temptations of his pleasures and lusts and conqueredthem in earnest and in play by word deed and act will still beperfectly temperate 
 cle a most unlikely supposition 
 ath suppose that some god had given a to men andthat the more a man drank of this the more he regarded himself atevery draught as a child of misfortune and that he fearedeverything happening or about to happen to him and that at last themost courageous of men utterly lost his presence of mind for a only came to himself again when he had slept off the influenceof the draught 
 cle but has such a draught stranger ever really been knownamong men 
 ath no but if there had been might not such a draught havebeen of use to the legislator as a test of courage might we not goand say to him o legislator whether you are legislating for thecretan or for any other state would you not like to have atouchstone of the courage and cowardice of your citizens 
 cle i should will be the answer of every one 
 ath and you would rather have a touchstone in which there is norisk and no great danger than the reverse 
 cle in that proposition every one may safely agree 
 ath and in order to make use of the draught you would lead themamid these imaginary terrors and prove them when the affection offear was working upon them and compel them to be and admonishing them and also honouring them butdishonouring any one who will not be persuaded by you to be in allrespects such as you command him and if he underwent the trial welland manfully you would let him go unscathed but if ill you wouldinflict a punishment upon him or would you abstain from using thepotion altogether although you have no reason for abstaining 
 cle he would be certain stranger to use the potion 
 ath this would be a mode of testing and training which would bewonderfully easy in comparison with those now in use and might beapplied to a single person or to a few or indeed to any he would do well who provided himself with the potion only ratherthan with any number of other things whether he preferred to be byhimself in solitude and there contend with his fears because hewas ashamed to be seen by the eye of man until he was perfect ortrusting to the force of his own nature and habits and believing thathe had been already disciplined sufficiently he did not hesitate totrain himself in company with any number of others and display hispower in conquering the irresistible change effected by virtue being such that he never in any instance fell intoany great unseemliness but was always himself and left off before hearrived at the last cup fearing that he like all other men might beovercome by the potion 
 cle yes stranger in that last case too he might equally showhis 
 ath let us return to the lawgiver and say to is certainly no such which man has either receivedfrom the gods or himself discovered for witchcraft has no place atour board but is there any potion which might serve as a test ofoverboldness and excessive and indiscreet boasting 
 cle i suppose that he will say that wine is such apotion 
 ath is not the effect of this quite the opposite of the effect ofthe other when a man drinks wine he begins to be better pleasedwith himself and the more he drinks the more he is filled full ofbrave hopes and conceit of his power and at last the string of histongue is loosened and fancying himself wise he is brimming overwith lawlessness and has no more fear or respect and is ready todo or say anything 
 cle i think that every one will admit the truth of yourdescription 
 meg certainly 
 ath now let us remember as we were saying that there are twothings which should be cultivated in the soul first the greatestcourage secondly the greatest fear 
 cle which you said to be characteristic of reverence if i am notmistaken 
 ath thank you for reminding me but now as the habit of courageand fearlessness is to be trained amid fears let us considerwhether the opposite quality is not also to be trained amongopposites 
 cle that is probably the case 
 ath there are times and seasons at which we are by nature more thancommonly valiant and bold now we ought to train ourselves on theseoccasions to be as free from impudence and shamelessness aspossible and to be afraid to say or suffer or do anything that isbase 
 cle true 
 ath are not the moments in which we are apt to be bold andshameless such as we are under the influence of pride ignorance avarice cowardice or when wealth and all the intoxicating workings of pleasure madden is better adapted than the festive use of wine in the firstplace to test and in the second place to train the character of aman if care be taken in the use of it what is there cheaper or moreinnocent for do but consider which is the greater yourather test a man of a morose and savage nature which is the sourceof ten thousand acts of injustice by making bargains with him at arisk to yourself or by having him as a companion at the festival ofdionysus or would you if you wanted to apply a touchstone to a manwho is prone to love entrust your wife or your sons or daughters tohim perilling your dearest interests in order to have a view of thecondition of his soul i might mention numberless cases in whichthe advantage would be manifest of getting to know a character insport and without paying dearly for experience and i do notbelieve that either a cretan or any other man will doubt that such atest is a fair test and safer cheaper and speedier than any other 
 cle that is certainly true 
 ath and this knowledge of the natures and habits of soulswill be of the greatest use in that art which has the management ofthem and that art if i am not mistaken is politics 
 cle exactly so

 laws 
 by plato 
 translated by benjamin jowett 
 book i 
 
 persons of the dialogue an athenian stranger cleinias acretan megillus a lacedaemonian 
 athenian stranger tell me strangers is a god or some man supposedto be the author of your laws 
 cleinias a god stranger in very truth a god among us cretans heis said to have been zeus but in lacedaemon whence our friend herecomes i believe they would say that apollo is their lawgiver wouldthey not megillus 
 megillus certainly 
 ath and do you cleinias believe as homer tells that every ninthyear minos went to converse with his olympian sire and was inspiredby him to make laws for your cities 
 cle yes that is our tradition and there was rhadamanthus abrother of his with whose name you are familiar he is reputed tohave been the justest of men and we cretans are of opinion that heearned this reputation from his righteous administration of justicewhen he was alive 
 ath yes and a noble reputation it was worthy of a son of zeus asyou and megillus have been trained in these institutions i dare saythat you will not be unwilling to give an account of your governmentand laws on our way we can pass the time pleasantly in about i am told that the distance from cnosus to the cave and templeof zeus is considerable and doubtless there are shady places underthe lofty trees which will protect us from this scorching no longer young we may often stop to rest beneath them and getover the whole journey without difficulty beguiling the time byconversation 
 cle yes stranger and if we proceed onward we shall come to grovesof cypresses which are of rare height and beauty and there are greenmeadows in which we may repose and converse 
 ath very good 
 cle very good indeed and still better when we see them let usmove on cheerily 
 ath i am first i want to know why the law has ordainedthat you shall have common meals and gymnastic exercises and weararms 
 cle i think stranger that the aim of our institutions is easilyintelligible to any one look at the character of our country creteis not like thessaly a large plain and for this reason they havehorsemen in thessaly and we have inequality of the groundin our country is more adapted to locomotion on foot but then if youhave runners you must have light one can carry a heavyweight when running and bows and arrows are convenient because theyare light now all these regulations have been made with a view towar and the legislator appears to me to have looked to this in allhis common meals if i am not mistaken wereinstituted by him for a similar reason because he saw that while theyare in the field the citizens are by the nature of the casecompelled to take their meals together for the sake of mutualprotection he seems to me to have thought the world foolish in notunderstanding that all are always at war with one another and if inwar there ought to be common meals and certain persons regularlyappointed under others to protect an army they should be continued inpeace for what men in general term peace would be said by him to beonly a name in reality every city is in a natural state of war withevery other not indeed proclaimed by heralds but everlasting and ifyou look closely you will find that this was the intention of thecretan legislator all institutions private as well as public werearranged by him with a view to war in giving them he was under theimpression that no possessions or institutions are of any value to himwho is defeated in battle for all the good things of the conqueredpass into the hands of the conquerors 
 ath you appear to me stranger to have been thoroughly trainedin the cretan institutions and to be well informed about them willyou tell me a little more explicitly what is the principle ofgovernment which you would lay down you seem to imagine that a wellgoverned state ought to be so ordered as to conquer all other statesin war am i right in supposing this to be your meaning 
 cle certainly and our lacedaemonian friend if i am notmistaken will agree with me 
 meg why my good friend how could any lacedaemonian say anythingelse 
 ath and is what you say applicable only to states or also tovillages 
 cle to both alike 
 ath the case is the same 
 cle yes 
 ath and in the village will there be the same war of family againstfamily and of individual against individual 
 cle the same 
 ath and should each man conceive himself to be his shall we say 
 cle o athenian of attica i will not call you seem to deserve rather to be named after the goddessherself because you go back to first principles you have thrown alight upon the argument and will now be better able to understandwhat i was just all men are publicly one and each man privately his own 
 ath my good sir what do you mean 
 cle moreover there is a victory and first andbest of victories the lowest and worst of each mangains or sustains at the hands not of another but of himself thisshows that there is a war against ourselves going on within everyone of us 
 ath let us now reverse the order of the argument seeing that everyindividual is either his own superior or his own inferior may wesay that there is the same principle in the house the village andthe state 
 cle you mean that in each of them there is a principle ofsuperiority or inferiority to self 
 ath yes 
 cle you are quite right in asking the question for there certainlyis such a principle and above all in states and the state in whichthe better citizens win a victory over the mob and over the inferiorclasses may be truly said to be better than itself and may bejustly praised where such a victory is gained or censured in theopposite case 
 ath whether the better is ever really conquered by the worse is aquestion which requires more discussion and may be therefore left forthe present but i now quite understand your meaning when you say thatcitizens who are of the same race and live in the same cities mayunjustly conspire and having the superiority in numbers mayovercome and enslave the few just and when they prevail the statemay be truly called its own inferior and therefore bad and whenthey are defeated its own superior and therefore good 
 cle your remark stranger is a paradox and yet we cannot possiblydeny it 
 ath here is another case for a family there maybe several brothers who are the offspring of a single pair verypossibly the majority of them may be unjust and the just may be ina minority 
 cle very possibly 
 ath and you and i ought not to raise a question of words as towhether this family and household are rightly said to be superior whenthey conquer and inferior when they are conquered for we are not nowconsidering what may or may not be the proper or customary way ofspeaking but we are considering the natural principles of right andwrong in laws 
 cle what you say stranger is most true 
 meg quite excellent in my opinion as far as we have gone 
 ath again might there not be a judge over these brethren ofwhom we were speaking 
 cle certainly 
 ath now which would be the better who destroyed thebad and appointed the good to govern themselves or one who whileallowing the good to govern let the bad live and made themvoluntarily submit or third i suppose in the scale of excellencemight be placed a judge who finding the family distracted notonly did not destroy any one but reconciled them to one another forever after and gave them laws which they mutually observed and wasable to keep them friends 
 cle the last would be by far the best sort of judge and legislator 
 ath and yet the aim of all the laws which he gave would be thereverse of war 
 cle very true 
 ath and will he who constitutes the state and orders the life ofman have in view external war or that kind of intestine war calledcivil which no one if he could prevent would like to have occurringin his own state and when occurring every one would wish to bequit of as soon as possible 
 cle he would have the latter chiefly in view 
 ath and would he prefer that this civil war should be terminated bythe destruction of one of the parties and by the victory of theother or that peace and friendship should be andthat being reconciled they should give their attention to foreignenemies 
 cle every one would desire the latter in the case of his own state 
 ath and would not that also be the desire of the legislator 
 cle certainly 
 ath and would not every one always make laws for the sake of thebest 
 cle to be sure 
 ath but war whether external or civil is not the best and theneed of either is to be deprecated but peace with one another andgood will are best nor is the victory of the state over itself to beregarded as a really good thing but as a necessity a man might aswell say that the body was in the best state when sick and purged bymedicine forgetting that there is also a state of the body whichneeds no purge and in like manner no one can be a true he aims at the happiness of the individual or state who looksonly or first of all to external warfare nor will he ever be asound legislator who orders peace for the sake of war and not war forthe sake of peace 
 cle i suppose that there is truth stranger in that remark ofyours and yet i am greatly mistaken if war is not the entire aimand object of our own institutions and also of the lacedaemonian 
 ath i dare say but there is no reason why we should rudely quarrelwith one another about your legislators instead of gently questioningthem seeing that both we and they are equally in earnest pleasefollow me and the argument first i will put forwardtyrtaeus an athenian by birth but also a spartan citizen who of allmen was most eager about war well he says i sing not i carenot about any man even if he were the richest of men andpossessed every good and then he gives a whole list of them if hebe not at all times a brave warrior i imagine that you too musthave heard his poems our lacedaemonian friend has probably heard morethan enough of them 
 meg very true 
 cle and they have found their way from lacedaemon to crete 
 ath come now and let us all join in asking this question oftyrtaeus o most divine poet we will say to him the excellent praisewhich you have bestowed on those who excel in war sufficientlyproves that you are wise and good and i and megillus and cleiniasof cnosus do as i believe entirely agree with you but we shouldlike to be quite sure that we are speaking of the same men tell do you agree with us in thinking that there are two kinds ofwar or what would you say a far inferior man to tyrtaeus wouldhave no difficulty in replying quite truly that war is of two kindsone which is universally called civil war and is as we were justnow saying of all wars the worst the other as we should alladmit in which we fall out with other nations who are of adifferent race is a far milder form of warfare 
 cle certainly far milder 
 ath well now when you praise and blame war in this whom are you praising or blaming and to which kind of war areyou referring i suppose that you must mean foreign war if i am tojudge from expressions of yours in which you say that you abominatethose 
 who refuse to look upon fields of blood and will not draw nearand strike at their we shall naturally go on to say to tyrtaeus as it those who distinguish themselves in external and foreign he must admit this 
 cle evidently 
 ath they are good but we say that there are still better men whosevirtue is displayed in the greatest of all battles and we too havea poet whom we summon as a witness theognis citizen of megara insicily 
 cyrnus he who is faithful in a civil broil is worth his weight ingold and such an one is far better as we affirm than the other in amore difficult kind of war much in the same degree as justice andtemperance and wisdom when united with courage are better thancourage only for a man cannot be faithful and good in civil strifewithout having all virtue but in the war of which tyrtaeus a mercenary soldier will take his stand and be ready to die athis post and yet they are generally and almost without exceptioninsolent unjust violent men and the most senseless of human will ask what the conclusion is and what i am seeking to prove imaintain that the divine legislator of crete like any other who isworthy of consideration will always and above all things in makinglaws have regard to the greatest virtue which according to loyalty in the hour of danger and may be truly called perfectjustice whereas that virtue which tyrtaeus highly praises is wellenough and was praised by the poet at the right time yet in placeand dignity may be said to be only fourth rate 
 cle stranger we are degrading our inspired lawgiver to a rankwhich is far beneath him 
 ath nay i think that we degrade not him but ourselves if weimagine that lycurgus and minos laid down laws both in lacedaemonand crete mainly with a view to war 
 cle what ought we to say then 
 ath what truth and what justice require of us if i am notmistaken when speaking in behalf of divine thelegislator when making his laws had in view not a part only andthis the lowest part of virtue but all virtue and that he devisedclasses of laws answering to the kinds of virtue not in the way inwhich modern inventors of laws make the classes for they onlyinvestigate and offer laws whenever a want is felt and one man hasa class of laws about allotments and heiresses another aboutassaults others about ten thousand other such matters but wemaintain that the right way of examining into laws is to proceed as wehave now done and i admired the spirit of your exposition for youwere quite right in beginning with virtue and saying that this wasthe aim of the giver of the law but i thought that you went wrongwhen you added that all his legislation had a view only to a part andthe least part of virtue and this called forth my subsequent you allow me then to explain how i should have liked to haveheard you expound the matter 
 cle by all means 
 ath you ought to have said cretan laws are withreason famous among the hellenes for they fulfil the object oflaws which is to make those who use them happy and they confer everysort of good now goods are of two kinds there are human and thereare divine goods and the human hang upon the divine and the statewhich attains the greater at the same time acquires the less or nothaving the greater has neither of the lesser goods the first ishealth the second beauty the third strength including swiftnessin running and bodily agility generally and the fourth is wealth notthe blind god pluto but one who is keen of sight if only he haswisdom for his companion for wisdom is chief and leader of the divinedass of goods and next follows temperance and from the union ofthese two with courage springs justice and fourth in the scale ofvirtue is courage all these naturally take precedence of the othergoods and this is the order in which the legislator must placethem and after them he will enjoin the rest of his ordinances onthe citizens with a view to these the human looking to the the divine looking to their leader mind some of his ordinanceswill relate to contracts of marriage which they make one with then to the procreation and education of children both male andfemale the duty of the lawgiver will be to take charge of hiscitizens in youth and age and at every time of life and to givethem punishments and rewards and in reference to all theirintercourse with one another he ought to consider their pains andpleasures and desires and the vehemence of all their passions heshould keep a watch over them and blame and praise them rightly bythe mouth of the laws themselves also with regard to anger andterror and the other perturbations of the soul which arise out ofmisfortune and the deliverances from them which prosperity the experiences which come to men in diseases or in war orpoverty or the opposite of these in all these states he shoulddetermine and teach what is the good and evil of the condition ofeach in the next place the legislator has to be careful how thecitizens make their money and in what way they spend it and to havean eye to their mutual contracts and dissolutions of voluntary or involuntary he should see how they order allthis and consider where justice as well as injustice is found or iswanting in their several dealings with one another and honour thosewho obey the law and impose fixed penalties on those who the round of civil life is ended and the time has come forthe consideration of the proper funeral rites and honours of the the lawgiver reviewing his work will appoint guardians to presideover these who walk by intelligence others by trueopinion only and then mind will bind together all his ordinancesand show them to be in harmony with temperance and justice and notwith wealth or ambition this is the spirit stranger in which iwas and am desirous that you should pursue the subject and i wantto know the nature of all these things and how they are arranged inthe laws of zeus as they are termed and in those of the pythianapollo which minos and lycurgus gave and how the order of them isdiscovered to his eyes who has experience in laws gained either bystudy or habit although they are far from being to therest of mankind like ourselves 
 cle how shall we proceed stranger 
 ath i think that we must begin again as before and firstconsider the habit of courage and then we will go on and discussanother and then another form of virtue if you please in this way weshall have a model of the whole and with these and similar discourseswe will beguile the way and when we have gone through all thevirtues we will show by the grace of god that the institutions ofwhich i was speaking look to virtue 
 meg very good and suppose that you first criticize this praiser ofzeus and the laws of crete 
 ath i will try to criticize you and myself as well as him for theargument is a common concern tell not first the syssitia andsecondly the gymnasia invented by your legislator with a view to war 
 meg yes 
 ath and what comes third and what fourth for that i think isthe sort of enumeration which ought to be made of the remainingparts of virtue no matter whether you call them parts or what theirname is provided the meaning is clear 
 meg then i or any other lacedaemonian would reply that hunting isthird in order 
 ath let us see if we can discover what comes fourth and fifth 
 meg i think that i can get as far as the fouth head which is thefrequent endurance of pain exhibited among us spartans in fights also in stealing with the prospect of getting agood beating there is too the crypteia or secretservice in which wonderful endurance is people wanderover the whole country by day and by night and even in winter havenot a shoe to their foot and are without beds to lie upon and haveto attend upon themselves marvellous too is the endurance which ourcitizens show in their naked exercises contending against the violentsummer heat and there are many similar practices to speak of whichin detail would be endless 
 ath excellent o lacedaemonian stranger but how ought we to definecourage is it to be regarded only as a combat against fears andpains or also against desires and pleasures and againstflatteries which exercise such a tremendous power that they make thehearts even of respectable citizens to melt like wax 
 meg i should say the latter 
 ath in what preceded as you will remember our cnosian friendwas speaking of a man or a city being inferior to younot cleinias 
 cle i was 
 ath now which is in the truest sense inferior the man who isovercome by pleasure or by pain 
 cle i should say the man who is overcome by pleasure for all mendeem him to be inferior in a more disgraceful sense than the otherwho is overcome by pain 
 ath but surely the lawgivers of crete and lacedaemon have notlegislated for a courage which is lame of one leg able only to meetattacks which come from the left but impotent against the insidiousflatteries which come from the right 
 cle able to meet both i should say 
 ath then let me once more ask what institutions have you in eitherof your states which give a taste of pleasures and do not avoidthem any more than they avoid pains but which set a person in themidst of them and compel or induce him by the prospect of reward toget the better of them where is an ordinance about pleasure similarto that about pain to be found in your laws tell me what there isof this nature among is there which makes your citizenequally brave against pleasure and pain conquering what they ought toconquer and superior to the enemies who are most dangerous andnearest home 
 meg i was able to tell you stranger many laws which were directedagainst pain but i do not know that i can point out any great orobvious examples of similar institutions which are concerned withpleasure there are some lesser provisions however which i mightmention 
 cle neither can i show anything of that sort which is at allequally prominent in the cretan laws 
 ath no wonder my dear friends and if as is very likely in oursearch after the true and good one of us may have to censure the lawsof the others we must not be offended but take kindly what anothersays 
 cle you are quite right athenian stranger and we will do as yousay 
 ath at our time of life cleinias there should be no feeling ofirritation 
 cle certainly not 
 ath i will not at present determine whether he who censures thecretan or lacedaemonian polities is right or wrong but i believe thati can tell better than either of you what the many say about them forassuming that you have reasonably good laws one of the best of themwill be the law forbidding any young men to enquire which of themare right or wrong but with one mouth and one voice they must allagree that the laws are all good for they came from god and anyone who says the contrary is not to be listened to but an old man whoremarks any defect in your laws may communicate his observation to aruler or to an equal in years when no young man is present 
 cle exactly so stranger and like a diviner although not there atthe time you seem to me quite to have hit the meaning of thelegislator and to say what is most true 
 ath as there are no young men present and the legislator has givenold men free licence there will be no impropriety in our discussingthese very matters now that we are alone 
 cle true and therefore you may be as free as you like in yourcensure of our laws for there is no discredit in knowing what iswrong he who receives what is said in a generous and friendlyspirit will be all the better for it 
 ath very good however i am not going to say anything against yourlaws until to the best of my ability i have examined them but i amgoing to raise doubts about them for you are the only people known tous whether greek or barbarian whom the legislator commanded toeschew all great pleasures and amusements and never to touch in the matter of pains or fears which we have just beendiscussing he thought that they who from infancy had always avoidedpains and fears and sorrows when they were compelled to face themwould run away from those who were hardened in them and wouldbecome their subjects now the legislator ought to have consideredthat this was equally true of pleasure he should have said tohimself that if our citizens are from their youth upward unacquaintedwith the greatest pleasures and unused to endure amid the temptationsof pleasure and are not disciplined to refrain from all thingsevil the sweet feeling of pleasure will overcome them just as fearwould overcome the former class and in another and even a worsemanner they will be the slaves of those who are able to endure amidpleasures and have had the opportunity of enjoying them they beingoften the worst of mankind one half of their souls will be a other half free and they will not be worthy to be called in thetrue sense men and freemen tell me whether you assent to my words 
 cle on first hearing what you say appears to be the truth butto be hasty in coming to a conclusion about such important matterswould be very childish and simple 
 ath suppose cleinias and megillus that we consider the virtuewhich follows next of those which we intended to discuss for aftercourage comes temperance what institutions shall we find relating totemperance either in crete or lacedaemon which like your militaryinstitutions differ from those of any ordinary state 
 meg that is not an easy question to answer still i should say thatthe common meals and gymnastic exercises have been excellently devisedfor the promotion both of temperance and courage 
 ath there seems to be a difficulty stranger with regard tostates in making words and facts coincide so that there can be nodispute about them as in the human body the regimen which doesgood in one way does harm in another and we can hardly say that anyone course of treatment is adapted to a particular constitution nowthe gymnasia and common meals do a great deal of good and yet theyare a source of evil in civil troubles as is shown in the case of themilesian and boeotian and thurian youth among whom theseinstitutions seem always to have had a tendency to degrade the ancientand natural custom of love below the level not only of man but ofthe beasts the charge may be fairly brought against your cities aboveall others and is true also of most other states which especiallycultivate gymnastics whether such matters are to be regardedjestingly or seriously i think that the pleasure is to be deemednatural which arises out of the intercourse between men and women butthat the intercourse of men with men or of women with women iscontrary to nature and that the bold attempt was originally due tounbridled lust the cretans are always accused of having inventedthe story of ganymede and zeus because they wanted to justifythemselves in the enjoyment of unnatural pleasures by the practiceof the god whom they believe to have been their lawgiver leavingthe story we may observe that any speculation about laws turns almostentirely on pleasure and pain both in states and in are two fountains which nature lets flow and he who drawsfrom them where and when and as much as he ought is happy andthis holds of men and individuals as well as states and hewho indulges in them ignorantly and at the wrong time is thereverse of happy 
 meg i admit stranger that your words are well spoken and ihardly know what to say in answer to you but still i think that thespartan lawgiver was quite right in forbidding pleasure of the cretanlaws i shall leave the defence to my cnosian friend but the lawsof sparta in as far as they relate to pleasure appear to me to bethe best in the world for that which leads mankind in general intothe wildest pleasure and licence and every other folly the law hasclean driven out and neither in the country nor in towns which areunder the control of sparta will you find revelries and the manyincitements of every kind of pleasure which accompany them and anyone who meets a drunken and disorderly person will immediately havehim most severely punished and will not let him off on anypretence not even at the time of a dionysiac festival although ihave remarked that this may happen at your performances on the they are called and among our tarentine colonists i have seenthe whole city drunk at a dionysiac festival but nothing of thesort happens among us 
 ath o lacedaemonian stranger these festivities are praiseworthywhere there is a spirit of endurance but are very senseless when theyare under no regulations in order to retaliate an athenian hasonly to point out the licence which exists among your women to allsuch accusations whether they are brought against the us or you there is one answer which exonerates the practice inquestion from impropriety when a stranger expresses wonder at thesingularity of what he sees any inhabitant will naturally not o stranger this is our custom and you may verylikely have some other custom about the same things now we arespeaking my friends not about men in general but about the meritsand defects of the lawgivers themselves let us then discourse alittle more at length about intoxication which is a very importantsubject and will seriously task the discrimination of the am not speaking of drinking or not drinking wine at all but ofintoxication are we to follow the custom of the scythians andpersians and carthaginians and celts and iberians and are all warlike nations or that of your countrymen for you say altogether abstain but the scythians and men and women drink unmixed wine which they pour on theirgarments and this they think a happy and glorious institution thepersians again are much given to other practices of luxury which youreject but they have more moderation in them than the thracians andscythians 
 meg o best of men we have only to take arms into our hands and wesend all these nations flying before us 
 ath nay my good friend do not say that there have been as therealways will be flights and pursuits of which no account can be therefore we cannot say that victory or defeat in battle affordsmore than a doubtful proof of the goodness or badness of when the greater states conquer and enslave the lesser as thesyracusans have done the locrians who appear to be people in their part of the world or as the athenianshave done the ceans and there are ten thousand other instances of thesame sort of thing all this is not to the point let us endeavourrather to form a conclusion about each institution in itself and saynothing at present of victories and defeats let us only say thatsuch and such a custom is honourable and another not and firstpermit me to tell you how good and bad are to be estimated inreference to these very matters 
 meg how do you mean 
 ath all those who are ready at a notice to praise orcensure any practice which is matter of discussion seem to me toproceed in a wrong way let me give you an illustration of what may suppose a person to be praising wheat as a good kindof food whereupon another person instantly blames wheat without everenquiring into its effect or use or in what way or to whom orwith what or in what state and how wheat is to be given and that isjust what we are doing in this discussion at the very mention ofthe word intoxication one side is ready with their praises and theother with their censures which is absurd for either side adducetheir witnesses and approvers and some of us think that we speak withauthority because we have many witnesses and others because theysee those who abstain conquering in battle and this again is disputedby us now i cannot say that i shall be satisfied if we go ondiscussing each of the remaining laws in the same way and aboutthis very point of intoxication i should like to speak in another i hold to be the right one for if number is to be thecriterion are there not myriads upon myriads of nations ready todispute the point with you who are only two cities 
 meg i shall gladly welcome any method of enquiry which is right 
 ath let me put the matter a person to praise thekeeping of goats and the creatures themselves as capital things tohave and then some one who had seen goats feeding without agoatherd in cultivated spots and doing mischief were to censure agoat or any other animal who has no keeper or a bad keeper wouldthere be any sense or justice in such censure 
 meg certainly not 
 ath does a captain require only to have nautical knowledge in orderto be a good captain whether he is or not what do you say 
 meg i say that he is not a good captain if although he havenautical skill he is liable to 
 ath and what would you say of the commander of an army will hebe able to command merely because he has military skill if he be acoward who when danger comes is sick and drunk with fear 
 meg impossible 
 ath and what if besides being a coward he has no skill 
 meg he is a miserable fellow not fit to be a commander of men butonly of old women 
 ath and what would you say of some one who blames or praises anysort of meeting which is intended by nature to have a ruler and iswell enough when under his presidency the critic however hasnever seen the society meeting together at an orderly feast underthe control of a president but always without a ruler or with a observers of this class praise or blame such meetings arewe to suppose that what they say is of any value 
 meg certainly not if they have never seen or been present atsuch a meeting when rightly ordered 
 ath reflect may not banqueters and banquets be said toconstitute a kind of meeting 
 meg of course 
 ath and did any one ever see this sort of convivial meeting rightlyordered of course you two will answer that you have never seen themat all because they are not customary or lawful in your i have come across many of them in many different places andmoreover i have made enquiries about them wherever i went as i maysay and never did i see or hear of anything of the kind which wascarried on altogether rightly in some few particulars they might beright but in general they were utterly wrong 
 cle what do you mean stranger by this remark explain for we asyou say from our inexperience in such matters might very likelynot know even if they came in our way what was right or wrong insuch societies 
 ath likely enough then let me try to be your instructor you wouldacknowledge would you not that in all gatherings of man kind ofwhatever sort there ought to be a leader 
 cle certainly i should 
 ath and we were saying just now that when men are at war theleader ought to be a brave man 
 cle we were 
 ath the brave man is less likely than the coward to be disturbed byfears 
 cle that again is true 
 ath and if there were a possibility of having a general of anarmy who was absolutely fearless and imperturbable should we not byall means appoint him 
 cle assuredly 
 ath now however we are speaking not of a general who is tocommand an army when foe meets foe in time of war but of one whois to regulate meetings of another sort when friend meets friend intime of peace 
 cle true 
 ath and that sort of meeting if attended with drunkenness isapt to be unquiet 
 cle certainly the reverse of quiet 
 ath in the first place then the revellers as well as the soldierswill require a ruler 
 cle to be sure no men more so 
 ath and we ought if possible to provide them with a quiet ruler 
 cle of course 
 ath and he should be a man who understands society for his duty isto preserve the friendly feelings which exist among the company at thetime and to increase them for the future by his use of the occasion 
 cle very true 
 ath must we not appoint a sober man and a wise to be our masterof the revels for if the ruler of drinkers be himself young anddrunken and not only by some special good fortune willhe be saved from doing some great evil 
 cle it will be by a singular good fortune that he is saved 
 ath now suppose such associations to be framed in the best waypossible in states and that some one blames the very fact of may very likely be right but if he blames a practicewhich he only sees very much mismanaged he shows in the first placethat he is not aware of the mismanagement and also not aware thateverything done in this way will turn out to be wrong because donewithout the superintendence of a sober ruler do you not see that adrunken pilot or a drunken ruler of any sort will ruin in short of which he has the direction 
 cle the last remark is very true stranger and i see quite clearlythe advantage of an army having a good will give victoryin war to his followers which is a very great advantage and so ofother things but i do not see any similar advantage which eitherindividuals or states gain from the good management of a feast andi want you to tell me what great good will be effected supposing thatthis drinking ordinance is duly established 
 ath if you mean to ask what great good accrues to the state fromthe right training of a single youth or of a single thequestion is put in that form we cannot deny that the good is not verygreat in any particular instance but if you ask what is the good ofeducation in general the answer is education makes goodmen and that good men act nobly and conquer their enemies in they are good education certainly gives victory althoughvictory sometimes produces forgetfulness of education for many havegrown insolent from victory in war and this insolence hasengendered in them innumerable evils and many a victory has beenand will be suicidal to the victors but education is never suicidal 
 cle you seem to imply my friend that convivial meetings whenrightly ordered are an important element of education 
 ath certainly i do 
 cle and can you show that what you have been saying is true 
 ath to be absolutely sure of the truth of matters concerningwhich there are many opinions is an attribute of the gods not givento man stranger but i shall be very happy to tell you what ithink especially as we are now proposing to enter on a discussionconcerning laws and constitutions 
 cle your opinion stranger about the questions which are now beingraised is precisely what we want to hear 
 ath very good i will try to find a way of explaining my you shall try to have the gift of understanding me but firstlet me make an apology the athenian citizen is reputed among allthe hellenes to be a great talker whereas sparta is renowned forbrevity and the cretans have more wit than words now i am afraidof appearing to elicit a very long discourse out of very smallmaterials for drinking indeed may appear to be a slight matter andyet is one which cannot be rightly ordered according to correct principles of music these are necessary to anyclear or satisfactory treatment of the subject and music again runsup into education generally and there is much to be said about allthis what would you say then to leaving these matters for thepresent and passing on to some other question of law 
 meg o athenian stranger let me tell you what perhaps you do notknow that our family is the proxenus of your state i imagine thatfrom their earliest youth all boys when they are told that they arethe proxeni of a particular state feel kindly towards their secondand this has certainly been my own feeling i can well remember fromthe days of my boyhood how when any lacedaemonians praised or blamedthe athenians they used to say to megillus how ill or howwell as the case might be has your state treated us and havingalways had to fight your battles against detractors when i heard youassailed i became warmly attached to you and i always like to hearthe athenian tongue spoken the common saying is quite true that agood athenian is more than ordinarily good for he is the only man whois freely and genuinely good by the divine inspiration of his ownnature and is not manufactured therefore be assured that i shalllike to hear you say whatever you have to say 
 cle yes stranger and when you have heard me speak say boldlywhat is in your thoughts let me remind you of a tie which unitesyou to crete you must have heard here the story of the prophetepimenides who was of my family and came to athens ten yearsbefore the persian war in accordance with the response of the offered certain sacrifices which the god commanded theathenians were at that time in dread of the persian invasion and hesaid that for ten years they would not come and that when theycame they would go away again without accomplishing any of theirobjects and would suffer more evil than they inflicted at thattime my forefathers formed ties of hospitality with you thusancient is the friendship which i and my parents have had for you 
 ath you seem to be quite ready to listen and i am also ready toperform as much as i can of an almost impossible task which i willnevertheless attempt at the outset of the discussion let me definethe nature and power of education for this is the way by which ourargument must travel onwards to the god dionysus 
 cle let us proceed if you please 
 ath well then if i tell you what are my notions of you consider whether they satisfy you 
 cle let us hear 
 ath according to my view any one who would be good at anythingmust practise that thing from his youth upwards both in sport andearnest in its several branches for example he who is to be agood builder should play at building houses he who isto be a good husbandman at tilling the ground and those who have thecare of their education should provide them when young with mimictools they should learn beforehand the knowledge which they willafterwards require for their art for example the future carpentershould learn to measure or apply the line in play and the futurewarrior should learn riding or some other exercise for the teacher should endeavour to direct the inclinationsand pleasures by the help of amusements to their final aim inlife the most important part of education is right training in thenursery the soul of the child in his play should be guided to thelove of that sort of excellence in which when he grows up to manhoodhe will have to be perfected do you agree with me thus far 
 cle certainly 
 ath then let us not leave the meaning of education ambiguous at present when we speak in terms of praise or blameabout the of each person we call one man educated andanother uneducated although the uneducated man may be sometimesvery well educated for the calling of a retail trader or of a captainof a ship and the like for we are not speaking of education inthis narrower sense but of that other education in virtue fromyouth upwards which makes a man eagerly pursue the ideal perfectionof citizenship and teaches him how rightly to rule and how to is the only education which upon our view deserves the other sort of training which aims at the acquisition of wealthor bodily strength or mere cleverness apart from intelligence andjustice is mean and illiberal and is not worthy to be callededucation at all but let us not quarrel with one another about aword provided that the proposition which has just been granted holdgood to wit that those who are rightly educated generally becomegood men neither must we cast a slight upon education which is thefirst and fairest thing that the best of men can ever have and liable to take a wrong direction is capable of this work of reformation is the great business of every manwhile he lives 
 cle very true and we entirely agree with you 
 ath and we agreed before that they are good men who are able torule themselves and bad men who are not 
 cle you are quite right 
 ath let me now proceed if i can to clear up the subject alittle further by an illustration which i will offer you 
 cle proceed 
 ath do we not consider each of ourselves to be one 
 cle we do 
 ath and each one of us has in his bosom two counsellors bothfoolish and also antagonistic of which we call the one the other pain 
 cle exactly 
 ath also there are opinions about the future which have thegeneral name of expectations and the specific name of fear whenthe expectation is of pain and of hope when of pleasure andfurther there is reflection about the good or evil of them and embodied in a decree by the state is called law 
 cle i am hardly able to follow you proceed however as if i were 
 meg i am in the like case 
 ath let us look at the matter thus may we not conceive each ofus living beings to be a puppet of the gods either their playthingonly or created with a of the two we cannot certainlyknow but we do know that these affections in us are like cords andstrings which pull us different and opposite ways and to oppositeactions and herein lies the difference between virtue and to the argument there is one among these cords which everyman ought to grasp and never let go but to pull with it against allthe rest and this is the sacred and golden cord of reason calledby us the common law of the state there are others which are hard andof iron but this one is soft because golden and there are severalother kinds now we ought always to cooperate with the lead of thebest which is law for inasmuch as reason is beautiful and not violent her rule must needs have ministers in order to helpthe golden principle in vanquishing the other principles and thus themoral of the tale about our being puppets will not have been lost andthe meaning of the expression superior or inferior to a become clearer and the individual attaining to right reasonin this matter of pulling the strings of the puppet should liveaccording to its rule while the city receiving the same from somegod or from one who has knowledge of these things should embody it ina law to be her guide in her dealings with herself and with otherstates in this way virtue and vice will be more clearly distinguishedby us and when they have become clearer education and otherinstitutions will in like manner become clearer and in particularthat question of convivial entertainment which may seem have been a very trifling matter and to have taken a great manymore words than were necessary 
 cle perhaps however the theme may turn out not to be unworthyof the length of discourse 
 ath very good let us proceed with any enquiry which really bearson our present object 
 cle proceed 
 ath suppose that we give this puppet of ours will be theeffect on him 
 cle having what in view do you ask that question 
 ath nothing as yet but i ask generally when the puppet is broughtto the drink what sort of result is likely to follow i willendeavour to explain my meaning more clearly what i am now askingis the drinking of wine heighten and increase pleasuresand pains and passions and loves 
 cle very greatly 
 ath and are perception and memory and opinion and and increased do not these qualities entirely desert a manif he becomes saturated with drink 
 cle yes they entirely desert him 
 ath does he not return to the state of soul in which he was whena young child 
 cle he does 
 ath then at that time he will have the least control over himself 
 cle the least 
 ath and will he not be in a most wretched plight 
 cle most wretched 
 ath then not only an old man but also a drunkard becomes a secondtime a child 
 cle well said stranger 
 ath is there any argument which will prove to us that we ought toencourage the taste for drinking instead of doing all we can toavoid it 
 cle i suppose that there is you at any rate were just nowsaying that you were ready to maintain such a doctrine 
 ath true i was and i am ready still seeing that you have bothdeclared that you are anxious to hear me 
 cle to sure we are if only for the strangeness of the asserts that a man ought of his own accord to plunge intoutter degradation 
 ath are you speaking of the soul 
 cle yes 
 ath and what would you say about the body my friend are you notsurprised at any one of his own accord bringing upon himselfdeformity leanness ugliness decrepitude 
 cle certainly 
 ath yet when a man goes of his own accord to a shop andtakes medicine is he not aware that soon and for many daysafterwards he will be in a state of body which he would die ratherthan accept as the permanent condition of his life are not thosewho train in gymnasia at first beginning reduced to a state ofweakness 
 cle yes all that is well known 
 ath also that they go of their own accord for the sake of thesubsequent benefit 
 cle very good 
 ath and we may conceive this to be true in the same way of otherpractices 
 cle certainly 
 ath and the same view may be taken of the pastime of drinking we are right in supposing that the same good effect follows 
 cle to be sure 
 ath if such convivialities should turn out to have any advantageequal in importance to that of gymnastic they are in their verynature to be preferred to mere bodily exercise inasmuch as theyhave no accompaniment of pain 
 cle true but i hardly think that we shall be able to discoverany such benefits to be derived from them 
 ath that is just what we must endeavour to show and let me ask youa we not distinguish two kinds of fear which are verydifferent 
 cle what are they 
 ath there is the fear of expected evil 
 cle yes 
 ath and there is the fear of an evil reputation we are afraidof being thought evil because we do or say some dishonourablething which fear we and all men term shame 
 cle certainly 
 ath these are the two fears as i called them one of which isthe opposite of pain and other fears and the opposite also of thegreatest and most numerous sort of pleasures 
 cle very true 
 ath and does not the legislator and every one who is good foranything hold this fear in the greatest honour this is what he termsreverence and the confidence which is the reverse of this he termsinsolence and the latter he always deems to be a very great evil bothto individuals and to states 
 cle true 
 ath does not this kind of fear preserve us in many importantways what is there which so surely gives victory and safety in there are two things which give before fear of disgrace before friends 
 cle there are 
 ath then each of us should be fearless and also fearful and why weshould be either has now been determined 
 cle certainly 
 ath and when we want to make any one fearless we and the law bringhim face to face with many fears 
 cle clearly 
 ath and when we want to make him rightly fearful must we notintroduce him to shameless pleasures and train him to take up armsagainst them and to overcome them or does this principle apply tocourage only and must he who would be perfect in valour fight againstand overcome his own natural if he be unpractisedand inexperienced in such conflicts he will not be half the man whichhe might have are we to suppose that with temperance it isotherwise and that he who has never fought with the shameless andunrighteous temptations of his pleasures and lusts and conqueredthem in earnest and in play by word deed and act will still beperfectly temperate 
 cle a most unlikely supposition 
 ath suppose that some god had given a to men andthat the more a man drank of this the more he regarded himself atevery draught as a child of misfortune and that he fearedeverything happening or about to happen to him and that at last themost courageous of men utterly lost his presence of mind for a only came to himself again when he had slept off the influenceof the draught 
 cle but has such a draught stranger ever really been knownamong men 
 ath no but if there had been might not such a draught havebeen of use to the legislator as a test of courage might we not goand say to him o legislator whether you are legislating for thecretan or for any other state would you not like to have atouchstone of the courage and cowardice of your citizens 
 cle i should will be the answer of every one 
 ath and you would rather have a touchstone in which there is norisk and no great danger than the reverse 
 cle in that proposition every one may safely agree 
 ath and in order to make use of the draught you would lead themamid these imaginary terrors and prove them when the affection offear was working upon them and compel them to be and admonishing them and also honouring them butdishonouring any one who will not be persuaded by you to be in allrespects such as you command him and if he underwent the trial welland manfully you would let him go unscathed but if ill you wouldinflict a punishment upon him or would you abstain from using thepotion altogether although you have no reason for abstaining 
 cle he would be certain stranger to use the potion 
 ath this would be a mode of testing and training which would bewonderfully easy in comparison with those now in use and might beapplied to a single person or to a few or indeed to any he would do well who provided himself with the potion only ratherthan with any number of other things whether he preferred to be byhimself in solitude and there contend with his fears because hewas ashamed to be seen by the eye of man until he was perfect ortrusting to the force of his own nature and habits and believing thathe had been already disciplined sufficiently he did not hesitate totrain himself in company with any number of others and display hispower in conquering the irresistible change effected by virtue being such that he never in any instance fell intoany great unseemliness but was always himself and left off before hearrived at the last cup fearing that he like all other men might beovercome by the potion 
 cle yes stranger in that last case too he might equally showhis 
 ath let us return to the lawgiver and say to is certainly no such which man has either receivedfrom the gods or himself discovered for witchcraft has no place atour board but is there any potion which might serve as a test ofoverboldness and excessive and indiscreet boasting 
 cle i suppose that he will say that wine is such apotion 
 ath is not the effect of this quite the opposite of the effect ofthe other when a man drinks wine he begins to be better pleasedwith himself and the more he drinks the more he is filled full ofbrave hopes and conceit of his power and at last the string of histongue is loosened and fancying himself wise he is brimming overwith lawlessness and has no more fear or respect and is ready todo or say anything 
 cle i think that every one will admit the truth of yourdescription 
 meg certainly 
 ath now let us remember as we were saying that there are twothings which should be cultivated in the soul first the greatestcourage secondly the greatest fear 
 cle which you said to be characteristic of reverence if i am notmistaken 
 ath thank you for reminding me but now as the habit of courageand fearlessness is to be trained amid fears let us considerwhether the opposite quality is not also to be trained amongopposites 
 cle that is probably the case 
 ath there are times and seasons at which we are by nature more thancommonly valiant and bold now we ought to train ourselves on theseoccasions to be as free from impudence and shamelessness aspossible and to be afraid to say or suffer or do anything that isbase 
 cle true 
 ath are not the moments in which we are apt to be bold andshameless such as we are under the influence of pride ignorance avarice cowardice or when wealth and all the intoxicating workings of pleasure madden is better adapted than the festive use of wine in the firstplace to test and in the second place to train the character of aman if care be taken in the use of it what is there cheaper or moreinnocent for do but consider which is the greater yourather test a man of a morose and savage nature which is the sourceof ten thousand acts of injustice by making bargains with him at arisk to yourself or by having him as a companion at the festival ofdionysus or would you if you wanted to apply a touchstone to a manwho is prone to love entrust your wife or your sons or daughters tohim perilling your dearest interests in order to have a view of thecondition of his soul i might mention numberless cases in whichthe advantage would be manifest of getting to know a character insport and without paying dearly for experience and i do notbelieve that either a cretan or any other man will doubt that such atest is a fair test and safer cheaper and speedier than any other 
 cle that is certainly true 
 ath and this knowledge of the natures and habits of soulswill be of the greatest use in that art which has the management ofthem and that art if i am not mistaken is politics 
 cle exactly so

 book ii 
 
 athenian stranger and now we have to consider whether the insightinto human nature is the only benefit derived from well orderedpotations or whether there are not other advantages great and much tobe desired the argument seems to imply that there are but how and inwhat way these are to be attained will have to be consideredattentively or we may be entangled in error 
 cleinias proceed 
 ath let me once more recall our doctrine of right education i am not mistaken depends on the due regulation of convivialintercourse 
 cle you talk rather grandly 
 ath pleasure and pain i maintain to be the first perceptions ofchildren and i say that they are the forms under which virtue andvice are originally present to them as to wisdom and true and fixedopinions happy is the man who acquires them even when declining inyears and we may say that he who possesses them and the blessingswhich are contained in them is a perfect man now i mean by educationthat training which is given by suitable habits to the first instinctsof virtue in pleasure and friendship and pain andhatred are rightly implanted in souls not yet capable ofunderstanding the nature of them and who find them after they haveattained reason to be in harmony with her this harmony of thesoul taken as a whole is virtue but the particular training inrespect of pleasure and pain which leads you always to hate whatyou ought to hate and love what you ought to love from thebeginning of life to the end may be separated off and in my be rightly called education 
 cle i think stranger that you are quite right in all that youhave said and are saying about education 
 ath i am glad to hear that you agree with me for indeed thediscipline of pleasure and pain which when rightly ordered is aprinciple of education has been often relaxed and corrupted inhuman life and the gods pitying the toils which our race is bornto undergo have appointed holy festivals wherein men alternaterest with labour and have given them the muses and apollo the leaderof the muses and dionysus to be companions in their revels thatthey may improve their education by taking part in the festivals ofthe gods and with their help i should like to know whether acommon saying is in our opinion true to nature or not for men saythat the young of all creatures cannot be quiet in their bodies orin their voices they are always wanting to move and cry out someleaping and skipping and overflowing with sportiveness and delight atsomething others uttering all sorts of cries but whereas theanimals have no perception of order or disorder in their is of rhythm or harmony as they are called to us the as we say have been appointed to be our companions in the given the pleasurable sense of harmony and rhythm and so theystir us into life and we follow them joining hands together indances and songs and these they call choruses which is a termnaturally expressive of cheerfulness shall we begin then with theacknowledgment that education is first given through apollo and themuses what do you say 
 cle i assent 
 ath and the uneducated is he who has not been trained in thechorus and the educated is he who has been well trained 
 cle certainly 
 ath and the chorus is made up of two parts dance and song 
 cle true 
 ath then he who is well educated will be able to sing and dancewell 
 cle i suppose that he will 
 ath let us see what are we saying 
 cle what 
 ath he sings well and dances well now must we add that he singswhat is good and dances what is good 
 cle let us make the addition 
 ath we will suppose that he knows the good to be good and thebad to be bad and makes use of them accordingly which now is thebetter trained in dancing and who is able to move his bodyand to use his voice in what is understood to be the right manner buthas no delight in good or hatred of evil or he who is incorrect ingesture and voice but is right in his sense of pleasure and pain andwelcomes what is good and is offended at what is evil 
 cle there is a great difference stranger in the two kinds ofeducation 
 ath if we three know what is good in song and dance then wetruly know also who is educated and who is uneducated but if we certainly shall not know wherein lies the safeguard ofeducation and whether there is any or not 
 cle true 
 ath let us follow the scent like hounds and go in pursuit ofbeauty of figure and melody and song and dance if these escape will be no use in talking about true education whether hellenicor barbarian 
 cle yes 
 ath and what is beauty of figure or beautiful melody when a manlysoul is in trouble and when a cowardly soul is in similar case arethey likely to use the same figures and gestures or to give utteranceto the same sounds 
 cle how can they when the very colours of their faces differ 
 ath good my friend i may observe however in passing that inmusic there certainly are figures and there are melodies and music isconcerned with harmony and rhythm so that you may speak of a melodyor figure having good rhythm or good term is correctenough but to speak metaphorically of a melody or figure having colour as the masters of choruses do is not you can speak of the melodies or figures of the brave and thecoward praising the one and censuring the other and not to betedious let us say that the figures and melodies which are expressiveof virtue of soul or body or of images of virtue are withoutexception good and those which are expressive of vice are the reverseof good 
 cle your suggestion is excellent and let us answer that thesethings are so 
 ath once more are all of us equally delighted with every sort ofdance 
 cle far otherwise 
 ath what then leads us astray are beautiful things not thesame to us all or are they the same in themselves but not in ouropinion of them for no one will admit that forms of vice in the danceare more beautiful than forms of virtue or that he himself delightsin the forms of vice and others in a muse of another character andyet most persons say that the excellence of music is to give pleasureto our souls but this is intolerable and blasphemous there a much more plausible account of the delusion 
 cle what 
 ath the adaptation of art to the characters of men choricmovements are imitations of manners occurring in various particular is imitated and those towhom the words or songs or dances are suited either by nature orhabit or both cannot help feeling pleasure in them and applaudingthem and calling them beautiful but those whose natures or ways orhabits are unsuited to them cannot delight in them or applaud they call them base there are others again whose natures areright and their habits wrong or whose habits are right and theirnatures wrong and they praise one thing but are pleased atanother for they say that all these imitations are pleasant butnot good and in the presence of those whom they think wise theyare ashamed of dancing and singing in the baser manner or ofdeliberately lending any countenance to such proceedings and have a secret pleasure in them 
 cle very true 
 ath and is any harm done to the lover of vicious dances or any good done to the approver of the opposite sort of pleasure 
 cle i think that there is 
 ath i think is not the word but i would say rather i amcertain for must they not have the same effect as when a manassociates with bad characters whom he likes and approves rather thandislikes and only censures playfully because he has a suspicion ofhis own badness in that case he who takes pleasure in them willsurely become like those in whom he takes pleasure even though hebe ashamed to praise them and what greater good or evil can anydestiny ever make us undergo 
 cle i know of none 
 ath then in a city which has good laws or in future ages is tohave them bearing in mind the instruction and amusement which aregiven by music can we suppose that the poets are to be allowed toteach in the dance anything which they themselves like in the wayof rhythm or melody or words to the young children of parents is the poet to train his choruses as hepleases without reference to virtue or vice 
 cle that is surely quite unreasonable and is not to be thought of 
 ath and yet he may do this in almost any state with the exceptionof egypt 
 cle and what are the laws about music and dancing in egypt 
 ath you will wonder when i tell you long ago they appear to haverecognized the very principle of which we are now young citizens must be habituated to forms and strains ofvirtue these they fixed and exhibited the patterns of them intheir temples and no painter or artist is allowed to innovate uponthem or to leave the traditional forms and invent new ones to thisday no alteration is allowed either in these arts or in music atall and you will find that their works of art are painted ormoulded in the same forms which they had ten thousand is literally true and no ancientpaintings and sculptures are not a whit better or worse than thework of but are made with just the same skill 
 cle how extraordinary 
 ath i should rather say how statesmanlike how worthy of alegislator i know that other things in egypt are nat so well butwhat i am telling you about music is true and deserving ofconsideration because showing that a lawgiver may institutemelodies which have a natural truth and correctness without any fearof failure to do this however must be the work of god or of adivine person in egypt they have a tradition that their ancientchants which have been preserved for so many ages are thecomposition of the goddess isis and therefore as i was saying ifa person can only find in any way the natural melodies he mayconfidently embody them in a fixed and legal form for the love ofnovelty which arises out of pleasure in the new and weariness of theold has not strength enough to corrupt the consecrated song anddance under the plea that they have become antiquated at any are far from being corrupted in egypt 
 cle your arguments seem to prove your point 
 ath may we not confidently say that the true use of music and ofchoral festivities is as follows we rejoice when we think that weprosper and again we think that we prosper when we rejoice 
 cle exactly 
 ath and when rejoicing in our good fortune we are unable to bestill 
 cle true 
 ath our young men break forth into dancing and singing and wewho are their elders deem that we are fulfilling our part in life whenwe look on at them having lost our agility we delight in theirsports and because we love to think of our formerselves and gladly institute contests for those who are able to awakenin us the memory of our youth 
 cle very true 
 ath is it altogether unmeaning to say as the common people doabout festivals that he should be adjudged the wisest of men and thewinner of the palm who gives us the greatest amount of pleasure andmirth for on such occasions and when mirth is the order of theday ought not he to be honoured most and as i was saying bearthe palm who gives most mirth to the greatest number now is this atrue way of speaking or of acting 
 cle possibly 
 ath but my dear friend let us distinguish between differentcases and not be hasty in forming a judgment one way ofconsidering the question will be to imagine a festival at whichthere are entertainments of all sorts including gymnastic equestrian contests the citizens are assembled prizes areoffered and proclamation is made that any one who likes may enter thelists and that he is to bear the palm who gives the most pleasureto the is to be no regulation about the manner he who is most successful in giving pleasure is to be crownedvictor and deemed to be the pleasantest of the candidates what islikely to be the result of such a proclamation 
 cle in what respect 
 ath there would be various exhibitions one man like homer willexhibit a rhapsody another a performance on the lute one will have atragedy and another a comedy nor would there be anything astonishingin some one imagining that he could gain the prize by exhibiting suppose these competitors to meet and not these innumerable others as well can you tell me who ought to be thevictor 
 cle i do not see how any one can answer you or pretend to he has heard with his own ears the several competitors thequestion is absurd 
 ath well then if neither of you can answer shall i answer thisquestion which you deem so absurd 
 cle by all means 
 ath if very small children are to determine the question they willdecide for the puppet show 
 cle of course 
 ath the older children will be advocates of comedy educated young men and people in general will favour tragedy 
 cle very likely 
 ath and i believe that we old men would have the greatestpleasure in hearing a rhapsodist recite well the iliad and odyssey orone of the hesiodic poems and would award the victory to him would really be the is the question 
 cle yes 
 ath clearly you and i will have to declare that those whom we oldmen adjudge victors ought to win for our ways are far and away betterthan any which at present exist anywhere in the world 
 cle certainly 
 ath thus far i too should agree with the many that theexcellence of music is to be measured by pleasure but the pleasuremust not be that of chance persons the fairest music is that whichdelights the best and best educated and especially that whichdelights the one man who is in virtue and education andtherefore the judges must be men of character for they will requireboth wisdom and courage the true judge must not draw hisinspiration from the theatre nor ought he to be unnerved by theclamour of the many and his own incapacity nor again knowing thetruth ought he through cowardice and unmanliness carelessly todeliver a lying judgment with the very same lips which have justappealed to the gods before he judged he is sitting not as thedisciple of the theatre but in his proper place as theirinstructor and he ought to be the enemy of all pandering to thepleasure of the spectators the ancient and common custom of still prevails in italy and sicily did certainly leave thejudgment to the body of spectators who determined the victor byshow of hands but this custom has been the destruction of thepoets for they are now in the habit of composing with a view toplease the bad taste of their judges and the result is that thespectators instruct also it has been the ruin of thetheatre they ought to be having characters put before them betterthan their own and so receiving a higher pleasure but now by theirown act the opposite result follows what inference is to be drawnfrom all this shall i tell you 
 cle what 
 ath the inference at which we arrive for the third or fourth timeis that education is the constraining and directing of youthtowards that right reason which the law affirms and which theexperience of the eldest and best has agreed to be truly right inorder then that the soul of the child may not be habituated tofeel joy and sorrow in a manner at variance with the law and thosewho obey the law but may rather follow the law and rejoice and sorrowat the same things as the order i say to produce thiseffect chants appear to have been invented which really enchant andare designed to implant that harmony of which we speak and becausethe mind of the child is incapable of enduring serious are called plays and songs and are performed in play just aswhen men are sick and ailing in their bodies their attendants givethem wholesome diet in pleasant meats and drinks but unwholesome dietin disagreeable things in order that they may learn as they like the one and to dislike the other and similarly the truelegislator will persuade and if he cannot persuade will compelthe poet to express as he ought by fair and noble words in hisrhythms the figures and in his melodies the music of temperateand brave and in every way good men 
 cle but do you really imagine stranger that this is the way inwhich poets generally compose in states at the present day as faras i can observe except among us and among the are no regulations like those of which you speak in otherplaces novelties are always being introduced in dancing and inmusic generally not under the authority of any law but at theinstigation of lawless pleasures and these pleasures are so farfrom being the same as you describe the egyptian to be or having thesame principles that they are never the same 
 ath most true cleinias and i daresay that i may have expressedmyself obscurely and so led you to imagine that i was speaking ofsome really existing state of things whereas i was only saying whatregulations i would like to have about music and hence there occurreda misapprehension on your part for when evils are far gone andirremediable the task of censuring them is never pleasant althoughat times necessary but as we do not really differ will you let meask you whether you consider such institutions to be more prevalentamong the cretans and lacedaemonians than among the other hellenes 
 cle certainly they are 
 ath and if they were extended to the other hellenes would it be animprovement on the present state of things 
 cle a very great improvement if the customs which prevail amongthem were such as prevail among us and the lacedaemonians and such asyou were just now saying ought to prevail 
 ath let us see whether we understand one not theprinciples of education and music which prevail among you asfollows you compel your poets to say that the good man if he betemperate and just is fortunate and happy and this whether he begreat and strong or small and weak and whether he be rich or on the other hand if he have a wealth passing that of cinyras ormidas and be unjust he is wretched and lives in misery as thepoet says and with truth i sing not i care not about him whoaccomplishes all noble things not having justice let him near and stretches out his hand against his enemies be a justman but if he be unjust i would not have him look calmly uponbloody death nor surpass in swiftness the thracian boreas and letno other thing that is called good ever be his for the goods of whichthe many speak are not really good first in the catalogue is placedhealth beauty next wealth third and then innumerable others as forexample to have a keen eye or a quick ear and in general to haveall the senses perfect or again to be a tyrant and do as youlike and the final consummation of happiness is to have acquiredall these things and when you have acquired them to become at onceimmortal but you and i say that while to the just and holy all thesethings are the best of possessions to the unjust they are even health the greatest of evils for in truth to havesight and hearing and the use of the senses or to live at allwithout justice and virtue even though a man be rich in all goods of fortune is the greatest of evils if life beimmortal but not so great if the bad man lives only a very shorttime these are the truths which if i am not mistaken you willpersuade or compel your poets to utter with suitable accompaniments ofharmony and rhythm and in these they must train up your youth am inot right for i plainly declare that evils as they are termed aregoods to the unjust and only evils to the just and that goods aretruly good to the good but evil to the evil let me ask again areyou and i agreed about this 
 cle i think that we partly agree and partly do not 
 ath when a man has health and wealth and a tyranny which lasts andwhen he is preeminent in strength and courage and has the gift ofimmortality and none of the evils which goods but only the injustice and insolence of his own an one you are i suspect unwilling to believe that he ismiserable rather than happy 
 cle that is quite true 
 ath once more suppose that he be valiant and strong andhandsome and rich and does throughout his whole life whatever helikes still if he be unrighteous and insolent would not both of youagree that he will of necessity live basely you will surely grantso much 
 cle certainly 
 ath and an evil life too 
 cle i am not equally disposed to grant that 
 ath will he not live painfully and to his own disadvantage 
 cle how can i possibly say so 
 ath how then may heaven make us to be of one mind for now weare of two to me dear cleinias the truth of what i am saying isas plain as the fact that crete is an island and if i were alawgiver i would try to make the poets and all the citizens speakin this strain and i would inflict the heaviest penalties on anyone in all the land who should dare to say that there are bad menwho lead pleasant lives or that the profitable and gainful is onething and the just another and there are many other matters aboutwhich i should make my citizens speak in a manner different from thecretans and lacedaemonians of this age and i may say indeed fromthe world in general for tell me my good friends by zeus and apollotell me if i were to ask these same gods who were your the most just life also the pleasantest or are there two of which is the justest and the other the theywere to reply that there are two and thereupon i proceeded to would be the right way of pursuing the enquiry which are who lead the justest or those who lead thepleasantest life and they replied those who lead would be a very strange answer which i should notlike to put into the mouth of the gods the words will come withmore propriety from the lips of fathers and legislators and thereforei will repeat my former questions to one of them and suppose him tosay again that he who leads the pleasantest life is the to that i my father did you not wish me to live ashappily as possible and yet you also never ceased telling me that ishould live as justly as possible now here the giver of the he be legislator or father will be in a dilemma and willin vain endeavour to be consistent with himself but if he were todeclare that the justest life is also the happiest every onehearing him would enquire if i am not mistaken what is that good andnoble principle in life which the law approves and which issuperior to pleasure for what good can the just man have which isseparated from pleasure shall we say that glory and fame coming fromgods and men though good and noble are nevertheless infamy pleasant certainly not sweet legislator or shall wesay that the of wrong and there being no wrong done isgood and honourable although there is no pleasure in it and that thedoing wrong is pleasant but evil and base 
 cle impossible 
 ath the view which identifies the pleasant and the pleasant and thejust and the good and the noble has an excellent moral and religioustendency and the opposite view is most at variance with the designsof the legislator and is in his opinion infamous for no one if hecan help will be persuaded to do that which gives him more painthan pleasure but as distant prospects are apt to make us in childhood the legislator will try to purge away thedarkness and exhibit the truth he will persuade the citizens in someway or other by customs and praises and words that just and unjustare shadows only and that injustice which seems opposed tojustice when contemplated by the unjust and evil man appears pleasantand the just most unpleasant but that from the just point ofview the very opposite is the appearance of both of them 
 cle true 
 ath and which may be supposed to be the truer ofthe inferior or of the better soul 
 cle surely that of the better soul 
 ath then the unjust life must not only be more base and also more unpleasant than the just and holy life 
 cle that seems to be implied in the present argument 
 ath and even supposing this were otherwise and not as the argumenthas proven still the lawgiver who is worth anything if he everventures to tell a lie to the young for their good could not invent amore useful lie than this or one which will have a better effect inmaking them do what is right not on compulsion but voluntarily 
 cle truth stranger is a noble thing and a lasting but a thing ofwhich men are hard to be persuaded 
 ath and yet the story of the sidonian cadmus which is soimprobable has been readily believed and also innumerable othertales 
 cle what is that story 
 ath the story of armed men springing up after the sowing ofteeth which the legislator may take as a proof that he can persuadethe minds of the young of anything so that he has only to reflect andfind out what belief will be of the greatest public advantage andthen use all his efforts to make the whole community utter one and thesame word in their songs and tales and discourses all their life if you do not agree with me there is no reason why you should notargue on the other side 
 cle i do not see that any argument can fairly be raised by eitherof us against what you are now saying 
 ath the next suggestion which i have to offer is that all ourthree choruses shall sing to the young and tender souls of in their strains all the noble thoughts of which we havealready spoken or are about to speak and the sum of them shall the life which is by the gods deemed to be the happiest is alsothe shall affirm this to be a most certain truth and theminds of our young disciples will be more likely to receive thesewords of ours than any others which we might address to them 
 cle i assent to what you say 
 ath first will enter in their natural order the sacred choircomposed of children which is to sing lustily the layto the whole city next will follow the choir of young men under theage of thirty who will call upon the god paean to testify to thetruth of their words and will pray him to be gracious to the youthand to turn their hearts thirdly the choir of elder men who arefrom thirty to sixty years of age will also sing there remainthose who are too old to sing and they will tell the same virtues as with the voice of an oracle 
 cle who are those who compose the third choir stranger for i donot clearly understand what you mean to say about them 
 ath and yet almost all that i have been saying has said with a viewto them 
 cle will you try to be a little plainer 
 ath i was speaking at the commencement of our discourse as youwill remember of the fiery nature of young creatures i said thatthey were unable to keep quiet either in limb or voice and thatthey called out and jumped about in a disorderly manner and that noother animal attained to any perception of order but man only nowthe order of motion is called rhythm and the order of the voice inwhich high and low are duly mingled is called harmony and bothtogether are termed choric song and i said that the gods had pityon us and gave us apollo and the muses to be our playfellows andleaders in the dance and dionysus as i dare say that you willremember was the third 
 cle i quite remember 
 ath thus far i have spoken of the chorus of apollo and the i have still to speak of the remaining chorus which is that ofdionysus 
 cle how is that arranged there is something strange at any rateon first hearing in a dionysiac chorus of old men if you really meanthat those who are above thirty and may be fifty or from fifty tosixty years of age are to dance in his honour 
 ath very true and therefore it must be shown that there is goodreason for the proposal 
 cle certainly 
 ath are we agreed thus far 
 cle about what 
 ath that every man and boy slave and free both sexes and thewhole city should never cease charming themselves with the strains ofwhich we have spoken and that there should be every sort of changeand variation of them in order to take away the effect of sameness sothat the singers may always receive pleasure from their hymns and maynever weary of them 
 cle every one will agree 
 ath where then will that best part of our city which by reasonof age and intelligence has the greatest influence sing thesefairest of strains which are to do so much good shall we be sofoolish as to let them off who would give us the most beautiful andalso the most useful of songs 
 cle but says the argument we cannot let them off 
 ath then how can we carry out our purpose with decorum will thisbe the way 
 cle what 
 ath when a man is advancing in years he is afraid and reluctant has no pleasure in his own performances and if compulsion isused he will be more and more ashamed the older and more discreet not this true 
 cle certainly 
 ath well and will he not be yet more ashamed if he has to stand upand sing in the theatre to a mixed if moreover when heis required to do so like the other choirs who contend for have been trained under a singing master he is pinched andhungry he will certainly have a feeling of shame and discomfort whichwill make him very unwilling to exhibit 
 cle no doubt 
 ath how then shall we reassure him and get him to sing shall webegin by enacting that boys shall not taste wine at all until they areeighteen years of age we will tell them that fire must not bepoured upon fire whether in the body or in the soul until they beginto go to is a precaution which has to be taken against theexcitableness of they may taste wine in moderationup to the age of thirty but while a man is young he should abstainaltogether from intoxication and from excess of wine when at has reached forty years after dinner at a public mess he mayinvite not only the other gods but dionysus above all to the mysteryand festivity of the elder men making use of the wine which he hasgiven men to lighten the sourness of old age that in age we may renewour youth and forget our sorrows and also in order that the natureof the soul like iron melted in the fire may become softer and somore impressible in the first place will not any one who is thusmellowed be more ready and less ashamed to do not say beforea large audience but before a moderate company nor yet amongstrangers but among his familiars and as we have often said tochant and to enchant 
 cle he will be far more ready 
 ath there will be no impropriety in our using such a method ofpersuading them to join with us in song 
 cle none at all 
 ath and what strain will they sing and what muse will they strain should clearly be one suitable to them 
 cle certainly 
 ath and what strain is suitable for heroes shall they sing achoric strain 
 cle truly stranger we of crete and lacedaemon know no strainother than that which we have learnt and been accustomed to sing inour chorus 
 ath i dare say for you have never acquired the knowledge of themost beautiful kind of song in your military way of life which ismodelled after the camp and is not like that of dwellers in you have your young men herding and feeding together like youngcolts no one takes his own individual colt and drags him away fromhis fellows against his will raging and foaming and gives him agroom to attend to him alone and trains and rubs him downprivately and gives him the qualities in education which will makehim not only a good soldier but also a governor of a state and ofcities such an one as we said at first would be a greater warriorthan he of whom tyrtaeus sings and he would honour courageeverywhere but always as the fourth and not as the first part ofvirtue either in individuals or states 
 cle once more stranger i must complain that you depreciate ourlawgivers 
 ath not intentionally if at all my good friend but whither theargument leads thither let us follow for if there be indeed somestrain of song more beautiful than that of the choruses or thepublic theatres i should like to impart it to those who as we ashamed of these and want to have the best 
 cle certainly 
 ath when things have an accompanying charm either the best thingin them is this very charm or there is some rightness or utilitypossessed by example i should say that eating and the use of food in general have an accompanying charm which wecall pleasure but that this rightness and utility is just thehealthfulness of the things served up to us which is their truerightness 
 cle just so 
 ath thus too i should say that learning has a certainaccompanying charm which is the pleasure but that the right and theprofitable the good and the noble are qualities which the truthgives to it 
 cle exactly 
 ath and so in the imitative they succeed in makinglikenesses and are accompanied by pleasure may not their works besaid to have a charm 
 cle yes 
 ath but equal proportions whether of quality or quantity andnot pleasure speaking generally would give them truth or rightness 
 cle yes 
 ath then that only can be rightly judged by the standard ofpleasure which makes or furnishes no utility or truth or on the other hand is productive of any hurtful quality but existssolely for the sake of the accompanying charm and the term most appropriately applied to it when these other qualities areabsent 
 cle you are speaking of harmless pleasure are you not 
 ath yes and this i term amusement when doing neither harm norgood in any degree worth speaking of 
 cle very true 
 ath then if such be our principles we must assert thatimitation is not to be judged of by pleasure and false opinion andthis is true of all equality for the equal is not equal or thesymmetrical symmetrical because somebody thinks or likes they are to be judged of by the standard of truth and by no otherwhatever 
 cle quite true 
 ath do we not regard all music as representative and imitative 
 cle certainly 
 ath then when any one says that music is to be judged of bypleasure his doctrine cannot be admitted and if there be any musicof which pleasure is the criterion such music is not to be sought outor deemed to have any real excellence but only that other kind ofmusic which is an imitation of the good 
 cle very true 
 ath and those who seek for the best kind of song and music oughtnot to seek for that which is pleasant but for that which is the truth of imitation consists as we were saying in renderingthe thing imitated according to quantity and quality 
 cle certainly 
 ath and every one will admit that musical compositions are allimitative and representative will not poets and spectators and actorsall agree in this 
 cle they will 
 ath surely then he who would judge correctly must know what eachcomposition is for if he does not know what is the character andmeaning of the piece and what it represents he will never discernwhether the intention is true or false 
 cle certainly not 
 ath and will he who does not know what is true be able todistinguish what is good and bad my statement is not very perhaps you will understand me better if i put the matter inanother way 
 cle how 
 ath there are ten thousand likenesses of objects of sight 
 cle yes 
 ath and can he who does not know what the exact object is whichis imitated ever know whether the resemblance is truthfully mean for example whether a statue has the proportions of a the true situation of the parts what those proportions are andhow the parts fit into one another in due order also their coloursand conformations or whether this is all confused in the you think that any one can know about this who does not knowwhat the animal is which has been imitated 
 cle impossible 
 ath but even if we know that the thing pictured or sculptured isa man who has received at the hand of the artist all his proper partsand colours and shapes must we not also know whether the work isbeautiful or in any respect deficient in beauty 
 cle if this were not required stranger we should all of us bejudges of beauty 
 ath very true and may we not say that in everything in drawing music or any other art he who is to be acompetent judge must possess three must know in thefirst place of what the imitation is secondly he must know thatit is true and thirdly that it has been well executed in words andmelodies and rhythms 
 cle certainly 
 ath then let us not faint in discussing the peculiar difficultyof music music is more celebrated than any other kind of therefore requires the greatest care of them all for if a manmakes a mistake here he may do himself the greatest injury bywelcoming evil dispositions and the mistake may be very difficultto discern because the poets are artists very inferior in characterto the muses themselves who would never fall into the monstrous errorof assigning to the words of men the gestures and songs of after combining the melodies with the gestures of freemen wouldthey add on the rhythms of slaves and men of the baser sort with the rhythms and gestures of freemen would theyassign to them a melody or words which are of an opposite would they mix up the voices and sounds of animals and of menand instruments and every other sort of noise as if they were allone but human poets are fond of introducing this sort of inconsistentmixture and so make themselves ridiculous in the eyes of those orpheus says are ripe for true pleasure the experienced see allthis confusion and yet the poets go on and make still further havocby separating the rhythm and the figure of the dance from themelody setting bare words to metre and also separating the melodyand the rhythm from the words using the lyre or the flute when there are no words it is very difficult to recognize themeaning of the harmony and rhythm or to see that any worthy object isimitated by them and we must acknowledge that all this sort of aims only at swiftness and smoothness and a brutish noise anduses the flute and the lyre not as the mere accompaniments of thedance and song is exceedingly coarse and tasteless the use of eitherinstrument when unaccompanied leads to every sort of irregularityand trickery this is all rational enough but we are consideringnot how our choristers who are from thirty to fifty years of age andmay be over fifty are not to use the muses but how they are to usethem and the considerations which we have urged seem to show inwhat way these fifty choristers who are to sing may beexpected to be better trained for they need to have a quickperception and knowledge of harmonies and rhythms otherwise howcan they ever know whether a melody would be rightly sung to thedorian mode or to the rhythm which the poet has assigned to it 
 cle clearly they cannot 
 ath the many are ridiculous in imagining that they know what isin proper harmony and rhythm and what is not when they can only bemade to sing and step in rhythm by force it never occurs to them thatthey are ignorant of what they are doing now every melody is rightwhen it has suitable harmony and rhythm and wrong when unsuitable 
 cle that is most certain 
 ath but can a man who does not know a thing as we were that the thing is right 
 cle impossible 
 ath then now as would appear we are making the discovery that choristers whom we hereby invite and although theyare their own masters compel to sing must be educated to such anextent as to be able to follow the steps of the rhythm and the notesof the song that they may know the harmonies and rhythms and be ableto select what are suitable for men of their age and character tosing and may sing them and have innocent pleasure from their ownperformance and also lead younger men to welcome with dutiful delightgood dispositions having such training they will attain a moreaccurate knowledge than falls to the lot of the common people or evenof the poets themselves for the poet need not know the third whether the imitation is good or not though he can hardlyhelp knowing the laws of melody and rhythm but the aged chorus mustknow all the three that they may choose the best and that which isnearest to the best for otherwise they will never be able to charmthe souls of young men in the way of virtue and now the originaldesign of the argument which was intended to bring eloquent aid to thechorus of dionysus has been accomplished to the best of ourability and let us see whether we were should imagine that adrinking assembly is likely to become more and more tumultuous asthe drinking goes on this as we were saying at first will certainlybe the case 
 cle certainly 
 ath every man has a more than natural elevation his heart isglad within him and he will say anything and will be restrained bynobody at such a time he fancies that he is able to rule over himselfand all mankind 
 cle quite true 
 ath were we not saying that on such occasions the souls of thedrinkers become like iron heated in the fire and grow softer andyounger and are easily moulded by him who knows how to educate andfashion them just as when they were young and that this fashioner ofthem is the same who prescribed for them in the days of their the good legislator and that he ought to enact laws of thebanquet which when a man is confident bold and impudent andunwilling to wait his turn and have his share of silence and drinking and music will change his character into laws as will infuse into him a just and noble will take up arms at the approach of insolence being thatdivine fear which we have called reverence and shame 
 cle true 
 ath and the guardians of these laws and with themare the calm and sober generals of the drinkers and without theirhelp there is greater difficulty in fighting against drink than infighting against enemies when the commander of an army is nothimself calm and he who is unwilling to obey them and thecommanders of dionysiac feasts who are more than sixty years of suffer a disgrace as great as he who disobeys militaryleaders or even greater 
 cle right 
 ath if then drinking and amusement were regulated in this not the companions of our revels be improved they would partbetter friends than they were and not as now enemies their wholeintercourse would be regulated by law and observant of it and thesober would be the leaders of the drunken 
 cle i think so too if drinking were regulated as you propose 
 ath let us not then simply censure the gift of dionysus as badand unfit to be received into the state for wine has manyexcellences and one one about which there is adifficulty in speaking to the many from a fear of their misconceivingand misunderstanding what is said 
 cle to what do you refer 
 ath there is a tradition or story which has somehow crept aboutthe world that dionysus was robbed of his wits by his stepmotherhere and that out of revenge he inspires bacchic furies and dancingmadnesses in others for which reason he gave men wine suchtraditions concerning the gods i leave to those who think that theymay be safely uttered i only know that no animal at birth is matureor perfect in intelligence and in the intermediate period in whichhe has not yet acquired his own proper sense he rages and roarswithout rhyme or reason and when he has once got on his legs he jumpsabout without rhyme or reason and this as you will remember hasbeen already said by us to be the origin of music and gymnastic 
 cle to be sure i remember 
 ath and did we not say that the sense of harmony and rhythmsprang from this beginning among men and that apollo and the musesand dionysus were the gods whom we had to thank for them 
 cle certainly 
 ath the other story implied that wine was given man out of in order to make him mad but our present doctrine on thecontrary is that wine was given him as a balm and in order toimplant modesty in the soul and health and strength in the body 
 cle that stranger is precisely what was said 
 ath then half the subject may now be considered to have beendiscussed shall we proceed to the consideration of the other half 
 cle what is the other half and how do you divide the subject 
 ath the whole choral art is also in our view the whole ofeducation and of this art rhythms and harmonies form the partwhich has to do with the voice 
 cle yes 
 ath the movement of the body has rhythm in common with the movementof the voice but gesture is peculiar to it whereas song is simplythe movement of the voice 
 cle most true 
 ath and the sound of the voice which reaches and educates the have ventured to term music 
 cle we were right 
 ath and the movement of the body when regarded as an amusement wetermed dancing but when extended and pursued with a view to theexcellence of the body this scientific training may be calledgymnastic 
 cle exactly 
 ath music which was one half of the choral art may be said tohave been completely discussed shall we proceed to the other halfor not what would you like 
 cle my good friend when you are talking with a cretan andlacedaemonian and we have discussed music and not gymnastic whatanswer are either of us likely to make to such an enquiry 
 ath an answer is contained in your question and i understand andaccept what you say not only as an answer but also as a command toproceed with gymnastic 
 cle you quite understand me do as you say 
 ath i will and there will not be any difficulty in speakingintelligibly to you about a subject with which both of you are farmore familiar than with music 
 cle there will not 
 ath is not the origin of gymnastics too to be sought in thetendency to rapid motion which exists in all animals man as wewere saying having attained the sense of rhythm created and inventeddancing and melody arousing and awakening rhythm both unitedformed the choral art 
 cle very true 
 ath and one part of this subject has been already discussed byus and there still remains another to be discussed 
 cle exactly 
 ath i have first a final word to add to my discourse about you will allow me to do so 
 cle what more have you to say 
 ath i should say that if a city seriously means to adopt thepractice of drinking under due regulation and with a view to theenforcement of temperance and in like manner and on the sameprinciple will allow of other pleasures designing to gain thevictory over them in this way all of them may be used but if thestate makes drinking an amusement only and whoever likes may drinkwhenever he likes and with whom he likes and add to this any otherindulgences i shall never agree or allow that this city or this manshould practise drinking i would go further than the cretans andlacedaemonians and am disposed rather to the law of thecarthaginians that no one while he is on a campaign should be allowedto taste wine at all but that he should drink water during all thattime and that in the city no slave male or female should ever drinkwine and that no magistrates should drink during their year ofoffice nor should pilots of vessels or judges while on duty tastewine at all nor any one who is going to hold a consultation about anymatter of importance nor in the daytime at all unless in consequenceof exercise or as medicine nor again at night when any one eitherman or woman is minded to get children there are numberless othercases also in which those who have good sense and good laws oughtnot to drink wine so that if what i say is true no city will needmany vineyards their husbandry and their way of life in generalwill follow an appointed order and their cultivation of the vine willbe the most limited and the least common of their employments andthis stranger shall be the crown of my discourse about wine ifyou agree 
 cle excellent we agree

 book ii 
 
 athenian stranger and now we have to consider whether the insightinto human nature is the only benefit derived from well orderedpotations or whether there are not other advantages great and much tobe desired the argument seems to imply that there are but how and inwhat way these are to be attained will have to be consideredattentively or we may be entangled in error 
 cleinias proceed 
 ath let me once more recall our doctrine of right education i am not mistaken depends on the due regulation of convivialintercourse 
 cle you talk rather grandly 
 ath pleasure and pain i maintain to be the first perceptions ofchildren and i say that they are the forms under which virtue andvice are originally present to them as to wisdom and true and fixedopinions happy is the man who acquires them even when declining inyears and we may say that he who possesses them and the blessingswhich are contained in them is a perfect man now i mean by educationthat training which is given by suitable habits to the first instinctsof virtue in pleasure and friendship and pain andhatred are rightly implanted in souls not yet capable ofunderstanding the nature of them and who find them after they haveattained reason to be in harmony with her this harmony of thesoul taken as a whole is virtue but the particular training inrespect of pleasure and pain which leads you always to hate whatyou ought to hate and love what you ought to love from thebeginning of life to the end may be separated off and in my be rightly called education 
 cle i think stranger that you are quite right in all that youhave said and are saying about education 
 ath i am glad to hear that you agree with me for indeed thediscipline of pleasure and pain which when rightly ordered is aprinciple of education has been often relaxed and corrupted inhuman life and the gods pitying the toils which our race is bornto undergo have appointed holy festivals wherein men alternaterest with labour and have given them the muses and apollo the leaderof the muses and dionysus to be companions in their revels thatthey may improve their education by taking part in the festivals ofthe gods and with their help i should like to know whether acommon saying is in our opinion true to nature or not for men saythat the young of all creatures cannot be quiet in their bodies orin their voices they are always wanting to move and cry out someleaping and skipping and overflowing with sportiveness and delight atsomething others uttering all sorts of cries but whereas theanimals have no perception of order or disorder in their is of rhythm or harmony as they are called to us the as we say have been appointed to be our companions in the given the pleasurable sense of harmony and rhythm and so theystir us into life and we follow them joining hands together indances and songs and these they call choruses which is a termnaturally expressive of cheerfulness shall we begin then with theacknowledgment that education is first given through apollo and themuses what do you say 
 cle i assent 
 ath and the uneducated is he who has not been trained in thechorus and the educated is he who has been well trained 
 cle certainly 
 ath and the chorus is made up of two parts dance and song 
 cle true 
 ath then he who is well educated will be able to sing and dancewell 
 cle i suppose that he will 
 ath let us see what are we saying 
 cle what 
 ath he sings well and dances well now must we add that he singswhat is good and dances what is good 
 cle let us make the addition 
 ath we will suppose that he knows the good to be good and thebad to be bad and makes use of them accordingly which now is thebetter trained in dancing and who is able to move his bodyand to use his voice in what is understood to be the right manner buthas no delight in good or hatred of evil or he who is incorrect ingesture and voice but is right in his sense of pleasure and pain andwelcomes what is good and is offended at what is evil 
 cle there is a great difference stranger in the two kinds ofeducation 
 ath if we three know what is good in song and dance then wetruly know also who is educated and who is uneducated but if we certainly shall not know wherein lies the safeguard ofeducation and whether there is any or not 
 cle true 
 ath let us follow the scent like hounds and go in pursuit ofbeauty of figure and melody and song and dance if these escape will be no use in talking about true education whether hellenicor barbarian 
 cle yes 
 ath and what is beauty of figure or beautiful melody when a manlysoul is in trouble and when a cowardly soul is in similar case arethey likely to use the same figures and gestures or to give utteranceto the same sounds 
 cle how can they when the very colours of their faces differ 
 ath good my friend i may observe however in passing that inmusic there certainly are figures and there are melodies and music isconcerned with harmony and rhythm so that you may speak of a melodyor figure having good rhythm or good term is correctenough but to speak metaphorically of a melody or figure having colour as the masters of choruses do is not you can speak of the melodies or figures of the brave and thecoward praising the one and censuring the other and not to betedious let us say that the figures and melodies which are expressiveof virtue of soul or body or of images of virtue are withoutexception good and those which are expressive of vice are the reverseof good 
 cle your suggestion is excellent and let us answer that thesethings are so 
 ath once more are all of us equally delighted with every sort ofdance 
 cle far otherwise 
 ath what then leads us astray are beautiful things not thesame to us all or are they the same in themselves but not in ouropinion of them for no one will admit that forms of vice in the danceare more beautiful than forms of virtue or that he himself delightsin the forms of vice and others in a muse of another character andyet most persons say that the excellence of music is to give pleasureto our souls but this is intolerable and blasphemous there a much more plausible account of the delusion 
 cle what 
 ath the adaptation of art to the characters of men choricmovements are imitations of manners occurring in various particular is imitated and those towhom the words or songs or dances are suited either by nature orhabit or both cannot help feeling pleasure in them and applaudingthem and calling them beautiful but those whose natures or ways orhabits are unsuited to them cannot delight in them or applaud they call them base there are others again whose natures areright and their habits wrong or whose habits are right and theirnatures wrong and they praise one thing but are pleased atanother for they say that all these imitations are pleasant butnot good and in the presence of those whom they think wise theyare ashamed of dancing and singing in the baser manner or ofdeliberately lending any countenance to such proceedings and have a secret pleasure in them 
 cle very true 
 ath and is any harm done to the lover of vicious dances or any good done to the approver of the opposite sort of pleasure 
 cle i think that there is 
 ath i think is not the word but i would say rather i amcertain for must they not have the same effect as when a manassociates with bad characters whom he likes and approves rather thandislikes and only censures playfully because he has a suspicion ofhis own badness in that case he who takes pleasure in them willsurely become like those in whom he takes pleasure even though hebe ashamed to praise them and what greater good or evil can anydestiny ever make us undergo 
 cle i know of none 
 ath then in a city which has good laws or in future ages is tohave them bearing in mind the instruction and amusement which aregiven by music can we suppose that the poets are to be allowed toteach in the dance anything which they themselves like in the wayof rhythm or melody or words to the young children of parents is the poet to train his choruses as hepleases without reference to virtue or vice 
 cle that is surely quite unreasonable and is not to be thought of 
 ath and yet he may do this in almost any state with the exceptionof egypt 
 cle and what are the laws about music and dancing in egypt 
 ath you will wonder when i tell you long ago they appear to haverecognized the very principle of which we are now young citizens must be habituated to forms and strains ofvirtue these they fixed and exhibited the patterns of them intheir temples and no painter or artist is allowed to innovate uponthem or to leave the traditional forms and invent new ones to thisday no alteration is allowed either in these arts or in music atall and you will find that their works of art are painted ormoulded in the same forms which they had ten thousand is literally true and no ancientpaintings and sculptures are not a whit better or worse than thework of but are made with just the same skill 
 cle how extraordinary 
 ath i should rather say how statesmanlike how worthy of alegislator i know that other things in egypt are nat so well butwhat i am telling you about music is true and deserving ofconsideration because showing that a lawgiver may institutemelodies which have a natural truth and correctness without any fearof failure to do this however must be the work of god or of adivine person in egypt they have a tradition that their ancientchants which have been preserved for so many ages are thecomposition of the goddess isis and therefore as i was saying ifa person can only find in any way the natural melodies he mayconfidently embody them in a fixed and legal form for the love ofnovelty which arises out of pleasure in the new and weariness of theold has not strength enough to corrupt the consecrated song anddance under the plea that they have become antiquated at any are far from being corrupted in egypt 
 cle your arguments seem to prove your point 
 ath may we not confidently say that the true use of music and ofchoral festivities is as follows we rejoice when we think that weprosper and again we think that we prosper when we rejoice 
 cle exactly 
 ath and when rejoicing in our good fortune we are unable to bestill 
 cle true 
 ath our young men break forth into dancing and singing and wewho are their elders deem that we are fulfilling our part in life whenwe look on at them having lost our agility we delight in theirsports and because we love to think of our formerselves and gladly institute contests for those who are able to awakenin us the memory of our youth 
 cle very true 
 ath is it altogether unmeaning to say as the common people doabout festivals that he should be adjudged the wisest of men and thewinner of the palm who gives us the greatest amount of pleasure andmirth for on such occasions and when mirth is the order of theday ought not he to be honoured most and as i was saying bearthe palm who gives most mirth to the greatest number now is this atrue way of speaking or of acting 
 cle possibly 
 ath but my dear friend let us distinguish between differentcases and not be hasty in forming a judgment one way ofconsidering the question will be to imagine a festival at whichthere are entertainments of all sorts including gymnastic equestrian contests the citizens are assembled prizes areoffered and proclamation is made that any one who likes may enter thelists and that he is to bear the palm who gives the most pleasureto the is to be no regulation about the manner he who is most successful in giving pleasure is to be crownedvictor and deemed to be the pleasantest of the candidates what islikely to be the result of such a proclamation 
 cle in what respect 
 ath there would be various exhibitions one man like homer willexhibit a rhapsody another a performance on the lute one will have atragedy and another a comedy nor would there be anything astonishingin some one imagining that he could gain the prize by exhibiting suppose these competitors to meet and not these innumerable others as well can you tell me who ought to be thevictor 
 cle i do not see how any one can answer you or pretend to he has heard with his own ears the several competitors thequestion is absurd 
 ath well then if neither of you can answer shall i answer thisquestion which you deem so absurd 
 cle by all means 
 ath if very small children are to determine the question they willdecide for the puppet show 
 cle of course 
 ath the older children will be advocates of comedy educated young men and people in general will favour tragedy 
 cle very likely 
 ath and i believe that we old men would have the greatestpleasure in hearing a rhapsodist recite well the iliad and odyssey orone of the hesiodic poems and would award the victory to him would really be the is the question 
 cle yes 
 ath clearly you and i will have to declare that those whom we oldmen adjudge victors ought to win for our ways are far and away betterthan any which at present exist anywhere in the world 
 cle certainly 
 ath thus far i too should agree with the many that theexcellence of music is to be measured by pleasure but the pleasuremust not be that of chance persons the fairest music is that whichdelights the best and best educated and especially that whichdelights the one man who is in virtue and education andtherefore the judges must be men of character for they will requireboth wisdom and courage the true judge must not draw hisinspiration from the theatre nor ought he to be unnerved by theclamour of the many and his own incapacity nor again knowing thetruth ought he through cowardice and unmanliness carelessly todeliver a lying judgment with the very same lips which have justappealed to the gods before he judged he is sitting not as thedisciple of the theatre but in his proper place as theirinstructor and he ought to be the enemy of all pandering to thepleasure of the spectators the ancient and common custom of still prevails in italy and sicily did certainly leave thejudgment to the body of spectators who determined the victor byshow of hands but this custom has been the destruction of thepoets for they are now in the habit of composing with a view toplease the bad taste of their judges and the result is that thespectators instruct also it has been the ruin of thetheatre they ought to be having characters put before them betterthan their own and so receiving a higher pleasure but now by theirown act the opposite result follows what inference is to be drawnfrom all this shall i tell you 
 cle what 
 ath the inference at which we arrive for the third or fourth timeis that education is the constraining and directing of youthtowards that right reason which the law affirms and which theexperience of the eldest and best has agreed to be truly right inorder then that the soul of the child may not be habituated tofeel joy and sorrow in a manner at variance with the law and thosewho obey the law but may rather follow the law and rejoice and sorrowat the same things as the order i say to produce thiseffect chants appear to have been invented which really enchant andare designed to implant that harmony of which we speak and becausethe mind of the child is incapable of enduring serious are called plays and songs and are performed in play just aswhen men are sick and ailing in their bodies their attendants givethem wholesome diet in pleasant meats and drinks but unwholesome dietin disagreeable things in order that they may learn as they like the one and to dislike the other and similarly the truelegislator will persuade and if he cannot persuade will compelthe poet to express as he ought by fair and noble words in hisrhythms the figures and in his melodies the music of temperateand brave and in every way good men 
 cle but do you really imagine stranger that this is the way inwhich poets generally compose in states at the present day as faras i can observe except among us and among the are no regulations like those of which you speak in otherplaces novelties are always being introduced in dancing and inmusic generally not under the authority of any law but at theinstigation of lawless pleasures and these pleasures are so farfrom being the same as you describe the egyptian to be or having thesame principles that they are never the same 
 ath most true cleinias and i daresay that i may have expressedmyself obscurely and so led you to imagine that i was speaking ofsome really existing state of things whereas i was only saying whatregulations i would like to have about music and hence there occurreda misapprehension on your part for when evils are far gone andirremediable the task of censuring them is never pleasant althoughat times necessary but as we do not really differ will you let meask you whether you consider such institutions to be more prevalentamong the cretans and lacedaemonians than among the other hellenes 
 cle certainly they are 
 ath and if they were extended to the other hellenes would it be animprovement on the present state of things 
 cle a very great improvement if the customs which prevail amongthem were such as prevail among us and the lacedaemonians and such asyou were just now saying ought to prevail 
 ath let us see whether we understand one not theprinciples of education and music which prevail among you asfollows you compel your poets to say that the good man if he betemperate and just is fortunate and happy and this whether he begreat and strong or small and weak and whether he be rich or on the other hand if he have a wealth passing that of cinyras ormidas and be unjust he is wretched and lives in misery as thepoet says and with truth i sing not i care not about him whoaccomplishes all noble things not having justice let him near and stretches out his hand against his enemies be a justman but if he be unjust i would not have him look calmly uponbloody death nor surpass in swiftness the thracian boreas and letno other thing that is called good ever be his for the goods of whichthe many speak are not really good first in the catalogue is placedhealth beauty next wealth third and then innumerable others as forexample to have a keen eye or a quick ear and in general to haveall the senses perfect or again to be a tyrant and do as youlike and the final consummation of happiness is to have acquiredall these things and when you have acquired them to become at onceimmortal but you and i say that while to the just and holy all thesethings are the best of possessions to the unjust they are even health the greatest of evils for in truth to havesight and hearing and the use of the senses or to live at allwithout justice and virtue even though a man be rich in all goods of fortune is the greatest of evils if life beimmortal but not so great if the bad man lives only a very shorttime these are the truths which if i am not mistaken you willpersuade or compel your poets to utter with suitable accompaniments ofharmony and rhythm and in these they must train up your youth am inot right for i plainly declare that evils as they are termed aregoods to the unjust and only evils to the just and that goods aretruly good to the good but evil to the evil let me ask again areyou and i agreed about this 
 cle i think that we partly agree and partly do not 
 ath when a man has health and wealth and a tyranny which lasts andwhen he is preeminent in strength and courage and has the gift ofimmortality and none of the evils which goods but only the injustice and insolence of his own an one you are i suspect unwilling to believe that he ismiserable rather than happy 
 cle that is quite true 
 ath once more suppose that he be valiant and strong andhandsome and rich and does throughout his whole life whatever helikes still if he be unrighteous and insolent would not both of youagree that he will of necessity live basely you will surely grantso much 
 cle certainly 
 ath and an evil life too 
 cle i am not equally disposed to grant that 
 ath will he not live painfully and to his own disadvantage 
 cle how can i possibly say so 
 ath how then may heaven make us to be of one mind for now weare of two to me dear cleinias the truth of what i am saying isas plain as the fact that crete is an island and if i were alawgiver i would try to make the poets and all the citizens speakin this strain and i would inflict the heaviest penalties on anyone in all the land who should dare to say that there are bad menwho lead pleasant lives or that the profitable and gainful is onething and the just another and there are many other matters aboutwhich i should make my citizens speak in a manner different from thecretans and lacedaemonians of this age and i may say indeed fromthe world in general for tell me my good friends by zeus and apollotell me if i were to ask these same gods who were your the most just life also the pleasantest or are there two of which is the justest and the other the theywere to reply that there are two and thereupon i proceeded to would be the right way of pursuing the enquiry which are who lead the justest or those who lead thepleasantest life and they replied those who lead would be a very strange answer which i should notlike to put into the mouth of the gods the words will come withmore propriety from the lips of fathers and legislators and thereforei will repeat my former questions to one of them and suppose him tosay again that he who leads the pleasantest life is the to that i my father did you not wish me to live ashappily as possible and yet you also never ceased telling me that ishould live as justly as possible now here the giver of the he be legislator or father will be in a dilemma and willin vain endeavour to be consistent with himself but if he were todeclare that the justest life is also the happiest every onehearing him would enquire if i am not mistaken what is that good andnoble principle in life which the law approves and which issuperior to pleasure for what good can the just man have which isseparated from pleasure shall we say that glory and fame coming fromgods and men though good and noble are nevertheless infamy pleasant certainly not sweet legislator or shall wesay that the of wrong and there being no wrong done isgood and honourable although there is no pleasure in it and that thedoing wrong is pleasant but evil and base 
 cle impossible 
 ath the view which identifies the pleasant and the pleasant and thejust and the good and the noble has an excellent moral and religioustendency and the opposite view is most at variance with the designsof the legislator and is in his opinion infamous for no one if hecan help will be persuaded to do that which gives him more painthan pleasure but as distant prospects are apt to make us in childhood the legislator will try to purge away thedarkness and exhibit the truth he will persuade the citizens in someway or other by customs and praises and words that just and unjustare shadows only and that injustice which seems opposed tojustice when contemplated by the unjust and evil man appears pleasantand the just most unpleasant but that from the just point ofview the very opposite is the appearance of both of them 
 cle true 
 ath and which may be supposed to be the truer ofthe inferior or of the better soul 
 cle surely that of the better soul 
 ath then the unjust life must not only be more base and also more unpleasant than the just and holy life 
 cle that seems to be implied in the present argument 
 ath and even supposing this were otherwise and not as the argumenthas proven still the lawgiver who is worth anything if he everventures to tell a lie to the young for their good could not invent amore useful lie than this or one which will have a better effect inmaking them do what is right not on compulsion but voluntarily 
 cle truth stranger is a noble thing and a lasting but a thing ofwhich men are hard to be persuaded 
 ath and yet the story of the sidonian cadmus which is soimprobable has been readily believed and also innumerable othertales 
 cle what is that story 
 ath the story of armed men springing up after the sowing ofteeth which the legislator may take as a proof that he can persuadethe minds of the young of anything so that he has only to reflect andfind out what belief will be of the greatest public advantage andthen use all his efforts to make the whole community utter one and thesame word in their songs and tales and discourses all their life if you do not agree with me there is no reason why you should notargue on the other side 
 cle i do not see that any argument can fairly be raised by eitherof us against what you are now saying 
 ath the next suggestion which i have to offer is that all ourthree choruses shall sing to the young and tender souls of in their strains all the noble thoughts of which we havealready spoken or are about to speak and the sum of them shall the life which is by the gods deemed to be the happiest is alsothe shall affirm this to be a most certain truth and theminds of our young disciples will be more likely to receive thesewords of ours than any others which we might address to them 
 cle i assent to what you say 
 ath first will enter in their natural order the sacred choircomposed of children which is to sing lustily the layto the whole city next will follow the choir of young men under theage of thirty who will call upon the god paean to testify to thetruth of their words and will pray him to be gracious to the youthand to turn their hearts thirdly the choir of elder men who arefrom thirty to sixty years of age will also sing there remainthose who are too old to sing and they will tell the same virtues as with the voice of an oracle 
 cle who are those who compose the third choir stranger for i donot clearly understand what you mean to say about them 
 ath and yet almost all that i have been saying has said with a viewto them 
 cle will you try to be a little plainer 
 ath i was speaking at the commencement of our discourse as youwill remember of the fiery nature of young creatures i said thatthey were unable to keep quiet either in limb or voice and thatthey called out and jumped about in a disorderly manner and that noother animal attained to any perception of order but man only nowthe order of motion is called rhythm and the order of the voice inwhich high and low are duly mingled is called harmony and bothtogether are termed choric song and i said that the gods had pityon us and gave us apollo and the muses to be our playfellows andleaders in the dance and dionysus as i dare say that you willremember was the third 
 cle i quite remember 
 ath thus far i have spoken of the chorus of apollo and the i have still to speak of the remaining chorus which is that ofdionysus 
 cle how is that arranged there is something strange at any rateon first hearing in a dionysiac chorus of old men if you really meanthat those who are above thirty and may be fifty or from fifty tosixty years of age are to dance in his honour 
 ath very true and therefore it must be shown that there is goodreason for the proposal 
 cle certainly 
 ath are we agreed thus far 
 cle about what 
 ath that every man and boy slave and free both sexes and thewhole city should never cease charming themselves with the strains ofwhich we have spoken and that there should be every sort of changeand variation of them in order to take away the effect of sameness sothat the singers may always receive pleasure from their hymns and maynever weary of them 
 cle every one will agree 
 ath where then will that best part of our city which by reasonof age and intelligence has the greatest influence sing thesefairest of strains which are to do so much good shall we be sofoolish as to let them off who would give us the most beautiful andalso the most useful of songs 
 cle but says the argument we cannot let them off 
 ath then how can we carry out our purpose with decorum will thisbe the way 
 cle what 
 ath when a man is advancing in years he is afraid and reluctant has no pleasure in his own performances and if compulsion isused he will be more and more ashamed the older and more discreet not this true 
 cle certainly 
 ath well and will he not be yet more ashamed if he has to stand upand sing in the theatre to a mixed if moreover when heis required to do so like the other choirs who contend for have been trained under a singing master he is pinched andhungry he will certainly have a feeling of shame and discomfort whichwill make him very unwilling to exhibit 
 cle no doubt 
 ath how then shall we reassure him and get him to sing shall webegin by enacting that boys shall not taste wine at all until they areeighteen years of age we will tell them that fire must not bepoured upon fire whether in the body or in the soul until they beginto go to is a precaution which has to be taken against theexcitableness of they may taste wine in moderationup to the age of thirty but while a man is young he should abstainaltogether from intoxication and from excess of wine when at has reached forty years after dinner at a public mess he mayinvite not only the other gods but dionysus above all to the mysteryand festivity of the elder men making use of the wine which he hasgiven men to lighten the sourness of old age that in age we may renewour youth and forget our sorrows and also in order that the natureof the soul like iron melted in the fire may become softer and somore impressible in the first place will not any one who is thusmellowed be more ready and less ashamed to do not say beforea large audience but before a moderate company nor yet amongstrangers but among his familiars and as we have often said tochant and to enchant 
 cle he will be far more ready 
 ath there will be no impropriety in our using such a method ofpersuading them to join with us in song 
 cle none at all 
 ath and what strain will they sing and what muse will they strain should clearly be one suitable to them 
 cle certainly 
 ath and what strain is suitable for heroes shall they sing achoric strain 
 cle truly stranger we of crete and lacedaemon know no strainother than that which we have learnt and been accustomed to sing inour chorus 
 ath i dare say for you have never acquired the knowledge of themost beautiful kind of song in your military way of life which ismodelled after the camp and is not like that of dwellers in you have your young men herding and feeding together like youngcolts no one takes his own individual colt and drags him away fromhis fellows against his will raging and foaming and gives him agroom to attend to him alone and trains and rubs him downprivately and gives him the qualities in education which will makehim not only a good soldier but also a governor of a state and ofcities such an one as we said at first would be a greater warriorthan he of whom tyrtaeus sings and he would honour courageeverywhere but always as the fourth and not as the first part ofvirtue either in individuals or states 
 cle once more stranger i must complain that you depreciate ourlawgivers 
 ath not intentionally if at all my good friend but whither theargument leads thither let us follow for if there be indeed somestrain of song more beautiful than that of the choruses or thepublic theatres i should like to impart it to those who as we ashamed of these and want to have the best 
 cle certainly 
 ath when things have an accompanying charm either the best thingin them is this very charm or there is some rightness or utilitypossessed by example i should say that eating and the use of food in general have an accompanying charm which wecall pleasure but that this rightness and utility is just thehealthfulness of the things served up to us which is their truerightness 
 cle just so 
 ath thus too i should say that learning has a certainaccompanying charm which is the pleasure but that the right and theprofitable the good and the noble are qualities which the truthgives to it 
 cle exactly 
 ath and so in the imitative they succeed in makinglikenesses and are accompanied by pleasure may not their works besaid to have a charm 
 cle yes 
 ath but equal proportions whether of quality or quantity andnot pleasure speaking generally would give them truth or rightness 
 cle yes 
 ath then that only can be rightly judged by the standard ofpleasure which makes or furnishes no utility or truth or on the other hand is productive of any hurtful quality but existssolely for the sake of the accompanying charm and the term most appropriately applied to it when these other qualities areabsent 
 cle you are speaking of harmless pleasure are you not 
 ath yes and this i term amusement when doing neither harm norgood in any degree worth speaking of 
 cle very true 
 ath then if such be our principles we must assert thatimitation is not to be judged of by pleasure and false opinion andthis is true of all equality for the equal is not equal or thesymmetrical symmetrical because somebody thinks or likes they are to be judged of by the standard of truth and by no otherwhatever 
 cle quite true 
 ath do we not regard all music as representative and imitative 
 cle certainly 
 ath then when any one says that music is to be judged of bypleasure his doctrine cannot be admitted and if there be any musicof which pleasure is the criterion such music is not to be sought outor deemed to have any real excellence but only that other kind ofmusic which is an imitation of the good 
 cle very true 
 ath and those who seek for the best kind of song and music oughtnot to seek for that which is pleasant but for that which is the truth of imitation consists as we were saying in renderingthe thing imitated according to quantity and quality 
 cle certainly 
 ath and every one will admit that musical compositions are allimitative and representative will not poets and spectators and actorsall agree in this 
 cle they will 
 ath surely then he who would judge correctly must know what eachcomposition is for if he does not know what is the character andmeaning of the piece and what it represents he will never discernwhether the intention is true or false 
 cle certainly not 
 ath and will he who does not know what is true be able todistinguish what is good and bad my statement is not very perhaps you will understand me better if i put the matter inanother way 
 cle how 
 ath there are ten thousand likenesses of objects of sight 
 cle yes 
 ath and can he who does not know what the exact object is whichis imitated ever know whether the resemblance is truthfully mean for example whether a statue has the proportions of a the true situation of the parts what those proportions are andhow the parts fit into one another in due order also their coloursand conformations or whether this is all confused in the you think that any one can know about this who does not knowwhat the animal is which has been imitated 
 cle impossible 
 ath but even if we know that the thing pictured or sculptured isa man who has received at the hand of the artist all his proper partsand colours and shapes must we not also know whether the work isbeautiful or in any respect deficient in beauty 
 cle if this were not required stranger we should all of us bejudges of beauty 
 ath very true and may we not say that in everything in drawing music or any other art he who is to be acompetent judge must possess three must know in thefirst place of what the imitation is secondly he must know thatit is true and thirdly that it has been well executed in words andmelodies and rhythms 
 cle certainly 
 ath then let us not faint in discussing the peculiar difficultyof music music is more celebrated than any other kind of therefore requires the greatest care of them all for if a manmakes a mistake here he may do himself the greatest injury bywelcoming evil dispositions and the mistake may be very difficultto discern because the poets are artists very inferior in characterto the muses themselves who would never fall into the monstrous errorof assigning to the words of men the gestures and songs of after combining the melodies with the gestures of freemen wouldthey add on the rhythms of slaves and men of the baser sort with the rhythms and gestures of freemen would theyassign to them a melody or words which are of an opposite would they mix up the voices and sounds of animals and of menand instruments and every other sort of noise as if they were allone but human poets are fond of introducing this sort of inconsistentmixture and so make themselves ridiculous in the eyes of those orpheus says are ripe for true pleasure the experienced see allthis confusion and yet the poets go on and make still further havocby separating the rhythm and the figure of the dance from themelody setting bare words to metre and also separating the melodyand the rhythm from the words using the lyre or the flute when there are no words it is very difficult to recognize themeaning of the harmony and rhythm or to see that any worthy object isimitated by them and we must acknowledge that all this sort of aims only at swiftness and smoothness and a brutish noise anduses the flute and the lyre not as the mere accompaniments of thedance and song is exceedingly coarse and tasteless the use of eitherinstrument when unaccompanied leads to every sort of irregularityand trickery this is all rational enough but we are consideringnot how our choristers who are from thirty to fifty years of age andmay be over fifty are not to use the muses but how they are to usethem and the considerations which we have urged seem to show inwhat way these fifty choristers who are to sing may beexpected to be better trained for they need to have a quickperception and knowledge of harmonies and rhythms otherwise howcan they ever know whether a melody would be rightly sung to thedorian mode or to the rhythm which the poet has assigned to it 
 cle clearly they cannot 
 ath the many are ridiculous in imagining that they know what isin proper harmony and rhythm and what is not when they can only bemade to sing and step in rhythm by force it never occurs to them thatthey are ignorant of what they are doing now every melody is rightwhen it has suitable harmony and rhythm and wrong when unsuitable 
 cle that is most certain 
 ath but can a man who does not know a thing as we were that the thing is right 
 cle impossible 
 ath then now as would appear we are making the discovery that choristers whom we hereby invite and although theyare their own masters compel to sing must be educated to such anextent as to be able to follow the steps of the rhythm and the notesof the song that they may know the harmonies and rhythms and be ableto select what are suitable for men of their age and character tosing and may sing them and have innocent pleasure from their ownperformance and also lead younger men to welcome with dutiful delightgood dispositions having such training they will attain a moreaccurate knowledge than falls to the lot of the common people or evenof the poets themselves for the poet need not know the third whether the imitation is good or not though he can hardlyhelp knowing the laws of melody and rhythm but the aged chorus mustknow all the three that they may choose the best and that which isnearest to the best for otherwise they will never be able to charmthe souls of young men in the way of virtue and now the originaldesign of the argument which was intended to bring eloquent aid to thechorus of dionysus has been accomplished to the best of ourability and let us see whether we were should imagine that adrinking assembly is likely to become more and more tumultuous asthe drinking goes on this as we were saying at first will certainlybe the case 
 cle certainly 
 ath every man has a more than natural elevation his heart isglad within him and he will say anything and will be restrained bynobody at such a time he fancies that he is able to rule over himselfand all mankind 
 cle quite true 
 ath were we not saying that on such occasions the souls of thedrinkers become like iron heated in the fire and grow softer andyounger and are easily moulded by him who knows how to educate andfashion them just as when they were young and that this fashioner ofthem is the same who prescribed for them in the days of their the good legislator and that he ought to enact laws of thebanquet which when a man is confident bold and impudent andunwilling to wait his turn and have his share of silence and drinking and music will change his character into laws as will infuse into him a just and noble will take up arms at the approach of insolence being thatdivine fear which we have called reverence and shame 
 cle true 
 ath and the guardians of these laws and with themare the calm and sober generals of the drinkers and without theirhelp there is greater difficulty in fighting against drink than infighting against enemies when the commander of an army is nothimself calm and he who is unwilling to obey them and thecommanders of dionysiac feasts who are more than sixty years of suffer a disgrace as great as he who disobeys militaryleaders or even greater 
 cle right 
 ath if then drinking and amusement were regulated in this not the companions of our revels be improved they would partbetter friends than they were and not as now enemies their wholeintercourse would be regulated by law and observant of it and thesober would be the leaders of the drunken 
 cle i think so too if drinking were regulated as you propose 
 ath let us not then simply censure the gift of dionysus as badand unfit to be received into the state for wine has manyexcellences and one one about which there is adifficulty in speaking to the many from a fear of their misconceivingand misunderstanding what is said 
 cle to what do you refer 
 ath there is a tradition or story which has somehow crept aboutthe world that dionysus was robbed of his wits by his stepmotherhere and that out of revenge he inspires bacchic furies and dancingmadnesses in others for which reason he gave men wine suchtraditions concerning the gods i leave to those who think that theymay be safely uttered i only know that no animal at birth is matureor perfect in intelligence and in the intermediate period in whichhe has not yet acquired his own proper sense he rages and roarswithout rhyme or reason and when he has once got on his legs he jumpsabout without rhyme or reason and this as you will remember hasbeen already said by us to be the origin of music and gymnastic 
 cle to be sure i remember 
 ath and did we not say that the sense of harmony and rhythmsprang from this beginning among men and that apollo and the musesand dionysus were the gods whom we had to thank for them 
 cle certainly 
 ath the other story implied that wine was given man out of in order to make him mad but our present doctrine on thecontrary is that wine was given him as a balm and in order toimplant modesty in the soul and health and strength in the body 
 cle that stranger is precisely what was said 
 ath then half the subject may now be considered to have beendiscussed shall we proceed to the consideration of the other half 
 cle what is the other half and how do you divide the subject 
 ath the whole choral art is also in our view the whole ofeducation and of this art rhythms and harmonies form the partwhich has to do with the voice 
 cle yes 
 ath the movement of the body has rhythm in common with the movementof the voice but gesture is peculiar to it whereas song is simplythe movement of the voice 
 cle most true 
 ath and the sound of the voice which reaches and educates the have ventured to term music 
 cle we were right 
 ath and the movement of the body when regarded as an amusement wetermed dancing but when extended and pursued with a view to theexcellence of the body this scientific training may be calledgymnastic 
 cle exactly 
 ath music which was one half of the choral art may be said tohave been completely discussed shall we proceed to the other halfor not what would you like 
 cle my good friend when you are talking with a cretan andlacedaemonian and we have discussed music and not gymnastic whatanswer are either of us likely to make to such an enquiry 
 ath an answer is contained in your question and i understand andaccept what you say not only as an answer but also as a command toproceed with gymnastic 
 cle you quite understand me do as you say 
 ath i will and there will not be any difficulty in speakingintelligibly to you about a subject with which both of you are farmore familiar than with music 
 cle there will not 
 ath is not the origin of gymnastics too to be sought in thetendency to rapid motion which exists in all animals man as wewere saying having attained the sense of rhythm created and inventeddancing and melody arousing and awakening rhythm both unitedformed the choral art 
 cle very true 
 ath and one part of this subject has been already discussed byus and there still remains another to be discussed 
 cle exactly 
 ath i have first a final word to add to my discourse about you will allow me to do so 
 cle what more have you to say 
 ath i should say that if a city seriously means to adopt thepractice of drinking under due regulation and with a view to theenforcement of temperance and in like manner and on the sameprinciple will allow of other pleasures designing to gain thevictory over them in this way all of them may be used but if thestate makes drinking an amusement only and whoever likes may drinkwhenever he likes and with whom he likes and add to this any otherindulgences i shall never agree or allow that this city or this manshould practise drinking i would go further than the cretans andlacedaemonians and am disposed rather to the law of thecarthaginians that no one while he is on a campaign should be allowedto taste wine at all but that he should drink water during all thattime and that in the city no slave male or female should ever drinkwine and that no magistrates should drink during their year ofoffice nor should pilots of vessels or judges while on duty tastewine at all nor any one who is going to hold a consultation about anymatter of importance nor in the daytime at all unless in consequenceof exercise or as medicine nor again at night when any one eitherman or woman is minded to get children there are numberless othercases also in which those who have good sense and good laws oughtnot to drink wine so that if what i say is true no city will needmany vineyards their husbandry and their way of life in generalwill follow an appointed order and their cultivation of the vine willbe the most limited and the least common of their employments andthis stranger shall be the crown of my discourse about wine ifyou agree 
 cle excellent we agree

 book iii 
 
 athenian stranger enough of this and what then is to be regardedas the origin of government will not a man be able to judge of itbest from a point of view in which he may behold the progress ofstates and their transitions to good or evil 
 cleinias what do you mean 
 ath i mean that he might watch them from the point of view of observe the changes which take place in them during infinite ages 
 cle how so 
 ath why do you think that you can reckon the time which haselapsed since cities first existed and men were citizens of them 
 cle hardly 
 ath but are sure that it must be vast and incalculable 
 cle certainly 
 ath and have not thousands and thousands of cities come intobeing during this period and as many perished and has not each ofthem had every form of government many times over now growing smaller and again improving or declining 
 cle to be sure 
 ath let us endeavour to ascertain the cause of these changes forthat will probably explain the first origin and development of formsof government 
 cle very good you shall endeavour to impart your thoughts to we will make an effort to understand you 
 ath do you believe that there is any truth in ancient traditions 
 cle what traditions 
 ath the traditions about the many destructions of mankind whichhave been occasioned by deluges and pestilences and in many otherways and of the survival of a remnant 
 cle every one is disposed to believe them 
 ath let us consider one of them that which was caused by thefamous deluge 
 cle what are we to observe about it 
 ath i mean to say that those who then escaped would only be sparks of the human race preserved on the tops ofmountains 
 cle clearly 
 ath such survivors would necessarily be unacquainted with thearts and the various devices which are suggested to the dwellers incities by interest or ambition and with all the wrongs which theycontrive against one another 
 cle very true 
 ath let us suppose then that the cities in the plain and on were utterly destroyed at that time 
 cle very good 
 ath would not all implements have then perished and every otherexcellent invention of political or any other sort of wisdom haveutterly disappeared 
 cle why yes my friend and if things had always continued as theyare at present ordered how could any discovery have ever been madeeven in the least particular for it is evident that the arts wereunknown during ten thousand times ten thousand years and no more thana thousand or two thousand years have elapsed since the discoveries ofdaedalus orpheus and marsyas and olympus inventedmusic and amphion the to speak of numberless otherinventions which are but of yesterday 
 ath have you forgotten cleinias the name of a friend who isreally of yesterday 
 cle i suppose that you mean epimenides 
 ath the same my friend he does indeed far overleap the heads ofall mankind by his invention for he carried out in practice as youdeclare what of old hesiod only preached 
 cle yes according to our tradition 
 ath after the great destruction may we not suppose that thestate of man was something of this the beginning of thingsthere was a fearful illimitable desert and a vast expanse of land aherd or two of oxen would be the only survivors of the animal there might be a few goats these too hardly enough to maintainthe shepherds who tended them 
 cle true 
 ath and of cities or governments or legislation about which we arenow talking do you suppose that they could have any recollection atall 
 cle none whatever 
 ath and out of this state of things has there not sprung all thatwe now are and have cities and governments and arts and laws anda great deal of vice and a great deal of virtue 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath why my good friend how can we possibly suppose that those whoknew nothing of all the good and evil of cities could have attainedtheir full development whether of virtue or of vice 
 cle i understand your meaning and you are quite right 
 ath but as time advanced and the race multiplied the world cameto be what the world is 
 cle very true 
 ath doubtless the change was not made all in a moment but littleby little during a very long period of time 
 cle a highly probable supposition 
 ath at first they would have a natural fear ringing in theirears which would prevent their descending from the heights into theplain 
 cle of course 
 ath the fewness of the survivors at that time would have madethem all the more desirous of seeing one another but then the meansof travelling either by land or sea had been almost entirely i may say with the loss of the arts and there was greatdifficulty in getting at one another for iron and brass and allmetals were jumbled together and had disappeared in the chaos nor wasthere any possibility of extracting ore from them and they hadscarcely any means of felling timber even if you suppose that someimplements might have been preserved in the mountains they mustquickly have worn out and vanished and there would be no more of themuntil the art of metallurgy had again revived 
 cle there could not have been 
 ath in how many generations would this be attained 
 cle clearly not for many generations 
 ath during this period and for some time afterwards all thearts which require iron and brass and the like would disappear 
 cle certainly 
 ath faction and war would also have died out in those days and formany reasons 
 cle how would that be 
 ath in the first place the desolation of these primitive men wouldcreate in them a feeling of affection and towards oneanother and secondly they would have no occasion to quarrel abouttheir subsistence for they would have pasture in abundance exceptjust at first and in some particular cases and from they would obtain the greater part of their food in aprimitive age having plenty of milk and flesh moreover they wouldprocure other food by the chase not to be despised either in quantityor quality they would also have abundance of clothing and dwellings and utensils either capable of standing on the fireor not for the plastic and weaving arts do not require any use ofiron and god has given these two arts to man in order to providehim with all such things that when reduced to the last human race may still grow and increase hence in those daysmankind were not very poor nor was poverty a cause of differenceamong them and rich they could not have been having neither gold at that time was their condition and the community whichhas neither poverty nor riches will always have the noblestprinciples in it there is no insolence or injustice nor there any contentions or envyings and therefore they were also because they were what is called and when theywere told about good and evil they in their simplicity believedwhat they heard to be very truth and practised it no one had thewit to suspect another of a falsehood as men do now but what theyheard about gods and men they believed to be true and livedaccordingly and therefore they were in all respects such as we havedescribed them 
 cle that quite accords with my views and with those of my friendhere 
 ath would not many generations living on in a simple ruder perhaps and more ignorant of the arts in particular of those of land or naval warfare and likewise ofother arts termed in cities legal practices and party including all conceivable ways of hurting one another in wordand inferior to those who lived before the deluge orto the men of our day in these respects would they not i say besimpler and more manly and also more temperate and altogether morejust the reason has been already explained 
 cle very true 
 ath i should wish you to understand that what has preceded and whatis about to follow has been and will be said with the intentionof explaining what need the men of that time had of laws and whowas their lawgiver 
 cle and thus far what you have said has been very well said 
 ath they could hardly have wanted lawgivers as yet nothing of thatsort was likely to have existed in their days for they had no lettersat this early period they lived by habit and the customs of theirancestors as they are called 
 cle probably 
 ath but there was already existing a form of government which if iam not mistaken is generally termed a lordship and this stillremains in many places both among hellenes and barbarians and is thegovernment which is declared by homer to have prevailed among thecyclopes 
 they have neither councils nor judgments but they dwell in hollowcaves on the tops of high mountains and every one gives law to hiswife and children and they do not busy themselves about one another 
 cle that seems to be a charming poet of yours i have read someother verses of his which are very clever but i do not know muchof him for foreign poets are very little read among the cretans 
 megillus but they are in lacedaemon and he appears to be theprince of them all the manner of life however which he describes isnot spartan but rather ionian and he seems quite to confirm what youare saying when he traces up the ancient state of mankind by the helpof tradition to barbarism 
 ath yes he does confirm it and we may accept his witness to thefact that such forms of government sometimes arise 
 cle we may 
 ath and were not such states composed of men who had been dispersedin single habitations and families by the poverty which attended thedevastations and did not the eldest then rule among them becausewith them government originated in the authority of a father and amother whom like a flock of birds they followed forming onetroop under the patriarchal rule and sovereignty of their of all sovereignties is the most just 
 cle very true 
 ath after this they came together in greater numbers and increasedthe size of their cities and betook themselves to husbandry first ofall at the foot of the mountains and made enclosures of loose wallsand works of defence in order to keep off wild beasts thuscreating a single large and common habitation 
 cle yes at least we may suppose so 
 ath there is another thing which would probably happen 
 cle what 
 ath when these larger habitations grew up out of the lesseroriginal ones each of the lesser ones would survive in the family would be under the rule of the eldest and owing totheir separation from one another would have peculiar customs inthings divine and human which they would have received from theirseveral parents who had educated them and these customs would inclinethem to order when the parents had the element of order in theirnature and to courage when they had the element of courage and theywould naturally stamp upon their children and upon their their own likings and as we are saying they would findtheir way into the larger society having already their own peculiarlaws 
 cle certainly 
 ath and every man surely likes his own laws best and the laws ofothers not so well 
 cle true 
 ath then now we seem to have stumbled upon the beginnings oflegislation 
 cle exactly 
 ath the next step will be that these persons who have met select some arbiters who will review the laws of all of will publicly present such as they approve to the chiefs wholead the tribes and who are in a manner their kings allowing them tochoose those which they think best these persons will themselves becalled legislators and will appoint the magistrates framing somesort of aristocracy or perhaps monarchy out of the dynasties orlordships and in this altered state of the government they will live 
 cle yes that would be the natural order of things 
 ath then now let us speak of a third form of government inwhich all other forms and conditions of polities and cities concur 
 cle what is that 
 ath the form which in fact homer indicates as following the third form arose when as he says dardanus founded dardania 
 for not as yet had the holy ilium been built on the plain to be acity of speaking men but they were still dwelling at the foot indeed in these verses and in what he said of the cyclopes hespeaks the words of god and nature for poets are a divine race andoften in their strains by the aid of the muses and the graces theyattain truth 
 cle yes 
 ath then now let us proceed with the rest of our tale which willprobably be found to illustrate in some degree our we do so 
 cle by all means 
 ath ilium was built when they descended from the mountain in alarge and fair plain on a sort of low hill watered by many riversdescending from ida 
 cle such is the tradition 
 ath and we must suppose this event to have taken place many agesafter the deluge 
 ath a marvellous forgetfulness of the former destruction wouldappear to have come over them when they placed their town right undernumerous streams flowing from the heights trusting for their securityto not very high hills either 
 cle there must have been a long interval clearly 
 ath and as population increased many other cities would beginto be inhabited 
 cle doubtless 
 ath those cities made war against sea as well as that time men were ceasing to be afraid of the sea 
 cle clearly 
 ath the achaeans remained ten years and overthrew troy 
 cle true 
 ath and during the ten years in which the achaeans were besiegingilium the homes of the besiegers were falling into an evil youth revolted and when the soldiers returned to their owncities and families they did not receive them properly and as theyought to have done and numerous deaths murders exiles were theconsequence the exiles came again under a new name no longerachaeans but name which they derived from dorieus for itwas he who gathered them together the rest of the story is told byyou lacedaemonians as part of the history of sparta 
 meg to be sure 
 ath thus after digressing from the original subject of laws intomusic and the argument has providentially comeback to the same point and presents to us another handle for we havereached the settlement of lacedaemon which as you truly say is inlaws and in institutions the sister of crete and we are all thebetter for the digression because we have gone through variousgovernments and settlements and have been present at the foundationof a first second and third state succeeding one another ininfinite time and now there appears on the horizon a fourth stateor nation which was once in process of settlement and has continuedsettled to this day if out of all this we are able to discernwhat is well or ill settled and what laws are the salvation andwhat are the destruction of cities and what changes would make astate happy o megillus and cleinias we may now begin again unlesswe have some fault to find with the previous discussion 
 meg if some god stranger would promise us that our new enquiryabout legislation would be as good and full as the present i would goa great way to hear such another and would think that a day as longas we are now approaching the longest day of the tooshort for the discussion 
 ath then i suppose that we must consider this subject 
 meg certainly 
 ath let us place ourselves in thought at the moment when lacedaemonand argos and messene and the rest of the peloponnesus were all incomplete subjection megillus to your ancestors for afterwards asthe legend informs us they divided their army into three settled three cities argos messene lacedaemon 
 meg true 
 ath temenus was the king of argos cresphontes of and eurysthenes of lacedaemon 
 meg certainly 
 ath to these kings all the men of that day made oath that theywould assist them if any one subverted their kingdom 
 meg true 
 ath but can a kingship be destroyed or was any other form ofgovernment ever destroyed by any but the rulers themselves noindeed by zeus have we already forgotten what was said a littlewhile ago 
 meg no 
 ath and may we not now further confirm what was then mentioned forwe have come upon facts which have brought us back again to the sameprinciple so that in resuming the discussion we shall not beenquiring about an empty theory but about events which actuallyhappened the case was as royal heroes made oath tothree cities which were under a kingly government and the cities tothe kings that both rulers and subjects should govern and be governedaccording to the laws which were common to all of them the rulerspromised that as time and the race went forward they would not maketheir rule more arbitrary and the subjects said that if the rulersobserved these conditions they would never subvert or permit othersto subvert those kingdoms the kings were to assist kings andpeoples when injured and the peoples were to assist peoples and kingsin like manner is not this the fact 
 meg yes 
 ath and the three states to whom these laws were given whethertheir kings or any others were the authors of them had thereforethe greatest security for the maintenance of their constitutions 
 meg what security 
 ath that the other two states were always to come to the rescueagainst a rebellious third 
 meg true 
 ath many persons say that legislators ought to impose such lawsas the mass of the people will be ready to receive but this is justas if one were to command gymnastic masters or physicians to treator cure their pupils or patients in an agreeable manner 
 meg exactly 
 ath whereas the physician may often be too happy if he canrestore health and make the body whole without any very greatinfliction of pain 
 meg certainly 
 ath there was also another advantage possessed by the men of thatday which greatly lightened the task of passing laws 
 meg what advantage 
 ath the legislators of that day when they equalized the great accusation which generally arises in legislation ifa person attempts to disturb the possession of land or to abolishdebts because he sees that without this reform there can never be anyreal equality now in general when the legislator attempts to make anew settlement of such matters every one meets him with the cry is not to disturb vested with imprecationsthat he is introducing agrarian laws and cancelling of debts untila man is at his wits end whereas no one could quarrel with thedorians for distributing the was nothing to hinder as for debts they had none which were considerable or of oldstanding 
 meg very true 
 ath but then my good friends why did the settlement andlegislation of their country turn out so badly 
 meg how do you mean and why do you blame them 
 ath there were three kingdoms and of these two quicklycorrupted their original constitution and laws and the only one whichremained was the spartan 
 meg the question which you ask is not easily answered 
 ath and yet must be answered when we are enquiring about laws thisbeing our old sober game of play whereby we beguile the way asi was saying when we first set out on our journey 
 meg certainly and we must find out why this was 
 ath what laws are more worthy of our attention than those whichhave regulated such cities or what settlements of states aregreater or more famous 
 meg i know of none 
 ath can we doubt that your ancestors intended these institutionsnot only for the protection of peloponnesus but of all thehellenes in case they were attacked by the barbarian for theinhabitants of the region about ilium when they provoked by theirinsolence the trojan war relied upon the power of the assyrians andthe empire of ninus which still existed and had a great prestige thepeople of those days fearing the united assyrian empire just as we nowfear the great king and the second capture of troy was a seriousoffence against them because troy was a portion of the assyrianempire to meet the danger the single army was distributed betweenthree cities by the royal brothers sons of fair device asit seemed and a far better arrangement than the expedition againsttroy for firstly the people of that day had as they thought inthe heraclidae better leaders than the pelopidae in the next considered that their army was superior in valour to that whichwent against troy for although the latter conquered the were themselves conquered by the bydorians may we not suppose that this was the intention with which themen of those days framed the constitutions of their states 
 meg quite true 
 ath and would not men who had shared with one another many were governed by a single race of royal brothers and had takenthe advice of oracles and in particular of the delphian apollo belikely to think that such states would be firmly and lastinglyestablished 
 meg of course they would 
 ath yet these institutions of which such great expectations wereentertained seem to have all rapidly vanished away with theexception as i was saying of that small part of them which existedin this third part has never to this day ceased warringagainst the two others whereas if the original idea had been carriedout and they had agreed to be one their power would have beeninvincible in war 
 meg no doubt 
 ath but what was the ruin of this glorious confederacy here is asubject well worthy of consideration 
 meg certainly no one will ever find more striking instances oflaws or governments being the salvation or destruction of great andnoble interests than are here presented to his view 
 ath then now we seem to have happily arrived at a real andimportant question 
 meg very true 
 ath did you never remark sage friend that all men and weourselves at this moment often fancy that they see some beautifulthing which might have effected wonders if any one had only knownhow to make a right use of it in some way and yet this mode oflooking at things may turn out after all to be a mistake and notaccording to nature either in our own case or in any other 
 meg to what are you referring and what do you mean 
 ath i was thinking of my own admiration of the aforesaidheracleid expedition which was so noble and might have had suchwonderful results for the hellenes if only rightly used and i wasjust laughing at myself 
 meg but were you not right and wise in speaking as you did andwe in assenting to you 
 ath perhaps and yet i cannot help observing that any one whosees anything great or powerful immediately has the the owner only knew how to use his great and noblepossession how happy would he be and what great results would heachieve 
 meg and would he not be justified 
 ath reflect in what point of view does this sort of praiseappear just first in reference to the question in thethen commanders had known how to arrange their army properly howwould they have attained success would not this have been the would have bound them all firmly together and preserved themfor ever giving them freedom and dominion at pleasure combinedwith the power of doing in the whole world hellenic and they and their descendants desired what other aim would theyhave had 
 meg very good 
 ath suppose any one were in the same way to express hisadmiration at the sight of great wealth or family honour or the would praise them under the idea that through them he wouldattain either all or the greater and chief part of what he desires 
 meg he would 
 ath well now and does not the argument show that there is onecommon desire of all mankind 
 meg what is it 
 ath the desire which a man has that all things if anyrate things come to pass in accordance with his 
 meg certainly 
 ath and having this desire always and at every time of life inyouth in manhood in age he cannot help always praying for thefulfilment of it 
 meg no doubt 
 ath and we join in the prayers of our friends and ask for themwhat they ask for themselves 
 meg we do 
 ath dear is the son to the younger to the elder 
 meg of course 
 ath and yet the son often prays to obtain things which the fatherprays that he may not obtain 
 meg when the son is young and foolish you mean 
 ath yes or when the father in the dotage of age or the heat ofyouth having no sense of right and justice prays with fervour underthe influence of feelings akin to those of theseus when he cursedthe unfortunate hippolytus do you imagine that the son having asense of right and justice will join in his prayers 
 meg i understand you to mean that a man should not desire or bein a hurry to have all things according to his wish for his wishmay be at variance with his reason but every state and everyindividual ought to pray and strive for wisdom 
 ath yes and i remember and you will remember what i said atfirst that a statesman and legislator ought to ordain laws with aview to wisdom while you were arguing that the good lawgiver ought toorder all with a view to war and to this i replied that there werefour virtues but that upon your view one of them only was the aimof legislation whereas you ought to regard all virtue and especiallythat which comes first and is the leader of all the meanwisdom and mind and opinion having affection and desire in theirtrain and now the argument returns to the same point and i sayonce more in jest if you like or in earnest if you like that theprayer of a fool is full of danger being likely to end in theopposite of what he desires and if you would rather receive mywords in earnest i am willing that you should and you will find isuspect as i have said already that not cowardice was the cause ofthe ruin of the dorian kings and of their whole design norignorance of military matters either on the part of the rulers orof their subjects but their misfortunes were due to their generaldegeneracy and especially to their ignorance of the most importanthuman affairs that was then and is still and always will be thecase as i will endeavour if you will allow me to make out anddemonstrate as well as i am able to you who are my friends in thecourse of the argument 
 cle pray go on are troublesome but wewill show not in word but in deed how greatly we prize your we will give them our best attention and that is the way in whicha freeman best shows his approval or disapproval 
 meg excellent cleinias let us do as you say 
 cle by all means if heaven wills go on 
 ath well then proceeding in the same train of thought i say thatthe greatest ignorance was the ruin of the dorian power and that then ignorance is ruin and if this be true the legislator mustendeavour to implant wisdom in states and banish ignorance to theutmost of his power 
 cle that is evident 
 ath then now consider what is really the greatest ignorance ishould like to know whether you and megillus would agree with me inwhat i am about to say for my opinion is 
 cle what 
 ath that the greatest ignorance is when a man hates that which henevertheless thinks to be good and noble and loves and embracesthat which he knows to be unrighteous and evil this disagreementbetween the sense of pleasure and the judgment of reason in the soulis in my opinion the worst ignorance and also the greatest becauseaffecting the great mass of the human soul for the principle whichfeels pleasure and pain in the individual is like the mass or populacein a state and when the soul is opposed to knowledge or reason which are her natural lords that i call folly just asin the state when the multitude refuses to obey their rulers andthe laws or again in the individual when fair reasonings havetheir habitation in the soul and yet do no good but rather thereverse of good all these cases i term the worst ignorance whetherin individuals or in states you will understand stranger that iam speaking of something which is very different from the ignorance ofhandicraftsmen 
 cle yes my friend we understand and agree 
 ath let us then in the first place declare and affirm that thecitizen who does not know these things ought never to have any kind ofauthority entrusted to him he must be stigmatized as ignorant eventhough he be versed in calculation and skilled in all sorts ofaccomplishments and feats of mental dexterity and the opposite areto be called wise even although in the words of the proverb theyknow neither how to read nor how to swim and to them as to men ofsense authority is to be committed for o my friends how canthere be the least shadow of wisdom when there is no harmony there isnone but the noblest and greatest of harmonies may be truly said tobe the greatest wisdom and of this he is a partaker who livesaccording to reason whereas he who is devoid of reason is thedestroyer of his house and the very opposite of a saviour of thestate he is utterly ignorant of political wisdom let this i was saying be laid down by us 
 cle let it be so laid down 
 ath i suppose that there must be rulers and subjects in states 
 cle certainly 
 ath and what are the principles on which men rule and obey incities whether great or small and similarly in families what arethey and how many in number is there not one claim of authoritywhich is always of fathers and mothers and in general ofprogenitors to rule over their offspring 
 cle there is 
 ath next follows the principle that the noble should rule overthe ignoble and thirdly that the elder should rule and theyounger obey 
 cle to be sure 
 ath and fourthly that slaves should be ruled and their mastersrule 
 cle of course 
 ath fifthly if i am not mistaken comes the principle that thestronger shall rule and the weaker be ruled 
 cle that is a rule not to be disobeyed 
 ath yes and a rule which prevails very widely among all is according to nature as the theban poet pindar once said andthe sixth principle and the greatest of all is that the wise shouldlead and command and the ignorant follow and obey and yet o thoumost wise pindar as i should reply him this surely is not contraryto nature but according to nature being the rule of law over willingsubjects and not a rule of compulsion 
 cle most true 
 ath there is a seventh kind of rule which is awarded by lot and isdear to the gods and a token of good fortune he on whom the lot fallsis a ruler and he who fails in obtaining the lot goes away and is thesubject and this we affirm to be quite just 
 cle certainly 
 ath then now as we say playfully to any of those who lightlyundertake the making of laws you see legislator the principlesof government how many they are and that they are naturallyopposed to each other there we have discovered a ofseditions to which you must attend and first we will ask you toconsider with us how and in what respect the kings of argos andmessene violated these our maxims and ruined themselves and the greatand famous hellenic power of the olden time was it because they didnot know how wisely hesiod spoke when he said that the half is oftenmore than the whole his meaning was that when to take the wholewould be dangerous and to take the half would be the safe andmoderate course then the moderate or better was more than theimmoderate or worse 
 cle very true 
 ath and may we suppose this immoderate spirit to be more fatal whenfound among kings than when among peoples 
 cle the probability is that ignorance will be a disorder especiallyprevalent among kings because they lead a proud and luxurious life 
 ath is it not palpable that the chief aim of the kings of that timewas to get the better of the established laws and that they werenot in harmony with the principles which they had agreed to observe byword and oath this want of harmony may have had the appearance ofwisdom but was really as we assert the greatest ignorance andutterly overthrew the whole empire by dissonance and harsh discord 
 cle very likely 
 ath good and what measures ought the legislator to have then takenin order to avert this calamity truly there is no great wisdom inknowing and no great difficulty in telling after the evil hashappened but to have foreseen the remedy at the time would have takena much wiser head than ours 
 meg what do you mean 
 ath any one who looks at what has occurred with you may easily know and may easily say what ought to have beendone at that time 
 meg speak a little more clearly 
 ath nothing can be clearer than the observation which i am about tomake 
 meg what is it 
 ath that if any one gives too great a power to anything toolarge a sail to a vessel too much food to the body too muchauthority to the mind and does not observe the mean everything isoverthrown and in the wantonness of excess runs in the one case todisorders and in the other to injustice which is the child ofexcess i mean to say my dear friends that there is no soul ofman young and irresponsible who will be able to sustain thetemptation of arbitrary one who will not under suchcircumstances become filled with folly that worst of diseases andbe hated by his nearest and dearest friends when this happens hiskingdom is undermined and all his power vanishes from him andgreat legislators who know the mean should take heed of the danger asfar as we can guess at this distance of time what happened was asfollows 
 meg what 
 ath a god who watched over sparta seeing into the future gaveyou two families of kings instead of one and thus brought you morewithin the limits of moderation in the next place some humanwisdom mingled with divine power observing that the constitution ofyour government was still feverish and excited tempered your inbornstrength and pride of birth with the moderation which comes of the power of your elders equal with that of thekings in the most important matters but your third that your government was still swelling and foaming anddesirous to impose a curb upon it instituted the ephors whosepower he made to resemble that of magistrates elected by lot and bythis arrangement the kingly office being compounded of the rightelements and duly moderated was preserved and was the means ofpreserving all the rest since if there had been only the originallegislators temenus cresphontes and their contemporaries as far asthey were concerned not even the portion of aristodemus would havebeen preserved for they had no proper experience in legislation orthey would surely not have imagined that oaths would moderate ayouthful spirit invested with a power which might be converted intoa tyranny now that god has instructed us what sort of governmentwould have been or will be lasting there is no wisdom as i havealready said in judging after the event there is no difficulty inlearning from an example which has already occurred but if any onecould have foreseen all this at the time and had been able tomoderate the government of the three kingdoms and unite them into might have saved all the excellent institutions which were thenconceived and no persian or any other armament would have dared toattack us or would have regarded hellas as a power to be despised 
 cle true 
 ath there was small credit to us cleinias in defeating the discredit was not that the conquerors did not win gloriousvictories both by land and sea but what in my opinion broughtdiscredit was first of all the circumstance that of the three citiesone only fought on behalf of hellas and the two others were soutterly good for nothing that the one was waging a mighty waragainst lacedaemon and was thus preventing her from renderingassistance while the city of argos which had the precedence at thetime of the distribution when asked to aid in repelling thebarbarian would not answer to the call or give aid many thingsmight be told about hellas in connection with that war which are farfrom honourable nor indeed can we rightly say that hellasrepelled the invader for the truth is that unless the atheniansand lacedaemonians acting in concert had warded off the impendingyoke all the tribes of hellas would have been fused in a chaos ofhellenes mingling with one another of barbarians mingling withhellenes and hellenes with barbarians just as nations who are nowsubject to the persian power owing to unnatural separations andcombinations of them are dispersed and scattered and live cleinias and megillus are the reproaches which we have to makeagainst statesmen and legislators as they are called past andpresent if we would analyse the causes of their failure and find outwhat else might have been done we said for instance just there ought to be no great and unmixed powers and this was underthe idea that a state ought to be free and wise and harmonious andthat a legislator ought to legislate with a view to this end nor isthere any reason to be surprised at our continually proposing aims forthe legislator which appear not to be always the same but we shouldconsider when we say that temperance is to be the aim or wisdom is tobe the aim or friendship is to be the aim that all these aims arereally the same and if so a variety in the modes of expression oughtnot to disturb us 
 cle let us resume the argument in that spirit and now speaking offriendship and wisdom and freedom i wish that you would tell me atwhat in your opinion the legislator should aim 
 ath hear me then there are two mother forms of states fromwhich the rest may be truly said to be derived and one of them may becalled monarchy and the other democracy the persians have the highestform of the one and we of the other almost all the rest as i wassaying are variations of these now if you are to have liberty andthe combination of friendship with wisdom you must have both theseforms of government in a measure the argument emphatically declaresthat no city can be well governed which is not made up of both 
 cle impossible 
 ath neither the one if it be exclusively and excessivelyattached to monarchy nor the other if it be similarly attached tofreedom observes moderation but your states the laconian andcretan have more of it and the same was the case with theathenians and persians of old time but now they have less shall itell you why 
 cle by all means if it will tend to elucidate our subject 
 ath hear was a time when the persians had more ofthe state which is a mean between slavery and freedom in the reign ofcyrus they were freemen and also lords of many others the rulers gavea share of freedom to the subjects and being treated as equals thesoldiers were on better terms with their generals and showedthemselves more ready in the hour of danger and if there was any wiseman among them who was able to give good counsel he imparted hiswisdom to the public for the king was not jealous but allowed himfull liberty of speech and gave honour to those who could advisehim in any matter and the nation waxed in all respects because therewas freedom and friendship and communion of mind among them 
 cle that certainly appears to have been the case 
 ath how then was this advantage lost under cambyses and againrecovered under darius shall i try to divine 
 cle the enquiry no doubt has a bearing upon our subject 
 ath i imagine that cyrus though a great and patriotic general hadnever given his mind to education and never attended to the orderof his household 
 cle what makes you say so 
 ath i think that from his youth upwards he was a soldier andentrusted the education of his children to the women and they broughtthem up from their childhood as the favourites of fortune who wereblessed already and needed no more blessings they thought thatthey were happy enough and that no one should be allowed to opposethem in any way and they compelled every one to praise all thatthey said or did this was how they brought them up 
 cle a splendid education truly 
 ath such an one as women were likely to give them and especiallyprincesses who had recently grown rich and in the absence of the who were occupied in wars and dangers and had no time to lookafter them 
 cle what would you expect 
 ath their father had possessions of cattle and sheep and manyherds of men and other animals but he did not consider that thoseto whom he was about to make them over were not trained in his owncalling which was persian for the persians are of arugged land which is a stern mother and well fitted to producesturdy race able to live in the open air and go without sleep andalso to fight if fighting is required he did not observe that hissons were trained differently through the blessing of beingroyal they were educated in the median fashion by women and led to their becoming such as people do become when they arebrought up unreproved and so after the death of cyrus his the fulness of luxury and licence took the kingdom and firstone slew the other because he could not endure a rival the slayer himself mad with wine and brutality losthis kingdom through the medes and the eunuch as they called despised the folly of cambyses 
 cle so runs the tale and such probably were the facts 
 ath yes and the tradition says that the empire came back to thepersians through darius and the seven chiefs 
 cle true 
 ath let us note the rest of the story observe that darius was notthe son of a king and had not received a luxurious education when hecame to the throne being one of the seven he divided the countryinto seven portions and of this arrangement there are some shadowytraces still remaining he made laws upon the principle of introducinguniversal equality in the order of the state and he embodied in hislaws the settlement of the tribute which cyrus a feeling of friendship and community among all the attaching the people to him with money and gifts hence his armiescheerfully acquired for him countries as large as those which cyrushad left behind him darius was succeeded by his son xerxes and heagain was brought up in the royal and luxurious fashion might wenot most justly say o darius how came you to bring up xerxes in thesame way in which cyrus brought up cambyses and not to see hisfatal mistake for xerxes being the creation of the sameeducation met with much the same fortune as cambyses and from thattime until now there has never been a really great king among thepersians although they are all called great and their degeneracyis not to be attributed to chance as i maintain the reason is ratherthe evil life which is generally led by the sons of very rich androyal persons for never will boy or man young or old excel invirtue who has been thus educated and this i say is what thelegislator has to consider and what at the present moment has to beconsidered by us justly may you o lacedaemonians be praised inthat you do not give special honour or a special education to wealthrather than to poverty or to a royal rather than to a privatestation where the divine and inspired lawgiver has not originallycommanded them to be given for no man ought to have in a state because he surpasses others in wealth any more thanbecause he is swift of foot or fair or strong unless he have somevirtue in him nor even if he have virtue unless he have thisparticular virtue of temperance 
 meg what do you mean stranger 
 ath i suppose that courage is a part of virtue 
 meg to be sure 
 ath then now hear and judge for you like to havefor a or neighbour a very courageous man who had nocontrol over himself 
 meg heaven forbid 
 ath or an artist who was clever in his profession but a rogue 
 meg certainly not 
 ath and surely justice does not grow apart from temperance 
 meg impossible 
 ath any more than our pattern wise man whom we exhibited as havinghis pleasures and pains in accordance with and corresponding to truereason can be intemperate 
 meg no 
 ath there is a further consideration relating to the due andundue award of honours in states 
 meg what is it 
 ath i should like to know whether temperance without the othervirtues existing alone in the soul of man is rightly to be praisedor blamed 
 meg i cannot tell 
 ath and that is the best answer for whichever alternative youhad chosen i think that you would have gone wrong 
 meg i am fortunate 
 ath very good a quality which is a mere appendage of things whichcan be praised or blamed does not deserve an expression of is best passed over in silence 
 meg you are speaking of temperance 
 ath yes but of the other virtues that which having this appendageis also most beneficial will be most deserving of honour and nextthat which is beneficial in the next degree and so each of themwill be rightly honoured according to a regular order 
 meg true 
 ath and ought not the legislator to determine these classes 
 meg certainly he should 
 ath suppose that we leave to him the arrangement of details butthe general division of laws according to their importance into afirst and second and third class we who are lovers of law may makeourselves 
 meg very good 
 ath we maintain then that a state which would be safe andhappy as far as the nature of man allows must and ought todistribute honour and dishonour in the right way and the right way isto place the goods of the soul first and highest in the assuming temperance to be the condition of them and toassign the second place to the goods of the body and the thirdplace to money and property and it any legislator or state departsfrom this rule by giving money the place of honour or in any waypreferring that which is really last may we not say that he or thestate is doing an unholy and unpatriotic thing 
 meg yes let that be plainly declared 
 ath the consideration of the persian governments led us thus far toenlarge we remarked that the persians grew worse and worse and weaffirm the reason of this to have been that they too muchdiminished the freedom of the people and introduced too much ofdespotism and so destroyed friendship and community of feeling andwhen there is an end of these no longer do the governors govern onbehalf of their subjects or of the people but on behalf ofthemselves and if they think that they can gain ever so small anadvantage for themselves they devastate cities and send fire anddesolation among friendly races and as they hate ruthlessly andhorribly so are they hated and when they want the people to fightfor them they find no community of feeling or willingness to risktheir lives on their behalf their untold myriads are useless tothem on the field of battle and they think that their salvationdepends on the employment of mercenaries and strangers whom they if they were in want of more men and they cannot help beingstupid since they proclaim by actions that the ordinarydistinctions of right and wrong which are made in a state are atrifle when compared with gold and silver 
 meg quite true 
 ath and now enough of the persians and their presentmaladministration of their government which is owing to the excess ofslavery and despotism among them 
 meg good 
 ath next we must pass in review the government of attica in likemanner and from this show that entire freedom and the absence ofall superior authority is not by any means so good as government byothers when properly limited which was our ancient athenianconstitution at the time when the persians made their attack onhellas or speaking more correctly on the whole continent of were four classes arranged according to a property reverence was our queen and mistress and made us willing tolive in obedience to the laws which then prevailed also thevastness of the persian armament both by sea and on land caused ahelpless terror which made us more and more the servants of ourrulers and of the laws and for all these reasons an exceeding harmonyprevailed among us about ten years before the naval engagement atsalamis datis came leading a persian host by command of was expressly directed against the athenians and orders to carry them away captive and these orders he was toexecute under pain of death now datis and his myriads soon becamecomplete masters of eretria and he sent a fearful report to athensthat no eretrian had escaped him for the soldiers of datis had joinedhands and netted the whole of eretria and this report whether wellor ill founded was terrible to all the hellenes and above all to theathenians and they dispatched embassies in all directions but no onewas willing to come to their relief with the exception of thelacedaemonians and they either because they were detained by themessenian war which was then going on or for some other reason ofwhich we are not told came a day too late for the battle of a while the news arrived of mighty preparations being made andinnumerable threats came from the king then as time went on arumour reached us that darius had died and that his son who wasyoung and had come to the throne and was persisting in hisdesign the athenians were under the impression that the wholeexpedition was directed against them in consequence of the battleof marathon and hearing of the bridge over the hellespont and thecanal of athos and the host of ships considering that there was nosalvation for them either by land or by sea for there was no one tohelp them and remembering that in the first expedition when thepersians destroyed eretria no one came to their help or would riskthe danger of an alliance with them they thought that this wouldhappen again at least on land nor when they looked to the they descry any hope of salvation for they were attacked by athousand vessels and more one chance of safety remained slightindeed and desperate but their only one they saw that on theformer occasion they had gained a seemingly impossible victory andborne up by this hope they found that their only refuge was inthemselves and in the gods all these things created in them thespirit of friendship there was the fear of the moment and therewas that higher fear which they had acquired by obedience to theirancient laws and which i have several times in the precedingdiscourse called reverence of which the good man ought to be awilling servant and of which the coward is independent andfearless if this fear had not possessed them they would never havemet the enemy or defended their temples and sepulchres and theircountry and everything that was near and dear to them as they little by little they would have been all scattered and dispersed 
 meg your words athenian are quite true and worthy of yourselfand of your country 
 ath they are true megillus and to you who have inherited thevirtues of your ancestors i may properly speak of the actions of thatday and i would wish you and cleinias to consider whether my wordshave not also a bearing on legislation for i am not discoursingonly for the pleasure of talking but for the to remark that the experience both of ourselves and thepersians was in a certain sense the same for as they led theirpeople into utter servitude so we too led ours into all now how shall we proceed for i would like you to observe thatour previous arguments have good deal to say for themselves 
 meg true but i wish that you would give us a fuller explanation 
 ath i will under the ancient laws my friends the people wasnot as now the master but rather the willing servant of the laws 
 meg what laws do you mean 
 ath in the first place let us speak of the laws about to say such music as then order that we may trace thegrowth of the excess of freedom from the beginning now music wasearly divided among us into certain kinds and manners one sortconsisted of prayers to the gods which were called hymns and therewas another and opposite sort called lamentations and anothertermed paeans and another celebrating the birth of dionysus believe dithyrambs and they used the actual word laws ornomoi for another kind of song and to this they added the all these and others were duly distinguished norwere the performers allowed to confuse one style of music withanother and the authority which determined and gave judgment andpunished the disobedient was not expressed in a hiss nor in the mostunmusical shouts of the multitude as in our days nor in applause andclapping of hands but the directors of public instruction insistedthat the spectators should listen in silence to the end and boysand their tutors and the multitude in general were kept quiet by ahint from a stick such was the good order which the multitude werewilling to observe they would never have dared to give judgment bynoisy cries and then as time went on the poets themselvesintroduced the reign of vulgar and lawless innovation they were menof genius but they had no perception of what is just and lawful inmusic raging like bacchanals and possessed with lamentations with hymns and paeans with the sounds of the flute on the lyre and making onegeneral confusion ignorantly affirming that music has no whether good or bad can only be judged of rightly by thepleasure of the hearer and by composing such licentious works andadding to them words as licentious they have inspired the multitudewith lawlessness and boldness and made them fancy that they can judgefor themselves about melody and song and in this way the theatresfrom being mute have become vocal as though they had understanding ofgood and bad in music and poetry and instead of an aristocracy anevil sort of theatrocracy has grown up for if the democracy whichjudged had only consisted of educated persons no fatal harm wouldhave been done but in music there first arose the universal conceitof omniscience and general came followingafterwards and men fancying that they knew what they did not no longer any fear and the absence of fear begetsshamelessness for what is this shamelessness which is so evil athing but the insolent refusal to regard the opinion of the better byreason of an sort of liberty 
 meg very true 
 ath consequent upon this freedom comes the other freedom ofdisobedience to rulers and then the attempt to escape the control andexhortation of father mother elders and when near the end thecontrol of the laws also and at the very end there is the contempt ofoaths and pledges and no regard at all for the theyexhibit and imitate the old so called titanic nature and come tothe same point as the titans when they rebelled against god leading alife of endless evils but why have i said all this i ask becausethe argument ought to be pulled up from time to time and not beallowed to run away but held with bit and bridle and then we shallnot as the proverb says fall off our ass let us then once moreask the question to what end has all this been said 
 meg very good 
 ath this then has been said for the sake 
 meg of what 
 ath we were maintaining that the lawgiver ought to have threethings in view first that the city for which he legislates should befree and secondly be at unity with herself and thirdly should were our principles were they not 
 meg certainly 
 ath with a view to this we selected two kinds of government thedespotic and the other the most free and now we are consideringwhich of them is the right form we took a mean in both cases ofdespotism in the one and of liberty in the other and we saw thatin a mean they attained their perfection but that when they werecarried to the extreme of either slavery or licence neither partywere the gainers 
 meg very true 
 ath and that was our reason for considering the settlement of thedorian army and of the city built by dardanus at the foot of themountains and the removal of cities to the seashore and of ourmention of the first men who were the survivors of the deluge andall that was previously said about music and drinking and whatpreceded was said with the view of seeing how a state might be bestadministered and how an individual might best order his own life andnow megillus and cleinias how can we put to the proof the value ofour words 
 cle stranger i think that i see how a proof of their value maybe obtained this discussion of ours appears to me to have beensingularly fortunate and just what i at this moment want mostauspiciously have you and my friend megillus come in my way for iwill tell you what has happened to me and i regard the coincidence asa sort of omen the greater part of crete is going to send out acolony and they have entrusted the management of the affair to thecnosians and the cnosian government to me and nine others and theydesire us to give them any laws which we please whether taken fromthe cretan model or from any other and they do not mind about theirbeing foreign if they are better grant me then this favour whichwill also be a gain to us make a selection from whathas been said and then let us imagine a state of which we willsuppose ourselves to be the original founders thus we shall proceedwith our enquiry and at the same time i may have the use of theframework which you are constructing for the city which is incontemplation 
 ath good news cleinias if megillus has no objection you maybe sure that i will do all in my power to please you 
 cle thank you 
 meg and so will i 
 cle excellent and now let us begin to frame the state
