 a rose from grave 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 all the songs of the east speak of the love of the nightingale for the rose in the silent starlight night the winged songster serenades the fragrant flowers 
 
 not far from smyrna where the merchant drives his loaded 
 camels proudly arching their long necks as they journey beneath the 
 lofty pines over holy ground i saw a hedge of roses the 
 flew among the branches of the tall trees and as the 
 sunbeams fell upon her wings they glistened as if they were 
 on the grew a flower more beautiful than 
 them all and to her the nightingale sung of his woes but the rose 
 remained silent not even a dewdrop lay like a tear of sympathy on her 
 leaves at last she bowed her head over a heap of stones and said 
 here rests the greatest singer in the world over his tomb will i 
 spread my fragrance and on it i will let my leaves fall when the 
 storm scatters them he who sung of troy became earth and from that earth i have sprung i a rose from the grave of homer am too lofty to bloom for a nightingale then the nightingale sung himself to 
 death a came by with his loaded camels and his black 
 slaves his little son found the dead bird and buried the lovely 
 songster in the grave of the great homer while the rose trembled in 
 the wind 
 
 the evening came and the rose wrapped her leaves more closely 
 round her and dreamed and this was her dream 
 
 it was a fair sunshiny day a crowd of strangers drew near who had 
 undertaken a pilgrimage to the grave of homer among the strangers was a minstrel from the north the home of the clouds and the brilliant 
 lights of the aurora borealis he plucked the rose and placed it in 
 a book and carried it away into a distant part of the world his 
 fatherland the rose faded with grief and lay between the leaves of 
 the book which he opened in his own home saying here is a rose 
 from the grave of homer 
 
 then the flower awoke from her dream and trembled in the wind 
 a drop of dew fell from the leaves upon the grave the sun 
 rose and the flower bloomed more beautiful than ever the day was 
 hot and she was still in her own warm asia then footsteps 
 approached strangers such as the rose had seen in her dream came 
 by and among them was a poet from the north he plucked the rose 
 pressed a kiss upon her fresh mouth and carried her away to the 
 home of the clouds and the northern lights like a mummy the flower 
 now rests in his iliad and as in her dream she hears him say 
 as he opens the book here is a rose from the grave of homer

 sophist 
 
 by plato 
 
 translated by benjamin jowett 
 book i 
 
 persons of the dialogue theodorus theaetetus socrates 
 an eleatic stranger whom theodorus and theaetetus bring 
 with them the younger socrates who is a silent auditor 
 
 theodorus here we are socrates true to our agreement of 
 yesterday and we bring with us a stranger from elea who is a 
 disciple of parmenides and zeno and a true philosopher 
 
 socrates is he not rather a god theodorus who comes to us in 
 the disguise of a stranger for homer says that all the gods and 
 especially the god of strangers are companions of the meek and 
 just and visit the good and evil among men and may not your 
 companion be one of those higher powers a deity 
 who has come to spy out our weakness in argument and to 
 us 
 
 theod nay socrates he is not one of the disputatious is 
 too good for that and in my opinion he is not a god at all but 
 divine he certainly is for this is a title which i should 
 give to all philosophers 
 
 soc capital my friend and i may add that they are almost as 
 hard to be discerned as the gods for the true philosophers and 
 such as are not merely made up for the occasion appear in various 
 forms unrecognized by the ignorance of men and they hover about 
 cities as homer declares looking from above upon human life and 
 some think nothing of them and others can never think enough and 
 sometimes they appear as statesmen and sometimes as sophists and 
 then again to many they seem to be no better than madmen i should 
 like to ask our eleatic friend if he would tell us what is thought 
 about them in italy and to whom the terms are applied 
 
 theod what terms 
 
 soc sophist statesman philosopher 
 
 theod what is your difficulty about them and what made you ask 
 
 soc i want to know whether by his countrymen they are regarded as 
 one or two or do they as the names are three distinguish 
 also three kinds and assign one to each name 
 
 theod i dare say that the stranger will not object to discuss the 
 question what do you say stranger 
 
 stranger i am far from objecting theodorus nor have i any 
 difficulty in replying that by us they are regarded as three but to 
 define precisely the nature of each of them is by no means a 
 slight or easy task 
 
 theod you have happened to light socrates almost on the very 
 question which we were asking our friend before we came 
 hither and he excused himself to us as he does now you although he admitted that the matter had been fully discussed and that he remembered the answer 
 
 soc then do not stranger deny us the first favour which 
 we ask of you i am sure that you will not and therefore i shall only beg of you to say whether you like and are accustomed to make a long oration on a subject which you want to explain to another or to 
 proceed by the method of question and answer i remember hearing a 
 very noble discussion in which parmenides employed the latter of the 
 two methods when i was a young man and he was far advanced 
 in years 
 
 str i prefer to talk with another when he responds pleasantly 
 and is light in hand if not i would rather have my own say 
 soc any one of the present company will respond kindly to you 
 and you can choose whom you like of them i should recommend you to take a young for you have a preference for some one else 
 
 str i feel ashamed socrates being a new comer into your 
 society instead of talking a little and hearing others talk to be 
 spinning out a long soliloquy or address as if i wanted to show 
 off for the true answer will certainly be a very long one a great 
 deal longer than might be expected from such a short and simple 
 question at the same time i fear that i may seem rude and 
 ungracious if i refuse your courteous request especially after what you have said for i certainly cannot object to your proposal that 
 theaetetus should respond having already conversed with him myself and being recommended by you to take him 
 theaetetus but are you sure stranger that this will be quite so 
 acceptable to the rest of the company as socrates imagines 
 
 str you hear them applauding theaetetus after that there is 
 nothing more to be said well then i am to argue with you 
 and if you tire of the argument you may complain of your friends and not of me 
 
 theaet i do not think that i shall tire and if i do i shall get 
 my friend here young socrates the namesake of the elder 
 socrates to help he is about my own age and my partner at the gymnasium and is constantly accustomed to work with me 
 
 str very good you can decide about that for yourself as we 
 proceed meanwhile you and i will begin together and enquire into 
 the nature of the sophist first of the three i should like you to 
 make out what he is and bring him to light in a discussion for at 
 present we are only agreed about the name but of the thing to which 
 we both apply the name possibly you have one notion and i another 
 whereas we ought always to come to an understanding about the thing 
 itself in terms of a definition and not merely about the name minus 
 the definition now the tribe of sophists which we are investigating 
 is not easily caught or defined and the world has long ago agreed 
 that if great subjects are to be adequately treated they must be 
 studied in the lesser and easier instances of them before we proceed 
 to the greatest of all and as i know that the tribe of sophists is 
 troublesome and hard to be caught i should recommend that 
 we practise beforehand the method which is to be applied to him on some simple and smaller thing unless you can suggest a better way 
 theaet indeed i cannot 
 
 str then suppose that we work out some lesser example 
 which will be a pattern of the greater 
 
 theaet good 
 
 str what is there which is well known and not great and is yet 
 as susceptible of definition as any larger thing shall i say an 
 angler he is familiar to all of us and not a very interesting or 
 important person 
 
 theaet he is not 
 
 str yet i suspect that he will furnish us with the sort of 
 definition and line of enquiry which we want 
 
 theaet very good 
 
 str let us begin by asking whether he is a man having art or not 
 having art but some other power 
 
 theaet he is clearly a man of art 
 
 str and of arts there are two kinds 
 
 theaet what are they 
 
 str there is agriculture and the tending of mortal creatures 
 and the art of constructing or moulding vessels and there is the 
 art of these may be appropriately called by a single 
 name 
 
 theaet what do you mean and what is the name 
 
 str he who brings into existence something that did not exist 
 before is said to be a producer and that which is brought into 
 existence is said to be produced 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and all the arts which were just now mentioned are 
 characterized by this power of producing 
 
 theaet they are 
 
 str then let us sum them up under the name of productive or 
 creative art 
 
 theaet very good 
 
 str next follows the whole class of learning and cognition then 
 comes trade fighting hunting and since none of these produces 
 anything but is only engaged in conquering by word or deed or in 
 preventing others from conquering things which exist and have been 
 already each and all of these branches there 
 appears to be an art which may be called acquisitive 
 
 theaet yes that is the proper name 
 
 str seeing then that all arts are either acquisitive or 
 creative in which class shall we place the art of the angler 
 
 theaet clearly in the acquisitive class 
 
 str and the acquisitive may be subdivided into two parts there 
 is exchange which is voluntary and is effected by gifts hire 
 purchase and the other part of acquisitive which takes by force of 
 word or deed may be termed conquest 
 
 theaet that is implied in what has been said 
 
 str and may not conquest be again subdivided 
 theaet how 
 
 str open force may be called fighting and secret force may have 
 the general name of hunting 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and there is no reason why the art of hunting should not be 
 further divided 
 
 theaet how would you make the division 
 
 str into the hunting of living and of lifeless prey 
 
 theaet yes if both kinds exist 
 
 str of course they exist but the hunting after lifeless things 
 having no special name except some sorts of diving and other small 
 matters may be omitted the hunting after living things may 
 be called animal hunting 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and animal hunting may be truly said to have two divisions 
 hunting which has many kinds and names and 
 
 hunting or the hunting after animals who swim 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and of swimming animals one class lives on the wing and the 
 other in the water 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str fowling is the general term under which the hunting of all 
 birds is included 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str the hunting of animals who live in the water has the general 
 name of fishing 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and this sort of hunting may be further divided also into two 
 principal kinds 
 
 theaet what are they 
 
 str there is one kind which takes them in nets another 
 which takes them by a blow 
 
 theaet what do you mean and how do you distinguish them 
 
 str as to the first that surrounds and encloses anything 
 to prevent egress may be rightly called an enclosure 
 
 theaet very true 
 str for which reason twig baskets casting nets nooses creels 
 and the like may all be termed enclosures 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and therefore this first kind of capture may be called by us 
 capture with enclosures or something of that sort 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str the other kind which is practised by a blow with hooks and 
 three pronged spears when summed up under one name may be called striking unless you theaetetus can find some better name 
 
 theaet never mind the you suggest will do very well 
 
 str there is one mode of striking which is done at night and by 
 the light of a fire and is by the hunters themselves called firing 
 or spearing by firelight 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and the fishing by day is called by the general name 
 of barbing because the spears too are barbed at the point 
 
 theaet yes that is the term 
 
 str of this that which strikes the fish who is 
 below from above is called spearing because this is the way in 
 which the spears are mostly used 
 
 theaet yes it is often called so 
 
 str then now there is only one kind remaining 
 
 theaet what is that 
 
 str when a hook is used and the fish is not struck in any chance 
 part of his as be is with the spear but only about the head 
 and mouth and is then drawn out from below upwards with reeds and is the right name of that mode of fish theaetetus 
 
 theaet i suspect that we have now discovered the object of our 
 search 
 
 str then now you and i have come to an understanding not 
 only about the name of the art but about the definition of the thing itself one half of all art was of all the art 
 acquisitive art was conquest or taking by force half of this was 
 hunting and half of hunting was hunting animals half of this was 
 hunting water this again the under half was fishing 
 half of fishing was striking a part of striking was fishing with a 
 barb and one half of this again being the kind which strikes with 
 a hook and draws the fish from below upwards is the art 
 which we have been seeking and which from the nature of the operation is denoted angling or drawing up aspalienutike anaspasthai 
 
 theaet the result has been quite satisfactorily brought out 
 
 str and now following this pattern let us endeavour to find out 
 what a sophist is 
 
 theaet by all means 
 
 str the first question about the angler was whether he was a 
 skilled artist or unskilled 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and shall we call our new friend unskilled or a thorough 
 master of his craft 
 
 theaet certainly not unskilled for his name as indeed you 
 imply must surely express his nature 
 
 str then he must be supposed to have some art 
 
 theaet what art 
 
 str by heaven they are cousins it never occurred to us 
 
 theaet who are cousins 
 
 str the angler and the sophist 
 
 theaet in what way are they related 
 
 str they both appear to me to be hunters 
 
 theaet how the sophist of the other we have spoken 
 
 str you remember our division of hunting into hunting after 
 swimming animals and land animals 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and you remember that we subdivided the swimming and left the 
 land animals saying that there were many kinds of them 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str thus far then the sophist and the angler starting from the 
 art of acquiring take the same road 
 
 theaet so it would appear 
 
 str their paths diverge when they reach the art of animal 
 hunting the one going to the seashore and to the rivers and to the 
 lakes and angling for the animals which are in them 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str while the other goes to land and water of another 
 of wealth and broad of generous youth and he also is 
 intending to take the animals which are in them 
 
 theaet what do you mean 
 
 str of hunting on land there are two principal divisions 
 
 theaet what are they 
 
 str one is the hunting of tame and the other of wild animals 
 
 theaet but are tame animals ever hunted 
 
 str yes if you include man under tame animals but if 
 you like you may say that there are no tame animals or that if there are man is not among them or you may say that man is a tame animal 
 but is not shall decide which of these alternatives you prefer 
 
 theaet i should say stranger that man is a tame animal and i 
 admit that he is hunted 
 
 str then let us divide the hunting of tame animals into two parts 
 theaet how shall we make the division 
 
 str let us define piracy tyranny the 
 whole military art by one name as hunting with violence 
 
 theaet very good 
 
 str but the art of the lawyer of the popular orator and the art 
 of conversation may be called in one word the art of persuasion 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and of persuasion there may be said to be two kinds 
 
 theaet what are they 
 
 str one is private and the other public 
 
 theaet yes each of them forms a class 
 
 str and of private hunting one sort receives hire and the other 
 brings gifts 
 
 theaet i do not understand you 
 
 str you seem never to have observed the manner in which lovers 
 hunt 
 
 theaet to what do you refer 
 
 str i mean that they lavish gifts on those whom they hunt in 
 addition to other inducements 
 
 theaet most true 
 
 str let us admit this then to be the amatory art 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str but that sort of hireling whose conversation is pleasing and 
 who baits his hook only with pleasure and exacts nothing but his 
 maintenance in return we should all if i am not mistaken describe 
 as possessing flattery or an art of making things pleasant 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and that sort which professes to form acquaintances only for 
 the sake of virtue and demands a reward in the shape of 
 money may be fairly called by another name 
 
 theaet to be sure 
 
 str and what is the name will you tell me 
 
 theaet it is obvious enough for i believe that we have 
 discovered the sophist which is as i conceive the proper name for 
 the class described 
 
 str then now theaetetus his art may be traced as a branch of 
 the appropriative acquisitive hunts 
 animals which hunts 
 money in the semblance of education 
 and this is termed sophistry and is a hunt after young men of 
 wealth and is the conclusion 
 
 theaet just so 
 
 str let us take another branch of his genealogy for he is a 
 professor of a great and many sided art and if we look back at what 
 has preceded we see that he presents another aspect besides that of 
 which we are speaking 
 
 theaet in what respect 
 
 str there were two sorts of acquisitive art the one 
 concerned with hunting the other with exchange 
 
 theaet there were 
 
 str and of the art of exchange there are two divisions the one 
 of giving and the other of selling 
 
 theaet let us assume that 
 
 str next will suppose the art of selling to be divided into two 
 parts 
 
 theaet how 
 
 str there is one part which is distinguished as the sale 
 of a own productions another which is the exchange of the works of others 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and is not that part of exchange which takes place in 
 the about half of the whole termed retailing 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and that which exchanges the goods of one city for those of 
 another by selling and buying is the exchange of the merchant 
 
 theaet to be sure 
 
 str and you are aware that this exchange of the merchant is of 
 two kinds it is partly concerned with food for the use of the body 
 and partly with the food of the soul which is bartered and 
 received in exchange for money 
 
 theaet what do you mean 
 
 str you want to know what is the meaning of food for the soul 
 the other kind you surely understand 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str take music in general and painting and marionette playing and 
 many other things which are purchased in one city and carried away 
 and sold in of the soul which are hawked about either 
 for the sake of instruction or not he who takes them 
 about and sells them be quite as truly called a merchant as he who 
 sells meats and drinks 
 
 theaet to be sure he may 
 
 str and would you not call by the same name him who buys up 
 knowledge and goes about from city to city exchanging his wares for 
 money 
 
 theaet certainly i should 
 
 str of this merchandise of the soul may not one part be fairly 
 termed the art of display and there is another part which is 
 certainly not less ridiculous but being a trade in learning must be 
 called by some name germane to the matter 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str the latter should have two descriptive of the sale 
 of the knowledge of virtue and the other of the sale of other kinds 
 of knowledge 
 
 theaet of course 
 
 str the name of corresponds well enough to the latter 
 but you must try and tell me the name of the other 
 
 theaet he must be the sophist whom we are seeking no other name 
 can possibly be right 
 
 str no other and so this trader in virtue again turns out to be 
 our friend the sophist whose art may now be traced from the art of 
 acquisition through exchange trade merchandise to a merchandise 
 of the soul which is concerned with speech and the knowledge of 
 virtue 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str and there may be a third reappearance of he may have 
 settled down in a city and may fabricate as well as buy these same 
 wares intending to live by selling them and he would still 
 be called a sophist 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str then that part of acquisitive art which exchanges and of 
 exchange which either sells a own productions or retails those 
 of others as the case may be and in either way sells the knowledge 
 of virtue you would again term sophistry 
 
 theaet i must if i am to keep pace with the argument 
 
 str let us consider once more whether there may not be yet 
 another aspect of sophistry 
 
 theaet what is it 
 
 str in the acquisitive there was a subdivision of the combative 
 or fighting art 
 
 theaet there was 
 
 str perhaps we had better divide it 
 
 theaet what shall be the divisions 
 
 str there shall be one division of the competitive and another 
 of the pugnacious 
 
 theaet very good 
 
 str that part of the pugnacious which is contest of 
 bodily strength may be properly called by some such name as violent 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and when the war is one of words it may be termed 
 controversy 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and controversy may be of two kinds 
 
 theaet what are they 
 
 str when long speeches are answered by long speeches and there 
 is public discussion about the just and unjust that is forensic 
 controversy 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and there is a private sort of controversy which is cut up 
 into questions and answers and this is commonly called disputation 
 
 theaet yes that is the name 
 
 str and of disputation that sort which is only a discussion 
 about contracts and is carried on at random and without 
 is recognized by the reasoning faculty to be a distinct 
 class but has hitherto had no distinctive name and does not deserve to receive one from us 
 
 theaet no for the different sorts of it are too minute and 
 heterogeneous 
 
 str but that which proceeds by rules of art to dispute about 
 justice and injustice in their own nature and about things in 
 general we have been accustomed to call argumentation eristic 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and of argumentation one sort wastes money and the other 
 makes money 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str suppose we try and give to each of these two classes a name 
 
 theaet let us do so 
 
 str i should say that the habit which leads a man to neglect his 
 own affairs for the pleasure of conversation of which the style is 
 far from being agreeable to the majority of his hearers may 
 be fairly termed loquacity such is my opinion 
 
 theaet that is the common name for it 
 
 str but now who the other is who makes money out of private 
 disputation it is your turn to say 
 
 theaet there is only one true answer he is the wonderful 
 sophist of whom we are in pursuit and who reappears again for the 
 fourth time 
 
 str yes and with a fresh pedigree for he is the 
 species of the eristic disputatious controversial pugnacious 
 combative acquisitive family as the argument has already proven 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str how true was the observation that he was a animal 
 and not to be caught with one hand as they say 
 
 theaet then you must catch him with two 
 
 str yes we must if we can and therefore let us try another 
 track in our pursuit of him you are aware that there are certain 
 menial occupations which have names among servants 
 
 theaet yes there are many such which of them do you mean 
 
 str i mean such as sifting straining winnowing threshing 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and besides these there are a great many more such 
 as carding spinning adjusting the warp and the woof and thousands of similar expressions are used in the arts 
 
 theaet of what are they to be patterns and what are we 
 going to do with them all 
 
 str i think that in all of these there is implied a notion of 
 division 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str then if as i was saying there is one art which includes all 
 of them ought not that art to have one name 
 
 theaes and what is the name of the art 
 
 str the art of discerning or discriminating 
 
 theaet very good 
 
 str think whether you cannot divide this 
 
 theaet i should have to think a long while 
 
 str in all the previously named processes either like has been 
 separated from like or the better from the worse 
 
 theaet i see now what you mean 
 
 str there is no name for the first kind of separation of the 
 second which throws away the worse and preserves the better i do 
 know a name 
 
 theaet what is it 
 
 str every discernment or discrimination of that kind as i have 
 observed is called a purification 
 
 theaet yes that is the usual expression 
 
 str and any one may see that purification is of two kinds 
 
 theaet perhaps so if he were allowed time to think but i do not 
 see at this moment 
 
 str there are many purifications of bodies which may with 
 propriety be comprehended under a single name 
 
 theaet what are they and what is their name 
 
 str there is the purification of living bodies in their inward 
 and in their outward parts of which the former is duly effected by 
 medicine and gymnastic the latter by the not very dignified art of 
 the and there is the purification of inanimate 
 this the arts of fulling and of furbishing in general attend in a number of minute particulars having a variety of names which are thought ridiculous 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str there can be no doubt that they are thought ridiculous 
 
 theaetetus but then the dialectical art never considers whether the 
 benefit to be derived from the purge is greater or less than that to 
 be derived from the sponge and has not more interest in the one 
 than in the other her endeavour is to know what is and is 
 not kindred in all arts with a view to the acquisition of intelligence and having this in view she honours them all alike and when she makes comparisons she counts one of them not a whit more ridiculous than another nor does she esteem him who adduces as his example of hunting the art at all more decorous than another who cites that of the but only as the greater 
 pretender of the two and as to your question concerning the name 
 which was to comprehend all these arts of purification whether of 
 animate or inanimate bodies the art of dialectic is in no wise 
 particular about fine words if she maybe only allowed to have a 
 general name for all other purifications binding them up 
 together and separating them off from the purification of the soul or intellect for this is the purification at which she wants to arrive 
 and this we should understand to be her aim 
 
 theaet yes i understand and i agree that there are two sorts of 
 purification and that one of them is concerned with the 
 soul and that there is another which is concerned with the body 
 
 str excellent and now listen to what i am going to say 
 and try to divide further the first of the two 
 
 theaet whatever line of division you suggest i will endeavour to 
 assist you 
 
 str do we admit that virtue is distinct from vice in the soul 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and purification was to leave the good and to cast 
 out whatever is bad 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str then any taking away of evil from the soul may be properly 
 called purification 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and in the soul there are two kinds of evil 
 
 theaet what are they 
 
 str the one may be compared to disease in the body the other to 
 deformity 
 
 theaet i do not understand 
 
 str perhaps you have never reflected that disease and discord are 
 the same 
 
 theaet to this again i know not what i should reply 
 
 str do you not conceive discord to be a dissolution of kindred 
 clements originating in some disagreement 
 
 theaet just that 
 
 str and is deformity anything but the want of measure which is 
 always unsightly 
 
 theaet exactly 
 
 str and do we not see that opinion is opposed to desire pleasure 
 to anger reason to pain and that all these elements are opposed to 
 one another in the souls of bad men 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and yet they must all be akin 
 
 theaet of course 
 
 str then we shall be right in calling vice a discord and 
 disease of the soul 
 
 theaet most true 
 
 str and when things having motion an aiming at an appointed 
 mark continually miss their aim and glance aside shall we say that 
 this is the effect of symmetry among them or of the want of 
 symmetry 
 
 theaet clearly of the want of symmetry 
 
 str but surely we know that no soul is voluntarily ignorant of 
 anything 
 
 theaet certainly not 
 
 str and what is ignorance but the aberration of a mind which is 
 bent on truth and in which the process of understanding is 
 perverted 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str then we are to regard an unintelligent soul as deformed and 
 devoid of symmetry 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str then there are these two kinds of evil in the one 
 which is generally called vice and is obviously a disease of the 
 soul 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and there is the other which they call ignorance and which 
 because existing only in the soul they will not allow to be vice 
 
 theaet i certainly admit what i at first there are 
 two kinds of vice in the soul and that we ought to consider 
 cowardice intemperance and injustice to be alike forms of 
 disease in the soul and ignorance of which there are all sorts of 
 varieties to be deformity 
 
 str and in the case of the body are there not two arts which 
 have to do with the two bodily states 
 
 theaet what are they 
 
 str there is gymnastic which has to do with deformity and 
 medicine which has to do with disease 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and where there is insolence and injustice and cowardice is 
 not chastisement the art which is most required 
 
 theaet that certainly appears to be the opinion of mankind 
 
 str again of the various kinds of ignorance may not instruction 
 be rightly said to be the remedy 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and of the art of instruction shall we say that there is one 
 or many kinds at any rate there are two principal ones think 
 
 theaet i will 
 
 str i believe that i can see how we shall soonest arrive at the 
 answer to this question 
 
 theaet how 
 
 str if we can discover a line which divides ignorance into two 
 halves for a division of ignorance into two parts will certainly 
 imply that the art of instruction is also twofold answering to the 
 two divisions of ignorance 
 
 theaet well and do you see what you are looking for 
 
 str i do seem to myself to see one very large and bad sort of 
 ignorance which is quite separate and may be weighed in the scale 
 against all other sorts of ignorance put together 
 
 theaet what is it 
 
 str when a person supposes that he knows and does not know this 
 appears to be the great source of all the errors of the intellect 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and this if i am not mistaken is the kind of ignorance 
 which specially earns the title of stupidity 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str what name then shall be given to the sort of instruction 
 which gets rid of this 
 
 theaet the instruction which you mean stranger is i should 
 imagine not the teaching of handicraft arts but what thanks to 
 us has been termed education in this part the world 
 
 str yes theaetetus and by nearly all hellenes but we have 
 still to consider whether education admits of any further division 
 
 theaet we have 
 
 str i think that there is a point at which such a division is 
 possible 
 
 theaet where 
 
 str of education one method appears to be rougher and another 
 smoother 
 
 theaet how are we to distinguish the two 
 
 str there is the mode which our fathers commonly 
 practised towards their sons and which is still adopted by 
 of roughly reproving their errors or of gently advising 
 them which varieties may be correctly included under the 
 general term of admonition 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str but whereas some appear to have arrived at the conclusion 
 that all ignorance is involuntary and that no one who thinks 
 himself wise is willing to learn any of those things in which he is 
 conscious of his own cleverness and that the admonitory sort of 
 instruction gives much trouble and does little good 
 
 theaet there they are quite right 
 
 str accordingly they set to work to eradicate the spirit of 
 conceit in another way 
 
 theaet in what way 
 
 str they a words when he thinks that he is 
 saying something and is really saying nothing and easily convict 
 him of inconsistencies in his opinions these they then 
 collect by the dialectical process and placing them side by side show that they contradict one another about the same things in relation to the same things and in the same respect he seeing this is angry with himself and grows gentle towards others and thus is entirely delivered from great prejudices and harsh notions in a way which is most amusing to the hearer and produces the most lasting good effect on the person who is the subject of the operation for as the physician considers that the body will receive no benefit from 
 taking food until the internal obstacles have been removed so the 
 purifier of the soul is conscious that his patient will receive no 
 benefit from the application of knowledge until he is refuted and 
 from refutation learns modesty he must be purged of his prejudices 
 first and made to think that he knows only what he knows 
 and no more 
 
 theaet that is certainly the best and wisest state of mind 
 
 str for all these reasons theaetetus we must admit that 
 refutation is the greatest and chiefest of purifications and he who 
 has not been refuted though he be the great king himself is in an 
 awful state of impurity he is uninstructed and deformed in those 
 things in which he who would be truly blessed ought to be fairest 
 and purest 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str and who are the ministers of this art 
 i am afraid to say the sophists 
 
 theaet why 
 
 str lest we should assign to them too high a prerogative 
 
 theaet yet the sophist has a certain likeness to our minister of 
 purification 
 
 str yes the same sort of likeness which a wolf who is the 
 fiercest of animals has to a dog who is the gentlest but he who 
 would not be found tripping ought to be very careful in this matter 
 of comparisons for they are most slippery things nevertheless let 
 us assume that the sophists are the men i say this 
 provisionally for i think that the line which divides them will be marked enough if proper care is taken 
 
 theaet likely enough 
 
 str let us grant then that from the discerning art comes 
 purification and from purification let there be separated off a 
 part which is concerned with the soul of this mental purification 
 instruction is a portion and of instruction education and of 
 education that refutation of vain conceit which has been discovered 
 in the present argument and let this be called by you and me the 
 art of sophistry 
 
 theaet very well and yet considering the number of 
 forms in which he has presented himself i begin to doubt how i can with any truth or confidence describe the real nature of the sophist 
 
 str you naturally feel perplexed and yet i think that he must be 
 still more perplexed in his attempt to escape us for as the proverb 
 says when every way is blocked there is no escape now 
 then is the time of all others to set upon him 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str first let us wait a moment and recover breath and 
 while we are resting we may reckon up in how many forms he has appeared in the first place he was discovered to be a paid hunter after wealth and youth 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str in the second place he was a merchant in the goods of the 
 soul 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str in the third place he has turned out to be a retailer of the 
 same sort of wares 
 
 theaet yes and in the fourth place he himself manufactured the 
 learned wares which he sold 
 
 str quite right i will try and remember the fifth myself he 
 belonged to the fighting class and was further distinguished as a 
 hero of debate who professed the eristic art 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str the sixth point was doubtful and yet we at last 
 agreed that he was a purger of souls who cleared away notions obstructive to knowledge 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str do you not see that when the professor of any art has one 
 name and many kinds of knowledge there must be something wrong the multiplicity of names which is applied to him shows that the common principle to which all these branches of knowledge are 
 tending is not understood 
 
 theaet i should imagine this to be the case 
 
 str at any rate we will understand him and no indolence shall 
 prevent us let us begin again then and some of our 
 statements concerning the sophist there was one thing which 
 appeared to me especially characteristic of him 
 
 theaet to what are you referring 
 
 str we were saying of him if i am not mistaken that he was a 
 disputer 
 
 theaet we were 
 
 str and does he not also teach others the art of disputation 
 
 theaet certainly he does 
 
 str and about what does he profess that he teaches men to 
 dispute to begin at the he make them able to dispute about divine things which are invisible to men in general 
 
 theaet at any rate he is said to do so 
 
 str and what do you say of the visible things in heaven and 
 earth and the like 
 
 theaet certainly he disputes and teaches to dispute about them 
 
 str then again in private conversation when any universal 
 assertion is made about generation and essence we know that such 
 persons are tremendous argufiers and are able to impart their own 
 skill to others 
 
 theaet undoubtedly 
 
 str and do they not profess to make men able to dispute about law 
 and about politics in general 
 
 theaet why no one would have anything to say to them if they 
 did not make these professions 
 
 str in all and every art what the craftsman ought to say 
 in answer to any question is written down in a popular form and he who likes may learn 
 
 theaet i suppose that you are referring to the precepts of 
 protagoras about wrestling and the other arts 
 
 str yes my friend and about a good many other things in a 
 word is not the art of disputation a power of disputing about all 
 things 
 
 theaet certainly there does not seem to be much which is 
 left out 
 
 str but oh my dear youth do you suppose this possible for 
 perhaps your young eyes may see things which to our duller sight do 
 not appear 
 
 theaet to what are you alluding i do not think that i understand 
 your present question 
 
 str i ask whether anybody can understand all things 
 
 theaet happy would mankind be if such a thing were possible 
 
 soc but how can any one who is ignorant dispute in a rational 
 manner against him who knows 
 
 theaet he cannot 
 
 str then why has the sophistical art such a mysterious power 
 
 theaet to what do you refer 
 
 str how do the sophists make young men believe in their 
 supreme and universal wisdom for if they neither disputed nor were thought to dispute rightly or being thought to do so were deemed no wiser for their controversial skill then to quote your own 
 observation no one would give them money or be willing to learn their art 
 
 theaet they certainly would not 
 
 str but they are willing 
 
 theaet yes they are 
 
 str yes and the reason as i should imagine is that they are 
 supposed to have knowledge of those things about which they dispute 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and they dispute about all things 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and therefore to their disciples they appear to be 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str but they are not for that was shown to be impossible 
 
 theaet impossible of course 
 
 str then the sophist has been shown to have a sort of conjectural 
 or apparent knowledge only of all things which is not the truth 
 
 theaet exactly no better description of him could be given 
 
 str let us now take an illustration which will still more 
 clearly explain his nature 
 
 theaet what is it 
 
 str i will tell you and you shall answer me giving your very 
 closest attention suppose that a person were to profess not that 
 he could speak or dispute but that he knew how to make and do all 
 things by a single art 
 
 theaet all things 
 
 str i see that you do not understand the first word that i utter 
 for you do not understand the meaning of all 
 
 theaet no i do not 
 
 str under all things i include you and me and also animals and 
 trees 
 
 theaet what do you mean 
 
 str suppose a person to say that he will make you and me and all 
 creatures 
 
 theaet what would he mean by making he cannot be a 
 you said that he is a maker of animals 
 
 str yes and i say that he is also the maker of the sea and the 
 earth and the heavens and the gods and of all other things and 
 further that he can make them in no time and sell them for a few 
 pence 
 
 theaet that must be a jest 
 
 str and when a man says that he knows all things and can teach 
 them to another at a small cost and in a short time is not that a 
 jest 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and is there any more artistic or graceful form of jest than 
 imitation 
 
 theaet certainly not and imitation is a very comprehensive term 
 which includes under one class the most diverse sorts of things 
 
 str we know of course that he who professes by one art to make 
 all things is really a painter and by the art makes 
 resemblances of real things which have the same name with 
 them and he can deceive the less intelligent sort of young children to whom he shows his pictures at a distance into the belief that he has the absolute power of making whatever he likes 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and may there not be supposed to be an imitative art of 
 reasoning is it not possible to enchant the hearts of young men by 
 words poured through their ears when they are still at a distance 
 from the truth of facts by exhibiting to them fictitious arguments 
 and making them think that they are true and that the speaker is 
 the wisest of men in all things 
 
 theaet yes why should there not be another such art 
 
 str but as time goes on and their hearers advance in years and 
 come into closer contact with realities and have learnt by sad 
 experience to see and feel the truth of things are not the greater 
 part of them compelled to change many opinions which they formerly 
 entertained so that the great appears small to them and the easy 
 difficult and all their dreamy speculations are overturned by the 
 facts of life 
 
 theaet that is my view as far as i can judge although 
 at my age i may be one of those who see things at a distance only 
 
 str and the wish of all of us who are your friends is and 
 always will be to bring you as near to the truth as we can 
 without the sad reality and now i should like you to tell me whether 
 the sophist is not visibly a magician and imitator of true being or are we still disposed to think that he may have a true knowledge of the 
 various matters about which he disputes 
 
 theaet but how can he stranger is there any doubt 
 after what has been said that he is to be located in one of the divisions of play 
 
 str then we must place him in the class of magicians and mimics 
 
 theaet certainly we must 
 
 str and now our business is not to let the animal out for we 
 have got him in a sort of dialectical net and there is one thing 
 which he decidedly will not escape 
 
 theaet what is that 
 
 str the inference that he is a juggler 
 
 theaet precisely my own opinion of him 
 
 str then clearly we ought as soon as possible to divide the 
 art and go down into the net and if the sophist does 
 not run away from us to seize him according to orders and 
 deliver him over to reason who is the lord of the hunt and proclaim the capture of him and if he creeps into the recesses of the imitative 
 art and secretes himself in one of them to divide again and follow 
 him up until in some of imitation he is caught for our 
 method of tackling each and all is one which neither he nor any 
 other creature will ever escape in triumph 
 
 theaet well said and let us do as you propose 
 
 str well then pursuing the same analytic method as before i 
 think that i can discern two divisions of the imitative art but i 
 am not as yet able to see in which of them the desired form is to be 
 found 
 
 theaet will you tell me first what are two divisions of which you 
 are speaking 
 
 str one is the art of a likeness of 
 anything is made by producing a copy which is executed according to the proportions of the original similar in length and breadth and 
 depth each thing receiving also its appropriate colour 
 
 theaet is not this always the aim of imitation 
 
 str not always in works either of sculpture or of painting 
 which are of any magnitude there is a certain degree of deception 
 for artists were to give the true proportions of their fair works 
 the upper part which is farther off would appear to be out of 
 proportion in comparison with the lower which is nearer and so 
 they give up the truth in their images and make only the proportions 
 which appear to be beautiful disregarding the real ones 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str and that which being other is also like may we not 
 fairly call a likeness or image 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and may we not as i did just now call that part of the 
 imitative art which is concerned with making such images the art of 
 likeness making 
 
 theaet let that be the name 
 
 str and what shall we call those resemblances of the beautiful 
 which appear such owing to the unfavourable position of the 
 spectator whereas if a person had the power of getting a correct view of works of such magnitude they would appear not even like that to which they profess to be like may we not call these appearances since they appear only and are not really like 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str there is a great deal of this kind of thing in 
 painting and in all imitation 
 
 theaet of course 
 
 str and may we not fairly call the sort of art which produces an 
 appearance and not an image phantastic art 
 
 theaet most fairly 
 
 str these then are the two kinds of image art of 
 making likenesses and phantastic or the art of making appearances 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str i was doubtful before in which of them i should place the 
 sophist nor am i even now able to see clearly verily he is a 
 wonderful and inscrutable creature and now in the cleverest 
 manner he has got into an impossible place 
 
 theaet yes he has 
 
 str do you speak advisedly or are you carried away at the moment 
 by the habit of assenting into giving a hasty answer 
 
 theaet may i ask to what you are referring 
 
 str my dear friend we are engaged in a very difficult 
 can be no doubt of that for how a thing can 
 appear and seem and not be or how a man can say a thing 
 which is not true has always been and still remains a very perplexing question can any one say or think that falsehood really exists and 
 avoid being caught in a contradiction indeed theaetetus the task is a difficult one 
 
 theaet why 
 
 str he who says that falsehood exists has the audacity to assert 
 the being of for this is implied in the possibility of 
 falsehood but my boy in the days when i was a boy the great 
 parmenides protested against this doctrine and to the end 
 of his life he continued to inculcate the same repeating both in verse and out of your mind from this way of enquiry for never will you show that is 
 such is his testimony which is confirmed by the very expression 
 when sifted a little would you object to begin with the 
 consideration of the words themselves 
 
 theaet never mind about me i am only desirous that you should 
 carry on the argument in the best way and that you should take me 
 with you 
 
 str very good and now say do we venture to utter the forbidden 
 word 
 
 theaet certainly we do 
 
 str let us be serious then and consider the question neither in 
 strife nor play suppose that one of the hearers of parmenides was 
 asked to is the term to be you know what 
 sort of object he would single out in reply and what answer he 
 would make to the enquirer 
 
 theaet that is a difficult question and one not to be answered 
 at all by a person like myself 
 
 str there is at any rate no difficulty in seeing that the 
 predicate is not applicable to any being 
 
 theaet none certainly 
 
 str and if not to being then not to something 
 
 theaet of course not 
 
 str it is also plain that in speaking of something we speak of 
 being for to speak of an abstract something naked and isolated from 
 all being is impossible 
 
 theaet impossible 
 
 str you mean by assenting to imply that he who says something 
 must say some one thing 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str some in the singular ti you would say is the sign of one 
 some in the dual tine of two some in the plural tines of many 
 
 theaet exactly 
 
 str then he who says not something must say absolutely nothing 
 theaet most assuredly 
 
 str and as we cannot admit that a man speaks and says nothing he 
 who says does not speak at all 
 
 theaet the difficulty of the argument can no further go 
 
 str not yet my friend is the time for such a word for there 
 still remains of all perplexities the first and greatest 
 touching the very foundation of the matter 
 
 theaet what do you mean do not be afraid to speak 
 
 str to that which is may be attributed some other thing which is 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str but can anything which is be attributed to that which is not 
 
 theaet impossible 
 
 str and all number is to be reckoned among things which are 
 
 theaet yes surely number if anything has a real existence 
 
 str then we must not attempt to attribute to number 
 either in the singular or plural 
 
 theaet the argument implies that we should be wrong in doing so 
 
 str but how can a man either express in words or even conceive in 
 thought things which are not or a thing which is not without number 
 
 theaet how indeed 
 
 str when we speak of things which are not attributing plurality 
 to 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str but on the other hand when we say what is not do we not 
 attribute unity 
 
 theaet manifestly 
 
 str nevertheless we maintain that you may not and ought not to 
 attribute being to 
 
 theaet most true 
 
 str do you see then that in itself can neither be 
 spoken uttered or thought but that it is unthinkable 
 unutterable unspeakable indescribable 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str but if so i was wrong in telling you just now that the 
 difficulty which was coming is the greatest of all 
 
 theaet what is there a greater still behind 
 
 str well i am surprised after what has been said already that 
 you do not see the difficulty in which he who would refute the 
 notion of is involved for he is compelled to contradict 
 himself as soon as he makes the attempt 
 
 theaet what do you mean speak more clearly 
 
 str do not expect clearness from me for i who maintain that 
 has no part either in the one or many just now 
 spoke and am still speaking of as one for i say do you understand 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and a little while ago i said that is unutterable 
 unspeakable indescribable do you follow 
 
 theaet i do after a fashion 
 
 str when i introduced the word is did i not contradict what i 
 said before 
 
 theaet clearly 
 
 str and in using the singular verb did i not speak of 
 as one 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and when i spoke of as indescribable and 
 unspeakable and unutterable in using each of these words in the 
 singular did i not refer to as one 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and yet we say that strictly speaking it should not be 
 defined as one or many and should not even be called it for the 
 use of the word it would imply a form of unity 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str how then can any one put any faith in me for now 
 as always i am unequal to the refutation of and therefore as i was saying do not look to me for the right way of speaking about but come let us try the experiment with you 
 
 theaet what do you mean 
 
 str make a noble effort as becomes youth and endeavour with all 
 your might to speak of in a right manner without 
 introducing into it either existence or unity or plurality 
 
 theaet it would be a strange boldness in me which would 
 attempt the task when i see you thus discomfited 
 
 str say no more of ourselves but until we find some one or other 
 who can speak of without number we must acknowledge that the sophist is a clever rogue who will not be got out of his hole 
 
 theaet most true 
 
 str and if we say to him that he professes an art of making 
 appearances he will grapple with us and retort our argument upon 
 ourselves and when we call him an he will say 
 pray what do you mean at all by an image and i should like to know theaetetus how we can possibly answer the question 
 
 theaet we shall doubtless tell him of the images which are 
 reflected in water or in mirrors also of sculptures pictures and 
 other duplicates 
 
 str i see theaetetus that you have never made the 
 acquaintance of the sophist 
 
 theaet why do you think so 
 
 str he will make believe to have his eyes shut or to have none 
 
 theaet what do you mean 
 
 str when you tell him of something existing in a mirror or in 
 sculpture and address him as though he had eyes he will 
 laugh you to scorn and will pretend that he knows nothing of mirrors and streams or of sight at all he will say that he is asking about an 
 idea 
 
 theaet what can he mean 
 
 str the common notion pervading all these objects which you 
 speak of as many and yet call by the single name of image as 
 though it were the unity under which they were all included how 
 will you maintain your ground against him 
 
 theaet how stranger can i describe an image except as something 
 fashioned in the likeness of the true 
 
 str and do you mean this something to be some other true thing 
 or what do you mean 
 
 theaet certainly not another true thing but only a resemblance 
 
 str and you mean by true that which really is 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and the not true is that which is the opposite of the true 
 
 theaet exactly 
 
 str a resemblance then is not really real if as you say not 
 true 
 
 theaet nay but it is in a certain sense 
 
 str you mean to say not in a true sense 
 
 theaet yes it is in reality only an image 
 
 str then what we call an image is in reality really unreal 
 
 theaet in what a strange complication of being and 
 we are involved 
 
 str strange i should think so see how by his reciprocation of 
 opposites the sophist has compelled us quite 
 against our will to admit the existence of 
 
 theaet yes indeed i see 
 
 str the difficulty is how to define his art without falling into 
 a contradiction 
 
 theaet how do you mean and where does the danger lie 
 
 str when we say that he deceives us with an illusion and that 
 his art is illusory do we mean that our soul is led by his art to 
 think falsely or what do we mean 
 
 theaet there is nothing else to be said 
 
 str again false opinion is that form of opinion which thinks the 
 opposite of the would assent 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str you mean to say that false opinion thinks what is not 
 
 theaet of course 
 
 str does false opinion think that things which are not are not 
 or that in a certain sense they are 
 
 theaet things that are not must be imagined to exist in a certain 
 sense if any degree of falsehood is to be possible 
 
 str and does not false opinion also think that things which most 
 certainly exist do not exist at all 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and here again is falsehood 
 
 theaet 
 
 str and in like manner a false proposition will be deemed to be 
 one which are the nonexistence of things which are and the 
 existence of things which are not 
 
 theaet there is no other way in which a false proposition can 
 arise 
 
 str there is not but the sophist will deny these statements and 
 indeed how can any rational man assent to them when the very 
 expressions which we have just used were before acknowledged by us to be unutterable unspeakable indescribable unthinkable 
 do you see his point theaetetus 
 
 theaet of course he will say that we are contradicting ourselves 
 when we hazard the assertion that falsehood exists in opinion and 
 in words for in maintaining this we are compelled over and over 
 again to assert being of which we admitted just now to be 
 an utter impossibility 
 
 str how well you remember and now it is high time to hold a 
 consultation as to what we ought to do about the sophist for if we 
 persist in looking for him in the class of false workers and 
 magicians you see that the handles for objection and the 
 difficulties which will arise are very numerous and obvious 
 
 theaet they are indeed 
 
 str we have gone through but a very small portion of 
 them and they are really infinite 
 
 theaet if that is the case we cannot possibly catch the sophist 
 
 str shall we then be so as to give him up 
 
 theaet certainly not i should say if we can get the slightest 
 hold upon him 
 
 str will you then forgive me and as your words imply not be 
 altogether displeased if i flinch a little from the grasp of such a 
 sturdy argument 
 
 theaet to be sure i will 
 
 str i have a yet more urgent request to make 
 
 theaet which is 
 
 str that you will promise not to regard me as a parricide 
 
 theaet and why 
 
 str because in i must test the philosophy of my 
 father parmenides and try to prove by main force that in a certain 
 sense is and that being on the other hand is not 
 
 theaet some attempt of the kind is clearly needed 
 
 str yes a blind man as they say might see that and unless 
 these questions are decided in one way or another no one when he 
 speaks false words or false opinion or idols or images or 
 imitations or appearances or about the arts which are concerned 
 with them can avoid falling into ridiculous contradictions 
 
 theaet most true 
 
 str and therefore i must venture to lay hands on my 
 argument for if i am to be i shall have to give 
 the matter up 
 
 theaet nothing in the world should ever induce us to do so 
 
 str i have a third little request which i wish to make 
 
 theaet what is it 
 
 str you heard have always felt and still 
 i have no heart for this argument 
 
 theaet i did 
 
 str i tremble at the thought of what i have said and expect that 
 you will deem me mad when you hear of my sudden changes and 
 shiftings let me therefore observe that i am examining the 
 question entirely out of regard for you 
 
 theaet there is no reason for you to fear that i shall impute any 
 impropriety to you if you attempt this refutation and proof take 
 heart therefore and proceed 
 
 str and where shall i begin the perilous enterprise i think that 
 the road which i must take is 
 
 theaet me hear 
 
 str i think that we had better first of all consider the points 
 which at present are regard as lest we may have fallen 
 into some confusion and be too ready to assent to one another 
 fancying that we are quite clear about them 
 theaet say more distinctly what you mean 
 
 str i think that parmenides and all ever yet undertook to 
 determine the number and nature of existences talked to us in 
 rather a light and easy strain 
 
 theaet how 
 
 str as if we had been children to whom they repeated each his 
 own mythus or said that there were three principles and 
 that at one time there was war between certain of them and 
 then again there was peace and they were married and begat children 
 and brought them up and another spoke of two moist and a dry or a hot and a cold and made them marry and cohabit the eleatics however in our part of the world say that things are many in name but in nature one this is their mythus which goes back to xenophanes and is even older then there are ionian and in more 
 recent times sicilian muses who have arrived at the conclusion that 
 to unite the two principles is safer and to say that being is one and 
 many and that these are held together by enmity and friendship 
 ever parting ever meeting as muses assert while the 
 gentler ones do not insist on the perpetual strife and peace but 
 admit a relaxation and alternation of them peace and unity sometimes prevailing under the sway of aphrodite and then again plurality and war by reason of a principle of strife whether any of them spoke the truth in all this is hard to determine besides antiquity and famous men should have reverence and not be liable to accusations so serious yet one thing may be said of them without offence 
 
 theaet what thing 
 
 str that they went on their several ways disdaining to notice 
 people like ourselves they did not care whether they took us with 
 them or left us behind them 
 
 theaet how do you mean 
 
 str i mean to say that when they talk of one two or more 
 elements which are or have become or are becoming or again of heat 
 mingling with cold assuming in some other part of their works 
 separations and me theaetetus do you understand 
 what they mean by these expressions when i was a younger man i 
 used to fancy that i understood quite well what was meant by the 
 term which is our present subject of dispute 
 and now you see in what a fix we are about it 
 
 theaet i see 
 
 str and very likely we have been getting into the same perplexity 
 about being and yet may fancy that when anybody utters 
 the word we understand him quite easily although we do not know about but we may be equally ignorant of both 
 
 theaet i dare say 
 
 str and the same may be said of all the terms just mentioned 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str the consideration of most of them may be deferred but we had 
 better now discuss the chief captain and leader of them 
 
 theaet of what are you speaking you clearly think that we must 
 first investigate what people mean by the word being 
 
 str you follow close at heels theaetetus for the right method 
 i conceive will be to call into our presence the dualistic 
 philosophers and to interrogate them come we will say ye who 
 affirm that hot and cold or any other two principles are the 
 universe 
 what is this term which you apply to both of them and what do you 
 mean when you say that both and each of them are how are we to 
 understand the word are upon your view are we to suppose that 
 there is a third principle over and above the other in 
 all and not two for clearly you cannot say that one of the two 
 principles is being and yet attribute being equally to both of 
 them for if you did whichever of the two is identified with 
 being will comprehend the other and so they will be one and not 
 two

 sophist 
 
 by plato 
 
 translated by benjamin jowett 
 book i 
 
 persons of the dialogue theodorus theaetetus socrates 
 an eleatic stranger whom theodorus and theaetetus bring 
 with them the younger socrates who is a silent auditor 
 
 theodorus here we are socrates true to our agreement of 
 yesterday and we bring with us a stranger from elea who is a 
 disciple of parmenides and zeno and a true philosopher 
 
 socrates is he not rather a god theodorus who comes to us in 
 the disguise of a stranger for homer says that all the gods and 
 especially the god of strangers are companions of the meek and 
 just and visit the good and evil among men and may not your 
 companion be one of those higher powers a deity 
 who has come to spy out our weakness in argument and to 
 us 
 
 theod nay socrates he is not one of the disputatious is 
 too good for that and in my opinion he is not a god at all but 
 divine he certainly is for this is a title which i should 
 give to all philosophers 
 
 soc capital my friend and i may add that they are almost as 
 hard to be discerned as the gods for the true philosophers and 
 such as are not merely made up for the occasion appear in various 
 forms unrecognized by the ignorance of men and they hover about 
 cities as homer declares looking from above upon human life and 
 some think nothing of them and others can never think enough and 
 sometimes they appear as statesmen and sometimes as sophists and 
 then again to many they seem to be no better than madmen i should 
 like to ask our eleatic friend if he would tell us what is thought 
 about them in italy and to whom the terms are applied 
 
 theod what terms 
 
 soc sophist statesman philosopher 
 
 theod what is your difficulty about them and what made you ask 
 
 soc i want to know whether by his countrymen they are regarded as 
 one or two or do they as the names are three distinguish 
 also three kinds and assign one to each name 
 
 theod i dare say that the stranger will not object to discuss the 
 question what do you say stranger 
 
 stranger i am far from objecting theodorus nor have i any 
 difficulty in replying that by us they are regarded as three but to 
 define precisely the nature of each of them is by no means a 
 slight or easy task 
 
 theod you have happened to light socrates almost on the very 
 question which we were asking our friend before we came 
 hither and he excused himself to us as he does now you although he admitted that the matter had been fully discussed and that he remembered the answer 
 
 soc then do not stranger deny us the first favour which 
 we ask of you i am sure that you will not and therefore i shall only beg of you to say whether you like and are accustomed to make a long oration on a subject which you want to explain to another or to 
 proceed by the method of question and answer i remember hearing a 
 very noble discussion in which parmenides employed the latter of the 
 two methods when i was a young man and he was far advanced 
 in years 
 
 str i prefer to talk with another when he responds pleasantly 
 and is light in hand if not i would rather have my own say 
 soc any one of the present company will respond kindly to you 
 and you can choose whom you like of them i should recommend you to take a young for you have a preference for some one else 
 
 str i feel ashamed socrates being a new comer into your 
 society instead of talking a little and hearing others talk to be 
 spinning out a long soliloquy or address as if i wanted to show 
 off for the true answer will certainly be a very long one a great 
 deal longer than might be expected from such a short and simple 
 question at the same time i fear that i may seem rude and 
 ungracious if i refuse your courteous request especially after what you have said for i certainly cannot object to your proposal that 
 theaetetus should respond having already conversed with him myself and being recommended by you to take him 
 theaetetus but are you sure stranger that this will be quite so 
 acceptable to the rest of the company as socrates imagines 
 
 str you hear them applauding theaetetus after that there is 
 nothing more to be said well then i am to argue with you 
 and if you tire of the argument you may complain of your friends and not of me 
 
 theaet i do not think that i shall tire and if i do i shall get 
 my friend here young socrates the namesake of the elder 
 socrates to help he is about my own age and my partner at the gymnasium and is constantly accustomed to work with me 
 
 str very good you can decide about that for yourself as we 
 proceed meanwhile you and i will begin together and enquire into 
 the nature of the sophist first of the three i should like you to 
 make out what he is and bring him to light in a discussion for at 
 present we are only agreed about the name but of the thing to which 
 we both apply the name possibly you have one notion and i another 
 whereas we ought always to come to an understanding about the thing 
 itself in terms of a definition and not merely about the name minus 
 the definition now the tribe of sophists which we are investigating 
 is not easily caught or defined and the world has long ago agreed 
 that if great subjects are to be adequately treated they must be 
 studied in the lesser and easier instances of them before we proceed 
 to the greatest of all and as i know that the tribe of sophists is 
 troublesome and hard to be caught i should recommend that 
 we practise beforehand the method which is to be applied to him on some simple and smaller thing unless you can suggest a better way 
 theaet indeed i cannot 
 
 str then suppose that we work out some lesser example 
 which will be a pattern of the greater 
 
 theaet good 
 
 str what is there which is well known and not great and is yet 
 as susceptible of definition as any larger thing shall i say an 
 angler he is familiar to all of us and not a very interesting or 
 important person 
 
 theaet he is not 
 
 str yet i suspect that he will furnish us with the sort of 
 definition and line of enquiry which we want 
 
 theaet very good 
 
 str let us begin by asking whether he is a man having art or not 
 having art but some other power 
 
 theaet he is clearly a man of art 
 
 str and of arts there are two kinds 
 
 theaet what are they 
 
 str there is agriculture and the tending of mortal creatures 
 and the art of constructing or moulding vessels and there is the 
 art of these may be appropriately called by a single 
 name 
 
 theaet what do you mean and what is the name 
 
 str he who brings into existence something that did not exist 
 before is said to be a producer and that which is brought into 
 existence is said to be produced 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and all the arts which were just now mentioned are 
 characterized by this power of producing 
 
 theaet they are 
 
 str then let us sum them up under the name of productive or 
 creative art 
 
 theaet very good 
 
 str next follows the whole class of learning and cognition then 
 comes trade fighting hunting and since none of these produces 
 anything but is only engaged in conquering by word or deed or in 
 preventing others from conquering things which exist and have been 
 already each and all of these branches there 
 appears to be an art which may be called acquisitive 
 
 theaet yes that is the proper name 
 
 str seeing then that all arts are either acquisitive or 
 creative in which class shall we place the art of the angler 
 
 theaet clearly in the acquisitive class 
 
 str and the acquisitive may be subdivided into two parts there 
 is exchange which is voluntary and is effected by gifts hire 
 purchase and the other part of acquisitive which takes by force of 
 word or deed may be termed conquest 
 
 theaet that is implied in what has been said 
 
 str and may not conquest be again subdivided 
 theaet how 
 
 str open force may be called fighting and secret force may have 
 the general name of hunting 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and there is no reason why the art of hunting should not be 
 further divided 
 
 theaet how would you make the division 
 
 str into the hunting of living and of lifeless prey 
 
 theaet yes if both kinds exist 
 
 str of course they exist but the hunting after lifeless things 
 having no special name except some sorts of diving and other small 
 matters may be omitted the hunting after living things may 
 be called animal hunting 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and animal hunting may be truly said to have two divisions 
 hunting which has many kinds and names and 
 
 hunting or the hunting after animals who swim 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and of swimming animals one class lives on the wing and the 
 other in the water 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str fowling is the general term under which the hunting of all 
 birds is included 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str the hunting of animals who live in the water has the general 
 name of fishing 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and this sort of hunting may be further divided also into two 
 principal kinds 
 
 theaet what are they 
 
 str there is one kind which takes them in nets another 
 which takes them by a blow 
 
 theaet what do you mean and how do you distinguish them 
 
 str as to the first that surrounds and encloses anything 
 to prevent egress may be rightly called an enclosure 
 
 theaet very true 
 str for which reason twig baskets casting nets nooses creels 
 and the like may all be termed enclosures 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and therefore this first kind of capture may be called by us 
 capture with enclosures or something of that sort 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str the other kind which is practised by a blow with hooks and 
 three pronged spears when summed up under one name may be called striking unless you theaetetus can find some better name 
 
 theaet never mind the you suggest will do very well 
 
 str there is one mode of striking which is done at night and by 
 the light of a fire and is by the hunters themselves called firing 
 or spearing by firelight 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and the fishing by day is called by the general name 
 of barbing because the spears too are barbed at the point 
 
 theaet yes that is the term 
 
 str of this that which strikes the fish who is 
 below from above is called spearing because this is the way in 
 which the spears are mostly used 
 
 theaet yes it is often called so 
 
 str then now there is only one kind remaining 
 
 theaet what is that 
 
 str when a hook is used and the fish is not struck in any chance 
 part of his as be is with the spear but only about the head 
 and mouth and is then drawn out from below upwards with reeds and is the right name of that mode of fish theaetetus 
 
 theaet i suspect that we have now discovered the object of our 
 search 
 
 str then now you and i have come to an understanding not 
 only about the name of the art but about the definition of the thing itself one half of all art was of all the art 
 acquisitive art was conquest or taking by force half of this was 
 hunting and half of hunting was hunting animals half of this was 
 hunting water this again the under half was fishing 
 half of fishing was striking a part of striking was fishing with a 
 barb and one half of this again being the kind which strikes with 
 a hook and draws the fish from below upwards is the art 
 which we have been seeking and which from the nature of the operation is denoted angling or drawing up aspalienutike anaspasthai 
 
 theaet the result has been quite satisfactorily brought out 
 
 str and now following this pattern let us endeavour to find out 
 what a sophist is 
 
 theaet by all means 
 
 str the first question about the angler was whether he was a 
 skilled artist or unskilled 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and shall we call our new friend unskilled or a thorough 
 master of his craft 
 
 theaet certainly not unskilled for his name as indeed you 
 imply must surely express his nature 
 
 str then he must be supposed to have some art 
 
 theaet what art 
 
 str by heaven they are cousins it never occurred to us 
 
 theaet who are cousins 
 
 str the angler and the sophist 
 
 theaet in what way are they related 
 
 str they both appear to me to be hunters 
 
 theaet how the sophist of the other we have spoken 
 
 str you remember our division of hunting into hunting after 
 swimming animals and land animals 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and you remember that we subdivided the swimming and left the 
 land animals saying that there were many kinds of them 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str thus far then the sophist and the angler starting from the 
 art of acquiring take the same road 
 
 theaet so it would appear 
 
 str their paths diverge when they reach the art of animal 
 hunting the one going to the seashore and to the rivers and to the 
 lakes and angling for the animals which are in them 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str while the other goes to land and water of another 
 of wealth and broad of generous youth and he also is 
 intending to take the animals which are in them 
 
 theaet what do you mean 
 
 str of hunting on land there are two principal divisions 
 
 theaet what are they 
 
 str one is the hunting of tame and the other of wild animals 
 
 theaet but are tame animals ever hunted 
 
 str yes if you include man under tame animals but if 
 you like you may say that there are no tame animals or that if there are man is not among them or you may say that man is a tame animal 
 but is not shall decide which of these alternatives you prefer 
 
 theaet i should say stranger that man is a tame animal and i 
 admit that he is hunted 
 
 str then let us divide the hunting of tame animals into two parts 
 theaet how shall we make the division 
 
 str let us define piracy tyranny the 
 whole military art by one name as hunting with violence 
 
 theaet very good 
 
 str but the art of the lawyer of the popular orator and the art 
 of conversation may be called in one word the art of persuasion 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and of persuasion there may be said to be two kinds 
 
 theaet what are they 
 
 str one is private and the other public 
 
 theaet yes each of them forms a class 
 
 str and of private hunting one sort receives hire and the other 
 brings gifts 
 
 theaet i do not understand you 
 
 str you seem never to have observed the manner in which lovers 
 hunt 
 
 theaet to what do you refer 
 
 str i mean that they lavish gifts on those whom they hunt in 
 addition to other inducements 
 
 theaet most true 
 
 str let us admit this then to be the amatory art 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str but that sort of hireling whose conversation is pleasing and 
 who baits his hook only with pleasure and exacts nothing but his 
 maintenance in return we should all if i am not mistaken describe 
 as possessing flattery or an art of making things pleasant 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and that sort which professes to form acquaintances only for 
 the sake of virtue and demands a reward in the shape of 
 money may be fairly called by another name 
 
 theaet to be sure 
 
 str and what is the name will you tell me 
 
 theaet it is obvious enough for i believe that we have 
 discovered the sophist which is as i conceive the proper name for 
 the class described 
 
 str then now theaetetus his art may be traced as a branch of 
 the appropriative acquisitive hunts 
 animals which hunts 
 money in the semblance of education 
 and this is termed sophistry and is a hunt after young men of 
 wealth and is the conclusion 
 
 theaet just so 
 
 str let us take another branch of his genealogy for he is a 
 professor of a great and many sided art and if we look back at what 
 has preceded we see that he presents another aspect besides that of 
 which we are speaking 
 
 theaet in what respect 
 
 str there were two sorts of acquisitive art the one 
 concerned with hunting the other with exchange 
 
 theaet there were 
 
 str and of the art of exchange there are two divisions the one 
 of giving and the other of selling 
 
 theaet let us assume that 
 
 str next will suppose the art of selling to be divided into two 
 parts 
 
 theaet how 
 
 str there is one part which is distinguished as the sale 
 of a own productions another which is the exchange of the works of others 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and is not that part of exchange which takes place in 
 the about half of the whole termed retailing 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and that which exchanges the goods of one city for those of 
 another by selling and buying is the exchange of the merchant 
 
 theaet to be sure 
 
 str and you are aware that this exchange of the merchant is of 
 two kinds it is partly concerned with food for the use of the body 
 and partly with the food of the soul which is bartered and 
 received in exchange for money 
 
 theaet what do you mean 
 
 str you want to know what is the meaning of food for the soul 
 the other kind you surely understand 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str take music in general and painting and marionette playing and 
 many other things which are purchased in one city and carried away 
 and sold in of the soul which are hawked about either 
 for the sake of instruction or not he who takes them 
 about and sells them be quite as truly called a merchant as he who 
 sells meats and drinks 
 
 theaet to be sure he may 
 
 str and would you not call by the same name him who buys up 
 knowledge and goes about from city to city exchanging his wares for 
 money 
 
 theaet certainly i should 
 
 str of this merchandise of the soul may not one part be fairly 
 termed the art of display and there is another part which is 
 certainly not less ridiculous but being a trade in learning must be 
 called by some name germane to the matter 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str the latter should have two descriptive of the sale 
 of the knowledge of virtue and the other of the sale of other kinds 
 of knowledge 
 
 theaet of course 
 
 str the name of corresponds well enough to the latter 
 but you must try and tell me the name of the other 
 
 theaet he must be the sophist whom we are seeking no other name 
 can possibly be right 
 
 str no other and so this trader in virtue again turns out to be 
 our friend the sophist whose art may now be traced from the art of 
 acquisition through exchange trade merchandise to a merchandise 
 of the soul which is concerned with speech and the knowledge of 
 virtue 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str and there may be a third reappearance of he may have 
 settled down in a city and may fabricate as well as buy these same 
 wares intending to live by selling them and he would still 
 be called a sophist 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str then that part of acquisitive art which exchanges and of 
 exchange which either sells a own productions or retails those 
 of others as the case may be and in either way sells the knowledge 
 of virtue you would again term sophistry 
 
 theaet i must if i am to keep pace with the argument 
 
 str let us consider once more whether there may not be yet 
 another aspect of sophistry 
 
 theaet what is it 
 
 str in the acquisitive there was a subdivision of the combative 
 or fighting art 
 
 theaet there was 
 
 str perhaps we had better divide it 
 
 theaet what shall be the divisions 
 
 str there shall be one division of the competitive and another 
 of the pugnacious 
 
 theaet very good 
 
 str that part of the pugnacious which is contest of 
 bodily strength may be properly called by some such name as violent 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and when the war is one of words it may be termed 
 controversy 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and controversy may be of two kinds 
 
 theaet what are they 
 
 str when long speeches are answered by long speeches and there 
 is public discussion about the just and unjust that is forensic 
 controversy 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and there is a private sort of controversy which is cut up 
 into questions and answers and this is commonly called disputation 
 
 theaet yes that is the name 
 
 str and of disputation that sort which is only a discussion 
 about contracts and is carried on at random and without 
 is recognized by the reasoning faculty to be a distinct 
 class but has hitherto had no distinctive name and does not deserve to receive one from us 
 
 theaet no for the different sorts of it are too minute and 
 heterogeneous 
 
 str but that which proceeds by rules of art to dispute about 
 justice and injustice in their own nature and about things in 
 general we have been accustomed to call argumentation eristic 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and of argumentation one sort wastes money and the other 
 makes money 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str suppose we try and give to each of these two classes a name 
 
 theaet let us do so 
 
 str i should say that the habit which leads a man to neglect his 
 own affairs for the pleasure of conversation of which the style is 
 far from being agreeable to the majority of his hearers may 
 be fairly termed loquacity such is my opinion 
 
 theaet that is the common name for it 
 
 str but now who the other is who makes money out of private 
 disputation it is your turn to say 
 
 theaet there is only one true answer he is the wonderful 
 sophist of whom we are in pursuit and who reappears again for the 
 fourth time 
 
 str yes and with a fresh pedigree for he is the 
 species of the eristic disputatious controversial pugnacious 
 combative acquisitive family as the argument has already proven 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str how true was the observation that he was a animal 
 and not to be caught with one hand as they say 
 
 theaet then you must catch him with two 
 
 str yes we must if we can and therefore let us try another 
 track in our pursuit of him you are aware that there are certain 
 menial occupations which have names among servants 
 
 theaet yes there are many such which of them do you mean 
 
 str i mean such as sifting straining winnowing threshing 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and besides these there are a great many more such 
 as carding spinning adjusting the warp and the woof and thousands of similar expressions are used in the arts 
 
 theaet of what are they to be patterns and what are we 
 going to do with them all 
 
 str i think that in all of these there is implied a notion of 
 division 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str then if as i was saying there is one art which includes all 
 of them ought not that art to have one name 
 
 theaes and what is the name of the art 
 
 str the art of discerning or discriminating 
 
 theaet very good 
 
 str think whether you cannot divide this 
 
 theaet i should have to think a long while 
 
 str in all the previously named processes either like has been 
 separated from like or the better from the worse 
 
 theaet i see now what you mean 
 
 str there is no name for the first kind of separation of the 
 second which throws away the worse and preserves the better i do 
 know a name 
 
 theaet what is it 
 
 str every discernment or discrimination of that kind as i have 
 observed is called a purification 
 
 theaet yes that is the usual expression 
 
 str and any one may see that purification is of two kinds 
 
 theaet perhaps so if he were allowed time to think but i do not 
 see at this moment 
 
 str there are many purifications of bodies which may with 
 propriety be comprehended under a single name 
 
 theaet what are they and what is their name 
 
 str there is the purification of living bodies in their inward 
 and in their outward parts of which the former is duly effected by 
 medicine and gymnastic the latter by the not very dignified art of 
 the and there is the purification of inanimate 
 this the arts of fulling and of furbishing in general attend in a number of minute particulars having a variety of names which are thought ridiculous 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str there can be no doubt that they are thought ridiculous 
 
 theaetetus but then the dialectical art never considers whether the 
 benefit to be derived from the purge is greater or less than that to 
 be derived from the sponge and has not more interest in the one 
 than in the other her endeavour is to know what is and is 
 not kindred in all arts with a view to the acquisition of intelligence and having this in view she honours them all alike and when she makes comparisons she counts one of them not a whit more ridiculous than another nor does she esteem him who adduces as his example of hunting the art at all more decorous than another who cites that of the but only as the greater 
 pretender of the two and as to your question concerning the name 
 which was to comprehend all these arts of purification whether of 
 animate or inanimate bodies the art of dialectic is in no wise 
 particular about fine words if she maybe only allowed to have a 
 general name for all other purifications binding them up 
 together and separating them off from the purification of the soul or intellect for this is the purification at which she wants to arrive 
 and this we should understand to be her aim 
 
 theaet yes i understand and i agree that there are two sorts of 
 purification and that one of them is concerned with the 
 soul and that there is another which is concerned with the body 
 
 str excellent and now listen to what i am going to say 
 and try to divide further the first of the two 
 
 theaet whatever line of division you suggest i will endeavour to 
 assist you 
 
 str do we admit that virtue is distinct from vice in the soul 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and purification was to leave the good and to cast 
 out whatever is bad 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str then any taking away of evil from the soul may be properly 
 called purification 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and in the soul there are two kinds of evil 
 
 theaet what are they 
 
 str the one may be compared to disease in the body the other to 
 deformity 
 
 theaet i do not understand 
 
 str perhaps you have never reflected that disease and discord are 
 the same 
 
 theaet to this again i know not what i should reply 
 
 str do you not conceive discord to be a dissolution of kindred 
 clements originating in some disagreement 
 
 theaet just that 
 
 str and is deformity anything but the want of measure which is 
 always unsightly 
 
 theaet exactly 
 
 str and do we not see that opinion is opposed to desire pleasure 
 to anger reason to pain and that all these elements are opposed to 
 one another in the souls of bad men 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and yet they must all be akin 
 
 theaet of course 
 
 str then we shall be right in calling vice a discord and 
 disease of the soul 
 
 theaet most true 
 
 str and when things having motion an aiming at an appointed 
 mark continually miss their aim and glance aside shall we say that 
 this is the effect of symmetry among them or of the want of 
 symmetry 
 
 theaet clearly of the want of symmetry 
 
 str but surely we know that no soul is voluntarily ignorant of 
 anything 
 
 theaet certainly not 
 
 str and what is ignorance but the aberration of a mind which is 
 bent on truth and in which the process of understanding is 
 perverted 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str then we are to regard an unintelligent soul as deformed and 
 devoid of symmetry 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str then there are these two kinds of evil in the one 
 which is generally called vice and is obviously a disease of the 
 soul 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and there is the other which they call ignorance and which 
 because existing only in the soul they will not allow to be vice 
 
 theaet i certainly admit what i at first there are 
 two kinds of vice in the soul and that we ought to consider 
 cowardice intemperance and injustice to be alike forms of 
 disease in the soul and ignorance of which there are all sorts of 
 varieties to be deformity 
 
 str and in the case of the body are there not two arts which 
 have to do with the two bodily states 
 
 theaet what are they 
 
 str there is gymnastic which has to do with deformity and 
 medicine which has to do with disease 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and where there is insolence and injustice and cowardice is 
 not chastisement the art which is most required 
 
 theaet that certainly appears to be the opinion of mankind 
 
 str again of the various kinds of ignorance may not instruction 
 be rightly said to be the remedy 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and of the art of instruction shall we say that there is one 
 or many kinds at any rate there are two principal ones think 
 
 theaet i will 
 
 str i believe that i can see how we shall soonest arrive at the 
 answer to this question 
 
 theaet how 
 
 str if we can discover a line which divides ignorance into two 
 halves for a division of ignorance into two parts will certainly 
 imply that the art of instruction is also twofold answering to the 
 two divisions of ignorance 
 
 theaet well and do you see what you are looking for 
 
 str i do seem to myself to see one very large and bad sort of 
 ignorance which is quite separate and may be weighed in the scale 
 against all other sorts of ignorance put together 
 
 theaet what is it 
 
 str when a person supposes that he knows and does not know this 
 appears to be the great source of all the errors of the intellect 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and this if i am not mistaken is the kind of ignorance 
 which specially earns the title of stupidity 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str what name then shall be given to the sort of instruction 
 which gets rid of this 
 
 theaet the instruction which you mean stranger is i should 
 imagine not the teaching of handicraft arts but what thanks to 
 us has been termed education in this part the world 
 
 str yes theaetetus and by nearly all hellenes but we have 
 still to consider whether education admits of any further division 
 
 theaet we have 
 
 str i think that there is a point at which such a division is 
 possible 
 
 theaet where 
 
 str of education one method appears to be rougher and another 
 smoother 
 
 theaet how are we to distinguish the two 
 
 str there is the mode which our fathers commonly 
 practised towards their sons and which is still adopted by 
 of roughly reproving their errors or of gently advising 
 them which varieties may be correctly included under the 
 general term of admonition 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str but whereas some appear to have arrived at the conclusion 
 that all ignorance is involuntary and that no one who thinks 
 himself wise is willing to learn any of those things in which he is 
 conscious of his own cleverness and that the admonitory sort of 
 instruction gives much trouble and does little good 
 
 theaet there they are quite right 
 
 str accordingly they set to work to eradicate the spirit of 
 conceit in another way 
 
 theaet in what way 
 
 str they a words when he thinks that he is 
 saying something and is really saying nothing and easily convict 
 him of inconsistencies in his opinions these they then 
 collect by the dialectical process and placing them side by side show that they contradict one another about the same things in relation to the same things and in the same respect he seeing this is angry with himself and grows gentle towards others and thus is entirely delivered from great prejudices and harsh notions in a way which is most amusing to the hearer and produces the most lasting good effect on the person who is the subject of the operation for as the physician considers that the body will receive no benefit from 
 taking food until the internal obstacles have been removed so the 
 purifier of the soul is conscious that his patient will receive no 
 benefit from the application of knowledge until he is refuted and 
 from refutation learns modesty he must be purged of his prejudices 
 first and made to think that he knows only what he knows 
 and no more 
 
 theaet that is certainly the best and wisest state of mind 
 
 str for all these reasons theaetetus we must admit that 
 refutation is the greatest and chiefest of purifications and he who 
 has not been refuted though he be the great king himself is in an 
 awful state of impurity he is uninstructed and deformed in those 
 things in which he who would be truly blessed ought to be fairest 
 and purest 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str and who are the ministers of this art 
 i am afraid to say the sophists 
 
 theaet why 
 
 str lest we should assign to them too high a prerogative 
 
 theaet yet the sophist has a certain likeness to our minister of 
 purification 
 
 str yes the same sort of likeness which a wolf who is the 
 fiercest of animals has to a dog who is the gentlest but he who 
 would not be found tripping ought to be very careful in this matter 
 of comparisons for they are most slippery things nevertheless let 
 us assume that the sophists are the men i say this 
 provisionally for i think that the line which divides them will be marked enough if proper care is taken 
 
 theaet likely enough 
 
 str let us grant then that from the discerning art comes 
 purification and from purification let there be separated off a 
 part which is concerned with the soul of this mental purification 
 instruction is a portion and of instruction education and of 
 education that refutation of vain conceit which has been discovered 
 in the present argument and let this be called by you and me the 
 art of sophistry 
 
 theaet very well and yet considering the number of 
 forms in which he has presented himself i begin to doubt how i can with any truth or confidence describe the real nature of the sophist 
 
 str you naturally feel perplexed and yet i think that he must be 
 still more perplexed in his attempt to escape us for as the proverb 
 says when every way is blocked there is no escape now 
 then is the time of all others to set upon him 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str first let us wait a moment and recover breath and 
 while we are resting we may reckon up in how many forms he has appeared in the first place he was discovered to be a paid hunter after wealth and youth 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str in the second place he was a merchant in the goods of the 
 soul 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str in the third place he has turned out to be a retailer of the 
 same sort of wares 
 
 theaet yes and in the fourth place he himself manufactured the 
 learned wares which he sold 
 
 str quite right i will try and remember the fifth myself he 
 belonged to the fighting class and was further distinguished as a 
 hero of debate who professed the eristic art 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str the sixth point was doubtful and yet we at last 
 agreed that he was a purger of souls who cleared away notions obstructive to knowledge 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str do you not see that when the professor of any art has one 
 name and many kinds of knowledge there must be something wrong the multiplicity of names which is applied to him shows that the common principle to which all these branches of knowledge are 
 tending is not understood 
 
 theaet i should imagine this to be the case 
 
 str at any rate we will understand him and no indolence shall 
 prevent us let us begin again then and some of our 
 statements concerning the sophist there was one thing which 
 appeared to me especially characteristic of him 
 
 theaet to what are you referring 
 
 str we were saying of him if i am not mistaken that he was a 
 disputer 
 
 theaet we were 
 
 str and does he not also teach others the art of disputation 
 
 theaet certainly he does 
 
 str and about what does he profess that he teaches men to 
 dispute to begin at the he make them able to dispute about divine things which are invisible to men in general 
 
 theaet at any rate he is said to do so 
 
 str and what do you say of the visible things in heaven and 
 earth and the like 
 
 theaet certainly he disputes and teaches to dispute about them 
 
 str then again in private conversation when any universal 
 assertion is made about generation and essence we know that such 
 persons are tremendous argufiers and are able to impart their own 
 skill to others 
 
 theaet undoubtedly 
 
 str and do they not profess to make men able to dispute about law 
 and about politics in general 
 
 theaet why no one would have anything to say to them if they 
 did not make these professions 
 
 str in all and every art what the craftsman ought to say 
 in answer to any question is written down in a popular form and he who likes may learn 
 
 theaet i suppose that you are referring to the precepts of 
 protagoras about wrestling and the other arts 
 
 str yes my friend and about a good many other things in a 
 word is not the art of disputation a power of disputing about all 
 things 
 
 theaet certainly there does not seem to be much which is 
 left out 
 
 str but oh my dear youth do you suppose this possible for 
 perhaps your young eyes may see things which to our duller sight do 
 not appear 
 
 theaet to what are you alluding i do not think that i understand 
 your present question 
 
 str i ask whether anybody can understand all things 
 
 theaet happy would mankind be if such a thing were possible 
 
 soc but how can any one who is ignorant dispute in a rational 
 manner against him who knows 
 
 theaet he cannot 
 
 str then why has the sophistical art such a mysterious power 
 
 theaet to what do you refer 
 
 str how do the sophists make young men believe in their 
 supreme and universal wisdom for if they neither disputed nor were thought to dispute rightly or being thought to do so were deemed no wiser for their controversial skill then to quote your own 
 observation no one would give them money or be willing to learn their art 
 
 theaet they certainly would not 
 
 str but they are willing 
 
 theaet yes they are 
 
 str yes and the reason as i should imagine is that they are 
 supposed to have knowledge of those things about which they dispute 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and they dispute about all things 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and therefore to their disciples they appear to be 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str but they are not for that was shown to be impossible 
 
 theaet impossible of course 
 
 str then the sophist has been shown to have a sort of conjectural 
 or apparent knowledge only of all things which is not the truth 
 
 theaet exactly no better description of him could be given 
 
 str let us now take an illustration which will still more 
 clearly explain his nature 
 
 theaet what is it 
 
 str i will tell you and you shall answer me giving your very 
 closest attention suppose that a person were to profess not that 
 he could speak or dispute but that he knew how to make and do all 
 things by a single art 
 
 theaet all things 
 
 str i see that you do not understand the first word that i utter 
 for you do not understand the meaning of all 
 
 theaet no i do not 
 
 str under all things i include you and me and also animals and 
 trees 
 
 theaet what do you mean 
 
 str suppose a person to say that he will make you and me and all 
 creatures 
 
 theaet what would he mean by making he cannot be a 
 you said that he is a maker of animals 
 
 str yes and i say that he is also the maker of the sea and the 
 earth and the heavens and the gods and of all other things and 
 further that he can make them in no time and sell them for a few 
 pence 
 
 theaet that must be a jest 
 
 str and when a man says that he knows all things and can teach 
 them to another at a small cost and in a short time is not that a 
 jest 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and is there any more artistic or graceful form of jest than 
 imitation 
 
 theaet certainly not and imitation is a very comprehensive term 
 which includes under one class the most diverse sorts of things 
 
 str we know of course that he who professes by one art to make 
 all things is really a painter and by the art makes 
 resemblances of real things which have the same name with 
 them and he can deceive the less intelligent sort of young children to whom he shows his pictures at a distance into the belief that he has the absolute power of making whatever he likes 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and may there not be supposed to be an imitative art of 
 reasoning is it not possible to enchant the hearts of young men by 
 words poured through their ears when they are still at a distance 
 from the truth of facts by exhibiting to them fictitious arguments 
 and making them think that they are true and that the speaker is 
 the wisest of men in all things 
 
 theaet yes why should there not be another such art 
 
 str but as time goes on and their hearers advance in years and 
 come into closer contact with realities and have learnt by sad 
 experience to see and feel the truth of things are not the greater 
 part of them compelled to change many opinions which they formerly 
 entertained so that the great appears small to them and the easy 
 difficult and all their dreamy speculations are overturned by the 
 facts of life 
 
 theaet that is my view as far as i can judge although 
 at my age i may be one of those who see things at a distance only 
 
 str and the wish of all of us who are your friends is and 
 always will be to bring you as near to the truth as we can 
 without the sad reality and now i should like you to tell me whether 
 the sophist is not visibly a magician and imitator of true being or are we still disposed to think that he may have a true knowledge of the 
 various matters about which he disputes 
 
 theaet but how can he stranger is there any doubt 
 after what has been said that he is to be located in one of the divisions of play 
 
 str then we must place him in the class of magicians and mimics 
 
 theaet certainly we must 
 
 str and now our business is not to let the animal out for we 
 have got him in a sort of dialectical net and there is one thing 
 which he decidedly will not escape 
 
 theaet what is that 
 
 str the inference that he is a juggler 
 
 theaet precisely my own opinion of him 
 
 str then clearly we ought as soon as possible to divide the 
 art and go down into the net and if the sophist does 
 not run away from us to seize him according to orders and 
 deliver him over to reason who is the lord of the hunt and proclaim the capture of him and if he creeps into the recesses of the imitative 
 art and secretes himself in one of them to divide again and follow 
 him up until in some of imitation he is caught for our 
 method of tackling each and all is one which neither he nor any 
 other creature will ever escape in triumph 
 
 theaet well said and let us do as you propose 
 
 str well then pursuing the same analytic method as before i 
 think that i can discern two divisions of the imitative art but i 
 am not as yet able to see in which of them the desired form is to be 
 found 
 
 theaet will you tell me first what are two divisions of which you 
 are speaking 
 
 str one is the art of a likeness of 
 anything is made by producing a copy which is executed according to the proportions of the original similar in length and breadth and 
 depth each thing receiving also its appropriate colour 
 
 theaet is not this always the aim of imitation 
 
 str not always in works either of sculpture or of painting 
 which are of any magnitude there is a certain degree of deception 
 for artists were to give the true proportions of their fair works 
 the upper part which is farther off would appear to be out of 
 proportion in comparison with the lower which is nearer and so 
 they give up the truth in their images and make only the proportions 
 which appear to be beautiful disregarding the real ones 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str and that which being other is also like may we not 
 fairly call a likeness or image 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and may we not as i did just now call that part of the 
 imitative art which is concerned with making such images the art of 
 likeness making 
 
 theaet let that be the name 
 
 str and what shall we call those resemblances of the beautiful 
 which appear such owing to the unfavourable position of the 
 spectator whereas if a person had the power of getting a correct view of works of such magnitude they would appear not even like that to which they profess to be like may we not call these appearances since they appear only and are not really like 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str there is a great deal of this kind of thing in 
 painting and in all imitation 
 
 theaet of course 
 
 str and may we not fairly call the sort of art which produces an 
 appearance and not an image phantastic art 
 
 theaet most fairly 
 
 str these then are the two kinds of image art of 
 making likenesses and phantastic or the art of making appearances 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str i was doubtful before in which of them i should place the 
 sophist nor am i even now able to see clearly verily he is a 
 wonderful and inscrutable creature and now in the cleverest 
 manner he has got into an impossible place 
 
 theaet yes he has 
 
 str do you speak advisedly or are you carried away at the moment 
 by the habit of assenting into giving a hasty answer 
 
 theaet may i ask to what you are referring 
 
 str my dear friend we are engaged in a very difficult 
 can be no doubt of that for how a thing can 
 appear and seem and not be or how a man can say a thing 
 which is not true has always been and still remains a very perplexing question can any one say or think that falsehood really exists and 
 avoid being caught in a contradiction indeed theaetetus the task is a difficult one 
 
 theaet why 
 
 str he who says that falsehood exists has the audacity to assert 
 the being of for this is implied in the possibility of 
 falsehood but my boy in the days when i was a boy the great 
 parmenides protested against this doctrine and to the end 
 of his life he continued to inculcate the same repeating both in verse and out of your mind from this way of enquiry for never will you show that is 
 such is his testimony which is confirmed by the very expression 
 when sifted a little would you object to begin with the 
 consideration of the words themselves 
 
 theaet never mind about me i am only desirous that you should 
 carry on the argument in the best way and that you should take me 
 with you 
 
 str very good and now say do we venture to utter the forbidden 
 word 
 
 theaet certainly we do 
 
 str let us be serious then and consider the question neither in 
 strife nor play suppose that one of the hearers of parmenides was 
 asked to is the term to be you know what 
 sort of object he would single out in reply and what answer he 
 would make to the enquirer 
 
 theaet that is a difficult question and one not to be answered 
 at all by a person like myself 
 
 str there is at any rate no difficulty in seeing that the 
 predicate is not applicable to any being 
 
 theaet none certainly 
 
 str and if not to being then not to something 
 
 theaet of course not 
 
 str it is also plain that in speaking of something we speak of 
 being for to speak of an abstract something naked and isolated from 
 all being is impossible 
 
 theaet impossible 
 
 str you mean by assenting to imply that he who says something 
 must say some one thing 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str some in the singular ti you would say is the sign of one 
 some in the dual tine of two some in the plural tines of many 
 
 theaet exactly 
 
 str then he who says not something must say absolutely nothing 
 theaet most assuredly 
 
 str and as we cannot admit that a man speaks and says nothing he 
 who says does not speak at all 
 
 theaet the difficulty of the argument can no further go 
 
 str not yet my friend is the time for such a word for there 
 still remains of all perplexities the first and greatest 
 touching the very foundation of the matter 
 
 theaet what do you mean do not be afraid to speak 
 
 str to that which is may be attributed some other thing which is 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str but can anything which is be attributed to that which is not 
 
 theaet impossible 
 
 str and all number is to be reckoned among things which are 
 
 theaet yes surely number if anything has a real existence 
 
 str then we must not attempt to attribute to number 
 either in the singular or plural 
 
 theaet the argument implies that we should be wrong in doing so 
 
 str but how can a man either express in words or even conceive in 
 thought things which are not or a thing which is not without number 
 
 theaet how indeed 
 
 str when we speak of things which are not attributing plurality 
 to 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str but on the other hand when we say what is not do we not 
 attribute unity 
 
 theaet manifestly 
 
 str nevertheless we maintain that you may not and ought not to 
 attribute being to 
 
 theaet most true 
 
 str do you see then that in itself can neither be 
 spoken uttered or thought but that it is unthinkable 
 unutterable unspeakable indescribable 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str but if so i was wrong in telling you just now that the 
 difficulty which was coming is the greatest of all 
 
 theaet what is there a greater still behind 
 
 str well i am surprised after what has been said already that 
 you do not see the difficulty in which he who would refute the 
 notion of is involved for he is compelled to contradict 
 himself as soon as he makes the attempt 
 
 theaet what do you mean speak more clearly 
 
 str do not expect clearness from me for i who maintain that 
 has no part either in the one or many just now 
 spoke and am still speaking of as one for i say do you understand 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and a little while ago i said that is unutterable 
 unspeakable indescribable do you follow 
 
 theaet i do after a fashion 
 
 str when i introduced the word is did i not contradict what i 
 said before 
 
 theaet clearly 
 
 str and in using the singular verb did i not speak of 
 as one 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and when i spoke of as indescribable and 
 unspeakable and unutterable in using each of these words in the 
 singular did i not refer to as one 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and yet we say that strictly speaking it should not be 
 defined as one or many and should not even be called it for the 
 use of the word it would imply a form of unity 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str how then can any one put any faith in me for now 
 as always i am unequal to the refutation of and therefore as i was saying do not look to me for the right way of speaking about but come let us try the experiment with you 
 
 theaet what do you mean 
 
 str make a noble effort as becomes youth and endeavour with all 
 your might to speak of in a right manner without 
 introducing into it either existence or unity or plurality 
 
 theaet it would be a strange boldness in me which would 
 attempt the task when i see you thus discomfited 
 
 str say no more of ourselves but until we find some one or other 
 who can speak of without number we must acknowledge that the sophist is a clever rogue who will not be got out of his hole 
 
 theaet most true 
 
 str and if we say to him that he professes an art of making 
 appearances he will grapple with us and retort our argument upon 
 ourselves and when we call him an he will say 
 pray what do you mean at all by an image and i should like to know theaetetus how we can possibly answer the question 
 
 theaet we shall doubtless tell him of the images which are 
 reflected in water or in mirrors also of sculptures pictures and 
 other duplicates 
 
 str i see theaetetus that you have never made the 
 acquaintance of the sophist 
 
 theaet why do you think so 
 
 str he will make believe to have his eyes shut or to have none 
 
 theaet what do you mean 
 
 str when you tell him of something existing in a mirror or in 
 sculpture and address him as though he had eyes he will 
 laugh you to scorn and will pretend that he knows nothing of mirrors and streams or of sight at all he will say that he is asking about an 
 idea 
 
 theaet what can he mean 
 
 str the common notion pervading all these objects which you 
 speak of as many and yet call by the single name of image as 
 though it were the unity under which they were all included how 
 will you maintain your ground against him 
 
 theaet how stranger can i describe an image except as something 
 fashioned in the likeness of the true 
 
 str and do you mean this something to be some other true thing 
 or what do you mean 
 
 theaet certainly not another true thing but only a resemblance 
 
 str and you mean by true that which really is 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and the not true is that which is the opposite of the true 
 
 theaet exactly 
 
 str a resemblance then is not really real if as you say not 
 true 
 
 theaet nay but it is in a certain sense 
 
 str you mean to say not in a true sense 
 
 theaet yes it is in reality only an image 
 
 str then what we call an image is in reality really unreal 
 
 theaet in what a strange complication of being and 
 we are involved 
 
 str strange i should think so see how by his reciprocation of 
 opposites the sophist has compelled us quite 
 against our will to admit the existence of 
 
 theaet yes indeed i see 
 
 str the difficulty is how to define his art without falling into 
 a contradiction 
 
 theaet how do you mean and where does the danger lie 
 
 str when we say that he deceives us with an illusion and that 
 his art is illusory do we mean that our soul is led by his art to 
 think falsely or what do we mean 
 
 theaet there is nothing else to be said 
 
 str again false opinion is that form of opinion which thinks the 
 opposite of the would assent 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str you mean to say that false opinion thinks what is not 
 
 theaet of course 
 
 str does false opinion think that things which are not are not 
 or that in a certain sense they are 
 
 theaet things that are not must be imagined to exist in a certain 
 sense if any degree of falsehood is to be possible 
 
 str and does not false opinion also think that things which most 
 certainly exist do not exist at all 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and here again is falsehood 
 
 theaet 
 
 str and in like manner a false proposition will be deemed to be 
 one which are the nonexistence of things which are and the 
 existence of things which are not 
 
 theaet there is no other way in which a false proposition can 
 arise 
 
 str there is not but the sophist will deny these statements and 
 indeed how can any rational man assent to them when the very 
 expressions which we have just used were before acknowledged by us to be unutterable unspeakable indescribable unthinkable 
 do you see his point theaetetus 
 
 theaet of course he will say that we are contradicting ourselves 
 when we hazard the assertion that falsehood exists in opinion and 
 in words for in maintaining this we are compelled over and over 
 again to assert being of which we admitted just now to be 
 an utter impossibility 
 
 str how well you remember and now it is high time to hold a 
 consultation as to what we ought to do about the sophist for if we 
 persist in looking for him in the class of false workers and 
 magicians you see that the handles for objection and the 
 difficulties which will arise are very numerous and obvious 
 
 theaet they are indeed 
 
 str we have gone through but a very small portion of 
 them and they are really infinite 
 
 theaet if that is the case we cannot possibly catch the sophist 
 
 str shall we then be so as to give him up 
 
 theaet certainly not i should say if we can get the slightest 
 hold upon him 
 
 str will you then forgive me and as your words imply not be 
 altogether displeased if i flinch a little from the grasp of such a 
 sturdy argument 
 
 theaet to be sure i will 
 
 str i have a yet more urgent request to make 
 
 theaet which is 
 
 str that you will promise not to regard me as a parricide 
 
 theaet and why 
 
 str because in i must test the philosophy of my 
 father parmenides and try to prove by main force that in a certain 
 sense is and that being on the other hand is not 
 
 theaet some attempt of the kind is clearly needed 
 
 str yes a blind man as they say might see that and unless 
 these questions are decided in one way or another no one when he 
 speaks false words or false opinion or idols or images or 
 imitations or appearances or about the arts which are concerned 
 with them can avoid falling into ridiculous contradictions 
 
 theaet most true 
 
 str and therefore i must venture to lay hands on my 
 argument for if i am to be i shall have to give 
 the matter up 
 
 theaet nothing in the world should ever induce us to do so 
 
 str i have a third little request which i wish to make 
 
 theaet what is it 
 
 str you heard have always felt and still 
 i have no heart for this argument 
 
 theaet i did 
 
 str i tremble at the thought of what i have said and expect that 
 you will deem me mad when you hear of my sudden changes and 
 shiftings let me therefore observe that i am examining the 
 question entirely out of regard for you 
 
 theaet there is no reason for you to fear that i shall impute any 
 impropriety to you if you attempt this refutation and proof take 
 heart therefore and proceed 
 
 str and where shall i begin the perilous enterprise i think that 
 the road which i must take is 
 
 theaet me hear 
 
 str i think that we had better first of all consider the points 
 which at present are regard as lest we may have fallen 
 into some confusion and be too ready to assent to one another 
 fancying that we are quite clear about them 
 theaet say more distinctly what you mean 
 
 str i think that parmenides and all ever yet undertook to 
 determine the number and nature of existences talked to us in 
 rather a light and easy strain 
 
 theaet how 
 
 str as if we had been children to whom they repeated each his 
 own mythus or said that there were three principles and 
 that at one time there was war between certain of them and 
 then again there was peace and they were married and begat children 
 and brought them up and another spoke of two moist and a dry or a hot and a cold and made them marry and cohabit the eleatics however in our part of the world say that things are many in name but in nature one this is their mythus which goes back to xenophanes and is even older then there are ionian and in more 
 recent times sicilian muses who have arrived at the conclusion that 
 to unite the two principles is safer and to say that being is one and 
 many and that these are held together by enmity and friendship 
 ever parting ever meeting as muses assert while the 
 gentler ones do not insist on the perpetual strife and peace but 
 admit a relaxation and alternation of them peace and unity sometimes prevailing under the sway of aphrodite and then again plurality and war by reason of a principle of strife whether any of them spoke the truth in all this is hard to determine besides antiquity and famous men should have reverence and not be liable to accusations so serious yet one thing may be said of them without offence 
 
 theaet what thing 
 
 str that they went on their several ways disdaining to notice 
 people like ourselves they did not care whether they took us with 
 them or left us behind them 
 
 theaet how do you mean 
 
 str i mean to say that when they talk of one two or more 
 elements which are or have become or are becoming or again of heat 
 mingling with cold assuming in some other part of their works 
 separations and me theaetetus do you understand 
 what they mean by these expressions when i was a younger man i 
 used to fancy that i understood quite well what was meant by the 
 term which is our present subject of dispute 
 and now you see in what a fix we are about it 
 
 theaet i see 
 
 str and very likely we have been getting into the same perplexity 
 about being and yet may fancy that when anybody utters 
 the word we understand him quite easily although we do not know about but we may be equally ignorant of both 
 
 theaet i dare say 
 
 str and the same may be said of all the terms just mentioned 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str the consideration of most of them may be deferred but we had 
 better now discuss the chief captain and leader of them 
 
 theaet of what are you speaking you clearly think that we must 
 first investigate what people mean by the word being 
 
 str you follow close at heels theaetetus for the right method 
 i conceive will be to call into our presence the dualistic 
 philosophers and to interrogate them come we will say ye who 
 affirm that hot and cold or any other two principles are the 
 universe 
 what is this term which you apply to both of them and what do you 
 mean when you say that both and each of them are how are we to 
 understand the word are upon your view are we to suppose that 
 there is a third principle over and above the other in 
 all and not two for clearly you cannot say that one of the two 
 principles is being and yet attribute being equally to both of 
 them for if you did whichever of the two is identified with 
 being will comprehend the other and so they will be one and not 
 two 
 
 theaet very true

 book 
 str but perhaps you mean to give the name of being to both of 
 them together 
 
 theaet quite likely 
 
 str then friends we shall reply to them the answer 
 is plainly that the two will still be resolved into one 
 
 theaet most true 
 
 str since then we are in a difficulty please to tell 
 us what you mean when you speak of being for there can be no doubt that you always from the first understood your own meaning whereas we once thought that we understood you but now we are in a great strait please to begin by explaining this matter to us and let us no longer fancy that we understand you when we entirely misunderstand you there will be no impropriety in our demanding an answer to this question either of the dualists or of the pluralists 
 
 theaet certainly not 
 
 str and what about the assertors of the oneness of the 
 we not endeavour to ascertain from them what they mean by being 
 
 theaet by all means 
 
 str then let them answer this question one you say alone is 
 yes they will reply 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and there is something which you call being 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and is being the same as one and do you apply two 
 names to the same thing 
 
 theaet what will be their answer stranger 
 
 str it is clear theaetetus that he who asserts the 
 unity of being will find a difficulty in answering this or any other question 
 
 theaet why so 
 
 str to admit of two names and to affirm that there is nothing 
 but unity is surely ridiculous 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and equally irrational to admit that a name is anything 
 
 theaet how so 
 
 str to distinguish the name from the thing implies duality 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and yet he who identifies the name with the thing will be 
 compelled to say that it is the name of nothing or if he 
 says that it is the name of something even then the name will only be the name of a name and of nothing else 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and the one will turn out to be only one of one and being 
 absolute unity will represent a mere name 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and would they say that the whole is other than the one that 
 is or the same with it 
 
 theaet to be sure they would and they actually say so 
 
 str if being is a whole as parmenides sings 
 every way like unto the fullness of a sphere 
 evenly balanced from the centre on every side 
 and must needs be neither greater nor less in any way 
 neither on this side nor on that 
 then being has a centre and extremes and having these must also 
 have parts 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str yet that which has parts may have the attribute of 
 unity in all the parts and in this way being all and a whole may be one 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str but that of which this is the condition cannot be absolute 
 unity 
 
 theaet why not 
 
 str because according to right reason that which is truly one 
 must be affirmed to be absolutely indivisible 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str but this indivisible if made up of many parts will 
 contradict reason 
 
 theaet i understand 
 
 str shall we say that being is one and a whole because it has 
 the attribute of unity or shall we say that being is not a whole at 
 all 
 
 theaet that is a hard alternative to offer 
 
 str most true for being having in a certain sense the attribute 
 of one is yet proved not to be the same as one and the all is 
 therefore more than one 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and yet if being be not a whole through having the attribute 
 of unity and there be such a thing as an absolute whole being 
 lacks something of its own nature 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str upon this view again being having a defect of being will 
 become 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and again the all becomes more than one for being and the 
 whole will each have their separate nature 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str but if the whole does not exist at all all the previous 
 difficulties remain the same and there will be the further 
 difficulty that besides having no being being can never have come 
 into being 
 
 theaet why so 
 
 str because that which comes into being always comes into being 
 as a whole so that he who does not give whole a place among beings cannot speak either of essence or generation as existing 
 
 theaet yes that certainly appears to be true 
 
 str again how can that which is not a whole have any 
 quantity for that which is of a certain quantity must necessarily be the whole of that quantity 
 
 theaet exactly 
 
 str and there will be innumerable other points each of them 
 causing infinite trouble to him who says that being is either one 
 or two 
 
 theaet the difficulties which are dawning upon us prove this for 
 one objection connects with another and they are always involving 
 what has preceded in a greater and worse perplexity 
 
 str we are far from having exhausted the more exact thinkers who 
 treat of being and but let us be content to leave 
 them and proceed to view those who speak less precisely and we shall find as the result of all that the nature of being is quite as difficult to comprehend as that of 
 
 theaet then now we will go to the others 
 
 str there appears to be a sort of war of giants and gods going on 
 amongst them they are fighting with one another about the nature of 
 essence 
 
 theaet how is that 
 
 str some of them are dragging down all things from heaven and 
 from the unseen to earth and they literally grasp in their hands 
 rocks and oaks of these they lay hold and obstinately 
 maintain that the things only which can be touched or handled have being or essence because they define being and body as one and if any one else says that what is not a body exists they altogether despise him and will hear of nothing but body 
 
 theaet i have often met with such men and terrible fellows they 
 are 
 
 str and that is the reason why their opponents cautiously defend 
 themselves from above out of an unseen world mightily contending 
 that true essence consists of certain intelligible and incorporeal 
 ideas the bodies of the materialists which by them are 
 maintained to be the very truth they break up into little bits by their 
 arguments and affirm them to be not essence but generation and 
 motion between the two armies theaetetus there is always 
 an endless conflict raging concerning these matters 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str let us ask each party in turn to give an account of 
 that which they call essence 
 
 theaet how shall we get it out of them 
 
 str with those who make being to consist in ideas there will be 
 less difficulty for they are civil people enough but there will be 
 very great difficulty or rather an absolute impossibility 
 in getting an opinion out of those who drag everything down to matter shall i tell you what we must do 
 
 theaet what 
 
 str let us if we can really improve them but if this is not 
 possible let us imagine them to be better than they are and more 
 willing to answer in accordance with the rules of argument and then 
 their opinion will be more worth having for that which better men 
 acknowledge has more weight than that which is acknowledged by 
 inferior men moreover we are no respecters of persons but seekers 
 after time 
 
 theaet very good 
 
 str then now on the supposition that they are improved 
 let us ask them to state their views and do you interpret them 
 
 theaet agreed 
 
 str let them say whether they would admit that there is such a 
 thing as a mortal animal 
 
 theaet of course they would 
 
 str and do they not acknowledge this to be a body having a soul 
 
 theaet certainly they do 
 
 str meaning to say the soul is something which exists 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and do they not say that one soul is just and another 
 unjust and that one soul is wise and another foolish 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and that the just and wise soul becomes just and wise by the 
 possession of justice and wisdom and the opposite under opposite 
 circumstances 
 
 theaet yes they do 
 
 str but surely that which may be present or may be absent will be 
 admitted by them to exist 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and allowing that justice wisdom the other virtues and 
 their opposites exist as well as a soul in which they inhere do they 
 affirm any of them to be visible and tangible or are they all 
 invisible 
 
 theaet they would say that hardly any of them are visible 
 
 str and would they say that they are corporeal 
 
 theaet they would distinguish the soul would be said by them to 
 have a body but as to the other qualities of justice 
 wisdom and the like about which you asked they would not venture either to deny their existence or to maintain that they were all corporeal 
 
 str verily theaetetus i perceive a great improvement in 
 them the real aborigines children of the teeth would have been deterred by no shame at all but would have obstinately asserted 
 that nothing is which they are not able to squeeze in their hands 
 
 theaet that is pretty much their notion 
 
 str let us push the question for if they will admit that 
 any even the smallest particle of being is incorporeal it is enough they must then say what that nature is which is common to both the 
 corporeal and incorporeal and which they have in their eye 
 when they say of both of them that they are perhaps they may be 
 in a difficulty and if this is the case there is a possibility 
 that they may accept a notion of ours respecting the nature of 
 being having nothing of their own to offer 
 
 theaet what is the notion tell me and we shall soon see 
 str my notion would be that anything which possesses any sort of 
 power to affect another or to be affected by another if only for a 
 single moment however trifling the cause and however slight the 
 effect has real existence and i hold that the definition 
 of being is simply power of theaet they accept your suggestion having nothing better of their own to offer 
 
 str very good perhaps we as well as they may one day change 
 our minds but for the present this may be regarded as the 
 understanding which is established with them 
 
 theaet agreed 
 
 str let us now go to the friends of ideas of their opinions 
 too you shall be the interpreter 
 
 theaet i will 
 
 str to them we would distinguish essence from generation 
 
 theaet yes they reply 
 
 str and you would allow that we participate in 
 generation with the body and through perception but we participate with the soul through in true essence and essence you would affirm to be always the same and immutable whereas generation or becoming varies 
 
 theaet yes that is what we should affirm 
 
 str well fair sirs we say to them what is this participation 
 which you assert of both do you agree with our recent definition 
 
 theaet what definition 
 
 str we said that being was an active or passive energy 
 arising out of a certain power which proceeds from elements meeting with one another perhaps your cars theaetetus may fail to catch their answer which i recognize because i have been accustomed to hear it 
 
 theaet and what is their answer 
 
 str they deny the truth of what we were just now saying to the 
 aborigines about existence 
 
 theaet what was that 
 
 str any power of doing or suffering in a degree however slight 
 was held by us to be a sufficient definition of being 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str they deny this and say that the power of doing or 
 suffering is confined to becoming and that neither power is applicable to being 
 
 theaet and is there not some truth in what they say 
 
 str yes but our reply will be that we want to ascertain from 
 them more distinctly whether they further admit that the soul 
 knows and that being or essence is known 
 
 theaet there can be no doubt that they say so 
 
 str and is knowing and being known doing or suffering 
 or both or is the one doing and the other suffering or has neither any share in either 
 
 theaet clearly neither has any share in either for if they say 
 anything else they will contradict themselves 
 
 str i understand but they will allow that if to know is active 
 then of course to be known is passive and on this view 
 being in so far as it is known is acted upon by knowledge and is therefore in motion for that which is in a state of rest cannot be acted upon as we affirm 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and o heavens can we ever be made to believe that motion 
 and life and soul and mind are not present with perfect being can 
 we imagine that being is devoid of life and mind and 
 exists in awful unmeaningness an everlasting fixture 
 
 theaet that would be a dreadful thing to admit stranger 
 
 str but shall we say that has mind and not life 
 
 theaet how is that possible 
 
 str or shall we say that both inhere in perfect being but that 
 it has no soul which contains them 
 
 theaet and in what other way can it contain them 
 
 str or that being has mind and life and soul but although 
 endowed with soul remains absolutely unmoved 
 
 theaet all three suppositions appear to me to be irrational 
 
 str under being then we must include motion and that which is 
 moved 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str then theaetetus our inference is that if there is 
 no motion neither is there any mind anywhere or about anything or belonging to any one 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str and yet this equally follows if we grant that all things are 
 in this view too mind has no existence 
 
 theaet how so 
 
 str do you think that sameness of condition and mode and subject 
 could ever exist without a principle of rest 
 
 theaet certainly not 
 
 str can you see how without them mind could exist or come into 
 existence anywhere 
 
 theaet no 
 
 str and surely contend we must in every possible way against him 
 who would annihilate knowledge and reason and mind and yet ventures to speak confidently about anything 
 
 theaet yes with all our might 
 
 str then the philosopher who has the truest reverence for these 
 qualities cannot possibly accept the notion of those who 
 say that the whole is at rest either as unity or in many forms and he will be utterly deaf to those who assert universal motion as children say entreatingly give us both so he will include both the moveable 
 and immoveable in his definition of being and all 
 
 theaet most true 
 
 str and now do we seem to have gained a fair notion of being 
 
 theaet yes truly 
 
 str alas theaetetus methinks that we are now only beginning to 
 see the real difficulty of the enquiry into the nature of it 
 
 theaet what do you mean 
 
 str o my friend do you not see that nothing can exceed out 
 ignorance and yet we fancy that we are saying something good 
 
 theaet i certainly thought that we were and i do not at all 
 understand how we never found out our desperate case 
 
 str reflect after having made these admissions may we not be 
 justly asked the same questions which we ourselves were asking of 
 those who said that all was hot and cold 
 
 theaet what were they will you recall them to my mind 
 
 str to be sure i will remind you of them by putting the same 
 questions to you which i did to them and then we shall get on 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str would you not say that rest and motion are in the most entire 
 opposition to one another 
 
 theaet of course 
 
 str and yet you would say that both and either of them 
 equally are 
 
 theaet i should 
 
 str and when you admit that both or either of them are 
 do you mean to say that both or either of them are in motion 
 
 theaet certainly not 
 
 str or do you wish to imply that they are both at rest when you 
 say that they are 
 
 theaet of course not 
 
 str then you conceive of being as some third and distinct nature 
 under which rest and motion are alike included and observing that 
 they both participate in being you declare that they are 
 
 theaet truly we seem to have an intimation that being is 
 some third thing when we say that rest and motion are 
 
 str then being is not the combination of rest and motion but 
 something different from them 
 
 theaet so it would appear 
 
 str being then according to its own nature is neither in 
 motion nor at rest 
 
 theaet that is very much the truth 
 
 str where then is a man to look for help who would have 
 any clear or fixed notion of being in his mind 
 
 theaet where indeed 
 
 str i scarcely think that he can look anywhere for that which is 
 not in motion must be at rest and again that which is not at rest 
 must be in motion but being is placed outside of both these 
 classes is this possible 
 
 theaet utterly impossible 
 
 str here then is another thing which we ought to bear in mind 
 
 theaet what 
 
 str when we were asked to what we were to assign the 
 appellation of we were in the greatest you remember 
 
 theaet to be sure 
 
 str and are we not now in as a difficulty about being 
 
 theaes i should say stranger that we are in one which is if 
 possible even greater 
 
 str then let us acknowledge the difficulty and as being and 
 are involved in the same perplexity there is hope 
 that when the one appears more or less distinctly the other will equally appear and if we are able to see neither there may still be a 
 chance of steering our way in between them without any great 
 discredit 
 theaet very good 
 
 str let us enquire then how we come to predicate many names of 
 the same thing 
 
 theaet give an example 
 
 str i mean that we speak of man for example under many 
 we attribute to him colours and forms and magnitudes and virtues and vices in all of which instances and in ten thousand others we not only speak of him as a man but also as good and having other attributes and in the same way anything else which we originally supposed to be one is described by us as many and under many names 
 
 theaet that is true 
 
 str and thus we provide a rich feast for tyros whether young or 
 old for there is nothing easier than to argue that the one cannot 
 be many or the many one and great is their delight in 
 denying that a man is good for man they insist is man and good is good i dare say that you have met with persons who interest in such are often elderly men whose meagre sense is thrown into amazement by these discoveries of theirs which they believe to be the height of wisdom 
 
 theaet certainly i have 
 
 str then not to exclude any one who has ever speculated at all 
 upon the nature of being let us put our questions to them as well 
 as to our former friends 
 
 theaet what questions 
 
 str shall we refuse to attribute being to motion and rest or 
 anything to anything and assume that they do not mingle and are 
 incapable of participating in one another or shall we 
 gather all into one class of things communicable with one another or are some things communicable and others of these alternatives 
 
 theaetetus will they prefer 
 
 theaet i have nothing to answer on their behalf suppose that you 
 take all these hypotheses in turn and see what are the consequences 
 which follow from each of them 
 
 str very good and first let us assume them to say that nothing 
 is capable of participating in anything else in any respect in that 
 case rest and motion cannot participate in being at all 
 
 theaet they cannot 
 
 str but would either of them be if not participating in being 
 
 theaet no 
 
 str then by this admission everything is instantly overturned as 
 well the doctrine of universal motion as of universal rest and also 
 the doctrine of those who distribute being into immutable and 
 everlasting kinds for all these add on a notion of being some 
 affirming that things are truly in motion and others that they 
 are truly at rest 
 
 theaes just so 
 
 str again those who would at one time compound and at another 
 resolve all things whether making them into one and out of one 
 creating infinity or dividing them into finite clements and 
 forming compounds out of these whether they suppose the processes of creation to be successive or continuous would be talking nonsense in all this if there were no admixture 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str most ridiculous of all will the men themselves be who want to 
 carry out the argument and yet forbid us to call anything because 
 participating in some affection from another by the name of that 
 other 
 
 theaet why so 
 
 str why because they are compelled to use the words to be 
 apart from others in itself and ten thousand more which 
 they cannot give up but must make the connecting links of 
 discourse and therefore they do not require to be refuted by 
 others but their enemy as the saying is inhabits the same house 
 with them they are always carrying about with them an 
 adversary like the wonderful ventriloquist eurycles who out of their own bellies audibly contradicts them 
 
 theaet precisely so a very true and exact illustration 
 
 str and now if we suppose that all things have the power of 
 communion with one another what will follow 
 
 theaet even i can solve that riddle 
 
 str how 
 
 theaet why because motion itself would be at rest and rest 
 again in motion if they could be attributed to one another 
 
 str but this is utterly impossible 
 
 theaet of course 
 
 str then only the third hypothesis remains 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str for surely either all things have communion with all or 
 nothing with any other thing or some things communicate with some 
 things and others not 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and two out of these three suppositions have been found to be 
 impossible 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str every one then who desires to answer truly will adopt the 
 third and remaining hypothesis of the communion of some with some 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str this communion of some with some may be illustrated 
 by the caseof letters for some letters do not fit each other while others do 
 
 theaet of course 
 
 str and the vowels especially are a sort of bond which pervades 
 all the other letters so that without a vowel one consonant 
 cannot be joined to another 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str but does every one know what letters will unite with what or 
 is art required in order to do so 
 
 theaet what is required 
 
 str what art 
 
 theaet the art of grammar 
 
 str and is not this also true of sounds high and 
 not he who has the art to know what sounds mingle a musician and he who is ignorant not a musician 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and we shall find this to be generally true of art or the 
 absence of art 
 
 theaet of course 
 
 str and as classes are admitted by us in like manner to be some 
 of them capable and others incapable of intermixture must not he 
 who would rightly show what kinds will unite and what will not 
 proceed by the help of science in the path of argument and will he 
 not ask if the connecting links are universal and so capable of 
 intermixture with all things and again in divisions whether there 
 are not other universal classes which make them possible 
 
 theaet to be sure he will require science and if i am not 
 mistaken the very greatest of all sciences 
 
 str how are we to call it by zeus have we not lighted 
 unwittingly upon our free and noble science and in looking for the sophist have we not entertained the philosopher unawares 
 
 theaet what do you mean 
 
 str should we not say that the division according to 
 classes which neither makes the same other nor makes other the same is the business of the dialectical science 
 
 theaet that is what we should say 
 
 str then surely he who can divide rightly is able to see 
 clearly one form pervading a scattered multitude and many different 
 forms contained under one higher form and again one form knit 
 together into a single whole and pervading many such wholes and 
 many forms existing only in separation and isolation this is the 
 knowledge of classes which determines where they can have communion with one another and where not 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str and the art of dialectic would be attributed by you 
 only to the philosopher pure and true 
 
 theaet who but he can be worthy 
 
 str in this region we shall always discover the philosopher if 
 we look for him like the sophist he is not easily discovered but 
 for a different reason 
 
 theaet for what reason 
 
 str because the sophist runs away into the darkness of 
 in which he has learned by habit to feel about and cannot be 
 discovered because of the darkness of the place is not that true 
 
 theaet it seems to be so 
 
 str and the philosopher always holding converse through reason 
 with the idea of being is also dark from excess of light for the 
 souls of the many have no eye which can endure the vision of the 
 divine 
 
 theaet yes that seems to be quite as true as the other 
 
 str well the philosopher may hereafter be more fully 
 considered by us if we are disposed but the sophist must clearly not be allowed to escape until we have had a good look at him 
 
 theaet very good 
 
 str since then we are agreed that some classes have a communion 
 with one another and others not and some have communion with a few and others with many and that there is no reason why some should not have universal communion with all let us now pursue the 
 enquiry as the argument suggests not in relation to all ideas 
 lest the multitude of them should confuse us but let us select a 
 few of those which are reckoned to be the principal ones 
 and consider their several natures and their capacity of communion with one another in order that if we are not able to apprehend with perfect clearness the notions of being and we may at 
 least not fall short in the consideration of them so far as they come within the scope of the present enquiry if peradventure we may be allowed to assert the reality of and yet escape unscathed 
 
 theaet we must do so 
 
 str the most important of all the genera are those which we were 
 just now and rest and motion 
 
 theaet yes by far 
 
 str and two of these are as we affirm incapable of 
 communion with one another 
 
 theaet quite incapable 
 
 str whereas being surely has communion with both of them for 
 both of them are 
 
 theaet of course 
 
 str that makes up three of them 
 
 theaet to be sure 
 
 str and each of them is other than the remaining two but the 
 same with itself 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str but then what is the meaning of these two words same and 
 other are they two new kinds other than the three and yet always 
 of necessity intermingling with them and are we to have five kinds 
 instead of three or when we speak of the same and other are we 
 unconsciously speaking of one of the three first kinds 
 
 theaet very likely we are 
 
 str but surely motion and rest are neither the other nor the 
 same 
 
 theaet how is that 
 
 str whatever we attribute to motion and rest in common cannot be 
 either of them 
 
 theaet why not 
 
 str because motion would be at rest and rest in motion for 
 either of them being predicated of both will compel the other to 
 change into the opposite of its own nature because partaking of its 
 opposite 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str yet they surely both partake of the same and of the other 
 theaet yes 
 
 str then we must not assert that motion any more than rest is 
 either the same or the other 
 
 theaet no we must not 
 
 str but are we to conceive that being and the same are identical 
 
 theaet possibly 
 
 str but if they are identical then again in saying that 
 motion and rest have being we should also be saying that they are the same 
 
 theaet which surely cannot be 
 
 str then being and same cannot be one 
 
 theaet scarcely 
 
 str then we may suppose the same to be a fourth class 
 which is now to be added to the three others 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str and shall we call the other a fifth class or should we 
 consider being and other to be two names of the same class 
 
 theaet very likely 
 
 str but you would agree if i am not mistaken that existences 
 are relative as well as absolute 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and the other is always relative to other 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str but this would not be the case unless being and the other 
 entirely differed for if the other like being were absolute as 
 well as relative then there would have been a kind of other 
 which was not other than other and now we find that what is other must of necessity be what it is in relation to some other 
 
 theaet that is the true state of the case 
 
 str then we must admit the other as the fifth of our selected 
 classes 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and the fifth class pervades all classes for they all differ 
 from one another not by reason of their own nature but because 
 they partake of the idea of the other 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str then let us now put the case with reference to each of the 
 five 
 
 theaet how 
 
 str first there is motion which we affirm to be 
 absolutely rest what else can we say 
 
 theaet it is so 
 
 str and therefore is not rest 
 
 theaet certainly not 
 
 str and yet is because partaking of being 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str again motion is other than the same 
 
 theaet just so 
 
 str and is therefore not the same 
 
 theaet it is not 
 
 str yet surely motion is the same because all things partake 
 of the same 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str then we must admit and not object to say that motion is the 
 same and is not the same for we do not apply the terms same and 
 not the same in the same sense but we call it the same in 
 relation to itself because partaking of the same and not the same 
 because having communion with the other it is thereby severed from 
 the same and has become not that but other and is therefore 
 rightly spoken of as not the same 
 
 theaet to be sure 
 
 str and if absolute motion in any point of view partook of rest 
 there would be no absurdity in calling motion stationary 
 
 theaet quite right that is on the supposition that some 
 classes mingle with one another and others not 
 
 str that such a communion of kinds is according to nature we had 
 already proved before we arrived at this part of our discussion 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str let us proceed then we not say that motion is other than 
 the other having been also proved by us to be other than 
 the same and other than rest 
 
 theaet that is certain 
 
 str then according to this view motion is other and also not 
 other 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str what is the next step shall we say that motion is other than 
 the three and not other than the we agreed that there are 
 five classes about and in the sphere of which we proposed to make 
 enquiry 
 
 theaet surely we cannot admit that the number is less than it 
 appeared to be just now 
 
 str then we may without fear contend that motion is other than 
 being 
 
 theaet without the least fear 
 
 str the plain result is that motion since it partakes of being 
 really is and also is not 
 
 theaet nothing can be plainer 
 
 str then necessarily exists in the case of motion and 
 of every class for the nature of the other entering into them all 
 makes each of them other than being and so and 
 therefore of all of them in like manner we may truly say that they 
 are again inasmuch as they partake of being that they are 
 and are existent 
 
 theaet so we may assume 
 
 str every class then has plurality of being and infinity of 
 
 
 theaet so we must infer 
 
 str and being itself may be said to be other than the other kinds 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str then we may infer that being is not in respect of as many 
 other things as there are for these it is itself one and 
 is not the other things which are infinite in number 
 
 theaet that is not far from the truth 
 
 str and we must not quarrel with this result since it is of the 
 nature of classes to have communion with one another and if any one 
 denies our present statement viz that being is not etc let 
 him first argue with our former conclusion respecting the 
 communion of ideas and then he may proceed to argue with what 
 follows 
 
 theaet nothing can be fairer 
 
 str let me ask you to consider a further question 
 
 theaet what question 
 
 str when we speak of we speak i suppose not of 
 something opposed to being but only different 
 
 theaet what do you mean 
 
 str when we speak of something as not great does the expression 
 seem to you to imply what is little any more than what is equal 
 
 theaet certainly not 
 
 str the negative particles ou and me when prefixed to words do 
 not imply opposition but only difference from the words or more 
 correctly from the things represented by the words which 
 follow them 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str there is another point to be considered if you do not object 
 
 theaet what is it 
 
 str the nature of the other appears to me to be divided into 
 fractions like knowledge 
 
 theaet how so 
 
 str knowledge like the other is one and yet the 
 various parts of knowledge have each of them their own particular name and hence there are many arts and kinds of knowledge 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str and is not the case the same with the parts of the 
 other which is also one 
 
 theaet very likely but will you tell me how 
 
 str there is some part of the other which is opposed to the 
 beautiful 
 
 theaet there is 
 
 str shall we say that this has or has not a name 
 
 theaet it has for whatever we call not beautiful is 
 other than the beautiful not than something else 
 
 str and now tell me another thing 
 
 theaet what 
 
 str is the anything but existence parted 
 off from a certain kind of existence and again from another point 
 of view opposed to an existing something 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str then the turns out to be the opposition of 
 being to being 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str but upon this view is the beautiful a more real and the 
 a less real existence 
 
 theaet not at all 
 
 str and the may be said to exist equally with 
 the great 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and in the same way the just must be placed in the same 
 category with the the one cannot be said to have any more 
 existence than the other 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str the same may be said of other things seeing that the 
 nature of the other has a real existence the parts of this nature must 
 equally be supposed to exist 
 
 theaet of course 
 
 str then as would appear the opposition of a part of the other 
 and of a part of being to one another is if i may venture to say 
 so as truly essence as being itself and implies not the opposite 
 of being but only what is other than being 
 
 theaet beyond question 
 
 str what then shall we call it 
 
 theaet clearly and this is the very nature for which 
 the sophist compelled us to search 
 
 str and has not this as you were saying as real an existence as 
 any other class may i not say with confidence that has an 
 assured existence and a nature of its own just as the great was 
 found to be great and the beautiful beautiful and the 
 and the in the same manner 
 has been found to be and is and is to 
 be reckoned one among the many classes of being do you theaetetus still feel any doubt of this 
 
 theaet none whatever 
 
 str do you observe that our scepticism has carried us beyond the 
 range of parmenides prohibition 
 
 theaet in what 
 
 str we have advanced to a further point and shown him 
 more than he for bad us to investigate 
 
 theaet how is that 
 
 str why because he never is and do thou keep thy thoughts from this way of enquiry 
 theaet yes he says so 
 
 str whereas we have not only proved that things which 
 are not are but we have shown what form of being is for we have shown that the nature of the other is and is distributed over all things in their relations to one another and whatever part of the other is contrasted with being this is precisely what we have 
 ventured to call 
 
 theaet and surely stranger we were quite right 
 
 str let not any one say then that while affirming the 
 opposition of to being we still assert the being of 
 for as to whether there is an opposite of being to that 
 enquiry we have long said may or may not be and may or may not be capable of definition but as touching our present 
 account of let a man either convince us of error or so 
 long as he cannot he too must say as we are saying that there is 
 a communion of classes and that being and difference or other 
 traverse all things and mutually interpenetrate so that the other 
 partakes of being and by reason of this participation is and yet 
 is not that of which it partakes but other and being other than 
 being it is clearly a necessity that should be again 
 being through partaking of the other becomes a class other than 
 the remaining classes and being other than all of them is not each 
 one of them and is not all the rest so that undoubtedly there are 
 thousands upon thousands of cases in which being is not and 
 all other things whether regarded individually or collectively in many 
 respects are and in many respects are not 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and he who is sceptical of this contradiction must think how 
 he can find something better to say or if he sees a puzzle and 
 his pleasure is to drag words this way and that the argument will 
 prove to him that he is not making a worthy use of his 
 faculties for there is no charm in such puzzles and there is no difficulty in detecting them but we can tell him of something else the pursuit of which is noble and also difficult 
 
 theaet what is it 
 
 str a thing of which i have already alone these 
 puzzles as involving no difficulty he should be able to follow and 
 criticize in detail every argument and when a man says that the 
 same is in a manner other or that other is the same to understand 
 and refute him from his own point of view and in the same respect 
 in which he asserts either of these affections but to show that 
 somehow and in some sense the same is other or the other 
 same or the great small or the like unlike and to delight in always bringing forward such contradictions is no real refutation but is 
 clearly the babe of some one who is only beginning to approach the problem of being 
 
 theaet to be sure 
 
 str for certainly my friend the attempt to separate all 
 existences from one another is a barbarism and utterly unworthy of 
 an educated or philosophical mind 
 
 theaet why so 
 
 str the attempt at universal separation is the final annihilation 
 of all reasoning for only by the union of conceptions with one 
 another do we attain to discourse of reason 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and observe that we were only just in time in making a 
 resistance to such separatists and compelling them to admit that 
 one thing mingles with another 
 
 theaet why so 
 
 str why that we might be able to assert discourse to be a kind 
 of being for if we could not the worst of all consequences would 
 follow we should have no philosophy moreover the necessity for 
 determining the nature of discourse presses upon us at this 
 moment if utterly deprived of it we could no more hold discourse and deprived of it we should be if we admitted that there was no 
 admixture of natures at all 
 
 theaet very true but i do not understand why at this moment we 
 must determine the nature of discourse 
 
 str perhaps you will see more clearly by the help of the 
 following explanation 
 
 theaet what explanation 
 
 str has been acknowledged by us to be one among many 
 classes diffused over all being 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and thence arises the question whether mingles 
 with opinion and language 
 
 theaet how so 
 
 str if has no part in the proposition then all things 
 must be true but if has a part then false opinion and 
 false speech are possible for think or to say what is 
 falsehood which thus arises in the region of thought and in speech 
 
 theaet that is quite true 
 
 str and where there is falsehood surely there must be deceit 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and if there is deceit then all things must be full of idols 
 and images and fancies 
 
 theaet to be sure 
 
 str into that region the sophist as we said made his 
 escape and when he had got there denied the very possibility of falsehood no one he argued either conceived or uttered falsehood inasmuch as did not in any way partake of being 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and now has been shown to partake of being and 
 therefore he will not continue fighting in this direction 
 but he will probably say that some ideas partake of and some not and that language and opinion are of the class and he will still fight to the death against the existence of the 
 and phantastic art in which we have placed 
 him he will say opinion and language do not partake of and unless this participation exists there can be no such thing as falsehood and with the view of meeting this evasion we must begin by enquiring into the nature of language opinion and 
 imagination in order that when we find them we may find also that they have communion with and having made out the connection of them may thus prove that falsehood exists and therein we will imprison the sophist if he deserves it or if not we will let him go again and look for him in another class 
 
 theaet certainly stranger there appears to be truth in what was 
 said about the sophist at first that he was of a class not easily 
 caught for he seems to have abundance of defences which he throws up and which must every one of them be stormed before we can reach the man himself and even now we have with difficulty got 
 through his first defence which is the of and lo here is another for we have still to show that falsehood exists in 
 the sphere of language and opinion and there will be another and 
 another line of defence without end 
 
 str any one theaetetus who is able to advance even a 
 little ought to be of good cheer for what would he who is dispirited at a little progress do if he were making none at all or even undergoing a repulse such a faint heart as the proverb says will never take a city but now that we have succeeded thus far the citadel is ours and what remains is easier 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str then as i was saying let us first of all obtain a 
 conception of language and opinion in order that we may have 
 clearer grounds for determining whether has any concern 
 with them or whether they are both always true and neither of them 
 ever false 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str then now let us speak of names as before we were 
 speaking of ideas and letters for that is the direction in which the answer may be expected 
 
 theaet and what is the question at issue about names 
 
 str the question at issue is whether all names may be connected 
 with one another or none or only some of them 
 
 theaet clearly the last is true 
 
 str i understand you to say that words which have a 
 meaning when in sequence may be connected but that words which have no meaning when in sequence cannot be connected 
 
 theaet what are you saying 
 
 str what i thought that you intended when you gave your 
 assent for there are two sorts of intimation of being which are given by the voice 
 
 theaet what are they 
 
 str one of them is called nouns and the other verbs 
 
 theaet describe them 
 
 str that which denotes action we call a verb 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and the other which is an articulate mark set on those who 
 do the actions we call a noun 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str a succession of nouns only is not a sentence any more than of 
 verbs without nouns 
 
 theaet i do not understand you 
 
 str i see that when you gave your assent you had something else 
 in your mind but what i intended to say was that a mere succession 
 of nouns or of verbs is not discourse 
 
 theaet what do you mean 
 
 str i mean that words like walks runs sleeps or any 
 other words which denote action however many of them you string 
 together do not make discourse 
 
 theaet how can they 
 
 str or again when you say lion stag horse or any other 
 words which denote agents neither in this way of stringing words 
 together do you attain to discourse for there is no expression of 
 action or inaction or of the existence of existence or 
 indicated by the sounds until verbs are mingled with 
 nouns then the words fit and the smallest combination of them 
 forms language and is the simplest and least form of discourse 
 
 theaet again i ask what do you mean 
 
 str when any one says a man learns should you not call this 
 the simplest and least of sentences 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str yes for he now arrives at the point of giving an intimation 
 about something which is or is becoming or has become or will be 
 and he not only names but he does something by connecting 
 verbs with nouns and therefore we say that he discourses and to this 
 connection of words we give the name of discourse 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and as there are some things which fit one another and other 
 things which do not fit so there are some vocal signs which do and 
 others which do not combine and form discourse 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str there is another small matter 
 
 theaet what is it 
 
 str a sentence must and cannot help having a subject 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and must be of a certain quality 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and now let us mind what we are about 
 
 theaet we must do so 
 
 str i will repeat a sentence to you in which a thing and an 
 action are combined by the help of a noun and a verb and you shall 
 tell me of whom the sentence speaks 
 
 theaet i will to the best my power 
 
 str theaetetus a very long sentence 
 
 theaet not very 
 
 str of whom does the sentence speak and who is the 
 subject that is what you have to tell 
 
 theaet of me i am the subject 
 
 str or this sentence again 
 
 theaet what sentence 
 
 str theaetetus with whom i am now speaking is flying 
 
 theaet that also is a sentence which will be admitted by every 
 one to speak of me and to apply to me 
 
 str we agreed that every sentence must necessarily have a certain 
 quality 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and what is the quality of each of these two sentences 
 
 theaet the one as i imagine is false and the other true 
 
 str the true says what is true about you 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and the false says what is other than true 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and therefore speaks of things which are not as if they were 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and say that things are real of you which are not for as we 
 were saying in regard to each thing or person there is much that 
 is and much that is not 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str the second of the two sentences which related to you was 
 first of all an example of the shortest form consistent with our 
 definition 
 
 theaet yes this was implied in recent admission 
 
 str and in the second place it related to a subject 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str who must be you and can be nobody else 
 theaet unquestionably 
 
 str and it would be no sentence at all if there were no subject 
 for as we proved a sentence which has no subject is impossible 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str when other then is asserted of you as the same and 
 as being such a combination of nouns and verbs is really and truly false discourse 
 
 theaet most true 
 
 str and therefore thought opinion and imagination are now 
 proved to exist in our minds both as true and false 
 
 theaet how so 
 
 str you will know better if you first gain a knowledge of 
 what they are and in what they severally differ from one another 
 theaet give me the knowledge which you would wish me to gain 
 str are not thought and speech the same with this exception 
 that what is called thought is the unuttered conversation of the 
 soul with herself 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str but the stream of thought which flows through the lips and is 
 audible is called speech 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and we know that there exists in speech 
 
 theaet what exists 
 
 str affirmation 
 
 theaet yes we know it 
 
 str when the affirmation or denial takes place in silence and in 
 the mind only have you any other name by which to call it but 
 opinion 
 
 theaet there can be no other name 
 
 str and when opinion is presented not simply but in some form 
 of sense would you not call it imagination 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and seeing that language is true and false and that 
 thought is the conversation of the soul with herself and opinion is the end of thinking and imagination or phantasy is the union of sense and 
 opinion the inference is that some of them since they are akin to 
 language should have an element of falsehood as well as of truth 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str do you perceive then that false opinion and speech have 
 been discovered sooner than we just now we seemed to be undertaking a task which would never be accomplished 
 
 theaet i perceive 
 
 str then let us not be discouraged about the future but 
 now having made this discovery let us go back to our previous classification 
 theaet what classification 
 
 str we divided into two sorts the one 
 the other imaginative or phantastic 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and we said that we were uncertain in which we should 
 place the sophist 
 
 theaet we did say so 
 
 str and our heads began to go round more and more when it was 
 asserted that there is no such thing as an image or idol or 
 appearance because in no manner or time or place can there ever be 
 such a thing as falsehood 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and now since there has been shown to be false speech and 
 false opinion there may be imitations of real existences and out 
 of this condition of the mind an art of deception may arise 
 
 theaet quite possible 
 
 str and we have already admitted in what preceded that the 
 sophist was lurking in one of the divisions of the 
 art 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str let us then renew the attempt and in dividing any class 
 always take the part to the right holding fast to that which holds 
 the sophist until we have stripped him of all his common 
 properties and reached his difference or peculiar then we may 
 exhibit him in his true nature first to ourselves and then 
 to kindred dialectical spirits 
 
 theaet very good 
 
 str you may remember that all art was originally divided 
 by us into creative and acquisitive 
 
 theaet yes 
 str and the sophist was flitting before us in the acquisitiveclass in the subdivisions of hunting contests merchandise and the like 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str but now that the imitative art has enclosed him it is clear 
 that we must begin by dividing the art of creation for 
 imitation is a kind of creation of images however as we affirm and not of real things 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str in the first place there are two kinds of creation 
 
 theaet what are they 
 
 str one of them is human and the other divine 
 
 theaet i do not follow 
 
 str every power as you may remember our saying originally which 
 causes things to exist not previously existing was defined by us 
 as creative 
 
 theaet i remember 
 
 str looking now at the world and all the animals and plants at 
 things which grow upon the earth from seeds and roots as well as at 
 inanimate substances which are formed within the earth fusile or 
 shall we say that they come into having 
 existed the creation of god or shall we agree with 
 vulgar opinion about them 
 
 theaet what is it 
 
 str the opinion that nature brings them into being from some 
 spontaneous and unintelligent cause or shall we say that they are 
 created by a divine reason and a knowledge which comes from god 
 
 theaet i dare say that owing to my youth i may often waver in 
 my view but now when i look at you and see that you incline to 
 refer them to god i defer to your authority 
 
 str nobly said theaetetus and if i thought that you were one of 
 those who would hereafter change your mind i would have 
 gently argued with you and forced you to assent but as i perceive that you will come of yourself and without any argument of mine to that belief which as you say attracts you i will not forestall the work of time let me suppose then that things which are said to be made by nature are the work of divine art and that things which are made by man out of these are work of human art and so there are two kinds of making and production the one human and the other divine 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str then now subdivide each of the two sections which we have 
 already 
 
 theaet how do you mean 
 
 str i mean to say that you should make a vertical division of 
 production or invention as you have already made a lateral one 
 
 theaet i have done so 
 
 str then now there are in all four parts or of 
 them have reference to us and are human and two of them have 
 reference to the gods and are divine 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and again in the division which was supposed to be made in 
 the other way one part in each subdivision is the making of the 
 things themselves but the two remaining parts may be called the 
 making of likenesses and so the productive art is again divided 
 into two parts 
 
 theaet tell me the divisions once more 
 
 str i suppose that we and the other animals and the elements 
 out of which things are water and the 
 known by us to be each and all the creation and work of god 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and there are images of them which are not them but which 
 correspond to them and these are also the creation of a wonderful 
 skill 
 
 theaet what are they 
 
 str the appearances which spring up of themselves in sleep or by 
 day such as a shadow when darkness arises in a fire or the 
 reflection which is produced when the light in bright and smooth 
 objects meets on their surface with an external light and creates a 
 perception the opposite of our ordinary sight 
 
 theaet yes and the images as well as the creation are equally 
 the work of a divine hand 
 
 str and what shall we say of human art do we not make 
 one house by the art of building and another by the art of drawing which is a sort of dream created by man for those who are awake 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str and other products of human creation are twofold and go in 
 pairs there is the thing with which the art of making the thing is 
 concerned and the image with which imitation is concerned 
 
 theaet now i begin to understand and am ready to acknowledge 
 that there are two kinds of production and each of them two fold 
 in the lateral division there is both a divine and a human 
 production in the vertical there are realities and a creation of a kind of 
 similitudes 
 
 str and let us not forget that of the imitative class the one 
 part to have been likeness making and the other phantastic if it 
 could be shown that falsehood is a reality and belongs to 
 the class of real being 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and this appeared to be the case and therefore now without 
 hesitation we shall number the different kinds as two 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str then now let us again divide the phantastic art 
 
 theaet where shall we make the division 
 
 str there is one kind which is produced by an instrument and 
 another in which the creator of the appearance is himself the 
 instrument 
 
 theaet what do you mean 
 
 str when any one makes himself appear like another in his 
 figure or his voice imitation is the name for this part of the phantastic art 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str let this then be named the art of mimicry and this the 
 province assigned to it as for the other division we are weary and 
 will give that up leaving to some one else the duty of making the 
 class and giving it a suitable name 
 
 theaet let us do as you a sphere to the one and leave 
 the other 
 
 str there is a further distinction theaetetus which is worthy 
 of our consideration and for a reason which i will tell you 
 
 theaet let me hear 
 
 str there are some who imitate knowing what they 
 imitate and some who do not know and what line of distinction can there possibly be greater than that which divides ignorance from knowledge 
 
 theaet there can be no greater 
 
 str was not the sort of imitation of which we spoke just now the 
 imitation of those who know for he who would imitate you 
 would surely know you and your figure 
 
 theaet naturally 
 
 str and what would you say of the figure or form of justice or of 
 virtue in general are we not well aware that many having no 
 knowledge of either but only a sort of opinion do their 
 best to show that this opinion is really entertained by them by expressing it as far as they can in word and deed 
 
 theaet yes that is very common 
 
 str and do they always fail in their attempt to be thought just 
 when they are not or is not the very opposite true 
 
 theaet the very opposite 
 
 str such a one then should be described as an be 
 distinguished from the other as he who is ignorant is distinguished 
 from him who knows 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str can we find a suitable name for each of them this is clearly 
 not an easy task for among the ancients there was some confusion of 
 ideas which prevented them from attempting to divide genera into 
 species wherefore there is no great abundance of names yet for 
 the sake of distinctness i will make bold to call the imitation which coexists with opinion the imitation of which coexists with science a scientific or learned imitation 
 
 theaet granted 
 
 str the former is our present concern for the sophist was 
 classed with imitators indeed but not among those who have 
 knowledge 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str let us then examine our imitator of appearance and see 
 whether he is sound like a piece of iron or whether there is still 
 some crack in him 
 
 theaet let us examine him 
 
 str indeed there is a very considerable crack for if you 
 look you find that one of the two classes of imitators is a simple creature who thinks that he knows that which he only fancies the other sort has knocked about among arguments until he suspects and 
 fears that he is ignorant of that which to the many he pretends to know 
 theaet there are certainly the two kinds which you describe 
 
 str shall we regard one as the simple other as the 
 dissembling or ironical imitator 
 
 theaet very good 
 
 str and shall we further speak of this latter class as having one 
 or two divisions 
 
 theaet answer yourself 
 
 str upon consideration then there appear to me to be two there 
 is the dissembler who harangues a multitude in public in a long 
 speech and the dissembler who in private and in short speeches 
 compels the person who is conversing with him to contradict himself 
 
 theaet what you say is most true 
 
 str and who is the maker of the longer speeches is he the 
 statesman or the popular orator 
 
 theaet the latter 
 
 str and what shall we call the other is he the philosopher or 
 the sophist 
 
 theaet the philosopher he cannot be for upon our view he is 
 ignorant but since he is an imitator of the wise he will have a 
 name which is formed by an adaptation of the word sothos what shall we name him i am pretty sure that i cannot be mistaken in 
 terming him the true and very sophist 
 
 str shall we bind up his name as we did before making a 
 chain from one end of his genealogy to the other 
 
 theaet by all means 
 
 str he then who traces the pedigree of his art as 
 belonging to the conscious or dissembling section of the art of 
 causing is an imitator of appearance and is 
 separated from the class of phantastic which is a branch of 
 into that further division of creation the juggling of 
 words a creation human and not one who affirms the real 
 sophist to be of this blood and lineage will say the very truth 
 
 theaet undoubtedly 
 
 the end

 book 
 str but perhaps you mean to give the name of being to both of 
 them together 
 
 theaet quite likely 
 
 str then friends we shall reply to them the answer 
 is plainly that the two will still be resolved into one 
 
 theaet most true 
 
 str since then we are in a difficulty please to tell 
 us what you mean when you speak of being for there can be no doubt that you always from the first understood your own meaning whereas we once thought that we understood you but now we are in a great strait please to begin by explaining this matter to us and let us no longer fancy that we understand you when we entirely misunderstand you there will be no impropriety in our demanding an answer to this question either of the dualists or of the pluralists 
 
 theaet certainly not 
 
 str and what about the assertors of the oneness of the 
 we not endeavour to ascertain from them what they mean by being 
 
 theaet by all means 
 
 str then let them answer this question one you say alone is 
 yes they will reply 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and there is something which you call being 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and is being the same as one and do you apply two 
 names to the same thing 
 
 theaet what will be their answer stranger 
 
 str it is clear theaetetus that he who asserts the 
 unity of being will find a difficulty in answering this or any other question 
 
 theaet why so 
 
 str to admit of two names and to affirm that there is nothing 
 but unity is surely ridiculous 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and equally irrational to admit that a name is anything 
 
 theaet how so 
 
 str to distinguish the name from the thing implies duality 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and yet he who identifies the name with the thing will be 
 compelled to say that it is the name of nothing or if he 
 says that it is the name of something even then the name will only be the name of a name and of nothing else 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and the one will turn out to be only one of one and being 
 absolute unity will represent a mere name 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and would they say that the whole is other than the one that 
 is or the same with it 
 
 theaet to be sure they would and they actually say so 
 
 str if being is a whole as parmenides sings 
 every way like unto the fullness of a sphere 
 evenly balanced from the centre on every side 
 and must needs be neither greater nor less in any way 
 neither on this side nor on that 
 then being has a centre and extremes and having these must also 
 have parts 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str yet that which has parts may have the attribute of 
 unity in all the parts and in this way being all and a whole may be one 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str but that of which this is the condition cannot be absolute 
 unity 
 
 theaet why not 
 
 str because according to right reason that which is truly one 
 must be affirmed to be absolutely indivisible 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str but this indivisible if made up of many parts will 
 contradict reason 
 
 theaet i understand 
 
 str shall we say that being is one and a whole because it has 
 the attribute of unity or shall we say that being is not a whole at 
 all 
 
 theaet that is a hard alternative to offer 
 
 str most true for being having in a certain sense the attribute 
 of one is yet proved not to be the same as one and the all is 
 therefore more than one 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and yet if being be not a whole through having the attribute 
 of unity and there be such a thing as an absolute whole being 
 lacks something of its own nature 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str upon this view again being having a defect of being will 
 become 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and again the all becomes more than one for being and the 
 whole will each have their separate nature 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str but if the whole does not exist at all all the previous 
 difficulties remain the same and there will be the further 
 difficulty that besides having no being being can never have come 
 into being 
 
 theaet why so 
 
 str because that which comes into being always comes into being 
 as a whole so that he who does not give whole a place among beings cannot speak either of essence or generation as existing 
 
 theaet yes that certainly appears to be true 
 
 str again how can that which is not a whole have any 
 quantity for that which is of a certain quantity must necessarily be the whole of that quantity 
 
 theaet exactly 
 
 str and there will be innumerable other points each of them 
 causing infinite trouble to him who says that being is either one 
 or two 
 
 theaet the difficulties which are dawning upon us prove this for 
 one objection connects with another and they are always involving 
 what has preceded in a greater and worse perplexity 
 
 str we are far from having exhausted the more exact thinkers who 
 treat of being and but let us be content to leave 
 them and proceed to view those who speak less precisely and we shall find as the result of all that the nature of being is quite as difficult to comprehend as that of 
 
 theaet then now we will go to the others 
 
 str there appears to be a sort of war of giants and gods going on 
 amongst them they are fighting with one another about the nature of 
 essence 
 
 theaet how is that 
 
 str some of them are dragging down all things from heaven and 
 from the unseen to earth and they literally grasp in their hands 
 rocks and oaks of these they lay hold and obstinately 
 maintain that the things only which can be touched or handled have being or essence because they define being and body as one and if any one else says that what is not a body exists they altogether despise him and will hear of nothing but body 
 
 theaet i have often met with such men and terrible fellows they 
 are 
 
 str and that is the reason why their opponents cautiously defend 
 themselves from above out of an unseen world mightily contending 
 that true essence consists of certain intelligible and incorporeal 
 ideas the bodies of the materialists which by them are 
 maintained to be the very truth they break up into little bits by their 
 arguments and affirm them to be not essence but generation and 
 motion between the two armies theaetetus there is always 
 an endless conflict raging concerning these matters 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str let us ask each party in turn to give an account of 
 that which they call essence 
 
 theaet how shall we get it out of them 
 
 str with those who make being to consist in ideas there will be 
 less difficulty for they are civil people enough but there will be 
 very great difficulty or rather an absolute impossibility 
 in getting an opinion out of those who drag everything down to matter shall i tell you what we must do 
 
 theaet what 
 
 str let us if we can really improve them but if this is not 
 possible let us imagine them to be better than they are and more 
 willing to answer in accordance with the rules of argument and then 
 their opinion will be more worth having for that which better men 
 acknowledge has more weight than that which is acknowledged by 
 inferior men moreover we are no respecters of persons but seekers 
 after time 
 
 theaet very good 
 
 str then now on the supposition that they are improved 
 let us ask them to state their views and do you interpret them 
 
 theaet agreed 
 
 str let them say whether they would admit that there is such a 
 thing as a mortal animal 
 
 theaet of course they would 
 
 str and do they not acknowledge this to be a body having a soul 
 
 theaet certainly they do 
 
 str meaning to say the soul is something which exists 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and do they not say that one soul is just and another 
 unjust and that one soul is wise and another foolish 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and that the just and wise soul becomes just and wise by the 
 possession of justice and wisdom and the opposite under opposite 
 circumstances 
 
 theaet yes they do 
 
 str but surely that which may be present or may be absent will be 
 admitted by them to exist 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and allowing that justice wisdom the other virtues and 
 their opposites exist as well as a soul in which they inhere do they 
 affirm any of them to be visible and tangible or are they all 
 invisible 
 
 theaet they would say that hardly any of them are visible 
 
 str and would they say that they are corporeal 
 
 theaet they would distinguish the soul would be said by them to 
 have a body but as to the other qualities of justice 
 wisdom and the like about which you asked they would not venture either to deny their existence or to maintain that they were all corporeal 
 
 str verily theaetetus i perceive a great improvement in 
 them the real aborigines children of the teeth would have been deterred by no shame at all but would have obstinately asserted 
 that nothing is which they are not able to squeeze in their hands 
 
 theaet that is pretty much their notion 
 
 str let us push the question for if they will admit that 
 any even the smallest particle of being is incorporeal it is enough they must then say what that nature is which is common to both the 
 corporeal and incorporeal and which they have in their eye 
 when they say of both of them that they are perhaps they may be 
 in a difficulty and if this is the case there is a possibility 
 that they may accept a notion of ours respecting the nature of 
 being having nothing of their own to offer 
 
 theaet what is the notion tell me and we shall soon see 
 str my notion would be that anything which possesses any sort of 
 power to affect another or to be affected by another if only for a 
 single moment however trifling the cause and however slight the 
 effect has real existence and i hold that the definition 
 of being is simply power of theaet they accept your suggestion having nothing better of their own to offer 
 
 str very good perhaps we as well as they may one day change 
 our minds but for the present this may be regarded as the 
 understanding which is established with them 
 
 theaet agreed 
 
 str let us now go to the friends of ideas of their opinions 
 too you shall be the interpreter 
 
 theaet i will 
 
 str to them we would distinguish essence from generation 
 
 theaet yes they reply 
 
 str and you would allow that we participate in 
 generation with the body and through perception but we participate with the soul through in true essence and essence you would affirm to be always the same and immutable whereas generation or becoming varies 
 
 theaet yes that is what we should affirm 
 
 str well fair sirs we say to them what is this participation 
 which you assert of both do you agree with our recent definition 
 
 theaet what definition 
 
 str we said that being was an active or passive energy 
 arising out of a certain power which proceeds from elements meeting with one another perhaps your cars theaetetus may fail to catch their answer which i recognize because i have been accustomed to hear it 
 
 theaet and what is their answer 
 
 str they deny the truth of what we were just now saying to the 
 aborigines about existence 
 
 theaet what was that 
 
 str any power of doing or suffering in a degree however slight 
 was held by us to be a sufficient definition of being 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str they deny this and say that the power of doing or 
 suffering is confined to becoming and that neither power is applicable to being 
 
 theaet and is there not some truth in what they say 
 
 str yes but our reply will be that we want to ascertain from 
 them more distinctly whether they further admit that the soul 
 knows and that being or essence is known 
 
 theaet there can be no doubt that they say so 
 
 str and is knowing and being known doing or suffering 
 or both or is the one doing and the other suffering or has neither any share in either 
 
 theaet clearly neither has any share in either for if they say 
 anything else they will contradict themselves 
 
 str i understand but they will allow that if to know is active 
 then of course to be known is passive and on this view 
 being in so far as it is known is acted upon by knowledge and is therefore in motion for that which is in a state of rest cannot be acted upon as we affirm 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and o heavens can we ever be made to believe that motion 
 and life and soul and mind are not present with perfect being can 
 we imagine that being is devoid of life and mind and 
 exists in awful unmeaningness an everlasting fixture 
 
 theaet that would be a dreadful thing to admit stranger 
 
 str but shall we say that has mind and not life 
 
 theaet how is that possible 
 
 str or shall we say that both inhere in perfect being but that 
 it has no soul which contains them 
 
 theaet and in what other way can it contain them 
 
 str or that being has mind and life and soul but although 
 endowed with soul remains absolutely unmoved 
 
 theaet all three suppositions appear to me to be irrational 
 
 str under being then we must include motion and that which is 
 moved 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str then theaetetus our inference is that if there is 
 no motion neither is there any mind anywhere or about anything or belonging to any one 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str and yet this equally follows if we grant that all things are 
 in this view too mind has no existence 
 
 theaet how so 
 
 str do you think that sameness of condition and mode and subject 
 could ever exist without a principle of rest 
 
 theaet certainly not 
 
 str can you see how without them mind could exist or come into 
 existence anywhere 
 
 theaet no 
 
 str and surely contend we must in every possible way against him 
 who would annihilate knowledge and reason and mind and yet ventures to speak confidently about anything 
 
 theaet yes with all our might 
 
 str then the philosopher who has the truest reverence for these 
 qualities cannot possibly accept the notion of those who 
 say that the whole is at rest either as unity or in many forms and he will be utterly deaf to those who assert universal motion as children say entreatingly give us both so he will include both the moveable 
 and immoveable in his definition of being and all 
 
 theaet most true 
 
 str and now do we seem to have gained a fair notion of being 
 
 theaet yes truly 
 
 str alas theaetetus methinks that we are now only beginning to 
 see the real difficulty of the enquiry into the nature of it 
 
 theaet what do you mean 
 
 str o my friend do you not see that nothing can exceed out 
 ignorance and yet we fancy that we are saying something good 
 
 theaet i certainly thought that we were and i do not at all 
 understand how we never found out our desperate case 
 
 str reflect after having made these admissions may we not be 
 justly asked the same questions which we ourselves were asking of 
 those who said that all was hot and cold 
 
 theaet what were they will you recall them to my mind 
 
 str to be sure i will remind you of them by putting the same 
 questions to you which i did to them and then we shall get on 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str would you not say that rest and motion are in the most entire 
 opposition to one another 
 
 theaet of course 
 
 str and yet you would say that both and either of them 
 equally are 
 
 theaet i should 
 
 str and when you admit that both or either of them are 
 do you mean to say that both or either of them are in motion 
 
 theaet certainly not 
 
 str or do you wish to imply that they are both at rest when you 
 say that they are 
 
 theaet of course not 
 
 str then you conceive of being as some third and distinct nature 
 under which rest and motion are alike included and observing that 
 they both participate in being you declare that they are 
 
 theaet truly we seem to have an intimation that being is 
 some third thing when we say that rest and motion are 
 
 str then being is not the combination of rest and motion but 
 something different from them 
 
 theaet so it would appear 
 
 str being then according to its own nature is neither in 
 motion nor at rest 
 
 theaet that is very much the truth 
 
 str where then is a man to look for help who would have 
 any clear or fixed notion of being in his mind 
 
 theaet where indeed 
 
 str i scarcely think that he can look anywhere for that which is 
 not in motion must be at rest and again that which is not at rest 
 must be in motion but being is placed outside of both these 
 classes is this possible 
 
 theaet utterly impossible 
 
 str here then is another thing which we ought to bear in mind 
 
 theaet what 
 
 str when we were asked to what we were to assign the 
 appellation of we were in the greatest you remember 
 
 theaet to be sure 
 
 str and are we not now in as a difficulty about being 
 
 theaes i should say stranger that we are in one which is if 
 possible even greater 
 
 str then let us acknowledge the difficulty and as being and 
 are involved in the same perplexity there is hope 
 that when the one appears more or less distinctly the other will equally appear and if we are able to see neither there may still be a 
 chance of steering our way in between them without any great 
 discredit 
 theaet very good 
 
 str let us enquire then how we come to predicate many names of 
 the same thing 
 
 theaet give an example 
 
 str i mean that we speak of man for example under many 
 we attribute to him colours and forms and magnitudes and virtues and vices in all of which instances and in ten thousand others we not only speak of him as a man but also as good and having other attributes and in the same way anything else which we originally supposed to be one is described by us as many and under many names 
 
 theaet that is true 
 
 str and thus we provide a rich feast for tyros whether young or 
 old for there is nothing easier than to argue that the one cannot 
 be many or the many one and great is their delight in 
 denying that a man is good for man they insist is man and good is good i dare say that you have met with persons who interest in such are often elderly men whose meagre sense is thrown into amazement by these discoveries of theirs which they believe to be the height of wisdom 
 
 theaet certainly i have 
 
 str then not to exclude any one who has ever speculated at all 
 upon the nature of being let us put our questions to them as well 
 as to our former friends 
 
 theaet what questions 
 
 str shall we refuse to attribute being to motion and rest or 
 anything to anything and assume that they do not mingle and are 
 incapable of participating in one another or shall we 
 gather all into one class of things communicable with one another or are some things communicable and others of these alternatives 
 
 theaetetus will they prefer 
 
 theaet i have nothing to answer on their behalf suppose that you 
 take all these hypotheses in turn and see what are the consequences 
 which follow from each of them 
 
 str very good and first let us assume them to say that nothing 
 is capable of participating in anything else in any respect in that 
 case rest and motion cannot participate in being at all 
 
 theaet they cannot 
 
 str but would either of them be if not participating in being 
 
 theaet no 
 
 str then by this admission everything is instantly overturned as 
 well the doctrine of universal motion as of universal rest and also 
 the doctrine of those who distribute being into immutable and 
 everlasting kinds for all these add on a notion of being some 
 affirming that things are truly in motion and others that they 
 are truly at rest 
 
 theaes just so 
 
 str again those who would at one time compound and at another 
 resolve all things whether making them into one and out of one 
 creating infinity or dividing them into finite clements and 
 forming compounds out of these whether they suppose the processes of creation to be successive or continuous would be talking nonsense in all this if there were no admixture 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str most ridiculous of all will the men themselves be who want to 
 carry out the argument and yet forbid us to call anything because 
 participating in some affection from another by the name of that 
 other 
 
 theaet why so 
 
 str why because they are compelled to use the words to be 
 apart from others in itself and ten thousand more which 
 they cannot give up but must make the connecting links of 
 discourse and therefore they do not require to be refuted by 
 others but their enemy as the saying is inhabits the same house 
 with them they are always carrying about with them an 
 adversary like the wonderful ventriloquist eurycles who out of their own bellies audibly contradicts them 
 
 theaet precisely so a very true and exact illustration 
 
 str and now if we suppose that all things have the power of 
 communion with one another what will follow 
 
 theaet even i can solve that riddle 
 
 str how 
 
 theaet why because motion itself would be at rest and rest 
 again in motion if they could be attributed to one another 
 
 str but this is utterly impossible 
 
 theaet of course 
 
 str then only the third hypothesis remains 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str for surely either all things have communion with all or 
 nothing with any other thing or some things communicate with some 
 things and others not 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and two out of these three suppositions have been found to be 
 impossible 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str every one then who desires to answer truly will adopt the 
 third and remaining hypothesis of the communion of some with some 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str this communion of some with some may be illustrated 
 by the caseof letters for some letters do not fit each other while others do 
 
 theaet of course 
 
 str and the vowels especially are a sort of bond which pervades 
 all the other letters so that without a vowel one consonant 
 cannot be joined to another 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str but does every one know what letters will unite with what or 
 is art required in order to do so 
 
 theaet what is required 
 
 str what art 
 
 theaet the art of grammar 
 
 str and is not this also true of sounds high and 
 not he who has the art to know what sounds mingle a musician and he who is ignorant not a musician 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and we shall find this to be generally true of art or the 
 absence of art 
 
 theaet of course 
 
 str and as classes are admitted by us in like manner to be some 
 of them capable and others incapable of intermixture must not he 
 who would rightly show what kinds will unite and what will not 
 proceed by the help of science in the path of argument and will he 
 not ask if the connecting links are universal and so capable of 
 intermixture with all things and again in divisions whether there 
 are not other universal classes which make them possible 
 
 theaet to be sure he will require science and if i am not 
 mistaken the very greatest of all sciences 
 
 str how are we to call it by zeus have we not lighted 
 unwittingly upon our free and noble science and in looking for the sophist have we not entertained the philosopher unawares 
 
 theaet what do you mean 
 
 str should we not say that the division according to 
 classes which neither makes the same other nor makes other the same is the business of the dialectical science 
 
 theaet that is what we should say 
 
 str then surely he who can divide rightly is able to see 
 clearly one form pervading a scattered multitude and many different 
 forms contained under one higher form and again one form knit 
 together into a single whole and pervading many such wholes and 
 many forms existing only in separation and isolation this is the 
 knowledge of classes which determines where they can have communion with one another and where not 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str and the art of dialectic would be attributed by you 
 only to the philosopher pure and true 
 
 theaet who but he can be worthy 
 
 str in this region we shall always discover the philosopher if 
 we look for him like the sophist he is not easily discovered but 
 for a different reason 
 
 theaet for what reason 
 
 str because the sophist runs away into the darkness of 
 in which he has learned by habit to feel about and cannot be 
 discovered because of the darkness of the place is not that true 
 
 theaet it seems to be so 
 
 str and the philosopher always holding converse through reason 
 with the idea of being is also dark from excess of light for the 
 souls of the many have no eye which can endure the vision of the 
 divine 
 
 theaet yes that seems to be quite as true as the other 
 
 str well the philosopher may hereafter be more fully 
 considered by us if we are disposed but the sophist must clearly not be allowed to escape until we have had a good look at him 
 
 theaet very good 
 
 str since then we are agreed that some classes have a communion 
 with one another and others not and some have communion with a few and others with many and that there is no reason why some should not have universal communion with all let us now pursue the 
 enquiry as the argument suggests not in relation to all ideas 
 lest the multitude of them should confuse us but let us select a 
 few of those which are reckoned to be the principal ones 
 and consider their several natures and their capacity of communion with one another in order that if we are not able to apprehend with perfect clearness the notions of being and we may at 
 least not fall short in the consideration of them so far as they come within the scope of the present enquiry if peradventure we may be allowed to assert the reality of and yet escape unscathed 
 
 theaet we must do so 
 
 str the most important of all the genera are those which we were 
 just now and rest and motion 
 
 theaet yes by far 
 
 str and two of these are as we affirm incapable of 
 communion with one another 
 
 theaet quite incapable 
 
 str whereas being surely has communion with both of them for 
 both of them are 
 
 theaet of course 
 
 str that makes up three of them 
 
 theaet to be sure 
 
 str and each of them is other than the remaining two but the 
 same with itself 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str but then what is the meaning of these two words same and 
 other are they two new kinds other than the three and yet always 
 of necessity intermingling with them and are we to have five kinds 
 instead of three or when we speak of the same and other are we 
 unconsciously speaking of one of the three first kinds 
 
 theaet very likely we are 
 
 str but surely motion and rest are neither the other nor the 
 same 
 
 theaet how is that 
 
 str whatever we attribute to motion and rest in common cannot be 
 either of them 
 
 theaet why not 
 
 str because motion would be at rest and rest in motion for 
 either of them being predicated of both will compel the other to 
 change into the opposite of its own nature because partaking of its 
 opposite 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str yet they surely both partake of the same and of the other 
 theaet yes 
 
 str then we must not assert that motion any more than rest is 
 either the same or the other 
 
 theaet no we must not 
 
 str but are we to conceive that being and the same are identical 
 
 theaet possibly 
 
 str but if they are identical then again in saying that 
 motion and rest have being we should also be saying that they are the same 
 
 theaet which surely cannot be 
 
 str then being and same cannot be one 
 
 theaet scarcely 
 
 str then we may suppose the same to be a fourth class 
 which is now to be added to the three others 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str and shall we call the other a fifth class or should we 
 consider being and other to be two names of the same class 
 
 theaet very likely 
 
 str but you would agree if i am not mistaken that existences 
 are relative as well as absolute 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and the other is always relative to other 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str but this would not be the case unless being and the other 
 entirely differed for if the other like being were absolute as 
 well as relative then there would have been a kind of other 
 which was not other than other and now we find that what is other must of necessity be what it is in relation to some other 
 
 theaet that is the true state of the case 
 
 str then we must admit the other as the fifth of our selected 
 classes 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and the fifth class pervades all classes for they all differ 
 from one another not by reason of their own nature but because 
 they partake of the idea of the other 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str then let us now put the case with reference to each of the 
 five 
 
 theaet how 
 
 str first there is motion which we affirm to be 
 absolutely rest what else can we say 
 
 theaet it is so 
 
 str and therefore is not rest 
 
 theaet certainly not 
 
 str and yet is because partaking of being 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str again motion is other than the same 
 
 theaet just so 
 
 str and is therefore not the same 
 
 theaet it is not 
 
 str yet surely motion is the same because all things partake 
 of the same 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str then we must admit and not object to say that motion is the 
 same and is not the same for we do not apply the terms same and 
 not the same in the same sense but we call it the same in 
 relation to itself because partaking of the same and not the same 
 because having communion with the other it is thereby severed from 
 the same and has become not that but other and is therefore 
 rightly spoken of as not the same 
 
 theaet to be sure 
 
 str and if absolute motion in any point of view partook of rest 
 there would be no absurdity in calling motion stationary 
 
 theaet quite right that is on the supposition that some 
 classes mingle with one another and others not 
 
 str that such a communion of kinds is according to nature we had 
 already proved before we arrived at this part of our discussion 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str let us proceed then we not say that motion is other than 
 the other having been also proved by us to be other than 
 the same and other than rest 
 
 theaet that is certain 
 
 str then according to this view motion is other and also not 
 other 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str what is the next step shall we say that motion is other than 
 the three and not other than the we agreed that there are 
 five classes about and in the sphere of which we proposed to make 
 enquiry 
 
 theaet surely we cannot admit that the number is less than it 
 appeared to be just now 
 
 str then we may without fear contend that motion is other than 
 being 
 
 theaet without the least fear 
 
 str the plain result is that motion since it partakes of being 
 really is and also is not 
 
 theaet nothing can be plainer 
 
 str then necessarily exists in the case of motion and 
 of every class for the nature of the other entering into them all 
 makes each of them other than being and so and 
 therefore of all of them in like manner we may truly say that they 
 are again inasmuch as they partake of being that they are 
 and are existent 
 
 theaet so we may assume 
 
 str every class then has plurality of being and infinity of 
 
 
 theaet so we must infer 
 
 str and being itself may be said to be other than the other kinds 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str then we may infer that being is not in respect of as many 
 other things as there are for these it is itself one and 
 is not the other things which are infinite in number 
 
 theaet that is not far from the truth 
 
 str and we must not quarrel with this result since it is of the 
 nature of classes to have communion with one another and if any one 
 denies our present statement viz that being is not etc let 
 him first argue with our former conclusion respecting the 
 communion of ideas and then he may proceed to argue with what 
 follows 
 
 theaet nothing can be fairer 
 
 str let me ask you to consider a further question 
 
 theaet what question 
 
 str when we speak of we speak i suppose not of 
 something opposed to being but only different 
 
 theaet what do you mean 
 
 str when we speak of something as not great does the expression 
 seem to you to imply what is little any more than what is equal 
 
 theaet certainly not 
 
 str the negative particles ou and me when prefixed to words do 
 not imply opposition but only difference from the words or more 
 correctly from the things represented by the words which 
 follow them 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str there is another point to be considered if you do not object 
 
 theaet what is it 
 
 str the nature of the other appears to me to be divided into 
 fractions like knowledge 
 
 theaet how so 
 
 str knowledge like the other is one and yet the 
 various parts of knowledge have each of them their own particular name and hence there are many arts and kinds of knowledge 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str and is not the case the same with the parts of the 
 other which is also one 
 
 theaet very likely but will you tell me how 
 
 str there is some part of the other which is opposed to the 
 beautiful 
 
 theaet there is 
 
 str shall we say that this has or has not a name 
 
 theaet it has for whatever we call not beautiful is 
 other than the beautiful not than something else 
 
 str and now tell me another thing 
 
 theaet what 
 
 str is the anything but existence parted 
 off from a certain kind of existence and again from another point 
 of view opposed to an existing something 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str then the turns out to be the opposition of 
 being to being 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str but upon this view is the beautiful a more real and the 
 a less real existence 
 
 theaet not at all 
 
 str and the may be said to exist equally with 
 the great 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and in the same way the just must be placed in the same 
 category with the the one cannot be said to have any more 
 existence than the other 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str the same may be said of other things seeing that the 
 nature of the other has a real existence the parts of this nature must 
 equally be supposed to exist 
 
 theaet of course 
 
 str then as would appear the opposition of a part of the other 
 and of a part of being to one another is if i may venture to say 
 so as truly essence as being itself and implies not the opposite 
 of being but only what is other than being 
 
 theaet beyond question 
 
 str what then shall we call it 
 
 theaet clearly and this is the very nature for which 
 the sophist compelled us to search 
 
 str and has not this as you were saying as real an existence as 
 any other class may i not say with confidence that has an 
 assured existence and a nature of its own just as the great was 
 found to be great and the beautiful beautiful and the 
 and the in the same manner 
 has been found to be and is and is to 
 be reckoned one among the many classes of being do you theaetetus still feel any doubt of this 
 
 theaet none whatever 
 
 str do you observe that our scepticism has carried us beyond the 
 range of parmenides prohibition 
 
 theaet in what 
 
 str we have advanced to a further point and shown him 
 more than he for bad us to investigate 
 
 theaet how is that 
 
 str why because he never is and do thou keep thy thoughts from this way of enquiry 
 theaet yes he says so 
 
 str whereas we have not only proved that things which 
 are not are but we have shown what form of being is for we have shown that the nature of the other is and is distributed over all things in their relations to one another and whatever part of the other is contrasted with being this is precisely what we have 
 ventured to call 
 
 theaet and surely stranger we were quite right 
 
 str let not any one say then that while affirming the 
 opposition of to being we still assert the being of 
 for as to whether there is an opposite of being to that 
 enquiry we have long said may or may not be and may or may not be capable of definition but as touching our present 
 account of let a man either convince us of error or so 
 long as he cannot he too must say as we are saying that there is 
 a communion of classes and that being and difference or other 
 traverse all things and mutually interpenetrate so that the other 
 partakes of being and by reason of this participation is and yet 
 is not that of which it partakes but other and being other than 
 being it is clearly a necessity that should be again 
 being through partaking of the other becomes a class other than 
 the remaining classes and being other than all of them is not each 
 one of them and is not all the rest so that undoubtedly there are 
 thousands upon thousands of cases in which being is not and 
 all other things whether regarded individually or collectively in many 
 respects are and in many respects are not 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and he who is sceptical of this contradiction must think how 
 he can find something better to say or if he sees a puzzle and 
 his pleasure is to drag words this way and that the argument will 
 prove to him that he is not making a worthy use of his 
 faculties for there is no charm in such puzzles and there is no difficulty in detecting them but we can tell him of something else the pursuit of which is noble and also difficult 
 
 theaet what is it 
 
 str a thing of which i have already alone these 
 puzzles as involving no difficulty he should be able to follow and 
 criticize in detail every argument and when a man says that the 
 same is in a manner other or that other is the same to understand 
 and refute him from his own point of view and in the same respect 
 in which he asserts either of these affections but to show that 
 somehow and in some sense the same is other or the other 
 same or the great small or the like unlike and to delight in always bringing forward such contradictions is no real refutation but is 
 clearly the babe of some one who is only beginning to approach the problem of being 
 
 theaet to be sure 
 
 str for certainly my friend the attempt to separate all 
 existences from one another is a barbarism and utterly unworthy of 
 an educated or philosophical mind 
 
 theaet why so 
 
 str the attempt at universal separation is the final annihilation 
 of all reasoning for only by the union of conceptions with one 
 another do we attain to discourse of reason 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and observe that we were only just in time in making a 
 resistance to such separatists and compelling them to admit that 
 one thing mingles with another 
 
 theaet why so 
 
 str why that we might be able to assert discourse to be a kind 
 of being for if we could not the worst of all consequences would 
 follow we should have no philosophy moreover the necessity for 
 determining the nature of discourse presses upon us at this 
 moment if utterly deprived of it we could no more hold discourse and deprived of it we should be if we admitted that there was no 
 admixture of natures at all 
 
 theaet very true but i do not understand why at this moment we 
 must determine the nature of discourse 
 
 str perhaps you will see more clearly by the help of the 
 following explanation 
 
 theaet what explanation 
 
 str has been acknowledged by us to be one among many 
 classes diffused over all being 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and thence arises the question whether mingles 
 with opinion and language 
 
 theaet how so 
 
 str if has no part in the proposition then all things 
 must be true but if has a part then false opinion and 
 false speech are possible for think or to say what is 
 falsehood which thus arises in the region of thought and in speech 
 
 theaet that is quite true 
 
 str and where there is falsehood surely there must be deceit 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and if there is deceit then all things must be full of idols 
 and images and fancies 
 
 theaet to be sure 
 
 str into that region the sophist as we said made his 
 escape and when he had got there denied the very possibility of falsehood no one he argued either conceived or uttered falsehood inasmuch as did not in any way partake of being 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and now has been shown to partake of being and 
 therefore he will not continue fighting in this direction 
 but he will probably say that some ideas partake of and some not and that language and opinion are of the class and he will still fight to the death against the existence of the 
 and phantastic art in which we have placed 
 him he will say opinion and language do not partake of and unless this participation exists there can be no such thing as falsehood and with the view of meeting this evasion we must begin by enquiring into the nature of language opinion and 
 imagination in order that when we find them we may find also that they have communion with and having made out the connection of them may thus prove that falsehood exists and therein we will imprison the sophist if he deserves it or if not we will let him go again and look for him in another class 
 
 theaet certainly stranger there appears to be truth in what was 
 said about the sophist at first that he was of a class not easily 
 caught for he seems to have abundance of defences which he throws up and which must every one of them be stormed before we can reach the man himself and even now we have with difficulty got 
 through his first defence which is the of and lo here is another for we have still to show that falsehood exists in 
 the sphere of language and opinion and there will be another and 
 another line of defence without end 
 
 str any one theaetetus who is able to advance even a 
 little ought to be of good cheer for what would he who is dispirited at a little progress do if he were making none at all or even undergoing a repulse such a faint heart as the proverb says will never take a city but now that we have succeeded thus far the citadel is ours and what remains is easier 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str then as i was saying let us first of all obtain a 
 conception of language and opinion in order that we may have 
 clearer grounds for determining whether has any concern 
 with them or whether they are both always true and neither of them 
 ever false 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str then now let us speak of names as before we were 
 speaking of ideas and letters for that is the direction in which the answer may be expected 
 
 theaet and what is the question at issue about names 
 
 str the question at issue is whether all names may be connected 
 with one another or none or only some of them 
 
 theaet clearly the last is true 
 
 str i understand you to say that words which have a 
 meaning when in sequence may be connected but that words which have no meaning when in sequence cannot be connected 
 
 theaet what are you saying 
 
 str what i thought that you intended when you gave your 
 assent for there are two sorts of intimation of being which are given by the voice 
 
 theaet what are they 
 
 str one of them is called nouns and the other verbs 
 
 theaet describe them 
 
 str that which denotes action we call a verb 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and the other which is an articulate mark set on those who 
 do the actions we call a noun 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str a succession of nouns only is not a sentence any more than of 
 verbs without nouns 
 
 theaet i do not understand you 
 
 str i see that when you gave your assent you had something else 
 in your mind but what i intended to say was that a mere succession 
 of nouns or of verbs is not discourse 
 
 theaet what do you mean 
 
 str i mean that words like walks runs sleeps or any 
 other words which denote action however many of them you string 
 together do not make discourse 
 
 theaet how can they 
 
 str or again when you say lion stag horse or any other 
 words which denote agents neither in this way of stringing words 
 together do you attain to discourse for there is no expression of 
 action or inaction or of the existence of existence or 
 indicated by the sounds until verbs are mingled with 
 nouns then the words fit and the smallest combination of them 
 forms language and is the simplest and least form of discourse 
 
 theaet again i ask what do you mean 
 
 str when any one says a man learns should you not call this 
 the simplest and least of sentences 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str yes for he now arrives at the point of giving an intimation 
 about something which is or is becoming or has become or will be 
 and he not only names but he does something by connecting 
 verbs with nouns and therefore we say that he discourses and to this 
 connection of words we give the name of discourse 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and as there are some things which fit one another and other 
 things which do not fit so there are some vocal signs which do and 
 others which do not combine and form discourse 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str there is another small matter 
 
 theaet what is it 
 
 str a sentence must and cannot help having a subject 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and must be of a certain quality 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and now let us mind what we are about 
 
 theaet we must do so 
 
 str i will repeat a sentence to you in which a thing and an 
 action are combined by the help of a noun and a verb and you shall 
 tell me of whom the sentence speaks 
 
 theaet i will to the best my power 
 
 str theaetetus a very long sentence 
 
 theaet not very 
 
 str of whom does the sentence speak and who is the 
 subject that is what you have to tell 
 
 theaet of me i am the subject 
 
 str or this sentence again 
 
 theaet what sentence 
 
 str theaetetus with whom i am now speaking is flying 
 
 theaet that also is a sentence which will be admitted by every 
 one to speak of me and to apply to me 
 
 str we agreed that every sentence must necessarily have a certain 
 quality 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and what is the quality of each of these two sentences 
 
 theaet the one as i imagine is false and the other true 
 
 str the true says what is true about you 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and the false says what is other than true 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and therefore speaks of things which are not as if they were 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and say that things are real of you which are not for as we 
 were saying in regard to each thing or person there is much that 
 is and much that is not 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str the second of the two sentences which related to you was 
 first of all an example of the shortest form consistent with our 
 definition 
 
 theaet yes this was implied in recent admission 
 
 str and in the second place it related to a subject 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str who must be you and can be nobody else 
 theaet unquestionably 
 
 str and it would be no sentence at all if there were no subject 
 for as we proved a sentence which has no subject is impossible 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str when other then is asserted of you as the same and 
 as being such a combination of nouns and verbs is really and truly false discourse 
 
 theaet most true 
 
 str and therefore thought opinion and imagination are now 
 proved to exist in our minds both as true and false 
 
 theaet how so 
 
 str you will know better if you first gain a knowledge of 
 what they are and in what they severally differ from one another 
 theaet give me the knowledge which you would wish me to gain 
 str are not thought and speech the same with this exception 
 that what is called thought is the unuttered conversation of the 
 soul with herself 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str but the stream of thought which flows through the lips and is 
 audible is called speech 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and we know that there exists in speech 
 
 theaet what exists 
 
 str affirmation 
 
 theaet yes we know it 
 
 str when the affirmation or denial takes place in silence and in 
 the mind only have you any other name by which to call it but 
 opinion 
 
 theaet there can be no other name 
 
 str and when opinion is presented not simply but in some form 
 of sense would you not call it imagination 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str and seeing that language is true and false and that 
 thought is the conversation of the soul with herself and opinion is the end of thinking and imagination or phantasy is the union of sense and 
 opinion the inference is that some of them since they are akin to 
 language should have an element of falsehood as well as of truth 
 
 theaet certainly 
 
 str do you perceive then that false opinion and speech have 
 been discovered sooner than we just now we seemed to be undertaking a task which would never be accomplished 
 
 theaet i perceive 
 
 str then let us not be discouraged about the future but 
 now having made this discovery let us go back to our previous classification 
 theaet what classification 
 
 str we divided into two sorts the one 
 the other imaginative or phantastic 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and we said that we were uncertain in which we should 
 place the sophist 
 
 theaet we did say so 
 
 str and our heads began to go round more and more when it was 
 asserted that there is no such thing as an image or idol or 
 appearance because in no manner or time or place can there ever be 
 such a thing as falsehood 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and now since there has been shown to be false speech and 
 false opinion there may be imitations of real existences and out 
 of this condition of the mind an art of deception may arise 
 
 theaet quite possible 
 
 str and we have already admitted in what preceded that the 
 sophist was lurking in one of the divisions of the 
 art 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str let us then renew the attempt and in dividing any class 
 always take the part to the right holding fast to that which holds 
 the sophist until we have stripped him of all his common 
 properties and reached his difference or peculiar then we may 
 exhibit him in his true nature first to ourselves and then 
 to kindred dialectical spirits 
 
 theaet very good 
 
 str you may remember that all art was originally divided 
 by us into creative and acquisitive 
 
 theaet yes 
 str and the sophist was flitting before us in the acquisitiveclass in the subdivisions of hunting contests merchandise and the like 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str but now that the imitative art has enclosed him it is clear 
 that we must begin by dividing the art of creation for 
 imitation is a kind of creation of images however as we affirm and not of real things 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str in the first place there are two kinds of creation 
 
 theaet what are they 
 
 str one of them is human and the other divine 
 
 theaet i do not follow 
 
 str every power as you may remember our saying originally which 
 causes things to exist not previously existing was defined by us 
 as creative 
 
 theaet i remember 
 
 str looking now at the world and all the animals and plants at 
 things which grow upon the earth from seeds and roots as well as at 
 inanimate substances which are formed within the earth fusile or 
 shall we say that they come into having 
 existed the creation of god or shall we agree with 
 vulgar opinion about them 
 
 theaet what is it 
 
 str the opinion that nature brings them into being from some 
 spontaneous and unintelligent cause or shall we say that they are 
 created by a divine reason and a knowledge which comes from god 
 
 theaet i dare say that owing to my youth i may often waver in 
 my view but now when i look at you and see that you incline to 
 refer them to god i defer to your authority 
 
 str nobly said theaetetus and if i thought that you were one of 
 those who would hereafter change your mind i would have 
 gently argued with you and forced you to assent but as i perceive that you will come of yourself and without any argument of mine to that belief which as you say attracts you i will not forestall the work of time let me suppose then that things which are said to be made by nature are the work of divine art and that things which are made by man out of these are work of human art and so there are two kinds of making and production the one human and the other divine 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str then now subdivide each of the two sections which we have 
 already 
 
 theaet how do you mean 
 
 str i mean to say that you should make a vertical division of 
 production or invention as you have already made a lateral one 
 
 theaet i have done so 
 
 str then now there are in all four parts or of 
 them have reference to us and are human and two of them have 
 reference to the gods and are divine 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and again in the division which was supposed to be made in 
 the other way one part in each subdivision is the making of the 
 things themselves but the two remaining parts may be called the 
 making of likenesses and so the productive art is again divided 
 into two parts 
 
 theaet tell me the divisions once more 
 
 str i suppose that we and the other animals and the elements 
 out of which things are water and the 
 known by us to be each and all the creation and work of god 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str and there are images of them which are not them but which 
 correspond to them and these are also the creation of a wonderful 
 skill 
 
 theaet what are they 
 
 str the appearances which spring up of themselves in sleep or by 
 day such as a shadow when darkness arises in a fire or the 
 reflection which is produced when the light in bright and smooth 
 objects meets on their surface with an external light and creates a 
 perception the opposite of our ordinary sight 
 
 theaet yes and the images as well as the creation are equally 
 the work of a divine hand 
 
 str and what shall we say of human art do we not make 
 one house by the art of building and another by the art of drawing which is a sort of dream created by man for those who are awake 
 
 theaet quite true 
 
 str and other products of human creation are twofold and go in 
 pairs there is the thing with which the art of making the thing is 
 concerned and the image with which imitation is concerned 
 
 theaet now i begin to understand and am ready to acknowledge 
 that there are two kinds of production and each of them two fold 
 in the lateral division there is both a divine and a human 
 production in the vertical there are realities and a creation of a kind of 
 similitudes 
 
 str and let us not forget that of the imitative class the one 
 part to have been likeness making and the other phantastic if it 
 could be shown that falsehood is a reality and belongs to 
 the class of real being 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str and this appeared to be the case and therefore now without 
 hesitation we shall number the different kinds as two 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str then now let us again divide the phantastic art 
 
 theaet where shall we make the division 
 
 str there is one kind which is produced by an instrument and 
 another in which the creator of the appearance is himself the 
 instrument 
 
 theaet what do you mean 
 
 str when any one makes himself appear like another in his 
 figure or his voice imitation is the name for this part of the phantastic art 
 
 theaet yes 
 
 str let this then be named the art of mimicry and this the 
 province assigned to it as for the other division we are weary and 
 will give that up leaving to some one else the duty of making the 
 class and giving it a suitable name 
 
 theaet let us do as you a sphere to the one and leave 
 the other 
 
 str there is a further distinction theaetetus which is worthy 
 of our consideration and for a reason which i will tell you 
 
 theaet let me hear 
 
 str there are some who imitate knowing what they 
 imitate and some who do not know and what line of distinction can there possibly be greater than that which divides ignorance from knowledge 
 
 theaet there can be no greater 
 
 str was not the sort of imitation of which we spoke just now the 
 imitation of those who know for he who would imitate you 
 would surely know you and your figure 
 
 theaet naturally 
 
 str and what would you say of the figure or form of justice or of 
 virtue in general are we not well aware that many having no 
 knowledge of either but only a sort of opinion do their 
 best to show that this opinion is really entertained by them by expressing it as far as they can in word and deed 
 
 theaet yes that is very common 
 
 str and do they always fail in their attempt to be thought just 
 when they are not or is not the very opposite true 
 
 theaet the very opposite 
 
 str such a one then should be described as an be 
 distinguished from the other as he who is ignorant is distinguished 
 from him who knows 
 
 theaet true 
 
 str can we find a suitable name for each of them this is clearly 
 not an easy task for among the ancients there was some confusion of 
 ideas which prevented them from attempting to divide genera into 
 species wherefore there is no great abundance of names yet for 
 the sake of distinctness i will make bold to call the imitation which coexists with opinion the imitation of which coexists with science a scientific or learned imitation 
 
 theaet granted 
 
 str the former is our present concern for the sophist was 
 classed with imitators indeed but not among those who have 
 knowledge 
 
 theaet very true 
 
 str let us then examine our imitator of appearance and see 
 whether he is sound like a piece of iron or whether there is still 
 some crack in him 
 
 theaet let us examine him 
 
 str indeed there is a very considerable crack for if you 
 look you find that one of the two classes of imitators is a simple creature who thinks that he knows that which he only fancies the other sort has knocked about among arguments until he suspects and 
 fears that he is ignorant of that which to the many he pretends to know 
 theaet there are certainly the two kinds which you describe 
 
 str shall we regard one as the simple other as the 
 dissembling or ironical imitator 
 
 theaet very good 
 
 str and shall we further speak of this latter class as having one 
 or two divisions 
 
 theaet answer yourself 
 
 str upon consideration then there appear to me to be two there 
 is the dissembler who harangues a multitude in public in a long 
 speech and the dissembler who in private and in short speeches 
 compels the person who is conversing with him to contradict himself 
 
 theaet what you say is most true 
 
 str and who is the maker of the longer speeches is he the 
 statesman or the popular orator 
 
 theaet the latter 
 
 str and what shall we call the other is he the philosopher or 
 the sophist 
 
 theaet the philosopher he cannot be for upon our view he is 
 ignorant but since he is an imitator of the wise he will have a 
 name which is formed by an adaptation of the word sothos what shall we name him i am pretty sure that i cannot be mistaken in 
 terming him the true and very sophist 
 
 str shall we bind up his name as we did before making a 
 chain from one end of his genealogy to the other 
 
 theaet by all means 
 
 str he then who traces the pedigree of his art as 
 belonging to the conscious or dissembling section of the art of 
 causing is an imitator of appearance and is 
 separated from the class of phantastic which is a branch of 
 into that further division of creation the juggling of 
 words a creation human and not one who affirms the real 
 sophist to be of this blood and lineage will say the very truth 
 
 theaet undoubtedly 
 
 the end
