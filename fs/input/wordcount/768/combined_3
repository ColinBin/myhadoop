 athenian stranger next with the help of the delphian oracle wehave to institute festivals and make laws about them and to determinewhat sacrifices will be for the good of the city and to what godsthey shall be offered but when they shall be offered and howoften may be partly regulated by us 
 cleinias the 
 ath then we will first determine the number and let the wholenumber be one for every that one magistrate at least willsacrifice daily to some god or on behalf of the city and thecitizens and their possessions and the interpreters and priestesses and prophets shall meet and in company with theguardians of the law ordain those things which the legislator ofnecessity omits and i may remark that they are the very persons whoought to take note of what is omitted the law will say that there aretwelve feasts dedicated to the twelve gods after whom the severaltribes are named and that to each of them they shall sacrificeevery month and appoint choruses and musical and gymnastic them so as to suit the gods and seasons of the year andthey shall have festivals for women distinguishing those whichought to be separated from the festivals and those whichought not further they shall not confuse the infernal deities andtheir rites with the gods who are termed heavenly and their rites butshall separate them giving to pluto his own in the twelfth is sacred to him according to the law to such a deitywarlike men should entertain no aversion but they should honour himas being always the best friend of man for the connection of soul andbody is no way better than the dissolution of them as i am ready tomaintain quite seriously moreover those who would regulate thesematters rightly should consider that our city among existing citieshas fellow either in respect of leisure or comin and of thenecessaries of life and that like an individual she ought to livehappily and those who would live happily should in the first place dono wrong to one another and ought not themselves to be wronged byothers to attain the first is not difficult but there is greatdifficulty in acquiring the power of not being wronged no man can beperfectly secure against wrong unless he has become perfectly cities are like individuals in this for a city if good has a lifeof peace but if evil a life of war within and without wherefore thecitizens ought to practise in time of war but rather whilethey are at peace and every city which has any sense should take thefield at least for one day in every month and for more if themagistrates think fit having no regard to winter cold or summer they should go out en masse including their wives and theirchildren when the magistrates determine to lead forth the wholepeople or in separate portions when summoned by them and they shouldalways provide that there should be games and sacrificial they should have tournaments imitating in as lively a manner asthey can real battles and they should distribute prizes of victoryand valour to the competitors passing censures and encomiums on oneanother according to the characters which they bear in the contestsand their whole life honouring him who seems to be the best andblaming him who is the opposite and let poets celebrate however every poet but only one who in the first place isnot less than fifty years of age nor should he be one who althoughhe may have musical and poetical gifts has never in his life done anynoble or illustrious action but those who are themselves good andalso honourable in the state creators of noble theirpoems be sung even though they be not very musical and let thejudgment of them rest with the instructor of youth and the otherguardians of the laws who shall give them this privilege and theyalone shall be free to sing but the rest of the world shall nothave this liberty nor shall any one dare to sing a song which has notbeen approved by the judgment of the guardians of the laws not evenif his strain be sweeter than the songs of thamyras and orpheus butonly and orpheus but only such poems as have been judged sacred anddedicated to the gods and such as are the works of good men whichpraise of blame has been awarded and which have been deemed tofulfil their design fairly 
 the regulations about and about liberty of speech in poitry oughtto apply equally to men and women the legislator may be supposed toargue the question in his own are my citizens for whom ihave set in order the city are they not competitors in the greatestof all contests and have they not innumerable rivals to be be the natural reply well but if we were training boxers orpancratiasts or any other sort of athletes would they never meetuntil the hour of contest arrived and should we do nothing to prepareourselves previously by daily practice surely if we were boxers weshould have been learning to fight for many days before andexercising ourselves in imitating all those blows and wards which wewere intending to use in the hour of conflict and in order that wemight come as near to reality as possible instead of cestuses weshould put on boxing gloves that the blows and the wards might bepractised by us to the utmost of our power and if there were a lackof competitors the ridicule of fools would ryot deter us from hangingup a lifeless image and practising at that or if we had noadversary at all animate or inanimate should we not venture in thedearth of antagonists to spar by ourselves in what other manner couldwe ever study the art of 
 cle the way which you mention stranger would be the only way 
 ath and shall the warriors of our city who are destined whenoccasion calli to enter the greatest of all contests and to fight fortheir lives and their children and their property and the wholecity be worse prepared than boxers and will the he is afraid that their practising with one another may appearto some ridiculous abstain from commanding them to go out andfight will he not ordain that soldiers shall perform lesser exerciseswithout arms every day making dancing and all gymnastic tend tothis end and also will he not require that they shall practise somegymnastic exercises greater as well as lesser as often as everymonth and that they shall have contests one with another in everypart of the country seizing upon posts and lying in ambush andimitating in every respect the reality of war fighting and hurling javelins and using weapons somewhatdangerous and as nearly as possible like the true ones in order thatthe sport may not be altogether without fear but may have terrors andto a certain degree show the man who has and who has not that the honour and dishonour which are assigned to themrespectively may prepare the whole city for the true conflict oflife if any one dies in these mimic contests the homicide isinvoluntary and we will make the slayer when he has been purifiedaccording to law to be pure of blood considering that if a few menshould die others as good as they will be born but that if fear isdead then the citizens will never find a test of superior and inferiornatures which is a far greater evil to the state than the loss of afew 
 cle we are quite agreed stranger that we should legislate aboutsuch things and that the whole state should practise them supposed 
 ath and what is the reason that dances and contests of this sorthardly ever exist in states at least not to any extent worth speakingof is this due to the ignorance of mankind and their legislators 
 cle perhaps 
 ath certainly not sweet cleinias there are two causes whichare quite enough to account for the deficiency 
 cle what are they 
 ath one cause is the love of wealth which wholly absorbs never for a moment allows them to think of anything but theirown private possessions on this the soul of every citizen hangssuspended and can attend to nothing but his daily gain mankind areready to learn any branch of knowledge and to follow any pursuitwhich tends to this end and they laugh at every is onereason why a city will not be in earnest about such contests or anyother good and honourable pursuit but from an insatiable love of goldand silver every man will stoop to any art or contrivance seemlyor unseemly in the hope of becoming rich and will make noobjection to performing any action holy or unholy and utterlybase if only like a beast he have the power of eating and drinkingall kinds of things and procuring for himself in every sort of waythe gratification of his lusts 
 cle true 
 ath let this then be deemed one of the causes which preventstates from pursuing in an efficient manner the art of war or anyother noble aim but makes the orderly and temperate part of mankindinto merchants and captains of ships and servants and convertsthe valiant sort into thieves and burglars and robbers of temples andviolent tyrannical persons many of whom are not without ability butthey are unfortunate 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath must not they be truly unfortunate whose souls are compelled topass through life always hungering 
 cle then that is one cause stranger but you spoke of another 
 ath thank you for reminding me 
 cle the insatiable life long love of wealth as you were sayingis one clause which absorbs mankind and prevents them from rightlypractising the arts of and now tell me what is theother 
 ath do you imagine that i delay because i am in a perplexity 
 cle no but we think that you are too severe upon temper of which you seem in the present discussion tohave a peculiar dislike 
 ath that is a very fair rebuke cleinias and i will now proceedto the second cause 
 cle proceed 
 ath i say that governments are a concerning which i have often spoken in the previousdiscourse or rather governments they are not for none of themexercises a voluntary rule over voluntary subjects but they may betruly called states of discord in which while the government isvoluntary the subjects always obey against their will and have to becoerced and the ruler fears the subject and will not if he canhelp allow him to become either noble or rich or strong orvaliant or warlike at all these two are the chief causes of almostall evils and of the evils of which i have been speaking they arenotably the causes but our state has escaped both of them for hercitizens have the greatest leisure and they are not subject to oneanother and will i think be made by these laws the reverse oflovers of money such a constitution may be reasonably supposed tobe the only one existing which will accept the education which we havedescribed and the martial pastimes which have been perfectedaccording to our idea 
 cle true 
 ath then next we must remember about all gymnastic only the warlike sort of them are to be practised and to haveprizes of victory and those which are not military are to be givenup the military sort had better be completely described andestablished by law and first let us speak of running and swiftness 
 cle very good 
 ath certainly the most military of all qualities is generalactivity of body whether of foot or hand for escaping or forcapturing an enemy quickness of foot is required but and combat need vigour and strength 
 cle very true 
 ath neither of them can attain their greatest efficiency withoutarms 
 cle how can they 
 ath then our herald in accordance with the prevailing first summon the will appear armed for to anunarmed competitor we will not give a prize and he shall enterfirst who is to run the single course bearing arms next he who is torun the double course third he who is to run the andfourthly he who is to run the long course the fifth whom we be the first sent forth in heavy armour and shall run acourse of sixty stadia to some temple of we will send forthanother whom we will style the more heavily armed to run oversmoother ground there remains the archer and he shall run in thefull equipments of an archer a distance of stadia overmountains and across every sort of country to a temple of apollo andartemis this shall be the order of the contest and we will waitfor them until they return and will give a prize to the conquerorin each 
 cle very good 
 ath let us suppose that there are three kinds of ofboys another of beardless youths and a third of men for theyouths we will fix the length of the contest at and forthe boys at half of the entire course whether they contend as archersor as heavy armed touching the women let the girls who are not grownup compete naked in the stadium and the double course and and the long course and let them run on itself those who are thirteen years of age and upwardsuntil their marriage shall continue to share in contests if they arenot more than twenty and shall be compelled to run up to they shall descend into the arena in suitable dresses let thesebe the regulations about contests in running both for men and women 
 respecting contests of strength instead of wrestling and similarcontests of the heavier sort we will institute conflicts in armour ofone against one and two against two and so on up to ten against to what a man ought not to suffer or do and to what extent inorder to gain the in wrestling the masters of the art havelaid down what is fair and what is not fair so in fighting ought to call in skilful persons who shall judge for us andbe our assessors in the work of legislation they shall say whodeserves to be victor in combats of this sort and what he is not todo or have done to him and in like manner what rule determines who isdefeated and let these ordinances apply to women until they marriedas well as to men the pancration shall have a counterpart in a combatof the light armed they shall contend with bows and with lightshields and with javelins and in the throwing of stones by slingsand by hand and laws shall be made about it and rewards and prizesgiven to him who best fulfils the ordinances of the law 
 next in order we shall have to legislate about the horse we do not need many horses for they cannot be of much use in acountry like crete and hence we naturally do not take great painsabout the rearing of them or about horse races there is no one whokeeps a chariot among us and any rivalry in such matters would bealtogether out of place there would be no sense nor any shadow ofsense in instituting contests which are not after the manner of ourcountry and therefore we give our prizes for single who have not yet cast their teeth and for those who areintermediate and for the horses themselves and thus ourequestrian games will accord with the nature of the country letthem have conflict and rivalry in these matters in accordance with thelaw and let the colonels and generals of horse decide togetherabout all courses and about the armed competitors in them but we havenothing to say to the unarmed either in gymnastic exercises or inthese contests on the other hand the cretan bowman or fights in armour on horseback is useful and therefore we may aswell place a competition of this sort among amusements women arenot to be forced to compete by laws and ordinances but if fromprevious training they have acquired the habit and are strong enoughand like to take part let them do so girls as well as boys and noblame to them 
 thus the competition in gymnastic and the mode of learning it havebeen described and we have spoken also of the toils of the of daily exercises under the superintendence of masters relates to music has been for the most part completed but asto rhapsodes and the like and the contests of choruses which are toperform at feasts all this shall be arranged when the months and daysand years have been appointed for gods and whether everythird year or again every fifth year or in whatever way or mannerthe gods may put into minds the distribution and order ofthem at the same time we may expect that the musical contests willbe celebrated in their turn by the command of the judges and thedirector of education and the guardians of the law meeting togetherfor this purpose and themselves becoming legislators of the times andnature and conditions of the choral contests and of dancing ingeneral what they ought severally to be in language and song andin the admixture of harmony with rhythm and the dance has beenoften declared by the original legislator and his successors ought tofollow him making the games and sacrifices duly to correspond atfitting times and appointing public festivals it is not difficult todetermine how these and the like matters may have a regular again will the alteration of them do any great good or harm tothe state there is however another matter of great importance anddifficulty concerning which god should legislate if there were anypossibility of obtaining from him an ordinance about it but seeingthat divine aid is not to be had there appears to be a need of somebold man who specially honours plainness of speech and will sayoutright what he thinks best for the city and is good and convenient for the whole state amid the corruptionsof human souls opposing the mightiest lusts and having no man hishelper but himself standing alone and following reason only 
 cle what is this stranger that you are saying for we do not asyet understand your meaning 
 ath very likely i will endeavour to explain myself more i came to the subject of education i beheld young men andmaidens holding friendly intercourse with one another and therenaturally arose in my mind a sort of could not helpthinking how one is to deal with a city in which youths and maidensare well nurtured and have nothing to do and are not undergoingthe excessive and servile toils which extinguish wantonness and whoseonly cares during their whole life are sacrifices and festivals anddances how in such a state as this will they abstain from desireswhich thrust many a man and woman into perdition and from whichreason assuming the functions of law commands them to abstain theordinances already made may possibly get the better of most of thesedesires the prohibition of excessive wealth is a very considerablegain in the direction of temperance and the whole education of ouryouth imposes a law of moderation on them moreover the eye of therulers is required always to watch over the young and never to losesight of them and these provisions do as far as human means caneffect anything exercise a regulating influence upon the desires ingeneral but how can we take precautions against the unnatural lovesof either sex from which innumerable evils have come upon individualsand cities how shall we devise a remedy and way of escape out of sogreat a danger truly cleinias here is a difficulty in many wayscrete and lacedaemon furnish a great help to those who make peculiarlaws but in the matter of love as we are alone i must confessthat they are quite against us for if any one following nature shouldlay down the law which existed before the days of laius anddenounce these lusts as contrary to nature adducing the animals asa proof that such unions were monstrous he might prove his point buthe would be wholly at variance with the custom of your they are repugnant to a principle which we say that alegislator should always observe for we are always enquiring which ofour enactments tends to virtue and which not and suppose we grantthat these loves are accounted by law to be honourable or at leastnot disgraceful in what degree will they contribute to virtue willsuch passions implant in the soul of him who is seduced the habit ofcourage or in the soul of the seducer the principle of will ever believe rather who will not blame theeffeminacy of him who yields to pleasures and is unable to hold outagainst them will not all men censure as womanly him who imitates thewoman and who would ever think of establishing such a practice bylaw certainly no one who had in his mind the image of true law howcan we prove that what i am saying is true he who would rightlyconsider these matters must see the nature of friendship and of these loves for they are of two kinds and out ofthe two arises a third kind having the same name and this similarityof name causes all the difficulty and obscurity 
 cle how is that 
 ath dear is the like in virtue to the like and the equal to theequal dear also though unlike is he who has abundance to him who isin want and when either of these friendships becomes excessive weterm the excess love 
 cle very true 
 ath the friendship which arises from contraries is horrible andcoarse and has often no tie of communion but that which arises fromlikeness is gentle and has a tie of communion which lasts throughlife as to the mixed sort which is made up of them both there of all a in determining what he who is possessed by thisthird love desires moreover he is drawn different ways and is indoubt between the two principles the one exhorting him to enjoy thebeauty of youth and the other forbidding him for the one is alover of the body and hungers after beauty like ripe fruit andwould fain satisfy himself without any regard to the character ofthe beloved the other holds the desire of the body to be asecondary matter and looking rather than loving and with his souldesiring the soul of the other in a becoming manner regards thesatisfaction of the bodily love as wantonness he reverences andrespects temperance and courage and magnanimity and wisdom and wishesto live chastely with the chaste object of his affection now the sortof love which is made up of the other two is that which we havedescribed as the third seeing then that there are these three sortsof love ought the law to prohibit and forbid them all to existamong us is it not rather clear that we should wish to have in thestate the love which is of virtue and which desires the belovedyouth to be the best possible and the other two if possible weshould hinder what do you say friend megillus 
 megillus i think stranger that you are perfectly right in whatyou have been now saying 
 ath i knew well my friend that i should obtain your assent whichi accept and therefore have no need to analyse your custom anyfurther cleinias shall be prevailed upon to give me his assent atsome other time enough of this and now let us proceed to the laws 
 meg very good 
 ath upon reflection i see a way of imposing the law which inone respect is easy but in another is of the utmost difficulty 
 meg what do you mean 
 ath we are all aware that most men in spite of their lawlessnatures are very strictly and precisely restrained from intercoursewith the fair and this is not at all against their will but entirelywith their will 
 meg when do you mean 
 ath when any one has a brother or sister who is fair and about ason or daughter the same unwritten law holds and is a most perfectsafeguard so that no open or secret connection ever takes placebetween them nor does the thought of such a thing ever enter at allinto the minds of most of them 
 meg very true 
 ath does not a little word extinguish all pleasures of that sort 
 meg what word 
 ath the declaration that they are unholy hated of god and mostinfamous and is not the reason of this that no one has ever saidthe opposite but every one from his earliest childhood has heardmen speaking in the same manner about them always and in comedy or in the graver language of tragedy when thepoet introduces on the stage a thyestes or an oedipus or a macareushaving secret intercourse with his sister he represents him whenfound out ready to kill himself as the penalty of his sin 
 meg you are very right in saying that tradition if no breath ofopposition ever assails it has a marvellous power 
 ath am i not also right in saying that the legislator who wantsto master any of the passions which master man may easily know howto subdue them he will consecrate the tradition of their evilcharacter among all slaves and freemen women and the will be the surest foundation of the lawwhich he can make 
 meg yes but will he ever succeed in making all mankind use thesame language about them 
 ath a good objection but was i not just now saying that i had away to make men use natural love and abstain from unnatural notintentionally destroying the seeds of human increase or sowing themin stony places in which they will take no root and that i wouldcommand them to abstain too from any female field of increase in whichthat which is sown is not likely to grow now if a law to thiseffect could only be made perpetual and gain an authority such asalready prevents intercourse of parents and a to other sensual desires and conquering them would bethe source of ten thousand blessings for in the first is the appointment of nature and deters men from allfrenzy and madness of love and from all adulteries and immoderate useof meats and drinks and makes them good friends to their own innumerable other benefits would result if such a could only beenforced i can imagine some lusty youth who is standing by andwho on hearing this enactment declares in scurrilous terms that weare making foolish and impossible laws and fills the world with hisoutcry and therefore i said that i knew a way of enacting andperpetuating such a law which was very easy in one respect but inanother most difficult there is no difficulty in seeing that such alaw is possible and in what way for as i was saying theordinance once consecrated would master the soul of every man andterrify him into obedience but matters have now come to such a passthat even then the desired result seems as if it could not beattained just as the continuance of an entire state in the practiceof common meals is also deemed impossible and although this latter ispartly disproven by the fact of their existence among you stilleven in your cities the common meals of women would be regarded asunnatural and impossible i was thinking of the rebelliousness ofthe human heart when i said that the permanent establishment ofthese things is very difficult 
 meg very true 
 ath shall i try and find some sort of persuasive argument whichwill prove to you that such enactments are possible and not beyondhuman nature 
 cle by all means 
 ath is a man more likely to abstain from the pleasures of loveand to do what he is bidden about them when his body is in a goodcondition or when he is in an ill condition and out of training 
 cle he will be far more temperate when he is in training 
 ath and have we not heard of iccus of tarentum who with a view tothe olympic and other contests in his zeal for his art ind alsobecause he was of a manly and temperate disposition never had anyconnection with a woman or a youth during the whole time of histraining and the same is said of crison and astylus and diopompus andmany others and yet cleinias they were far worse educated intheir minds than your and my citizens and in their bodies far morelusty 
 cle no doubt this fact has been often affirmed positively by theancients of these athletes 
 ath and had they courage to abstain from what is ordinarillydeemed a pleasure for the sake of a victory in wrestling running andthe like and shall our young men be incapable of a similarendurance for the sake of a much nobler victory which is thenoblest of all as from their youth upwards we will tell them as we hope into the belief of this by tales andsayings and songs 
 cle of what victory are you speaking 
 ath of the victory over pleasure which if they win they will livehappily or if they are conquered the reverse of happily may we not suppose that the fear of impiety will enablethem to master that which other inferior people have mastered 
 cle i dare say 
 ath and since we have reached this point in our legislation andhave fallen into a difficulty by reason of the vices of mankind iaffirm that our ordinance should simply run in the following citizens ought not to fall below the nature of birds and beasts ingeneral who are born in great multitudes and yet remain until theage for procreation virgin and unmarried but when they have reachedthe proper time of life are coupled male and female and lovinglypair together and live the rest of their lives in holiness andinnocence abiding firmly in their original we willsay to them you should be better than the animals but if they arecorrupted by the other hellenes and the common practice of they see with their eyes and hear with their ears of the love everywhere prevailing among them and they themselves arenot able to get the better of the temptation the guardians of thelaw exercising the functions of lawgivers shall devise a secondlaw against them 
 cle and what law would you advise them to pass if this one failed 
 ath clearly cleinias the one which would naturally follow 
 cle what is that 
 ath our citizens should not allow pleasures to strengthen withindulgence but should by toil divert the aliment and exuberance ofthem into other parts of the body and this will happen if noimmodesty be allowed in the practice of love then they will beashamed of frequent intercourse and they will find pleasure ifseldom enjoyed to be a less imperious mistress they should not befound out doing anything of the sort concealment shall be sanctioned by custom and made law by unwritten prescription onthe other hand to be detected shall be esteemed dishonourable butnot to abstain wholly in this way there will be a second legalstandard of honourable and dishonourable involving a second notion ofright three principles will comprehend all those corrupt natures whomwe call inferior to themselves and who form but one dass and willcompel them not to transgress 
 cle what are they 
 ath the principle of piety the love of honour and the desire ofbeauty not in the body but in the soul these are aspirations but they are the noblest of aspirations if theycould only be realized in all states and god willing in thematter of love we may be able to enforce one of two thatno one shall venture to touch any person of the freeborn or nobleclass except his wedded wife or sow the unconsecrated and bastardseed among harlots or in barren and unnatural lusts or at least wemay abolish altogether the connection of men with men and as towomen if any man has to do with any but those who come into his houseduly married by sacred rites whether they be bought or acquired inany other way and he offends publicly in the face of all shall be right in enacting that he be deprived of civic honours andprivileges and be deemed to be as he truly is a stranger letthis law then whether it is one or ought rather to be called laid down respecting love in general and the intercourse of thesexes which arises out of the desires whether rightly or wronglyindulged 
 meg i for my part stranger would gladly receive this shall speak for himself and tell you what is his opinion 
 cle i will megillus when an opportunity offers at present ithink that we had better allow the stranger to proceed with his laws 
 meg very good 
 ath we had got about as far as the establishment of the commontables which in most places would be difficult but in crete no onewould think of introducing any other custom there might arise aquestion about the manner of they shall be such as theyare here in crete or such as they are in is there athird kind which may be better than either of them the answer to thisquestion might be easily discovered but the discovery would do nogreat good for at present they are very well ordered 
 leaving the common tables we may therefore proceed to the meansof providing food now in cities the means of life are gained in manyways and from divers sources and in general from two sources whereasour city has only one for most of the hellenes obtain their food fromsea and land but our citizens from land only and this makes the taskof the legislator less as many laws will be enough andmuch less than half and they will be of a kind better suited tofree men for he has nothing to do with laws about shipowners andmerchants and retailers and innkeepers and tax collectors and minesand moneylending and compound interest and innumerable to these he gives laws to husbandmen andshepherds and and to the guardians and superintendents oftheir implements and he has already legislated for greater for example respecting marriage and the procreation and nurture ofchildren and for education and the establishment of he must direct his laws to those who provide food and labour inpreparing it 
 let us first of all then have a class of laws which shall becalled the laws of husbandmen and let the first of them be the law ofzeus the god of boundaries let no one shift the boundary line eitherof a who is a neighbour or if he dwells at theextremity of the land of any stranger who is conterminous with that this is truly to move the immovable and everyone should be more willing to move the largest rock which is not alandmark than the least stone which is the sworn mark of friendshipand hatred between neighbours for zeus the god of kindred is thewitness of the citizen and zeus the god of strangers of thestranger and when aroused terrible are the wars which they stirup he who obeys the law will never know the fatal consequences ofdisobedience but he who despises the law shall be liable to adouble penalty the first coming from the gods and the second fromthe law for let no one wilfully remove the boundaries of land and if any one does let him who will inform thelandowners and let them bring him into court and if he beconvicted of the land by stealth or by force let thecourt determine what he ought to suffer or pay in the next small injuries done by neighbours to one another through theirmultiplication may cause a weight of enmity and make neighbourhood avery disagreeable and bitter thing wherefore a man ought to be verycareful of committing any offence against his neighbour andespecially of encroaching on his land for any man mayeasily do harm but not every man can do good to another he whoencroaches on his land and transgresses his make good the damage and to cure him of his impudence and alsoof his meanness he shall pay a double penalty to the injured these and the like matters the wardens of the country shall takecognizance and be the judges of them and assessors of the the more important cases as has been already said the wholenumber of them belonging to any one of the twelve divisions shalldecide and in the lesser cases the commanders or again if anyone pastures his cattle on his land they shall see theinjury and adjudge the penalty and if any one by decoying the possession of swarms and draws them to himself bymaking noises he shall pay the damage or if anyone sets fire tohis own wood and takes no care of his property he shallbe fined at the discretion of the magistrates and if in planting hedoes not leave a fair distance between his own and his he shall be punished in accordance with the enactments ofmany law givers which we may use not deeming it necessary that thegreat legislator of our state should determine all the trifles whichmight be decided by any body for example husbandmen have had ofold excellent laws about waters and there is no reason why weshould propose to divert their course who likes may draw water fromthe of the common stream on to his own land if he donot cut off the spring which clearly belongs to some other he may take the water in any direction which he pleases exceptthrough a house or temple or sepulchre but he must be careful to dono harm beyond the channel and if there be in any place a naturaldryness of the earth which keeps in the rain from heaven andcauses a deficiency in the supply of water let him dig down on hisown land as far as the clay and if at this depth he finds no him obtain water from his neighbours as much as is requiredfor his servants drinking and if his neighbours too are limited intheir supply let him have a fixed measure which shall bedetermined by the wardens of the country this he shall receive eachday and on these terms have a share of his neighbours water ifthere be heavy rain and one of those on the lower ground injures sometiller of the upper ground or some one who has a common wall byrefusing to give the man outlet for water or again if some oneliving on the higher ground recklessly lets off the water on his lowerneighbour and they cannot come to terms with one another let him whowill call in a warden of the city if he be in the city or if he bein the country warden of the country and let him obtain a decisiondetermining what each of them is to do and he who will not abide bythe decision shall suffer for his malignant and morose temper and paya fine to the injured party equivalent to double the value of theinjury because he was unwilling to submit to the magistrates 
 now the participation of fruits shall be ordered on this wise thegoddess of autumn has two gracious gifts one the joy of dionysuswhich is not treasured up the other which nature intends to bestored let this be the law then concerning the fruits of autumn hewho tastes the common or storing fruits of autumn whether grapes orfigs before the season of vintage which coincides with on his own land or on that of him pay fiftydrachmae which shall be sacred to dionysus if he pluck them from hisown land and if from his land a mina and if from anyothers of a mina and he who would gather the or the choice figs as they are now termed if he take themoff his own land let him pluck them how and when he likes but ifhe take them from the ground of others without their leave let him inthat case be always punished in accordance with the law whichordains that he should not move what he has not laid down and if aslave touches any fruit of this sort without the consent of the ownerof the land he shall be beaten with as many blows as there are grapeson the bunch or figs on the let a metic purchase autumnal fruit and then if he pleases he may gather if a stranger is passing along the road and desires to eat lethim take of the choice grapes for himself and a single followerwithout payment as a tribute of hospitality the law howeverforbids strangers from sharing in the sort which is not used foreating and if any one whether he be master or slave takes of themin ignorance let the slave be beaten and the freeman dismissedwith admonitions and instructed to take of the other autumnalfruits which are unfit for making raisins and wine or for laying byas dried figs as to pears and apples and pomegranates andsimilar fruits there shall be no disgrace in taking them he who is caught if he be of less than thirty years of age shallbe struck and beaten off but not wounded and no freeman shall haveany right of satisfaction for such blows of these fruits the strangermay partake just as he may of the fruits of autumn and if anelder who is more than thirty years of age eat of them on thespot let him like the stranger be allowed to partake of all suchfruits but he must carry away nothing if however he will notobey the law let him run risk of failing in the competition ofvirtue in case any one takes notice of his actions before thejudges at the time 
 water is the greatest element of nutrition in gardens but is easilypolluted you cannot poison the soil or the soil or the sun orthe air which are other elements of nutrition in plants or divertthem or steal them but all these things may very likely happen inregard to water which must therefore be protected by law and letthis be the any one intentionally pollutes the water ofanother whether the water of a spring or collected in by poisonous substances or by digging or by theft let theinjured party bring the cause before the wardens of the city andclaim in writing the value of the loss if the accused be found guiltyof injuring the water by deleterious substances let him not onlypay damages but purify the stream or the cistern which contains thewater in such manner as the laws of the interpreters order thepurification to be made by the offender in each case 
 with respect to the gathering in of the fruits of the soil let aman if he pleases carry his own fruits through any place in which heeither does no harm to any one or himself gains three times as muchas his neighbour loses now of these things the magistrates shouldbe cognisant as of all other things in which a man intentionally doesinjury to another or to the property of another by fraud or force inthe use which he makes of his own property all these matters a manshould lay before the magistrates and receive damages supposingthe injury to be not more than three minae or if he have a chargeagainst another which involves a larger amount let him bring his suitinto the public courts and have the punished but if anyof the magistrates appear to adjudge the penalties which he imposes inan unjust spirit let him be liable to pay double to the injuredparty any one may bring the offences of magistrates in anyparticular case before the public courts there are innumerablelittle matters relating to the modes of punishment and applicationsfor suits and summonses and the witnesses to two witnesses should be required for a summons or all such details which cannot be omitted in legislation butare beneath the wisdom of an aged legislator these lesser matters asthey indeed are in comparison with the greater ones let a youngergeneration regulate by law after the patterns which have according to their own experience of the usefulness andnecessity of such laws and when they are duly regulated let therebe no alteration but let the citizens live in the observance of them 
 now of artisans let the regulations be as the firstplace let no citizen or servant of a citizen be occupied inhandicraft arts for he who is to secure and preserve the public orderof the state has an art which requires much study and many kinds ofknowledge and does not admit of being made a secondary hardly any human being is capable of pursuing two professions ortwo arts rightly or of practising one art himself and superintendingsome one else who is practising another let this then be ourfirst principle in the one who is a smith shall also be acarpenter and if he be a carpenter he shall not superintend art rather than his own under the pretext that insuperintending many servants who are working for him he is likelyto superintend them better because more revenue will accrue to himfrom them than from his own art but let every man in the state haveone art and get his living by that let the wardens of the citylabour to maintain this law and if any citizen incline to any otherart than the study of virtue let them punish him with disgrace andinfamy until they bring him back into his own right course and ifany stranger profess two arts let them chastise him with bonds andmoney penalties and expulsion from the state until they compel himto be one only and not many 
 but as touching payments for hire and contracts of work or in caseany one does wrong to any of the citizens or they do wrong to anyother up to fifty drachmae let the wardens of the city decide thecase but if greater amount be involved then let the public courtsdecide according to law let no one pay any duty either on theimportation or exportation of goods and as to frankincense andsimilar perfumes used in the service of the gods which come fromabroad and purple and other dyes which are not produced in thecountry or the materials of any art which have to be imported andwhich are not one should import them nor again shouldany one export anything which is wanted in the country of all thesethings let there be inspectors and superintendents taken from theguardians of the law and they shall be the twelve next in order tothe five seniors concerning arms and all implements which are formilitary purposes if there be need of introducing any art orplant or metal or chains of any kind or animals for use in war letthe commanders of the horse and the generals have authority over theirimportation and exportation the city shall send them out and alsoreceive them and the guardians of the law shall make fit and properlaws about them but let there be no retail trade for the sake either in these or any other articles in the city orcountry at all 
 with respect to food and the distribution of the produce of thecountry the right and proper way seems to be nearly that which is thecustom of crete for all should be required to distribute the fruitsof the soil into twelve parts and in this way consume them let thetwelfth portion of each as for instance of wheat and barley to whichthe rest of the fruits of the earth shall be added as well as theanimals which are for sale in each of the twelve divisions be dividedin due proportion into three parts one part for freemen anotherfor their servants and a third for craftsmen and in general forstrangers whether sojourners who may be dwelling in the city andlike other men must live or those who come on some business whichthey have with the state or with some individual let only this thirdpart of all necessaries be required to be sold out of the no one shall be compelled to sell and how will they bebest distributed in the first place we see clearly that thedistribution will be of equals in one point of view and in anotherpoint of view of unequals 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath i mean that the earth of necessity produces and nourishes thevarious articles of food sometimes better and sometimes worse 
 cle of course 
 ath such being the case let no one of the three portions begreater than either of the other that which is assigned tomasters or to slaves nor again that of the stranger but let thedistribution to all be equal and alike and let every citizen take histwo portions and distribute them among slaves and freemen he havingpower to determine the quantity and quality and what remains he shalldistribute by measure and numb among the animals who have to besustained from the earth taking the whole number of them 
 in the second place our citizens should have separate houses dulyordered and this will be the order proper for men like them thereshall be twelve hamlets one in the middle of each twelfth in each hamlet they shall first set apart a andthe temples of the gods and of their attendant demigods and if therebe any local deities of the magnetes or holy seats of other ancientdeities whose memory has been preserved to these let them paytheir ancient honours but hestia and zeus and athene will havetemples everywhere together with the god who presides in each of thetwelve districts and the first erection of houses shall be aroundthese temples where the ground is highest in order to provide thesafest and most defensible place of retreat for the guards all therest of the country they shall settle in the following make thirteen divisions of the craftsmen one of them they shallestablish in the city and this again they shall subdivide intotwelve lesser divisions among the twelve districts of the city andthe remainder shall be distributed in the country round about andin each village they shall settle various classes of craftsmen with aview to the convenience of the husbandmen and the chief officers ofthe wardens of the country shall superintend all these matters andsee how many of them and which class of them each place fix them where they are likely to be least troublesome and mostuseful to the husbandman and the wardens of the city shall see tosimilar matters in the city 
 now the wardens of the agora ought to see to the details of theagora their first care after the temples which are in the agora havebeen seen to should be to prevent any one from doing any indealings between man and man in the second place as beinginspectors of temperance and violence they should chastise him whorequires chastisement touching articles of gale they should firstsee whether the articles which the citizens are under regulations tosell to strangers are sold to them as the law ordains and let thelaw be as the first day of the month the persons incharge whoever they are whether strangers or slaves who have thecharge on behalf of the citizens shall produce to the strangers theportion which falls to them in the first place a twelfth portionof the stranger shall purchase corn for the whole month andother cereals on the first market day and on the tenth day of themonth the one party shall sell and the other buy liquidssufficient to last during the whole month and on the daythere shall be a sale of animals by those who are willing to sell tothe people who want to buy and of implements and other things whichhusbandmen sell such as skins and all kinds of clothing either wovenor made of felt and other goods of the same sort and which strangersare compelled to buy and purchase of others as to the retail trade inthese things whether of barley or wheat set apart for meal and any other kind of food no one shall sell them to citizens or theirslaves nor shall any one buy of a citizen but let the strangersell them in the market of strangers to artisans and their an exchange of wine and food which is commonly called retailtrade and butchers shall offer for sale parts of dismemberedanimals to the strangers and artisans and their servants let anystranger who likes buy fuel from day to day wholesale from thosewho have the care of it in the country and let him sell to thestrangers as much he pleases and when he pleases as to other goodsand implements which are likely to be wanted they shall sell themin common market at any place which the guardians of the law andthe wardens of the market and city choosing according to theirjudgment shall determine at such places they shall exchange moneyfor goods and goods for money neither party giving credit to theother and he who gives credit must be satisfied whether he obtainhis money not for in such exchanges he will not be protected bylaw but whenever property has been bought or sold greater inquantity or value than is allowed by the law which has determinedwithin what limited a man may increase and diminish his the excess be registered in the books of the guardians of the case of diminution let there be an erasure made and let thesame rule be observed about the registration of the property of themetics any one who likes may come and be a metic on certainconditions a foreigner if he likes and is able to settle may dwellin the land but he must practise an art and not abide more thantwenty years from the time at which he has registered himself andhe shall pay no tax however small except good any other tax for buying and selling but when the twenty yearshave expired he shall take his property with him and depart and ifin the course of these years he should chance to distinguish himselfby any considerable benefit which he confers on the state and hethinks that he can persuade the council and assembly either togrant him delay in leaving the country or to allow him to remainfor the whole of his life let him go and persuade the city andwhatever they assent to at his instance shall take effect for thechildren of the metics being artisans and of fifteen years of the time of their sojourn commence after their fifteenth year andlet them remain for twenty years and then go where they like but anyof them who wishes to remain may do so if he can persuade thecouncil and assembly and if he depart let him erase all theentries which have been made by him in the register kept by themagistrates

 book ix 
 
 next to all the matters which have preceded in the natural orderof legislation will come suits of law of suits those which relateto agriculture have been already described but the more importanthave not been described having mentioned them severally under theirusual names we will proceed to say what punishments are to beinflicted for each offence and who are to be the judges of them 
 cleinias very good 
 athenian stranger there is a sense of disgrace in legislating aswe are about to do for all the details of crime in a state we say is to be well regulated and will be perfectly adapted tothe practice of virtue to assume that in such a state there willarise some one who will be guilty of crimes as heinous as any whichare ever perpetrated in other states and that we must legislate forhim by anticipation and threaten and make laws against him if heshould arise in order to deter him and punish his acts under theidea that he will as i was saying is in a mannerdisgraceful yet seeing that we are not like the ancientlegislators who gave laws to heroes and sons of gods to the popular belief themselves the offspring of the legislating for others who were also the children of divineparents but that we are only men who are legislating for the sonsof men there is no uncharitableness in apprehending that some oneof our citizens may be like a seed which has touched the a heart so hard that it cannot be softened any more thanthose seeds can be softened by fire among our citizens there may bethose who cannot be subdued by all the strength of the laws and fortheir sake though an ungracious task i will proclaim my first lawabout the robbing of temples in case any one should dare to commitsuch a crime i do not expect or imagine that any will ever take the infection but their servants andstrangers and strangers servants may be guilty of many with a view to them especially and yet not without a providenteye to the weakness of human nature generally i will proclaim the lawabout robbers of temples and similar incurable or almost having already agreed that such enactments ought alwaysto have a short prelude we may speak to the criminal whom sometormenting desire by night and by day tempts to go and rob a fewest possible words of admonition and sir wewill say to him the impulse which moves you to rob temples is notan ordinary human malady nor yet a visitation of heaven but amadness which is begotten in a man from ancient and unexpiatedcrimes of his race an this you mustguard with all your might and how you are to guard we will explain toyou when any such thought comes into your mind go and performexpiations go as a suppliant to the temples of the gods who avertevils go to the society of those who are called good men among them tell and yourself try to repeat after them that every manshould honour the noble and the just fly from the company of and turn not back and if your disorder is lightened bythese remedies well and good but if not then acknowledge death tobe nobler than life and depart hence 
 such are the preludes which we sing to all who have thoughts ofunholy and treasonable actions and to him who hearkens to them thelaw has nothing to say but to him who is disobedient when the preludeis over cry with a loud who is taken in the act ofrobbing temples if he be a slave or stranger shall have his evildeed engraven on his face and hands and shall be beaten with asmany stripes as may seem good to the judges and be cast nakedbeyond the borders of the land and if he suffers this punishment hewill probably return to his right mind and be improved for no penaltywhich the law inflicts is designed for evil but always makes himwho suffers either better or not so much worse as he would havebeen but if any citizen be found guilty of any great or unmentionablewrong either in relation to the gods or his parents or the the judge deem him to be incurable remembering that afterreceiving such an excellent education and training from youthupward he has not abstained from the greatest of crimes hispunishment shall be death which to him will be the least of his example will benefit others if he perish ingloriously and becast beyond the borders of the land but let his children andfamily if they avoid the ways of their father have glory and lethonourable mention be made of them as having nobly and manfullyescaped out of evil into good none of them should have their goodsconfiscated to the state for the lots of the citizens ought always tocontinue the same and equal 
 touching the exaction of penalties when a man appears to havedone anything which deserves a fine he shall pay the fine if he haveanything in excess of the lot which is assigned to him but morethan that he shall not pay and to secure exactness let the guardiansof the law refer to the registers and inform the judges of theprecise truth in order that none of the lots may go uncultivatedfor want of money but if any one seems to deserve a greaterpenalty let him undergo a long and public imprisonment and bedishonoured unless some of his friends are willing to be surety forhim and liberate him by assisting him to pay the fine no criminalshall go unpunished not even for a single offence nor if he havefled the country but let the penalty be according to or bonds or blows or degrading places of sitting orstanding or removal to some temple on the borders of the land or lethim pay fines as we said before in cases of death let the judges bethe guardians of the law and a court selected by merit from thelast magistrates but how the causes are to be brought intoto court how the summonses are to be served the like these thingsmay be left to the younger generation of legislators to determine themanner of voting we must determine ourselves 
 let the vote be given openly but before they come to the vote letthe judges sit in order of seniority over against plaintiff anddefendant and let all the citizens who can spare time hear and take aserious interest in listening to such causes first of all theplaintiff shall make one speech and then the defendant shall makeanother and after the speeches have been made the eldest judgeshall begin to examine the parties and proceed to make an adequateenquiry into what has been said and after the oldest has rest shall proceed in order to examine either party as to whathe finds defective in the evidence whether of statement oromission and he who has nothing to ask shall hand over theexamination to another and on so much of what has been said as isto the purpose all the judges shall set their seals and place thewritings on the altar of hestia on the next day they shall meetagain and in like manner put their questions and go through thecause and again set their seals upon the evidence and when they havethree times done this and have had witnesses and evidence shall each of them give a holy vote after promising by hestiathat they will decide justly and truly to the utmost of their so they shall put an end to the suit 
 next after what relates to the gods follows what relates to thedissolution of the by promoting a man to power enslavesthe laws and subjects the city to factions using violence andstirring up sedition contrary to law him we will deem the greatestenemy of the whole state but he who takes no part in suchproceedings and being one of the chief magistrates of the state hasno knowledge of the treason or having knowledge of it by reasonof cowardice does not interfere on behalf of his country such anone we must consider nearly as bad every man who is worth anythingwill inform the magistrates and bring the conspirator to trial formaking a violent and illegal attempt to change the government thejudges of such cases shall be the same as of the robbers of let the whole proceeding be carried on in the same way and thevote of the majority condemn to death but let there be a generalrule that the disgrace and punishment of the father is not to bevisited on the children except in the case of some one whosefather grandfather and have successively undergonethe penalty of death such persons the city shall send away with alltheir possessions to the city and country of their only and wholly their appointed lot and out of the citizenswho have more than one son of not less than ten years of age theyshall select ten whom their father or grandfather by the side shall appoint and let them send to delphi the namesof those who are selected and him whom the god chooses they shallestablish as heir of the house which has failed and may he havebetter fortune than his predecessors 
 cle very good 
 ath once more let there be a third general law respecting thejudges who are to give judgment and the manner of conducting suitsagainst those who are tried on an accusation of treason and asconcerning the remaining or departure of their shallbe one law for all three for the traitor and the robber oftemples and the subverter by violence of the laws of the state for athief whether he steal much or little let there be one law andone punishment for all alike in the first place let him pay doublethe amount of the theft if he be convicted and if he have so muchover and above the he have not he shall be bounduntil he pay the penalty or persuade him has obtained the sentenceagainst him to forgive him but if a person be convicted of a theftagainst the state then if he can persuade the city or if he will payback twice the amount of the theft he shall be set free from hisbonds 
 cle what makes you say stranger that a theft is all the thief may have taken much or little and either fromsacred or secular these are not the only differences then that they are of many kinds ought not thelegislator to adapt himself to them and impose upon them entirelydifferent penalties 
 ath excellent i was running on too fast cleinias and youimpinged upon me and brought me to my senses reminding me of had occurred to mind already that legislation was never yetrightly worked out as i may say in you remember the imagein which i likened the men for whom laws are now made to slaves whoare doctored by slaves for of this you may be very sure that ifone of those empirical physicians who practise medicine withoutscience were to come upon the gentleman physician talking to hisgentleman patient and using the language almost of at the beginning of the disease and discoursing about thewhole nature of the body he would burst into a hearty say what most of those who are called doctors always have attheir fellow he would say you are nothealing the sick man but you are educating him and he does notwant to be made a doctor but to get well 
 cle and would he not be right 
 ath perhaps he would and he might remark upon us that he whodiscourses about laws as we are now doing is giving the citizenseducation and not laws that would be rather a telling observation 
 cle very true 
 ath but we are fortunate 
 cle in what way 
 ath inasmuch as we are not compelled to give laws but we maytake into consideration every form of government and ascertain whatis best and what is most needful and how they may both be carriedinto execution and we may also if we please at this very momentchoose what is best or if we prefer what is most we do 
 cle there is something ridiculous stranger in our proposing suchan alternative as if we were legislators simply bound under somegreat necessity which cannot be deferred to the morrow but we as imay by grace of heaven affirm like gatherers of stones orbeginners of some composite work may gather a heap of out of this at our leisure select what is suitable for ourprojected construction let us then suppose ourselves to be atleisure not of necessity building but rather like men who are partlyproviding materials and partly putting them together and we maytruly say that some of our laws like stones are already fixed intheir places and others lie at hand 
 ath certainly in that case cleinias our view of law will be morein accordance with nature for there is another matter affectinglegislators which i must earnestly entreat you to consider 
 cle what is it 
 ath there are many writings to be found in cities and among themthere are composed by legislators as well as by other persons 
 cle to be sure 
 ath shall we give heed rather to the writings of those the like who either in metre or out of metre have recordedtheir advice about the conduct of life and not to the writings oflegislators or shall we give heed to them above all 
 cle yes to them far above all others 
 ath and ought the legislator alone among writers to withhold hisopinion about the beautiful the good and the just and not toteach what they are and how they are to be pursued by those whointend to be happy 
 cle certainly not 
 ath and is it disgraceful for homer and tyrtaeus and other poets tolay down evil precepts in their writings respecting life and thepursuits of men but not so disgraceful for lycurgus and solon andothers who were legislators as well as writers is it not true that ofall the writings to be found in cities those which relate to you unfold and read them ought to be by far the noblest andthe best and should not other writings either agree with them orif they disagree be deemed ridiculous we should consider whether thelaws of states ought not to have the character of loving and wiseparents rather than of tyrants and masters who command and after writing their decrees on walls go their ways and discoursing of laws we should not take the gentler view of themwhich may or may not be any rate we will show ourreadiness to entertain such a view and be prepared to undergowhatever may be the result and may the result be good and if godbe gracious it will be good 
 cle excellent let us do as you say 
 ath then we will now consider accurately as we proposed whatrelates to robbers of temples and all kinds of thefts and offencesin general and we must not be annoyed if in the course oflegislation we have enacted some things and have not made up ourminds about some others for as yet we are not legislators but we maysoon be let us if you please consider these matters 
 cle by all means 
 ath concerning all things honourable and just let us thenendeavour to ascertain how far we are consistent with ourselves andhow far we are inconsistent and how far the many from whom at anyrate we should profess a desire to differ agree and disagree amongthemselves 
 cle what are the inconsistencies which you observe in us 
 ath i will endeavour to explain if i am not mistaken we are allagreed that justice and just men and things and actions are allfair and if a person were to maintain that just men even whenthey are deformed in body are still perfectly beautiful in respect ofthe excellent justice of their minds no one would say that therewas any inconsistency in this 
 cle they would be quite right 
 ath perhaps but let us consider further that if all thingswhich are just are fair and honourable in the term all we mustinclude just sufferings which are the correlatives of just actions 
 cle and what is the inference 
 ath the inference is that a just action in partaking of the justpartakes also in the same degree of the fair and honourable 
 cle certainly 
 ath and must not a suffering which partakes of the just principlebe admitted to be in the same degree fair and honourable if theargument is consistently carried out 
 cle true 
 ath but then if we admit suffering to be just and yetdishonourable and the term dishonourable is applied to not the just and the honourable disagree 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath a thing not difficult to understand the laws which have beenalready enacted would seem to announce principles directly opposedto what we are saying 
 cle to what 
 ath we had enacted if i am not mistaken that the robber oftemples and he who was the enemy of law and order might justly beput to death and we were proceeding to make divers other enactmentsof a similar nature but we stopped short because we saw that thesesufferings are infinite in number and degree and that they are atonce the most just and also the most dishonourable of all if this be true are not the just and the honourable at one timeall the same and at another time in the most diametrical opposition 
 cle such appears to be the case 
 ath in this discordant and inconsistent fashion does the languageof the many rend asunder the honourable and just 
 cle very true stranger 
 ath then now cleinias let us see how far we ourselves areconsistent about these matters 
 cle consistent in what 
 ath i think that i have clearly stated in the former part of thediscussion but if i did not let me now state 
 cle what 
 ath that all bad men are always involuntarily bad and from thismust proceed to draw a further inference 
 cle what is it 
 ath that the unjust man may be bad but that he is bad againsthis will now that an action which is voluntary should be doneinvoluntarily is a contradiction wherefore he who maintains thatinjustice is involuntary will deem that the unjust does injusticeinvoluntarily i too admit that all men do injustice if any contentious or disputatious person says that men are unjustagainst their will and yet that many do injustice willingly i do notagree with him but then how can i avoid being inconsistent withmyself if you cleinias and you megillus say to all this be as you say how about legislating for the city of we legislate or do you advise certainly wewill i should reply then will you determine for them what arevoluntary and what are involuntary crimes and shall we make thepunishments greater of voluntary errors and crimes and less for theinvoluntary or shall we make the punishment of all to be alike underthe idea that there is no such thing as voluntary crime 
 cle very good stranger and what shall we say in answer to theseobjections 
 ath that is a very fair question in the first place let us 
 cle do what 
 ath let us remember what has been well said by us already that ourideas of justice are in the highest degree confused and this in mind let us proceed to ask ourselves once morewhether we have discovered a way out of the difficulty have we everdetermined in what respect these two classes of actions differ fromone another for in all states and by all legislators kinds of actions have been one voluntary theother involuntary and they have legislated about them shall this new word of ours like an oracle of god be onlyspoken and get away without giving any explanation or verification ofitself how can a word not understood be the basis of before proceeding to legislate then we must prove thatthey are two and what is the difference between them that when weimpose the penalty upon either every one may understand our be able in some way to judge whether the penalty is fitly orunfitly inflicted 
 cle i agree with you stranger for one of two things is we must not say that all unjust acts are involuntary or wemust show the meaning and truth of this statement 
 ath of these two alternatives the one is quite speak what i believe to be the truth would be to me unlawful andunholy but if acts of injustice cannot be divided into voluntaryand involuntary i must endeavour to find some other distinctionbetween them 
 cle very true stranger there cannot be two opinions among us uponthat point 
 ath reflect then there are hurts of various kinds done by thecitizens to one another in the intercourse of life affordingplentiful examples both of the voluntary and involuntary 
 cle certainly 
 ath i would not have any one suppose that all these hurts areinjuries and that these injuries are of two voluntary andthe other involuntary for the involuntary hurts of all men are quiteas many and as great as the voluntary and please to considerwhether i am right or quite wrong in what i am going to say for ideny cleinias and megillus that he who harms another involuntarilydoes him an injury involuntarily nor should i legislate about such anact under the idea that i am legislating for an involuntary i should rather say that such a hurt whether great or small isnot an injury at all and on the other hand if i am right when abenefit is wrongly conferred the author of the benefit may often besaid to injure for i maintain o my friends that the mere givingor taking away of anything is not to be described either as just orunjust but the legislator has to consider whether mankind do goodor harm to one another out of a just principle and intention on thedistinction between injustice and hurt he must fix his eye and whenthere is hurt he must as far as he can make the hurt good by save that which is ruined and raise up that which is make that which is dead or wounded whole and when compensationhas been given for injustice the law must always seek to win over thedoers and sufferers of the several hurts from feelings of enmity tothose of friendship 
 cle very good 
 ath then as to unjust hurts and gains also supposing theinjustice to bring gain of these we may heal as many as arecapable of being healed regarding them as diseases of the soul andthe cure of injustice will take the following direction 
 cle what direction 
 ath when any one commits any injustice small or great the lawwill admonish and compel him either never at all to do the like never voluntarily or at any rate in a far less degree and he mustin addition pay for the hurt whether the end is to be attained byword or action with pleasure or pain by giving or taking awayprivileges by means of fines or gifts or in whatsoever way the lawshall proceed to make a man hate injustice and love or not hate thenature of the is quite the noblest work of law but if thelegislator sees any one who is incurable for him he will appoint alaw and a penalty he knows quite well that to such men themselvesthere is no profit in the continuance of their lives and that theywould do a double good to the rest of mankind if they would take theirdeparture inasmuch as they would be an example to other men not tooffend and they would relieve the city of bad citizens in suchcases and in such cases only the legislator ought to inflict deathas the punishment of offences 
 cle what you have said appears to me to be very reasonable butwill you favour me by stating a little more clearly the differencebetween hurt and injustice and the various complications of thevoluntary and involuntary which enter into them 
 ath i will endeavour to do as you the much would be generally said and allowed that one element in hernature is passion which may be described either as a state or apart of her and is hard to be striven against and contended with andby irrational force overturns many things 
 cle very true 
 ath and pleasure is not the same with passion but has anopposite power working her will by persuasion and by the force ofdeceit in all things 
 cle quite true 
 ath a man may truly say that ignorance is a third cause ofcrimes ignorance however may be conveniently divided by thelegislator into two sorts there is simple ignorance which is thesource of lighter offences and double ignorance which is accompaniedby a conceit of wisdom and he who is under the influence of thelatter fancies that he knows all about matters of which he knowsnothing this second kind of ignorance when possessed of power andstrength will be held by the legislator to be the source of great andmonstrous times but when attended with weakness will only resultin the errors of children and old men and these he will treat aserrors and will make laws accordingly for those who commit will be the mildest and most merciful of all laws 
 cle you are perfectly right 
 ath we all of us remark of one man that he is superior topleasure and passion and of another that he is inferior to this is true 
 cle certainly 
 ath but no one was ever yet heard to say that one of us is superiorand another inferior to ignorance 
 cle very true 
 ath we are speaking of motives which incite men to the fulfilmentof their will although an individual may be often drawn by them inopposite directions at the same time 
 cle yes often 
 ath and now i can define to you clearly and without i mean by the just and unjust according to my notion anger and fear and pleasure and pain and jealousies anddesires tyrannize over the soul whether they do any harm or all this injustice but when the opinion of the best in whateverpart of human nature states or individuals may suppose that todwell has dominion in the soul and orders the life of every man evenif it be sometimes mistaken yet what is done in accordance principle in individuals which obeys this rule and is best forthe whole life of man is to be called just although the hurt done bymistake is thought by many to be involuntary injustice leaving thequestion of names about which we are not going to quarrel and havingalready delineated three sources of error we may begin by recallingthem somewhat more vividly to our of them was of thepainful sort which we denominate anger and fear 
 cle quite right 
 ath there was a second consisting of pleasures and desires and athird of hopes which aimed at true opinion about the best the latterbeing subdivided into three we now get five sources of actions andfor these five we will make laws of two kinds 
 cle what are the two kinds 
 ath there is one kind of actions done by violence and in thelight of day and another kind of actions which are done in darknessand with secret deceit or sometimes both with violence and laws concerning these last ought to have a character of severity 
 cle naturally 
 ath and now let us return from this digression and complete thework of legislation laws have been already enacted by us concerningthe robbers of the gods and concerning traitors and alsoconcerning those who corrupt the laws for the purpose of subvertingthe government a man may very likely commit some of these in a state of madness or when affected by disease or under theinfluence of extreme old age or in a fit of childish no better than a child and if this be made evident to thejudges elected to try the cause on the appeal of the criminal orhis advocate and he be judged to have been in this state when hecommitted the offence he shall simply pay for the hurt which he mayhave done to another but he shall be exempt from other he have slain some one and have on his hands the stain ofblood and in that case he shall go to another land and country andthere dwell for a year and if he return before the expiration ofthe time which the law appoints or even set his foot at all on hisnative land he shall be bound by the guardians of the law in thepublic prison for two years and then go free 
 having begun to speak of homicide let us endeavour to lay down lawsconcerning every different kind of homicides and first of violent and involuntary homicides if any one in anathletic contest and at the public games involuntarily kills afriend and he dies either at the time or afterwards of the blowswhich he has received or if the like misfortune happens to any one inwar or military exercises or mimic contests of which themagistrates enjoin the practice whether with or without arms when hehas been purified according to the law brought from delphi relating tothese matters he shall be innocent and so in the case of their patient dies against their will they shall be held guiltlessby the law and if one slay another with his own hand butunintentionally whether he be unarmed or have some instrument or dartin his hand or if he kill him by administering food or drink or bythe application of fire or cold or by suffocating him whether hedo the deed by his own hand or by the agency of others he shall bedeemed the agent and shall suffer one of the he kill the slave of another in the belief that he ishis own he shall bear the master of the dead man harmless fromloss or shall pay a penalty of twice the value of the dead man whichthe judges shall assess but purifications must be used greater andmore numerous than for those who committed homicide at the are to be the interpreters whom the god appoints shall beauthorized to declare and if a man kills his own slave when he hasbeen purified according to laws he shall be quit of the if a man kills a freeman unintentionally he shall undergo thesame purification as he did who killed the slave but let him notforget also a tale of olden time which is to this whohas suffered a violent end when newly dead if he has had the soul ofa freeman in life is angry with the author of his death and beinghimself full of fear and panic by reason of his violent end when hesees his murderer walking about in his own accustomed haunts he isstricken with terror and becomes disordered and this disorder of by the guilty recollection of is communicated by him withoverwhelming force to the murderer and his deeds wherefore also themurderer must go out of the way of his victim for the entire period ofa year and not himself be found in any spot which was familiar to himthroughout the country and if the dead man be a stranger thehomicide shall be kept from the country of the stranger during alike period if any one voluntarily obeys this law the next of kin tothe deceased seeing all that has happened shall take pity on make peace with him and show him all gentleness but if any oneis disobedient either ventures to go to any of the temples andsacrifice unpurified or will not continue in exile during theappointed time the next of kin to the deceased shall proceedagainst him for murder and if he be convicted every part of hispunishment shall be doubled 
 and if the next of kin do not proceed against the perpetrator of thecrime then the pollution shall be deemed to fall upon his murdered man will fix the guilt upon his kinsman and he whohas a mind to proceed against him may compel him to be absent from hiscountry during five years according to law if a strangerunintentionally kill a stranger who is dwelling in the city he wholikes shall prosecute the cause according to the same rules if hebe a metic let him be absent for a year or if he be an entirestranger in addition to the purification whether he have slain astranger or a metic or a citizen he shall be banished for life fromthe country which is in possession of our laws and if he returncontrary to law let the guardians of the law punish him with let them hand over his property if he have any to him who isnext of kin to the sufferer and if he be wrecked and driven on thecoast against his will he shall take up his abode on the his feet in the sea and watching for an opportunity ofsailing but if he be brought by land and is not his own the magistrate whom he first comes across in the city release himand send him unharmed over the border 
 if any one slays a freeman with his own hand and the deed be done inpassion in the case of such actions we must begin by making adistinction for a deed is done from passion either when men without intention to kill cause the death of another by blows andthe like on a momentary impulse and are sorry for the deedimmediately afterwards or again when after having been insulted indeed or word men pursue revenge and kill a person intentionally andare not sorry for the act and therefore we must assume that thesehomicides are of two kinds both of them arising from passion whichmay be justly said to be in a mean between the voluntary andinvoluntary at the same time they are neither of them anythingmore than a likeness or shadow of either he who treasures up hisanger and avenges himself not immediately and at the moment butwith insidious design and after an interval is like the he who does not treasure up his anger and takes vengeance onthe instant and without malice prepense approaches to theinvoluntary and yet even he is not altogether involuntary but onlythe image or shadow of the involuntary wherefore about homicidescommitted in hot blood there is a difficulty in determining whetherin legislating we shall reckon them as voluntary or as partlyinvoluntary the best and truest view is to regard them respectivelyas likenesses only of the voluntary and involuntary and todistinguish them accordingly as they are done with or withoutpremeditation and we should make the penalties heavier for thosewho commit homicide with angry premeditation and lighter for thosewho do not premeditate but smite upon the instant for that whichis like a greater evil should be punished more severely and thatwhich is like a less evil should be punished less severely this shallbe the rule of our laws 
 cle certainly 
 ath let us any one slays a free man with his ownhand and the deed be done in a moment of anger and withoutpremeditation let the offender suffer in other respects as theinvoluntary homicide would have suffered and also undergo an exile oftwo years that he may learn to school his passions but he whoslays another from passion yet with premeditation shall in otherrespects suffer as the former and to this shall be added an exileof three instead of two punishment is to be longer becausehis passion is greater the manner of their return shall be on thiswise and here the law has difficulty in determining exactly forin some cases the murderer who is judged by the law to be the worsemay really be the less cruel and he who is judged the less cruelmay be really the worse and may have executed the murder in a moresavage manner whereas the other may have been gentler but in generalthe degrees of guilt will be such as we have described them of allthese things the guardians of the law must take ahomicide of either kind has completed his term of exile the guardiansshall send twelve judges to the borders of the land these duringthe interval shall have informed themselves of the actions of thecriminals and they shall judge respecting their pardon and the homicides shall abide by their judgment but if after theyhave returned home any one of them in a moment of anger repeats thedeed let him be an exile and return no more or if he returns lethim suffer as the stranger was to suffer in a similar case he whokills his own slave shall undergo a purification but if he killsthe slave of another in anger he shall pay twice the amount of theloss to his owner and if any homicide is disobedient to the without purification pollutes the agora or the games or thetemples he who pleases may bring to trial the next of kin to the deadman for permitting him and the murderer with him and may compelthe one to exact and the other to suffer a double amount of finesand purifications and the accuser shall himself receive the fine inaccordance with the law if a slave in a fit of passion kills hismaster the kindred of the deceased man may do with the only they do not spare his life whatever they please andthey will be pure or if he kills a freeman who is not his owner shall give up the slave to the relatives of the they shall be under an obligation to put him to death but thismay be done in any manner which they please 
 and if which is a rare occurrence but does sometimes happen afather or a mother in a moment of passion slays a son or daughter byblows or some other violence the slayer shall undergo the samepurification as in other cases and be exiled during three when the exile returns the wife shall separate from the the husband from the wife and they shall never afterwards begetchildren together or live under the same roof or partake of the samesacred rites with those whom they have deprived of a child or of abrother and he who is impious and disobedient in such a case shall bebrought to trial for impiety by any one who pleases if in a fit ofanger a husband kills his wedded wife or the wife her husband theslayer shall undergo the same purification and the term of exileshall be three years and when he who has committed any such crimereturns let him have no communication in sacred rites with hischildren neither let him sit at the same table with them and thefather or son who disobeys shall be liable to be brought to trialfor impiety by any one who pleases if a brother or a sister in afit of passion kills a brother or a sister they shall undergopurification and exile as was the case with parents who killedtheir offspring they shall not come under the same roof or sharein the sacred rites of those whom they have deprived of theirbrethren or of their children 
 and he who is disobedient shall be justly liable to the lawconcerning impiety which relates to these matters if any one is soviolent in his passion against his parents that in the madness of hisanger he dares to kill one of them if the murdered person beforedying freely forgives the murderer let him undergo the purificationwhich is assigned to those who have been guilty of involuntaryhomicide and do as they do and he shall be pure but if he be notacquitted the perpetrator of such a deed shall be amenable to shall be amenable to the extreme punishments for assault andimpiety and robbing of temples for he has robbed his parent of if a man could be slain more than once most justly would he whoin a fit of passion has slain father or mother undergo many can he whom alone of all men even in defence of his life andwhen about to suffer death at the hands of his parents no law willallow to kill his father or his mother who are the authors of hisbeing and whom the legislator will command to endure any extremityrather than do can he i say lawfully receive any otherpunishment let death then be the appointed punishment of him who in afit of passion slays his father or his mother but if brother killsbrother in a civil broil or under other like circumstances if theother has begun and he only defends himself let him be free fromguilt as he would be if he had slain an enemy and the same rule willapply if a citizen kill a citizen or a stranger a stranger or if astranger kill a citizen or a citizen a stranger in lethim be free from guilt in like manner and so in the case of a slavewho has killed a slave but if a slave have killed a freeman let him be subject to the same law as he who haskilled a father and let the law about the remission of penalties inthe case of parricide apply equally to every other remission wheneverany sufferer of his own accord remits the guilt of homicide toanother under the idea that his act was involuntary let theperpetrator of the deed undergo a purification and remain in exile fora year according to law 
 enough has been said of murders violent and involuntary andcommitted in passion we have now to speak of voluntary crimes donewith injustice of every kind and with premeditation through theinfluence of pleasures and desires and jealousies 
 cle very good 
 ath let us first speak as far as we are able of their variouskinds the greatest cause of them is lust which gets the mastery ofthe soul maddened by desire and this is most commonly found toexist where the passion reigns which is strongest and most prevalentamong mass of mankind i mean where the power of wealth breeds endlessdesires of acquisition originating in naturaldisposition and a miserable want of education of this want ofeducation the false praise of wealth which is bruited about bothamong hellenes and barbarians is the cause they deem that to be thefirst of goods which in reality is only the third and in this waythey wrong both posterity and themselves for nothing can be noblerand better than that the truth about wealth should be spoken in that riches are for the sake of the body as the bodyis for the sake of the soul they are good and wealth is intendedby nature to be for the sake of them and is therefore inferior tothem both and third in order of excellence this argument teachesus that he who would be happy ought not to seek to be rich orrather he should seek to be rich justly and temperately and thenthere would be no murders in states requiring to be purged away byother murders but now as i said at first avarice is the chiefestcause and source of the worst trials for voluntary homicide asecond cause is ambition this creates jealousies which aretroublesome companions above all to the jealous man himself and in aless degree to the chiefs of the state and a third cause iscowardly and unjust fear which has been the occasion of many a man is doing or has done something which he desires that no oneshould know him to be doing or to have done he will take the lifeof those who are likely to inform of such things if he have noother means of getting rid of them let this be said as a preludeconcerning crimes of violence in general and i must not omit tomention a tradition which is firmly believed by many and has beenreceived by them from those who are learned in the mysteries they saythat such deeds will be punished in the world below and also thatwhen the perpetrators return to this world they will pay the naturalpenalty which is due to the sufferer and end their lives in likemanner by the hand of another if he who is about to commit murderbelieves this and is made by the mere prelude to dread such apenalty there is no need to proceed with the proclamation of the if he will not listen let the following law be declared andregistered against him 
 whoever shall wrongfully and of design slay with his own hand any ofhis kinsmen shall in the first place be deprived of legal he shall not pollute the temples or the agora or the any other place of meeting whether he is forbidden of men ornot for the law which represents the whole state forbids him andalways is and will be in the attitude of forbidding him and if acousin or nearer relative of the deceased whether on the male orfemale side does not prosecute the homicide when he ought and havehim proclaimed an outlaw he shall in the first place be involved inthe pollution and incur the hatred of the gods even as the curseof the law stirs up the voices of men against him and in the secondplace he shall be liable to be prosecuted by any one who is willing toinflict retribution on behalf of the dead and he who would avenge amurder shall observe all the precautionary ceremonies of lavation andany others which the god commands in cases of this kind let himhave proclamation made and then go forth and compel the perpetratorto suffer the execution of justice according to the law now thelegislator may easily show that these things must be accomplished byprayers and sacrifices to certain gods who are concerned with theprevention of murders in states but who these gods are and whatshould be the true manner of instituting such trials with due regardto religion the guardians of the law aided by the the prophets and the god shall determine and when they havedetermined let them carry on the prosecution at law the cause shallhave the same judges who are appointed to decide in the case ofthose who plunder temples let him who is convicted be punished withdeath and let him not be buried in the country of the murdered this would be shameless as well as impious but if he fly and willnot stand his trial let him fly for ever or if he set foot anywhereon any part of the murdered country let any relation of thedeceased or any other citizen who may first happen to meet withhim kill him with impunity or bind and deliver him to those amongthe judges of the case who are magistrates that they may put him todeath and let the prosecutor demand surety of him whom he sureties sufficient in the opinion of the magistrates who trythe cause shall be provided by him and they shall undertake toproduce him at the trial but if he be unwilling or unable toprovide sureties then the magistrates shall take him and keep himin bonds and produce him at the day of trial 
 if a man do not commit a murder with his own hand but contrives thedeath of another and is the author of the deed in intention anddesign and he continues to dwell in the city having his soul notpure of the guilt of murder let him be tried in the same in what relates to the sureties and also if he be foundguilty his body after execution may have burial in his native in all other respects his case shall be as the former and whethera stranger shall kill a citizen or a citizen a stranger or a slave aslave there shall be no difference as touching murder by ownhand or by contrivance except in the matter of sureties and has been said shall be required of the actual murderer only andhe who brings the accusation shall bind them over at the time if aslave be convicted of slaying a freeman voluntarily either by his ownhand or by contrivance let the public executioner take him in thedirection of the sepulchre to a place whence he can see the tomb ofthe dead man and inflict upon him as many stripes as the person whocaught him orders and if he survive let him put him to death and ifany one kills a slave who has done no wrong because he is afraid thathe may inform of some base and evil deeds of his own or for anysimilar reason in such a case let him pay the penalty of murder ashe would have done if he had slain a citizen there are things aboutwhich it is terrible and unpleasant to legislate but impossible notto legislate if for example there should be murders of perpetrated by the hands of kinsmen or by their and purely malicious which most often happen and states and may perhaps occur even in acountry where a man would not expect to find them we must repeat oncemore the tale which we narrated a little while ago in the hope thathe who hears us will be the more disposed to abstain voluntarily onthese grounds from murders which are utterly abominable for the saying or whatever we ought to call it has been plainly set forthby priests of old they have pronounced that the justice whichguards and avenges the blood of kindred follows the law ofretaliation and ordains that he who has done any murderous act shouldof necessity suffer that which he has done he who has slain afather shall himself be slain at some time or other by his mother he shall of necessity take a nature and lose hislife at the hands of his offspring in after ages for where theblood of a family has been polluted there is no other can the pollution be washed out until the homicidal soul which thedeed has given life for life and has propitiated and laid to sleepthe wrath of the whole family these are the retributions of by such punishments men should be deterred but if they are notdeterred and any one should be incited by some fatality to deprivehis father or mother or brethren or children of life voluntarilyand of purpose for him the earthly lawgiver legislates shall be the same proclamations about outlawry andthere shall be the same sureties which have been enacted in the formercases but in his case if he be convicted the servants of the judgesand the magistrates shall slay him at an appointed place without thecity where three ways meet and there expose his body naked andeach of the magistrates on behalf of the whole city shall take a stoneand cast it upon the head of the dead man and so deliver the cityfrom pollution after that they shall bear him to the borders ofthe land and cast him forth unburied according to law and whatshall he suffer who slays him who of all men as they say is hisown best friend i mean the suicide who deprives himself byviolence of his appointed share of life not because the law of thestate requires him nor yet under the compulsion of some painful andinevitable misfortune which has come upon him nor because he hashad to suffer from irremediable and intolerable shame but who fromsloth or want of manliness imposes upon himself an unjust penalty forhim what ceremonies there are to be of purification and burial godknows and about these the next of kin should enquire of theinterpreters and of the laws thereto relating and do according totheir injunctions they who meet their death in this way shall beburied alone and none shall be laid by their side they shall beburied ingloriously in the borders of the twelve portions the land insuch places as are uncultivated and nameless and no column orinscription shall mark the place of their interment and if a beast ofburden or other animal cause the death of any one except in thecase of anything of that kind happening to a competitor in thepublic contests the kinsmen of the deceased shall prosecute theslayer for murder and the wardens of the country such and so manyas the kinsmen appoint shall try the cause and let the beast whencondemned be slain by them and let them cast it beyond the if any lifeless thing deprive a man of life except in the case ofa thunderbolt or other fatal dart sent from the a manis killed by lifeless objects falling upon him or by his fallingupon them the nearest of kin shall appoint the nearest neighbour tobe a judge and thereby acquit himself and the whole family ofguilt and he shall cast forth the guilty thing beyond the has been said about the animals 
 if a man is found dead and his murderer be unknown and after adiligent search cannot be detected there shall be the sameproclamation as in the previous cases and the same interdict on themurderer and having proceeded against him they shall proclaim in theagora by a herald that he who has slain such and such a person andhas been convicted of murder shall not set his foot in the at all in the country of the murdered man and if he appears andis discovered he shall die and be cast forth unburied beyond theborder let this one law then be laid down by us about murder and letcases of this sort be so regarded 
 and now let us say in what cases and under what circumstances themurderer is rightly free from a man catch a thief his house by night to steal and he take and kill him or if heslay a footpad in he shall be guiltless and any one whodoes violence to a free woman or a youth shall be slain with impunityby the injured person or by his or her father or brothers or sons ifa man find his wife suffering violence he may kill the be guiltless in the eye of the law or if a person kill another inwarding off death from his father or mother or children or brethren orwife who are doing no wrong he shall assuredly be guiltless 
 thus much as to the nurture and education of the living soul of which he can and without which if he unfortunately bewithout them he cannot live and also concerning are to be inflicted for violent deaths let thusmuch be enacted of the nurture and education of the body we havespoken before and next in order we have to speak of deeds ofviolence voluntary and involuntary which men do to one we will now distinguish as far as we are able according totheir nature and number and determine what will be the suitablepenalties of each and so assign to them their proper place in theseries of our enactments the poorest legislator will have nodifficulty in determining that wounds and mutilations arising out ofwounds should follow next in order after deaths let wounds be dividedas homicides were those which are involuntary andwhich are given in passion or from fear and those inflictedvoluntarily and with premeditation concerning all this we mustmake some such proclamation as the must havelaws and conform to them or their life would be as bad as that ofthe most savage beast and the reason of this is that no is able to know what is best for human society or able and willing to do what is best in the first is a difficulty in apprehending that the true art or politics isconcerned not with private but with public good for public goodbinds together states but private only distracts them and that boththe public and private good as well of individuals as of states isgreater when the state and not the individual is first the second place although a person knows in the abstract that thisis true yet if he be possessed of absolute and irresponsible will never remain firm in his principles or persist in regardingthe public good as primary in the state and the private good assecondary human nature will be always drawing him into avarice andselfishness avoiding pain and pursuing pleasure without any will bring these to the front obscuring the juster and so working darkness in his soul will at last fill with evilsboth him and the whole city for if a man were born so divinely giftedthat he could naturally apprehend the truth he would have no needof laws to rule over him for there is no law or order which isabove knowledge nor can mind without impiety be deemed thesubject or slave of any man but rather the lord of all i speak ofmind true and free and in harmony with nature but then there isno such mind anywhere or at least not much and therefore we mustchoose law and order which are second best these look at things asthey exist for the most part only and are unable to survey thewhole of them and therefore i have spoken as i have 
 and now we will determine what penalty he ought to pay or suffer whohas hurt or wounded another any one may easily imagine thequestions which have to be asked in all such did he whom or how or when for there are innumerable particulars ofthis sort which greatly vary from one another and to allow courtsof law to determine all these things or not to determine any of alike impossible there is one particular which they must determinein all question of fact and then again that thelegislator should not permit them to determine what punishment is tobe inflicted in any of these cases but should himself decide them small or great is next to impossible 
 cle then what is to be the inference 
 ath the inference is that some things should be left to courtsof law others the legislator must decide for himself 
 cle and what ought the legislator to decide and what ought he toleave to courts of law 
 ath i may reply that in a state in which the courts are bad andmute because the judges conceal their opinions and decide causesclandestinely or what is worse when they are disorderly and in a theatre clapping or hooting in turn this or that saythat then there is a very serious evil which affects the whole is the necessity of having to legislate for such where the necessity exists the legislator should only allowthem to ordain the penalties for the smallest offences if the statefor which he is legislating be of this character he must take mostmatters into his own hands and speak distinctly but when a statehas good courts and the judges are well trained and scrupulouslytested the determination of the penalties or punishments whichshall be inflicted on the guilty may fairly and with advantage be leftto them and we are not to be blamed for not legislating concerningall that large class of matters which judges far worse educated thanours would be able to determine assigning to each offence what is dueboth to the perpetrator and to the sufferer we believe those for whomwe are legislating to be best able to judge and therefore to them thegreater part may be left at the same time as i have often said weshould exhibit to the judges as we have done the outline and form ofthe punishments to be inflicted and then they will not transgress thejust rule that was an excellent practice which we observed which now that we are resuming the work of legislation may withadvantage be repeated by us 
 let the enactment about wounding be in the following has a purpose and intention to slay another who is not hisenemy and whom the law does not permit him to slay and he woundshim but is unable to kill him he who had the intent and haswounded him is not to be deserves no consideration butshould be regarded as a murderer and be tried for murder still havingrespect to the fortune which has in a manner favoured him and tothe providence which in pity to him and to the wounded man saved theone from a fatal blow and the other from an accursed fate a to this deity and in order not to opposehis such a case the law will remit the punishment of only compel the offender to emigrate to a neighbouring city forthe rest of his life where he shall remain in the enjoyment of allhis possessions but if he have injured the wounded man he shall makesuch compensation for the injury as the court deciding the cause shallassess and the same judges shall decide who would have decided if theman had died of his wounds and if a child intentionally wound hisparents or a servant his master death shall be the penalty and if abrother ora sister intentionally wound a brother or a sister and isfound guilty death shall be the penalty and if a husband wound awife or a wife a husband with intent to kill let him or her undergoperpetual exile if they have sons or daughters who are still guardians shall take care of their property and have charge ofthe children as orphans if their sons are grown up they shall beunder no obligation to support the exiled parent but they shallpossess the property themselves and if he who meets with such amisfortune has no children the kindred of the exiled man to thedegree of sons of cousins both on the male and female side shallmeet together and after taking counsel with the guardians of theand the priests shall appoint a th citizen to be the heir ofthe house considering and reasoning that no house of all the belongs to the inhabitant or to the whole family but is the publicand private property of the state now the state should seek to haveits houses as holy and happy as possible and if any one of the housesbe unfortunate and stained with impiety and the owner leave noposterity but dies unmarried or married and childless havingsuffered death as the penalty of murder or some other crimecommitted against the gods or against his of whichdeath is the penalty distinctly laid down in the law or if any of thecitizens be in perpetual exile and also childless that house shallfirst of all be purified and undergo expiation according to law andthen let the kinsmen of the house as we were just now saying and theguardians of the law meet and consider what family there is in thestate which is of the highest repute for virtue and also for goodfortune in which there are a number of sons from that family letthem take one and introduce him to the father and forefathers of thedead man as their son and for the sake of the omen let him becalled so that he may be the continuer of their family the keeper oftheir hearth and the minister of their sacred rites with betterfortune than his father had and when they have made thissupplication they shall make him heir according to law and theoffending person they shall leave nameless and childless andportionless when calamities such as these overtake him 
 now the boundaries of some things do not touch one another butthere is a borderland which comes in between preventing them fromtouching and we were saying that actions done from passion are ofthis nature and come in between the voluntary and involuntary if aperson be convicted of having inflicted wounds in a passion in thefirst place he shall pay twice the amount of the injury if thewound be curable or if incurable four times the amount of theinjury or if the wound be curable and at the same time cause greatand notable disgrace to the wounded person he shall pay fourfold andwhenever any one in wounding another injures not only the also the city and makes him incapable of defending his countryagainst the enemy he besides the other penalties shall pay apenalty for the loss which the state has incurred and the penaltyshall be that in addition to his own times of service he shall serveon behalf of the disabled person and shall take his place in war he refuse he shall be liable to be convicted by law of refusalto serve the compensation for the injury whether to be twofold orthreefold or fourfold shall be fixed by the judges who convict if in like manner a brother wounds a brother the parents andkindred of either sex including the children of cousins whether onthe male or female side shall meet and when they have judged thecause they shall entrust the assessment of damages to the parents asis natural and if the estimate be disputed then the kinsmen on themale side shall make the estimate or if they cannot they shallcommit the matter to the guardians of the law and when similarcharges of wounding are brought by children against their who are more than sixty years of age having children of theirown not adopted shall be required to decide and if any one isconvicted they shall determine whether he or she ought to die orsuffer some other punishment either greater than death or at anyrate not much less a kinsman of the offender shall not be allowed tojudge the cause not even if he be of the age which is prescribed bythe law if a slave in a fit of anger wound a freeman the owner ofthe slave shall give him up to the wounded man who may do as hepleases with him and if be not give him up he shall himself make goodthe injury and if any one says that the slave and the wounded man areconspiring together let him argue the point and if he is cast heshall pay for the wrong three times over but if he gains his freeman who conspired with the slave shall reliable to an actionfor kidnapping and if any one unintentionally wounds another he shallsimply pay for the harm for no legislator is able to controlchance in such a case the judges shall be the same as those who areappointed in the case of children suing their parents and theyshall estimate the amount of the injury 
 all the preceding injuries and every kind of assault are deeds ofviolence and every man woman or child ought to consider that theelder has the precedence of the younger in honour both among the godsand also among men who would live in security and happiness whereforeit is a foul thing and hateful to the gods to see an elder manassaulted by a younger in the city and it is reasonable that ayoung man when struck by an elder should lightly endure his up in store for himself a like honour when he is old letthis be the one shall reverence his elder in word and shall respect any one who is twenty years older than male or female regarding him or her as his father ormother and he shall abstain from laying hands on any one who is of anage to have been his father or his mother out of reverence to thegods who preside over birth similarly he shall keep his hands froma stranger whether he be an old inhabitant or newly arrived he shallnot venture to correct such an one by blows either as the aggressoror in if he thinks that some stranger has struck him outof wantonness or insolence and ought to be punished he shall takehim to the wardens of the city but let him not strike him that thestranger may be kept far away from the possibility of lifting up hishand against a citizen and let the wardens of the city take theoffender and examine him not forgetting their duty to the god ofstrangers and in case the stranger appears to have struck the citizenunjustly let them inflict upon him as many blows with the scourgeas he has himself inflicted and quell his presumption but if he beinnocent they shall threaten and rebuke the man who arrested him andlet them both go if a person strikes another of the same age orsomewhat older than himself who has no children whether he be an oldman who strikes an old man or a young man who strikes a young man letthe person struck defend himself in the natural way without a weaponand with his hands only he who being more than forty years of to fight with another whether he be the aggressor or in selfdefence shall be regarded as rude and will be a disgraceful punishment and therefore suitableto him the obedient nature will readily yield to such the disobedient who heeds not the prelude shall have the lawready for any man smite another who is older than by twenty or by more years in the first place he who is athand not being younger than the combatants nor their equal in separate them or be disgraced according to law but if he bethe equal in age of the person who is struck or younger he shalldefend the person injured as he would a brother or father or stillolder relative further let him who dares to smite an elder betried for assault as i have said and if he be found guilty lethim be imprisoned for a period of not less than a year or if thejudges approve of a longer period their decision shall be if a stranger or metic smite one who is older by twenty years ormore the same law shall hold about the bystanders assisting and hewho is found guilty in such a suit if he be a stranger but notresident shall be imprisoned during a period of two years and ametic who disobeys the laws shall be imprisoned for three the court assign him a longer term and let him who was presentin any of these cases and did not assist according to law be he be of the highest dass by paying a fine of a mina or if hebe of the second class of fifty drachmas or if of the third a fine of thirty drachmas or if he be of the fourth class by afine of twenty drachmas and the generals and taxiarchs andphylarchs and hipparchs shall form the court in such cases 
 laws are partly framed for the sake of good men in order toinstruct them how they thay live on friendly terms with one partly for the sake of those who refuse to be instructed whosespirit cannot be subdued or softened or hindered from plunginginto evil these are the persons who cause the word to be spoken whichi am about to utter for them the legislator legislates ofnecessity and in the hope that there may be no need of his laws hewho shall dare to lay violent hands upon his father or mother orany still older relative having no fear either of the wrath of thegods above or of the punishments that are spoken of in the worldbelow but transgresses in contempt of ancient and universaltraditions as though he were too wise to believe in them requiressome extreme measure of prevention now death is not the worst thatcan happen to men far worse are the punishments which are said topursue them in the world below but although they are most true work on such souls no prevention for if they had any effectthere would be no slayers of mothers or impious hands lifted upagainst parents and therefore the punishments of this world which areinflicted during life ought not in such cases to fall short ifpossible of the terrors of the world below let our enactment then beas a man dare to strike his father or his mother or theirfathers or mothers he being at the time of sound mind then let anyone who is at hand come to the rescue as has been already said andthe metic or stranger who comes to the rescue shall be called to thefirst place in the games but if he do not come he shall suffer thepunishment of perpetual exile he who is not a metic if he comes tothe rescue shall have praise and if he do not come blame and ifa slave come to the rescue let him be made free but if he do notcome the rescue let him receive strokes of the whip by orderof the wardens of the agora if the occurrence take place in theagora or if somewhere in the city beyond the limits of the agora anywarden of the city is in residence shall punish him or if in thecountry then the commanders of the wardens of the country if thosewho are near at the time be inhabitants of the same place whetherthey be youths or men or women let them come to the rescue anddenounce him as the impious one and he who does not come to therescue shall fall under the curse of zeus the god of kindred and ofancestors according to law and if any one is found guilty ofassaulting a parent let him in the first place be for ever banishedfrom the city into the country and let him abstain from thetemples and if he do not abstain the wardens of the country shallpunish him with blows or in any way which they please and if hereturn he shall be put to death and if any freeman eat or drink orhave any other sort of intercourse with him or only meeting himhave voluntarily touched him he shall not enter into any into the agora nor into the city until he is purified for heshould consider that he has become tainted by a curse and if hedisobeys the law and pollutes the city and the temples contrary tolaw and one of the magistrates sees him and does not indict him whenhe gives in his account this omission shall be a most serious charge 
 if a slave strike a freeman whether a stranger or a citizen letany one who is present come to the rescue or pay the penaltyalready mentioned and let the bystanders bind him and deliver him upto the injured person and he receiving him shall put him in inflict on him as many stripes as he pleases but havingpunished him he must surrender him to his master according to law andnot deprive him of his property let the law be as who strikes a freeman not at the command of the owner shall receive bound from the man whom he has stricken andnot release him until the slave has persuaded the man whom he hasstricken that he ought to be released and let there be the samelaws about women in relation to women about men and women in relationto one another

 book ix 
 
 next to all the matters which have preceded in the natural orderof legislation will come suits of law of suits those which relateto agriculture have been already described but the more importanthave not been described having mentioned them severally under theirusual names we will proceed to say what punishments are to beinflicted for each offence and who are to be the judges of them 
 cleinias very good 
 athenian stranger there is a sense of disgrace in legislating aswe are about to do for all the details of crime in a state we say is to be well regulated and will be perfectly adapted tothe practice of virtue to assume that in such a state there willarise some one who will be guilty of crimes as heinous as any whichare ever perpetrated in other states and that we must legislate forhim by anticipation and threaten and make laws against him if heshould arise in order to deter him and punish his acts under theidea that he will as i was saying is in a mannerdisgraceful yet seeing that we are not like the ancientlegislators who gave laws to heroes and sons of gods to the popular belief themselves the offspring of the legislating for others who were also the children of divineparents but that we are only men who are legislating for the sonsof men there is no uncharitableness in apprehending that some oneof our citizens may be like a seed which has touched the a heart so hard that it cannot be softened any more thanthose seeds can be softened by fire among our citizens there may bethose who cannot be subdued by all the strength of the laws and fortheir sake though an ungracious task i will proclaim my first lawabout the robbing of temples in case any one should dare to commitsuch a crime i do not expect or imagine that any will ever take the infection but their servants andstrangers and strangers servants may be guilty of many with a view to them especially and yet not without a providenteye to the weakness of human nature generally i will proclaim the lawabout robbers of temples and similar incurable or almost having already agreed that such enactments ought alwaysto have a short prelude we may speak to the criminal whom sometormenting desire by night and by day tempts to go and rob a fewest possible words of admonition and sir wewill say to him the impulse which moves you to rob temples is notan ordinary human malady nor yet a visitation of heaven but amadness which is begotten in a man from ancient and unexpiatedcrimes of his race an this you mustguard with all your might and how you are to guard we will explain toyou when any such thought comes into your mind go and performexpiations go as a suppliant to the temples of the gods who avertevils go to the society of those who are called good men among them tell and yourself try to repeat after them that every manshould honour the noble and the just fly from the company of and turn not back and if your disorder is lightened bythese remedies well and good but if not then acknowledge death tobe nobler than life and depart hence 
 such are the preludes which we sing to all who have thoughts ofunholy and treasonable actions and to him who hearkens to them thelaw has nothing to say but to him who is disobedient when the preludeis over cry with a loud who is taken in the act ofrobbing temples if he be a slave or stranger shall have his evildeed engraven on his face and hands and shall be beaten with asmany stripes as may seem good to the judges and be cast nakedbeyond the borders of the land and if he suffers this punishment hewill probably return to his right mind and be improved for no penaltywhich the law inflicts is designed for evil but always makes himwho suffers either better or not so much worse as he would havebeen but if any citizen be found guilty of any great or unmentionablewrong either in relation to the gods or his parents or the the judge deem him to be incurable remembering that afterreceiving such an excellent education and training from youthupward he has not abstained from the greatest of crimes hispunishment shall be death which to him will be the least of his example will benefit others if he perish ingloriously and becast beyond the borders of the land but let his children andfamily if they avoid the ways of their father have glory and lethonourable mention be made of them as having nobly and manfullyescaped out of evil into good none of them should have their goodsconfiscated to the state for the lots of the citizens ought always tocontinue the same and equal 
 touching the exaction of penalties when a man appears to havedone anything which deserves a fine he shall pay the fine if he haveanything in excess of the lot which is assigned to him but morethan that he shall not pay and to secure exactness let the guardiansof the law refer to the registers and inform the judges of theprecise truth in order that none of the lots may go uncultivatedfor want of money but if any one seems to deserve a greaterpenalty let him undergo a long and public imprisonment and bedishonoured unless some of his friends are willing to be surety forhim and liberate him by assisting him to pay the fine no criminalshall go unpunished not even for a single offence nor if he havefled the country but let the penalty be according to or bonds or blows or degrading places of sitting orstanding or removal to some temple on the borders of the land or lethim pay fines as we said before in cases of death let the judges bethe guardians of the law and a court selected by merit from thelast magistrates but how the causes are to be brought intoto court how the summonses are to be served the like these thingsmay be left to the younger generation of legislators to determine themanner of voting we must determine ourselves 
 let the vote be given openly but before they come to the vote letthe judges sit in order of seniority over against plaintiff anddefendant and let all the citizens who can spare time hear and take aserious interest in listening to such causes first of all theplaintiff shall make one speech and then the defendant shall makeanother and after the speeches have been made the eldest judgeshall begin to examine the parties and proceed to make an adequateenquiry into what has been said and after the oldest has rest shall proceed in order to examine either party as to whathe finds defective in the evidence whether of statement oromission and he who has nothing to ask shall hand over theexamination to another and on so much of what has been said as isto the purpose all the judges shall set their seals and place thewritings on the altar of hestia on the next day they shall meetagain and in like manner put their questions and go through thecause and again set their seals upon the evidence and when they havethree times done this and have had witnesses and evidence shall each of them give a holy vote after promising by hestiathat they will decide justly and truly to the utmost of their so they shall put an end to the suit 
 next after what relates to the gods follows what relates to thedissolution of the by promoting a man to power enslavesthe laws and subjects the city to factions using violence andstirring up sedition contrary to law him we will deem the greatestenemy of the whole state but he who takes no part in suchproceedings and being one of the chief magistrates of the state hasno knowledge of the treason or having knowledge of it by reasonof cowardice does not interfere on behalf of his country such anone we must consider nearly as bad every man who is worth anythingwill inform the magistrates and bring the conspirator to trial formaking a violent and illegal attempt to change the government thejudges of such cases shall be the same as of the robbers of let the whole proceeding be carried on in the same way and thevote of the majority condemn to death but let there be a generalrule that the disgrace and punishment of the father is not to bevisited on the children except in the case of some one whosefather grandfather and have successively undergonethe penalty of death such persons the city shall send away with alltheir possessions to the city and country of their only and wholly their appointed lot and out of the citizenswho have more than one son of not less than ten years of age theyshall select ten whom their father or grandfather by the side shall appoint and let them send to delphi the namesof those who are selected and him whom the god chooses they shallestablish as heir of the house which has failed and may he havebetter fortune than his predecessors 
 cle very good 
 ath once more let there be a third general law respecting thejudges who are to give judgment and the manner of conducting suitsagainst those who are tried on an accusation of treason and asconcerning the remaining or departure of their shallbe one law for all three for the traitor and the robber oftemples and the subverter by violence of the laws of the state for athief whether he steal much or little let there be one law andone punishment for all alike in the first place let him pay doublethe amount of the theft if he be convicted and if he have so muchover and above the he have not he shall be bounduntil he pay the penalty or persuade him has obtained the sentenceagainst him to forgive him but if a person be convicted of a theftagainst the state then if he can persuade the city or if he will payback twice the amount of the theft he shall be set free from hisbonds 
 cle what makes you say stranger that a theft is all the thief may have taken much or little and either fromsacred or secular these are not the only differences then that they are of many kinds ought not thelegislator to adapt himself to them and impose upon them entirelydifferent penalties 
 ath excellent i was running on too fast cleinias and youimpinged upon me and brought me to my senses reminding me of had occurred to mind already that legislation was never yetrightly worked out as i may say in you remember the imagein which i likened the men for whom laws are now made to slaves whoare doctored by slaves for of this you may be very sure that ifone of those empirical physicians who practise medicine withoutscience were to come upon the gentleman physician talking to hisgentleman patient and using the language almost of at the beginning of the disease and discoursing about thewhole nature of the body he would burst into a hearty say what most of those who are called doctors always have attheir fellow he would say you are nothealing the sick man but you are educating him and he does notwant to be made a doctor but to get well 
 cle and would he not be right 
 ath perhaps he would and he might remark upon us that he whodiscourses about laws as we are now doing is giving the citizenseducation and not laws that would be rather a telling observation 
 cle very true 
 ath but we are fortunate 
 cle in what way 
 ath inasmuch as we are not compelled to give laws but we maytake into consideration every form of government and ascertain whatis best and what is most needful and how they may both be carriedinto execution and we may also if we please at this very momentchoose what is best or if we prefer what is most we do 
 cle there is something ridiculous stranger in our proposing suchan alternative as if we were legislators simply bound under somegreat necessity which cannot be deferred to the morrow but we as imay by grace of heaven affirm like gatherers of stones orbeginners of some composite work may gather a heap of out of this at our leisure select what is suitable for ourprojected construction let us then suppose ourselves to be atleisure not of necessity building but rather like men who are partlyproviding materials and partly putting them together and we maytruly say that some of our laws like stones are already fixed intheir places and others lie at hand 
 ath certainly in that case cleinias our view of law will be morein accordance with nature for there is another matter affectinglegislators which i must earnestly entreat you to consider 
 cle what is it 
 ath there are many writings to be found in cities and among themthere are composed by legislators as well as by other persons 
 cle to be sure 
 ath shall we give heed rather to the writings of those the like who either in metre or out of metre have recordedtheir advice about the conduct of life and not to the writings oflegislators or shall we give heed to them above all 
 cle yes to them far above all others 
 ath and ought the legislator alone among writers to withhold hisopinion about the beautiful the good and the just and not toteach what they are and how they are to be pursued by those whointend to be happy 
 cle certainly not 
 ath and is it disgraceful for homer and tyrtaeus and other poets tolay down evil precepts in their writings respecting life and thepursuits of men but not so disgraceful for lycurgus and solon andothers who were legislators as well as writers is it not true that ofall the writings to be found in cities those which relate to you unfold and read them ought to be by far the noblest andthe best and should not other writings either agree with them orif they disagree be deemed ridiculous we should consider whether thelaws of states ought not to have the character of loving and wiseparents rather than of tyrants and masters who command and after writing their decrees on walls go their ways and discoursing of laws we should not take the gentler view of themwhich may or may not be any rate we will show ourreadiness to entertain such a view and be prepared to undergowhatever may be the result and may the result be good and if godbe gracious it will be good 
 cle excellent let us do as you say 
 ath then we will now consider accurately as we proposed whatrelates to robbers of temples and all kinds of thefts and offencesin general and we must not be annoyed if in the course oflegislation we have enacted some things and have not made up ourminds about some others for as yet we are not legislators but we maysoon be let us if you please consider these matters 
 cle by all means 
 ath concerning all things honourable and just let us thenendeavour to ascertain how far we are consistent with ourselves andhow far we are inconsistent and how far the many from whom at anyrate we should profess a desire to differ agree and disagree amongthemselves 
 cle what are the inconsistencies which you observe in us 
 ath i will endeavour to explain if i am not mistaken we are allagreed that justice and just men and things and actions are allfair and if a person were to maintain that just men even whenthey are deformed in body are still perfectly beautiful in respect ofthe excellent justice of their minds no one would say that therewas any inconsistency in this 
 cle they would be quite right 
 ath perhaps but let us consider further that if all thingswhich are just are fair and honourable in the term all we mustinclude just sufferings which are the correlatives of just actions 
 cle and what is the inference 
 ath the inference is that a just action in partaking of the justpartakes also in the same degree of the fair and honourable 
 cle certainly 
 ath and must not a suffering which partakes of the just principlebe admitted to be in the same degree fair and honourable if theargument is consistently carried out 
 cle true 
 ath but then if we admit suffering to be just and yetdishonourable and the term dishonourable is applied to not the just and the honourable disagree 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath a thing not difficult to understand the laws which have beenalready enacted would seem to announce principles directly opposedto what we are saying 
 cle to what 
 ath we had enacted if i am not mistaken that the robber oftemples and he who was the enemy of law and order might justly beput to death and we were proceeding to make divers other enactmentsof a similar nature but we stopped short because we saw that thesesufferings are infinite in number and degree and that they are atonce the most just and also the most dishonourable of all if this be true are not the just and the honourable at one timeall the same and at another time in the most diametrical opposition 
 cle such appears to be the case 
 ath in this discordant and inconsistent fashion does the languageof the many rend asunder the honourable and just 
 cle very true stranger 
 ath then now cleinias let us see how far we ourselves areconsistent about these matters 
 cle consistent in what 
 ath i think that i have clearly stated in the former part of thediscussion but if i did not let me now state 
 cle what 
 ath that all bad men are always involuntarily bad and from thismust proceed to draw a further inference 
 cle what is it 
 ath that the unjust man may be bad but that he is bad againsthis will now that an action which is voluntary should be doneinvoluntarily is a contradiction wherefore he who maintains thatinjustice is involuntary will deem that the unjust does injusticeinvoluntarily i too admit that all men do injustice if any contentious or disputatious person says that men are unjustagainst their will and yet that many do injustice willingly i do notagree with him but then how can i avoid being inconsistent withmyself if you cleinias and you megillus say to all this be as you say how about legislating for the city of we legislate or do you advise certainly wewill i should reply then will you determine for them what arevoluntary and what are involuntary crimes and shall we make thepunishments greater of voluntary errors and crimes and less for theinvoluntary or shall we make the punishment of all to be alike underthe idea that there is no such thing as voluntary crime 
 cle very good stranger and what shall we say in answer to theseobjections 
 ath that is a very fair question in the first place let us 
 cle do what 
 ath let us remember what has been well said by us already that ourideas of justice are in the highest degree confused and this in mind let us proceed to ask ourselves once morewhether we have discovered a way out of the difficulty have we everdetermined in what respect these two classes of actions differ fromone another for in all states and by all legislators kinds of actions have been one voluntary theother involuntary and they have legislated about them shall this new word of ours like an oracle of god be onlyspoken and get away without giving any explanation or verification ofitself how can a word not understood be the basis of before proceeding to legislate then we must prove thatthey are two and what is the difference between them that when weimpose the penalty upon either every one may understand our be able in some way to judge whether the penalty is fitly orunfitly inflicted 
 cle i agree with you stranger for one of two things is we must not say that all unjust acts are involuntary or wemust show the meaning and truth of this statement 
 ath of these two alternatives the one is quite speak what i believe to be the truth would be to me unlawful andunholy but if acts of injustice cannot be divided into voluntaryand involuntary i must endeavour to find some other distinctionbetween them 
 cle very true stranger there cannot be two opinions among us uponthat point 
 ath reflect then there are hurts of various kinds done by thecitizens to one another in the intercourse of life affordingplentiful examples both of the voluntary and involuntary 
 cle certainly 
 ath i would not have any one suppose that all these hurts areinjuries and that these injuries are of two voluntary andthe other involuntary for the involuntary hurts of all men are quiteas many and as great as the voluntary and please to considerwhether i am right or quite wrong in what i am going to say for ideny cleinias and megillus that he who harms another involuntarilydoes him an injury involuntarily nor should i legislate about such anact under the idea that i am legislating for an involuntary i should rather say that such a hurt whether great or small isnot an injury at all and on the other hand if i am right when abenefit is wrongly conferred the author of the benefit may often besaid to injure for i maintain o my friends that the mere givingor taking away of anything is not to be described either as just orunjust but the legislator has to consider whether mankind do goodor harm to one another out of a just principle and intention on thedistinction between injustice and hurt he must fix his eye and whenthere is hurt he must as far as he can make the hurt good by save that which is ruined and raise up that which is make that which is dead or wounded whole and when compensationhas been given for injustice the law must always seek to win over thedoers and sufferers of the several hurts from feelings of enmity tothose of friendship 
 cle very good 
 ath then as to unjust hurts and gains also supposing theinjustice to bring gain of these we may heal as many as arecapable of being healed regarding them as diseases of the soul andthe cure of injustice will take the following direction 
 cle what direction 
 ath when any one commits any injustice small or great the lawwill admonish and compel him either never at all to do the like never voluntarily or at any rate in a far less degree and he mustin addition pay for the hurt whether the end is to be attained byword or action with pleasure or pain by giving or taking awayprivileges by means of fines or gifts or in whatsoever way the lawshall proceed to make a man hate injustice and love or not hate thenature of the is quite the noblest work of law but if thelegislator sees any one who is incurable for him he will appoint alaw and a penalty he knows quite well that to such men themselvesthere is no profit in the continuance of their lives and that theywould do a double good to the rest of mankind if they would take theirdeparture inasmuch as they would be an example to other men not tooffend and they would relieve the city of bad citizens in suchcases and in such cases only the legislator ought to inflict deathas the punishment of offences 
 cle what you have said appears to me to be very reasonable butwill you favour me by stating a little more clearly the differencebetween hurt and injustice and the various complications of thevoluntary and involuntary which enter into them 
 ath i will endeavour to do as you the much would be generally said and allowed that one element in hernature is passion which may be described either as a state or apart of her and is hard to be striven against and contended with andby irrational force overturns many things 
 cle very true 
 ath and pleasure is not the same with passion but has anopposite power working her will by persuasion and by the force ofdeceit in all things 
 cle quite true 
 ath a man may truly say that ignorance is a third cause ofcrimes ignorance however may be conveniently divided by thelegislator into two sorts there is simple ignorance which is thesource of lighter offences and double ignorance which is accompaniedby a conceit of wisdom and he who is under the influence of thelatter fancies that he knows all about matters of which he knowsnothing this second kind of ignorance when possessed of power andstrength will be held by the legislator to be the source of great andmonstrous times but when attended with weakness will only resultin the errors of children and old men and these he will treat aserrors and will make laws accordingly for those who commit will be the mildest and most merciful of all laws 
 cle you are perfectly right 
 ath we all of us remark of one man that he is superior topleasure and passion and of another that he is inferior to this is true 
 cle certainly 
 ath but no one was ever yet heard to say that one of us is superiorand another inferior to ignorance 
 cle very true 
 ath we are speaking of motives which incite men to the fulfilmentof their will although an individual may be often drawn by them inopposite directions at the same time 
 cle yes often 
 ath and now i can define to you clearly and without i mean by the just and unjust according to my notion anger and fear and pleasure and pain and jealousies anddesires tyrannize over the soul whether they do any harm or all this injustice but when the opinion of the best in whateverpart of human nature states or individuals may suppose that todwell has dominion in the soul and orders the life of every man evenif it be sometimes mistaken yet what is done in accordance principle in individuals which obeys this rule and is best forthe whole life of man is to be called just although the hurt done bymistake is thought by many to be involuntary injustice leaving thequestion of names about which we are not going to quarrel and havingalready delineated three sources of error we may begin by recallingthem somewhat more vividly to our of them was of thepainful sort which we denominate anger and fear 
 cle quite right 
 ath there was a second consisting of pleasures and desires and athird of hopes which aimed at true opinion about the best the latterbeing subdivided into three we now get five sources of actions andfor these five we will make laws of two kinds 
 cle what are the two kinds 
 ath there is one kind of actions done by violence and in thelight of day and another kind of actions which are done in darknessand with secret deceit or sometimes both with violence and laws concerning these last ought to have a character of severity 
 cle naturally 
 ath and now let us return from this digression and complete thework of legislation laws have been already enacted by us concerningthe robbers of the gods and concerning traitors and alsoconcerning those who corrupt the laws for the purpose of subvertingthe government a man may very likely commit some of these in a state of madness or when affected by disease or under theinfluence of extreme old age or in a fit of childish no better than a child and if this be made evident to thejudges elected to try the cause on the appeal of the criminal orhis advocate and he be judged to have been in this state when hecommitted the offence he shall simply pay for the hurt which he mayhave done to another but he shall be exempt from other he have slain some one and have on his hands the stain ofblood and in that case he shall go to another land and country andthere dwell for a year and if he return before the expiration ofthe time which the law appoints or even set his foot at all on hisnative land he shall be bound by the guardians of the law in thepublic prison for two years and then go free 
 having begun to speak of homicide let us endeavour to lay down lawsconcerning every different kind of homicides and first of violent and involuntary homicides if any one in anathletic contest and at the public games involuntarily kills afriend and he dies either at the time or afterwards of the blowswhich he has received or if the like misfortune happens to any one inwar or military exercises or mimic contests of which themagistrates enjoin the practice whether with or without arms when hehas been purified according to the law brought from delphi relating tothese matters he shall be innocent and so in the case of their patient dies against their will they shall be held guiltlessby the law and if one slay another with his own hand butunintentionally whether he be unarmed or have some instrument or dartin his hand or if he kill him by administering food or drink or bythe application of fire or cold or by suffocating him whether hedo the deed by his own hand or by the agency of others he shall bedeemed the agent and shall suffer one of the he kill the slave of another in the belief that he ishis own he shall bear the master of the dead man harmless fromloss or shall pay a penalty of twice the value of the dead man whichthe judges shall assess but purifications must be used greater andmore numerous than for those who committed homicide at the are to be the interpreters whom the god appoints shall beauthorized to declare and if a man kills his own slave when he hasbeen purified according to laws he shall be quit of the if a man kills a freeman unintentionally he shall undergo thesame purification as he did who killed the slave but let him notforget also a tale of olden time which is to this whohas suffered a violent end when newly dead if he has had the soul ofa freeman in life is angry with the author of his death and beinghimself full of fear and panic by reason of his violent end when hesees his murderer walking about in his own accustomed haunts he isstricken with terror and becomes disordered and this disorder of by the guilty recollection of is communicated by him withoverwhelming force to the murderer and his deeds wherefore also themurderer must go out of the way of his victim for the entire period ofa year and not himself be found in any spot which was familiar to himthroughout the country and if the dead man be a stranger thehomicide shall be kept from the country of the stranger during alike period if any one voluntarily obeys this law the next of kin tothe deceased seeing all that has happened shall take pity on make peace with him and show him all gentleness but if any oneis disobedient either ventures to go to any of the temples andsacrifice unpurified or will not continue in exile during theappointed time the next of kin to the deceased shall proceedagainst him for murder and if he be convicted every part of hispunishment shall be doubled 
 and if the next of kin do not proceed against the perpetrator of thecrime then the pollution shall be deemed to fall upon his murdered man will fix the guilt upon his kinsman and he whohas a mind to proceed against him may compel him to be absent from hiscountry during five years according to law if a strangerunintentionally kill a stranger who is dwelling in the city he wholikes shall prosecute the cause according to the same rules if hebe a metic let him be absent for a year or if he be an entirestranger in addition to the purification whether he have slain astranger or a metic or a citizen he shall be banished for life fromthe country which is in possession of our laws and if he returncontrary to law let the guardians of the law punish him with let them hand over his property if he have any to him who isnext of kin to the sufferer and if he be wrecked and driven on thecoast against his will he shall take up his abode on the his feet in the sea and watching for an opportunity ofsailing but if he be brought by land and is not his own the magistrate whom he first comes across in the city release himand send him unharmed over the border 
 if any one slays a freeman with his own hand and the deed be done inpassion in the case of such actions we must begin by making adistinction for a deed is done from passion either when men without intention to kill cause the death of another by blows andthe like on a momentary impulse and are sorry for the deedimmediately afterwards or again when after having been insulted indeed or word men pursue revenge and kill a person intentionally andare not sorry for the act and therefore we must assume that thesehomicides are of two kinds both of them arising from passion whichmay be justly said to be in a mean between the voluntary andinvoluntary at the same time they are neither of them anythingmore than a likeness or shadow of either he who treasures up hisanger and avenges himself not immediately and at the moment butwith insidious design and after an interval is like the he who does not treasure up his anger and takes vengeance onthe instant and without malice prepense approaches to theinvoluntary and yet even he is not altogether involuntary but onlythe image or shadow of the involuntary wherefore about homicidescommitted in hot blood there is a difficulty in determining whetherin legislating we shall reckon them as voluntary or as partlyinvoluntary the best and truest view is to regard them respectivelyas likenesses only of the voluntary and involuntary and todistinguish them accordingly as they are done with or withoutpremeditation and we should make the penalties heavier for thosewho commit homicide with angry premeditation and lighter for thosewho do not premeditate but smite upon the instant for that whichis like a greater evil should be punished more severely and thatwhich is like a less evil should be punished less severely this shallbe the rule of our laws 
 cle certainly 
 ath let us any one slays a free man with his ownhand and the deed be done in a moment of anger and withoutpremeditation let the offender suffer in other respects as theinvoluntary homicide would have suffered and also undergo an exile oftwo years that he may learn to school his passions but he whoslays another from passion yet with premeditation shall in otherrespects suffer as the former and to this shall be added an exileof three instead of two punishment is to be longer becausehis passion is greater the manner of their return shall be on thiswise and here the law has difficulty in determining exactly forin some cases the murderer who is judged by the law to be the worsemay really be the less cruel and he who is judged the less cruelmay be really the worse and may have executed the murder in a moresavage manner whereas the other may have been gentler but in generalthe degrees of guilt will be such as we have described them of allthese things the guardians of the law must take ahomicide of either kind has completed his term of exile the guardiansshall send twelve judges to the borders of the land these duringthe interval shall have informed themselves of the actions of thecriminals and they shall judge respecting their pardon and the homicides shall abide by their judgment but if after theyhave returned home any one of them in a moment of anger repeats thedeed let him be an exile and return no more or if he returns lethim suffer as the stranger was to suffer in a similar case he whokills his own slave shall undergo a purification but if he killsthe slave of another in anger he shall pay twice the amount of theloss to his owner and if any homicide is disobedient to the without purification pollutes the agora or the games or thetemples he who pleases may bring to trial the next of kin to the deadman for permitting him and the murderer with him and may compelthe one to exact and the other to suffer a double amount of finesand purifications and the accuser shall himself receive the fine inaccordance with the law if a slave in a fit of passion kills hismaster the kindred of the deceased man may do with the only they do not spare his life whatever they please andthey will be pure or if he kills a freeman who is not his owner shall give up the slave to the relatives of the they shall be under an obligation to put him to death but thismay be done in any manner which they please 
 and if which is a rare occurrence but does sometimes happen afather or a mother in a moment of passion slays a son or daughter byblows or some other violence the slayer shall undergo the samepurification as in other cases and be exiled during three when the exile returns the wife shall separate from the the husband from the wife and they shall never afterwards begetchildren together or live under the same roof or partake of the samesacred rites with those whom they have deprived of a child or of abrother and he who is impious and disobedient in such a case shall bebrought to trial for impiety by any one who pleases if in a fit ofanger a husband kills his wedded wife or the wife her husband theslayer shall undergo the same purification and the term of exileshall be three years and when he who has committed any such crimereturns let him have no communication in sacred rites with hischildren neither let him sit at the same table with them and thefather or son who disobeys shall be liable to be brought to trialfor impiety by any one who pleases if a brother or a sister in afit of passion kills a brother or a sister they shall undergopurification and exile as was the case with parents who killedtheir offspring they shall not come under the same roof or sharein the sacred rites of those whom they have deprived of theirbrethren or of their children 
 and he who is disobedient shall be justly liable to the lawconcerning impiety which relates to these matters if any one is soviolent in his passion against his parents that in the madness of hisanger he dares to kill one of them if the murdered person beforedying freely forgives the murderer let him undergo the purificationwhich is assigned to those who have been guilty of involuntaryhomicide and do as they do and he shall be pure but if he be notacquitted the perpetrator of such a deed shall be amenable to shall be amenable to the extreme punishments for assault andimpiety and robbing of temples for he has robbed his parent of if a man could be slain more than once most justly would he whoin a fit of passion has slain father or mother undergo many can he whom alone of all men even in defence of his life andwhen about to suffer death at the hands of his parents no law willallow to kill his father or his mother who are the authors of hisbeing and whom the legislator will command to endure any extremityrather than do can he i say lawfully receive any otherpunishment let death then be the appointed punishment of him who in afit of passion slays his father or his mother but if brother killsbrother in a civil broil or under other like circumstances if theother has begun and he only defends himself let him be free fromguilt as he would be if he had slain an enemy and the same rule willapply if a citizen kill a citizen or a stranger a stranger or if astranger kill a citizen or a citizen a stranger in lethim be free from guilt in like manner and so in the case of a slavewho has killed a slave but if a slave have killed a freeman let him be subject to the same law as he who haskilled a father and let the law about the remission of penalties inthe case of parricide apply equally to every other remission wheneverany sufferer of his own accord remits the guilt of homicide toanother under the idea that his act was involuntary let theperpetrator of the deed undergo a purification and remain in exile fora year according to law 
 enough has been said of murders violent and involuntary andcommitted in passion we have now to speak of voluntary crimes donewith injustice of every kind and with premeditation through theinfluence of pleasures and desires and jealousies 
 cle very good 
 ath let us first speak as far as we are able of their variouskinds the greatest cause of them is lust which gets the mastery ofthe soul maddened by desire and this is most commonly found toexist where the passion reigns which is strongest and most prevalentamong mass of mankind i mean where the power of wealth breeds endlessdesires of acquisition originating in naturaldisposition and a miserable want of education of this want ofeducation the false praise of wealth which is bruited about bothamong hellenes and barbarians is the cause they deem that to be thefirst of goods which in reality is only the third and in this waythey wrong both posterity and themselves for nothing can be noblerand better than that the truth about wealth should be spoken in that riches are for the sake of the body as the bodyis for the sake of the soul they are good and wealth is intendedby nature to be for the sake of them and is therefore inferior tothem both and third in order of excellence this argument teachesus that he who would be happy ought not to seek to be rich orrather he should seek to be rich justly and temperately and thenthere would be no murders in states requiring to be purged away byother murders but now as i said at first avarice is the chiefestcause and source of the worst trials for voluntary homicide asecond cause is ambition this creates jealousies which aretroublesome companions above all to the jealous man himself and in aless degree to the chiefs of the state and a third cause iscowardly and unjust fear which has been the occasion of many a man is doing or has done something which he desires that no oneshould know him to be doing or to have done he will take the lifeof those who are likely to inform of such things if he have noother means of getting rid of them let this be said as a preludeconcerning crimes of violence in general and i must not omit tomention a tradition which is firmly believed by many and has beenreceived by them from those who are learned in the mysteries they saythat such deeds will be punished in the world below and also thatwhen the perpetrators return to this world they will pay the naturalpenalty which is due to the sufferer and end their lives in likemanner by the hand of another if he who is about to commit murderbelieves this and is made by the mere prelude to dread such apenalty there is no need to proceed with the proclamation of the if he will not listen let the following law be declared andregistered against him 
 whoever shall wrongfully and of design slay with his own hand any ofhis kinsmen shall in the first place be deprived of legal he shall not pollute the temples or the agora or the any other place of meeting whether he is forbidden of men ornot for the law which represents the whole state forbids him andalways is and will be in the attitude of forbidding him and if acousin or nearer relative of the deceased whether on the male orfemale side does not prosecute the homicide when he ought and havehim proclaimed an outlaw he shall in the first place be involved inthe pollution and incur the hatred of the gods even as the curseof the law stirs up the voices of men against him and in the secondplace he shall be liable to be prosecuted by any one who is willing toinflict retribution on behalf of the dead and he who would avenge amurder shall observe all the precautionary ceremonies of lavation andany others which the god commands in cases of this kind let himhave proclamation made and then go forth and compel the perpetratorto suffer the execution of justice according to the law now thelegislator may easily show that these things must be accomplished byprayers and sacrifices to certain gods who are concerned with theprevention of murders in states but who these gods are and whatshould be the true manner of instituting such trials with due regardto religion the guardians of the law aided by the the prophets and the god shall determine and when they havedetermined let them carry on the prosecution at law the cause shallhave the same judges who are appointed to decide in the case ofthose who plunder temples let him who is convicted be punished withdeath and let him not be buried in the country of the murdered this would be shameless as well as impious but if he fly and willnot stand his trial let him fly for ever or if he set foot anywhereon any part of the murdered country let any relation of thedeceased or any other citizen who may first happen to meet withhim kill him with impunity or bind and deliver him to those amongthe judges of the case who are magistrates that they may put him todeath and let the prosecutor demand surety of him whom he sureties sufficient in the opinion of the magistrates who trythe cause shall be provided by him and they shall undertake toproduce him at the trial but if he be unwilling or unable toprovide sureties then the magistrates shall take him and keep himin bonds and produce him at the day of trial 
 if a man do not commit a murder with his own hand but contrives thedeath of another and is the author of the deed in intention anddesign and he continues to dwell in the city having his soul notpure of the guilt of murder let him be tried in the same in what relates to the sureties and also if he be foundguilty his body after execution may have burial in his native in all other respects his case shall be as the former and whethera stranger shall kill a citizen or a citizen a stranger or a slave aslave there shall be no difference as touching murder by ownhand or by contrivance except in the matter of sureties and has been said shall be required of the actual murderer only andhe who brings the accusation shall bind them over at the time if aslave be convicted of slaying a freeman voluntarily either by his ownhand or by contrivance let the public executioner take him in thedirection of the sepulchre to a place whence he can see the tomb ofthe dead man and inflict upon him as many stripes as the person whocaught him orders and if he survive let him put him to death and ifany one kills a slave who has done no wrong because he is afraid thathe may inform of some base and evil deeds of his own or for anysimilar reason in such a case let him pay the penalty of murder ashe would have done if he had slain a citizen there are things aboutwhich it is terrible and unpleasant to legislate but impossible notto legislate if for example there should be murders of perpetrated by the hands of kinsmen or by their and purely malicious which most often happen and states and may perhaps occur even in acountry where a man would not expect to find them we must repeat oncemore the tale which we narrated a little while ago in the hope thathe who hears us will be the more disposed to abstain voluntarily onthese grounds from murders which are utterly abominable for the saying or whatever we ought to call it has been plainly set forthby priests of old they have pronounced that the justice whichguards and avenges the blood of kindred follows the law ofretaliation and ordains that he who has done any murderous act shouldof necessity suffer that which he has done he who has slain afather shall himself be slain at some time or other by his mother he shall of necessity take a nature and lose hislife at the hands of his offspring in after ages for where theblood of a family has been polluted there is no other can the pollution be washed out until the homicidal soul which thedeed has given life for life and has propitiated and laid to sleepthe wrath of the whole family these are the retributions of by such punishments men should be deterred but if they are notdeterred and any one should be incited by some fatality to deprivehis father or mother or brethren or children of life voluntarilyand of purpose for him the earthly lawgiver legislates shall be the same proclamations about outlawry andthere shall be the same sureties which have been enacted in the formercases but in his case if he be convicted the servants of the judgesand the magistrates shall slay him at an appointed place without thecity where three ways meet and there expose his body naked andeach of the magistrates on behalf of the whole city shall take a stoneand cast it upon the head of the dead man and so deliver the cityfrom pollution after that they shall bear him to the borders ofthe land and cast him forth unburied according to law and whatshall he suffer who slays him who of all men as they say is hisown best friend i mean the suicide who deprives himself byviolence of his appointed share of life not because the law of thestate requires him nor yet under the compulsion of some painful andinevitable misfortune which has come upon him nor because he hashad to suffer from irremediable and intolerable shame but who fromsloth or want of manliness imposes upon himself an unjust penalty forhim what ceremonies there are to be of purification and burial godknows and about these the next of kin should enquire of theinterpreters and of the laws thereto relating and do according totheir injunctions they who meet their death in this way shall beburied alone and none shall be laid by their side they shall beburied ingloriously in the borders of the twelve portions the land insuch places as are uncultivated and nameless and no column orinscription shall mark the place of their interment and if a beast ofburden or other animal cause the death of any one except in thecase of anything of that kind happening to a competitor in thepublic contests the kinsmen of the deceased shall prosecute theslayer for murder and the wardens of the country such and so manyas the kinsmen appoint shall try the cause and let the beast whencondemned be slain by them and let them cast it beyond the if any lifeless thing deprive a man of life except in the case ofa thunderbolt or other fatal dart sent from the a manis killed by lifeless objects falling upon him or by his fallingupon them the nearest of kin shall appoint the nearest neighbour tobe a judge and thereby acquit himself and the whole family ofguilt and he shall cast forth the guilty thing beyond the has been said about the animals 
 if a man is found dead and his murderer be unknown and after adiligent search cannot be detected there shall be the sameproclamation as in the previous cases and the same interdict on themurderer and having proceeded against him they shall proclaim in theagora by a herald that he who has slain such and such a person andhas been convicted of murder shall not set his foot in the at all in the country of the murdered man and if he appears andis discovered he shall die and be cast forth unburied beyond theborder let this one law then be laid down by us about murder and letcases of this sort be so regarded 
 and now let us say in what cases and under what circumstances themurderer is rightly free from a man catch a thief his house by night to steal and he take and kill him or if heslay a footpad in he shall be guiltless and any one whodoes violence to a free woman or a youth shall be slain with impunityby the injured person or by his or her father or brothers or sons ifa man find his wife suffering violence he may kill the be guiltless in the eye of the law or if a person kill another inwarding off death from his father or mother or children or brethren orwife who are doing no wrong he shall assuredly be guiltless 
 thus much as to the nurture and education of the living soul of which he can and without which if he unfortunately bewithout them he cannot live and also concerning are to be inflicted for violent deaths let thusmuch be enacted of the nurture and education of the body we havespoken before and next in order we have to speak of deeds ofviolence voluntary and involuntary which men do to one we will now distinguish as far as we are able according totheir nature and number and determine what will be the suitablepenalties of each and so assign to them their proper place in theseries of our enactments the poorest legislator will have nodifficulty in determining that wounds and mutilations arising out ofwounds should follow next in order after deaths let wounds be dividedas homicides were those which are involuntary andwhich are given in passion or from fear and those inflictedvoluntarily and with premeditation concerning all this we mustmake some such proclamation as the must havelaws and conform to them or their life would be as bad as that ofthe most savage beast and the reason of this is that no is able to know what is best for human society or able and willing to do what is best in the first is a difficulty in apprehending that the true art or politics isconcerned not with private but with public good for public goodbinds together states but private only distracts them and that boththe public and private good as well of individuals as of states isgreater when the state and not the individual is first the second place although a person knows in the abstract that thisis true yet if he be possessed of absolute and irresponsible will never remain firm in his principles or persist in regardingthe public good as primary in the state and the private good assecondary human nature will be always drawing him into avarice andselfishness avoiding pain and pursuing pleasure without any will bring these to the front obscuring the juster and so working darkness in his soul will at last fill with evilsboth him and the whole city for if a man were born so divinely giftedthat he could naturally apprehend the truth he would have no needof laws to rule over him for there is no law or order which isabove knowledge nor can mind without impiety be deemed thesubject or slave of any man but rather the lord of all i speak ofmind true and free and in harmony with nature but then there isno such mind anywhere or at least not much and therefore we mustchoose law and order which are second best these look at things asthey exist for the most part only and are unable to survey thewhole of them and therefore i have spoken as i have 
 and now we will determine what penalty he ought to pay or suffer whohas hurt or wounded another any one may easily imagine thequestions which have to be asked in all such did he whom or how or when for there are innumerable particulars ofthis sort which greatly vary from one another and to allow courtsof law to determine all these things or not to determine any of alike impossible there is one particular which they must determinein all question of fact and then again that thelegislator should not permit them to determine what punishment is tobe inflicted in any of these cases but should himself decide them small or great is next to impossible 
 cle then what is to be the inference 
 ath the inference is that some things should be left to courtsof law others the legislator must decide for himself 
 cle and what ought the legislator to decide and what ought he toleave to courts of law 
 ath i may reply that in a state in which the courts are bad andmute because the judges conceal their opinions and decide causesclandestinely or what is worse when they are disorderly and in a theatre clapping or hooting in turn this or that saythat then there is a very serious evil which affects the whole is the necessity of having to legislate for such where the necessity exists the legislator should only allowthem to ordain the penalties for the smallest offences if the statefor which he is legislating be of this character he must take mostmatters into his own hands and speak distinctly but when a statehas good courts and the judges are well trained and scrupulouslytested the determination of the penalties or punishments whichshall be inflicted on the guilty may fairly and with advantage be leftto them and we are not to be blamed for not legislating concerningall that large class of matters which judges far worse educated thanours would be able to determine assigning to each offence what is dueboth to the perpetrator and to the sufferer we believe those for whomwe are legislating to be best able to judge and therefore to them thegreater part may be left at the same time as i have often said weshould exhibit to the judges as we have done the outline and form ofthe punishments to be inflicted and then they will not transgress thejust rule that was an excellent practice which we observed which now that we are resuming the work of legislation may withadvantage be repeated by us 
 let the enactment about wounding be in the following has a purpose and intention to slay another who is not hisenemy and whom the law does not permit him to slay and he woundshim but is unable to kill him he who had the intent and haswounded him is not to be deserves no consideration butshould be regarded as a murderer and be tried for murder still havingrespect to the fortune which has in a manner favoured him and tothe providence which in pity to him and to the wounded man saved theone from a fatal blow and the other from an accursed fate a to this deity and in order not to opposehis such a case the law will remit the punishment of only compel the offender to emigrate to a neighbouring city forthe rest of his life where he shall remain in the enjoyment of allhis possessions but if he have injured the wounded man he shall makesuch compensation for the injury as the court deciding the cause shallassess and the same judges shall decide who would have decided if theman had died of his wounds and if a child intentionally wound hisparents or a servant his master death shall be the penalty and if abrother ora sister intentionally wound a brother or a sister and isfound guilty death shall be the penalty and if a husband wound awife or a wife a husband with intent to kill let him or her undergoperpetual exile if they have sons or daughters who are still guardians shall take care of their property and have charge ofthe children as orphans if their sons are grown up they shall beunder no obligation to support the exiled parent but they shallpossess the property themselves and if he who meets with such amisfortune has no children the kindred of the exiled man to thedegree of sons of cousins both on the male and female side shallmeet together and after taking counsel with the guardians of theand the priests shall appoint a th citizen to be the heir ofthe house considering and reasoning that no house of all the belongs to the inhabitant or to the whole family but is the publicand private property of the state now the state should seek to haveits houses as holy and happy as possible and if any one of the housesbe unfortunate and stained with impiety and the owner leave noposterity but dies unmarried or married and childless havingsuffered death as the penalty of murder or some other crimecommitted against the gods or against his of whichdeath is the penalty distinctly laid down in the law or if any of thecitizens be in perpetual exile and also childless that house shallfirst of all be purified and undergo expiation according to law andthen let the kinsmen of the house as we were just now saying and theguardians of the law meet and consider what family there is in thestate which is of the highest repute for virtue and also for goodfortune in which there are a number of sons from that family letthem take one and introduce him to the father and forefathers of thedead man as their son and for the sake of the omen let him becalled so that he may be the continuer of their family the keeper oftheir hearth and the minister of their sacred rites with betterfortune than his father had and when they have made thissupplication they shall make him heir according to law and theoffending person they shall leave nameless and childless andportionless when calamities such as these overtake him 
 now the boundaries of some things do not touch one another butthere is a borderland which comes in between preventing them fromtouching and we were saying that actions done from passion are ofthis nature and come in between the voluntary and involuntary if aperson be convicted of having inflicted wounds in a passion in thefirst place he shall pay twice the amount of the injury if thewound be curable or if incurable four times the amount of theinjury or if the wound be curable and at the same time cause greatand notable disgrace to the wounded person he shall pay fourfold andwhenever any one in wounding another injures not only the also the city and makes him incapable of defending his countryagainst the enemy he besides the other penalties shall pay apenalty for the loss which the state has incurred and the penaltyshall be that in addition to his own times of service he shall serveon behalf of the disabled person and shall take his place in war he refuse he shall be liable to be convicted by law of refusalto serve the compensation for the injury whether to be twofold orthreefold or fourfold shall be fixed by the judges who convict if in like manner a brother wounds a brother the parents andkindred of either sex including the children of cousins whether onthe male or female side shall meet and when they have judged thecause they shall entrust the assessment of damages to the parents asis natural and if the estimate be disputed then the kinsmen on themale side shall make the estimate or if they cannot they shallcommit the matter to the guardians of the law and when similarcharges of wounding are brought by children against their who are more than sixty years of age having children of theirown not adopted shall be required to decide and if any one isconvicted they shall determine whether he or she ought to die orsuffer some other punishment either greater than death or at anyrate not much less a kinsman of the offender shall not be allowed tojudge the cause not even if he be of the age which is prescribed bythe law if a slave in a fit of anger wound a freeman the owner ofthe slave shall give him up to the wounded man who may do as hepleases with him and if be not give him up he shall himself make goodthe injury and if any one says that the slave and the wounded man areconspiring together let him argue the point and if he is cast heshall pay for the wrong three times over but if he gains his freeman who conspired with the slave shall reliable to an actionfor kidnapping and if any one unintentionally wounds another he shallsimply pay for the harm for no legislator is able to controlchance in such a case the judges shall be the same as those who areappointed in the case of children suing their parents and theyshall estimate the amount of the injury 
 all the preceding injuries and every kind of assault are deeds ofviolence and every man woman or child ought to consider that theelder has the precedence of the younger in honour both among the godsand also among men who would live in security and happiness whereforeit is a foul thing and hateful to the gods to see an elder manassaulted by a younger in the city and it is reasonable that ayoung man when struck by an elder should lightly endure his up in store for himself a like honour when he is old letthis be the one shall reverence his elder in word and shall respect any one who is twenty years older than male or female regarding him or her as his father ormother and he shall abstain from laying hands on any one who is of anage to have been his father or his mother out of reverence to thegods who preside over birth similarly he shall keep his hands froma stranger whether he be an old inhabitant or newly arrived he shallnot venture to correct such an one by blows either as the aggressoror in if he thinks that some stranger has struck him outof wantonness or insolence and ought to be punished he shall takehim to the wardens of the city but let him not strike him that thestranger may be kept far away from the possibility of lifting up hishand against a citizen and let the wardens of the city take theoffender and examine him not forgetting their duty to the god ofstrangers and in case the stranger appears to have struck the citizenunjustly let them inflict upon him as many blows with the scourgeas he has himself inflicted and quell his presumption but if he beinnocent they shall threaten and rebuke the man who arrested him andlet them both go if a person strikes another of the same age orsomewhat older than himself who has no children whether he be an oldman who strikes an old man or a young man who strikes a young man letthe person struck defend himself in the natural way without a weaponand with his hands only he who being more than forty years of to fight with another whether he be the aggressor or in selfdefence shall be regarded as rude and will be a disgraceful punishment and therefore suitableto him the obedient nature will readily yield to such the disobedient who heeds not the prelude shall have the lawready for any man smite another who is older than by twenty or by more years in the first place he who is athand not being younger than the combatants nor their equal in separate them or be disgraced according to law but if he bethe equal in age of the person who is struck or younger he shalldefend the person injured as he would a brother or father or stillolder relative further let him who dares to smite an elder betried for assault as i have said and if he be found guilty lethim be imprisoned for a period of not less than a year or if thejudges approve of a longer period their decision shall be if a stranger or metic smite one who is older by twenty years ormore the same law shall hold about the bystanders assisting and hewho is found guilty in such a suit if he be a stranger but notresident shall be imprisoned during a period of two years and ametic who disobeys the laws shall be imprisoned for three the court assign him a longer term and let him who was presentin any of these cases and did not assist according to law be he be of the highest dass by paying a fine of a mina or if hebe of the second class of fifty drachmas or if of the third a fine of thirty drachmas or if he be of the fourth class by afine of twenty drachmas and the generals and taxiarchs andphylarchs and hipparchs shall form the court in such cases 
 laws are partly framed for the sake of good men in order toinstruct them how they thay live on friendly terms with one partly for the sake of those who refuse to be instructed whosespirit cannot be subdued or softened or hindered from plunginginto evil these are the persons who cause the word to be spoken whichi am about to utter for them the legislator legislates ofnecessity and in the hope that there may be no need of his laws hewho shall dare to lay violent hands upon his father or mother orany still older relative having no fear either of the wrath of thegods above or of the punishments that are spoken of in the worldbelow but transgresses in contempt of ancient and universaltraditions as though he were too wise to believe in them requiressome extreme measure of prevention now death is not the worst thatcan happen to men far worse are the punishments which are said topursue them in the world below but although they are most true work on such souls no prevention for if they had any effectthere would be no slayers of mothers or impious hands lifted upagainst parents and therefore the punishments of this world which areinflicted during life ought not in such cases to fall short ifpossible of the terrors of the world below let our enactment then beas a man dare to strike his father or his mother or theirfathers or mothers he being at the time of sound mind then let anyone who is at hand come to the rescue as has been already said andthe metic or stranger who comes to the rescue shall be called to thefirst place in the games but if he do not come he shall suffer thepunishment of perpetual exile he who is not a metic if he comes tothe rescue shall have praise and if he do not come blame and ifa slave come to the rescue let him be made free but if he do notcome the rescue let him receive strokes of the whip by orderof the wardens of the agora if the occurrence take place in theagora or if somewhere in the city beyond the limits of the agora anywarden of the city is in residence shall punish him or if in thecountry then the commanders of the wardens of the country if thosewho are near at the time be inhabitants of the same place whetherthey be youths or men or women let them come to the rescue anddenounce him as the impious one and he who does not come to therescue shall fall under the curse of zeus the god of kindred and ofancestors according to law and if any one is found guilty ofassaulting a parent let him in the first place be for ever banishedfrom the city into the country and let him abstain from thetemples and if he do not abstain the wardens of the country shallpunish him with blows or in any way which they please and if hereturn he shall be put to death and if any freeman eat or drink orhave any other sort of intercourse with him or only meeting himhave voluntarily touched him he shall not enter into any into the agora nor into the city until he is purified for heshould consider that he has become tainted by a curse and if hedisobeys the law and pollutes the city and the temples contrary tolaw and one of the magistrates sees him and does not indict him whenhe gives in his account this omission shall be a most serious charge 
 if a slave strike a freeman whether a stranger or a citizen letany one who is present come to the rescue or pay the penaltyalready mentioned and let the bystanders bind him and deliver him upto the injured person and he receiving him shall put him in inflict on him as many stripes as he pleases but havingpunished him he must surrender him to his master according to law andnot deprive him of his property let the law be as who strikes a freeman not at the command of the owner shall receive bound from the man whom he has stricken andnot release him until the slave has persuaded the man whom he hasstricken that he ought to be released and let there be the samelaws about women in relation to women about men and women in relationto one another

 and now having spoken of assaults let us sum up all acts ofviolence under a single law which shall be as one shalltake or carry away any of his goods neither shall heuse anything which is his without the consent of theowner for these are the offences which are and have been and willever be the source of all the aforesaid evils the greatest of themare excesses and insolences of youth and are offences against thegreatest when they are done against religion and especially greatwhen in violation of public and holy rites or of the in which tribes and phratries share and in the second degreegreat when they are committed against private rites and in the third degree not to repeat the acts formerly insults are offered to parents the fourth kind of violence iswhen any one regardless of the authority of the rulers takes orcarries away or makes use of anything which belongs to them nothaving their consent and the fifth kind is when the violation ofthe civil rights of an individual demands reparation there shouldbe a common law embracing all these cases for we have already said ingeneral terms what shall be the punishment of sacrilege whetherfraudulent or violent and now we have to determine what is to bethe punishment of those who speak or act insolently toward the first we must give them an admonition which may be in thefollowing one who in obedience to the laws believed thatthere were gods ever intentionally did any unholy act or uttered anyunlawful word but he who did must have supposed one of that they did not is the first secondly that if they did they took no care of man orthirdly that they were easily appeased and turned aside from theirpurpose by sacrifices and prayers 
 cleinias what shall we say or do to these persons 
 athenian stranger my good friend let us first hear the jests whichi suspect that they in their superiority will utter against us 
 cle what jests 
 ath they will make some irreverent speech of this of athens and sparta and cnosus they will reply inthat you speak truly for some of us deny the very existence of thegods while others as you say are of opinion that they do not careabout us and others that they are turned from their course bygifts now we have a right to claim as you yourself allowed in thematter of laws that before you are hard upon us and threaten should argue with us and convince should first attempt toteach and persuade us that there are gods by reasonable evidences andalso that they are too good to be unrighteous or to be turned from their course by gifts for when we hear such thingssaid of them by those who are esteemed to be the best of poets andorators and prophets and priests and by innumerable others thethoughts of most of us are not set upon abstaining from unrighteousacts but upon doing them and atoning for them when lawgivers professthat they are gentle and not stern we think that they should first ofall use persuasion to us and show us the existence of gods if not ina better manner than other men at any rate in a truer and whoknows but that we shall hearken to you if then our request is afair one please to accept our challenge 
 cle but is there any difficulty in proving the existence of thegods 
 ath how would you prove it 
 cle how in the first place the earth and the sun and the starsand the universe and the fair order of the seasons and thedivision of them into years and months furnish proofs of theirexistence and also there is the fact that all hellenes and barbariansbelieve in them 
 ath i fear my sweet friend though i will not say that i muchregard the contempt with which the profane will be likely to assailus for you do not understand the nature of their complaint and youfancy that they rush into impiety only from a love of sensualpleasure 
 cle why stranger what other reason is there 
 ath one which you who live in a different atmosphere would neverguess 
 cle what is it 
 ath a very grievous sort of ignorance which is imagined to be thegreatest wisdom 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath at athens there are tales preserved in writing which the virtueof your state as i am informed refuses to admit they speak of thegods in prose as well as verse and the oldest of them tell of theorigin of the heavens and of the world and not far from the beginningof their story they proceed to narrate the birth of the gods andhow after they were born they behaved to one another whether thesestories have in other ways a good or a bad influence i should notlike to be severe upon them because they are ancient but looking atthem with reference to the duties of children to their parents icannot praise them or think that they are useful or at all the words of the ancients i have nothing more to say and ishould wish to say of them only what is pleasing to the gods but asto our younger generation and their wisdom i cannot let them off whenthey do mischief for do but mark the effect of their words whenyou and i argue for the existence of the gods and produce the stars and earth claiming for them a divine being if wewould listen to the aforesaid philosophers we should say that they areearth and stones only which can have no care at all of human that all religion is a cooking up of words and a 
 cle one such teacher o stranger would be bad enough and youimply that there are many of them which is worse 
 ath well then what shall we say or we assume thatsome one is accusing us among unholy men who are trying to escapefrom the effect of our legislation and that they say of that you should legislate on the supposition that there aregods shall we make a defence of ourselves or shall we leave them andreturn to our laws lest the prelude should become longer than thelaw for the discourse will certainly extend to great length if weare to treat the impiously disposed as they desire partlydemonstrating to them at some length the things of which they demandan explanation partly making them afraid or dissatisfied and thenproceed to the requisite enactments 
 cle yes stranger but then how often have we repeated already thaton the present occasion there is no reason why brevity should bepreferred to length who is at our the saying goes and itwould be paltry and ridiculous to prefer the shorter to the better itis a matter of no small consequence in some way or other to provethat there are gods and that they are good and regard justice morethan men do the demonstration of this would be the best and noblestprelude of all our laws and therefore without impatience andwithout hurry let us unreservedly consider the whole up all the power of persuasion which we possess 
 ath seeing you thus in earnest i would fain offer up a prayer thati may i must proceed at once who can be calm when heis called upon to prove the existence of the gods who can avoidhating and abhorring the men who are and have been the cause of thisargument i speak of those who will not believe the tales which theyhave heard as babes and sucklings from their mothers and by them both in jest and earnest like charms who havealso heard them in the sacrificial prayers and seen sightsaccompanying and sounds delightful to theirparents during the sacrifices showing an intense earnestness on behalfof their children and of themselves and with eager interest talkingto the gods and beseeching them as though they were firmly convincedof their existence who likewise see and hear the prostrations andinvocations which are made by hellenes and barbarians at the risingand setting of the sun and moon in all the vicissitudes of as if they thought that there were no gods but as if therecould be no doubt of their existence and no suspicion of when men knowing all these things despise them onno real grounds as would be admitted by all who have any particleof intelligence and when they force us to say what we are now can any one in gentle terms remonstrate with the like of he has to begin by proving to them the very existence of thegods yet the attempt must be made for it would be unseemly thatone half of mankind should go mad in their lust of pleasure and theother half in their indignation at such persons our address tothese lost and perverted natures should not be spoken in us suppose ourselves to select some one of them and gently reasonwith him smothering our my son we will say to him youare young and the advance of time will make you reverse may of theopinions which you now hold wait awhile and do not attempt tojudge at present of the highest things and that is the highest ofwhich you now think know the gods rightly and to liveaccordingly and in the first place let me indicate to you one pointwhich is of great importance and about which i cannot and your friends are not the first who have held thisopinion about the gods there have always been persons more or lessnumerous who have had the same disorder i have known many of can tell you that no one who had taken up in youth thisopinion that the gods do not exist ever continued in the sameuntil he was old the two other notions certainly do continue insome cases but not in many the notion i mean that the godsexist but take no heed of human things and the other notion thatthey do take heed of them but are easily propitiated withsacrifices and prayers as to the opinion about the gods which maysome day become clear to you i advise you go wait and consider ifit be true or not ask of others and above all of the the meantime take care that you do not offend against the gods forthe duty of the legislator is and always will be to teach you thetruth of these matters 
 cle our address stranger thus far is excellent 
 ath quite true megillus and cleinias but i am afraid that we haveunconsciously lighted on a strange doctrine 
 cle what doctrine do you mean 
 ath the wisest of all doctrines in the opinion of many 
 cle i wish that you would speak plainer 
 ath the doctrine that all things do become have become and willbecome some by nature some by art and some by chance 
 cle is not that true 
 ath well philosophers are probably right at any rate we may aswell follow in their track and examine what is the meaning of themand their disciples 
 cle by all means 
 ath they say that the greatest and fairest things are the work ofnature and of chance the lesser of art which receiving fromnature the greater and primeval creations moulds and fashions allthose lesser works which are generally termed artificial 
 cle how is that 
 ath i will explain my meaning still more clearly they say thatfire and water and earth and air all exist by nature and chance andnone of them by art and that as to the bodies which come next and sun and moon and have been created bymeans of these absolutely inanimate existences the elements areseverally moved by chance and some inherent force according to certainaffinities among hot with cold or of dry with moist or ofsoft with hard and according to all the other accidental admixturesof opposites which have been formed by necessity after this fashionand in this manner the whole heaven has been created and all thatis in the heaven as well as animals and all plants and all theseasons come from these elements not by the action of mind as theysay or of any god or from art but as i was saying by nature andchance only art sprang up afterwards and out of these mortal andof mortal birth and produced in play certain images and verypartial imitations of the truth having an affinity to one as music and painting create and their companion arts andthere are other arts which have a serious purpose and with nature such for example as medicine and gymnastic and they say that politics cooperate with nature butin a less degree and have more of art also that legislation isentirely a work of art and is based on assumptions which are nottrue 
 cle how do you mean 
 ath in the first place my dear friend these people would say thatthe gods exist not by nature but by art and by the laws of are different in different places according to the agreement ofthose who make them and that the honourable is one thing by natureand another thing by law and that the principles of justice have noexistence at all in nature but that mankind are always disputingabout them and altering them and that the alterations which aremade by art and by law have no basis in nature but are of authorityfor the moment and at the time at which they are myfriends are the sayings of wise men poets and prose writers whichfind a way into the minds of youth they are told by them that thehighest right is might and in this way the young fall into the idea that the gods are not such as the law bids themimagine and hence arise factions these philosophers inviting them tolead a true life according to nature that is to live in realdominion over others and not in legal subjection to them 
 cle what a dreadful picture stranger have you given and howgreat is the injury which is thus inflicted on young men to the ruinboth of states and families 
 ath true cleinias but then what should the lawgiver do whenthis evil is of long standing should he only rise up in the state andthreaten all mankind proclaiming that if they will not say andthink that the gods are such as the law ordains and this may beextended generally to the honourable the just and to all the highestthings and to all that relates to virtue and vice and if theywill not make their actions conform to the copy which the law givesthem then he who refuses to obey the law shall die or suffer stripesand bonds or privation of citizenship or in some cases be punishedby loss of property and exile should he not rather when he is makinglaws for men at the same time infuse the spirit of persuasion intohis words and mitigate the severity of them as far as he can 
 cle why stranger if such persuasion be at all possible then alegislator who has anything in him ought never to weary ofpersuading men he ought to leave nothing unsaid in support of theancient opinion that there are gods and of all those other truthswhich you were just now mentioning he ought to support the law andalso art and acknowledge that both alike exist by nature and no lessthan nature if they are the creations of mind in accordance withright reason you appear to me to maintain and i am disposed to agreewith you in thinking 
 ath yes my enthusiastic cleinias but are not these things whenspoken to a multitude hard to be understood not to mention thatthey take up a dismal length of time 
 cle why stranger shall we whose patience failed not whendrinking or music were the themes of discourse weary now ofdiscoursing about the gods and about divine things and thegreatest help to rational legislation is that the laws when oncewritten down are always at rest they can be put to the test at anyfuture time and therefore if on first hearing they seem is no reason for apprehension about them because any manhowever dull can go over them and consider them again and again norif they are tedious but useful is there any reason or religion as itseems to me in any man refusing to maintain the principles of them tothe utmost of his power 
 megillus stranger i like what cleinias is saying 
 ath yes megillus and we should do as he proposes for ifimpious discourses were not scattered as i may say throughout theworld there would have been no need for any vindication of theexistence of the seeing that they are spread far and arguments are needed and who should come to the rescue of thegreatest laws when they are being undermined by bad men but thelegislator himself 
 meg there is no more proper champion of them 
 ath well then tell me i must ask you to be not he who talks in this way conceive fire and waterand earth and air to be the first elements of all things these hecalls nature and out of these he supposes the soul to be formedafterwards and this is not a mere conjecture of ours about hismeaning but is what he really means 
 cle very true 
 ath then by heaven we have discovered the source of this vainopinion of all those physical investigators and i would have youexamine their arguments with the utmost care for their impiety is avery serious matter they not only make a bad and mistaken use ofargument but they lead away the minds of others that is my opinionof them 
 cle you are right but i should like to know how this happens 
 ath i fear that the argument may seem singular 
 cle do not hesitate stranger i see that you are afraid of sucha discussion carrying you beyond the limits of legislation but ifthere be no other way of showing our agreement in the belief thatthere are gods of whom the law is said now to approve let us takethis way my good sir 
 ath then i suppose that i must repeat the singular argument ofthose who manufacture the soul according to their own impious affirm that which is the first cause of the generation anddestruction of all things to be not first but last and that whichis last to be first and hence they have fallen into error about thetrue nature of the gods 
 cle still i do not understand you 
 ath nearly all of them my friends seem to be ignorant of thenature and power of the soul especially in what relates to herorigin they do not know that she is among the first of things andbefore all bodies and is the chief author of their changes andtranspositions and if this is true and if the soul is older than thebody must not the things which are of the kindred be ofnecessity prior to those which appertain to the body 
 cle certainly 
 ath then thought and attention and mind and art and law will beprior to that which is hard and soft and heavy and light and thegreat and primitive works and actions will be works of art theywill be the first and after them will come nature and works ofnature which however is a wrong term for men to apply to will follow and will be under the government of art and mind 
 cle but why is the word nature wrong 
 ath because those who use the term mean to say that nature is thefirst creative power but if the soul turn out to be the primevalelement and not fire or air then in the truest sense and beyondother things the soul may be said to exist by nature and this wouldbe true if you proved that the soul is older than the body but nototherwise 
 cle you are quite right 
 ath shall we then take this as the next point to which ourattention should be directed 
 cle by all means 
 ath let us be on our guard lest this most deceptive argument withits youthful looks beguiling us old men give us the slip and makea of us who knows but we may be aiming at the fail of attaining the lesser suppose that we three have to pass arapid river and i being the youngest of the three and experienced inrivers take upon me the duty of making the attempt first by you in safety on the bank i am to examine whether the riveris passable by older men like yourselves and if such appears to bethe case then i shall invite you to follow and my experience willhelp to convey you across but if the river is impassable by you thenthere will have been no danger to anybody but not thatseem to be a very fair proposal i mean to say that the argument inprospect is likely to be too much for you out of your depth andbeyond your strength and i should be afraid that the stream of myquestions might create in you who are not in the habit of and confusion of mind and hence a feeling of unpleasantnessand unsuitableness might arise i think therefore that i had betterfirst ask the questions and then answer them myself while you listenin safety in that way i can carry on the argument until i havecompleted the proof that the soul is prior to the body 
 cle excellent stranger and i hope that you will do as youpropose 
 ath come then and if ever we are to call upon the gods let uscall upon them now in all seriousness to come to the demonstrationof their own existence and so holding fast to the rope we willventure upon the depths of the argument when questions of this sortare asked of me my safest answer would appear to be one says to me o stranger are all things at restand nothing in motion or is the exact opposite of this true or aresome things in motion and others at this i shall reply thatsome things are in motion and others at rest and do not things whichmove a place and are not the things which are at rest at rest in aplace certainly and some move or rest in one place and some inmore places than one you mean to say we shall rejoin that thosethings which rest at the centre move in one place just as thecircumference goes round of globes which are said to be at and we observe that in the revolution the motion whichcarries round the larger and the lesser circle at the same time isproportionally distributed to greater and smaller and is greaterand smaller in a certain proportion here is a wonder which might bethought an impossibility that the same motion should impart swiftnessand slowness in due proportion to larger and lesser circles verytrue and when you speak of bodies moving in many places you seem tome to mean those which move from one place to another and sometimeshave one centre of motion and sometimes more than one because theyturn upon their axis and whenever they meet anything if it bestationary they are divided by it but if they get in the midstbetween bodies which are approaching and moving towards the samespot from opposite directions they unite with them i admit thetruth of what you are saying also when they unite they grow andwhen they are divided they waste is supposing theconstitution of each to remain or if that fails then there is asecond reason of their dissolution and when are all things createdand how clearly they are created when the first principlereceives increase and attains to the second dimension and from thisarrives at the one which is neighbour to this and after reachingthe third becomes perceptible to sense everything which is thuschanging and moving is in process of generation only when at rest hasit real existence but when passing into another state it is destroyedutterly have we not mentioned all motions that there are andcomprehended them under their kinds and numbered them with theexception my friends of two 
 cle which are they 
 ath just the two with which our present enquiry is concerned 
 cle speak plainer 
 ath i suppose that our enquiry has reference to the soul 
 cle very true 
 ath let us assume that there is a motion able to move other not to move is one kind and there is another kindwhich can move itself as well as other things working incomposition and decomposition by increase and diminution andgeneration and is also one of the many kinds ofmotion 
 cle granted 
 ath and we will assume that which moves other and is changed byother to be the ninth and that which changes itself and is with every action and every passion and is thetrue principle of change and motion in all that we shall beinclined to call the tenth 
 cle certainly 
 ath and which of these ten motions ought we to prefer as beingthe mightiest and most efficient 
 cle i must say that the motion which is able to move itself isten thousand times superior to all the others 
 ath very good but may i make one or two corrections in what i havebeen saying 
 cle what are they 
 ath when i spoke of the tenth sort of motion that was not quitecorrect 
 cle what was the error 
 ath according to the true order the tenth was really the firstin generation and power then follows the second which wasstrangely enough termed the ninth by us 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath i mean this when one thing changes another and thatanother of such will there be any primary changing element how can athing which is moved by another ever be the beginning of but when the changes other and that againother and thus thousands upon tens of thousands of bodies are setin motion must not the beginning of all this motion be the changeof the principle 
 cle very true and i quite agree 
 ath or to put the question in another way making answer as most of these philosophers have the audacity toaffirm all things were at rest in one mass which of principles of motion would first spring up among them 
 cle clearly the for there could be no change in themarising out of any external cause the change must first take place inthemselves 
 ath then we must say that being the origin of allmotions and the first which arises among things at rest as well asamong things in motion is the eldest and mightiest principle ofchange and that which is changed by another and yet moves other issecond 
 cle quite true 
 ath at this stage of the argument let us put a question 
 cle what question 
 ath if we were to see this power existing in any earthy watery orfiery substance simple or should we describe it 
 cle you mean to ask whether we should call such a powerlife 
 ath i do 
 cle certainly we should 
 ath and when we see soul in anything must we not do we not admit that this is life 
 cle we must 
 ath and now i beseech you would admit that we have athreefold knowledge of things 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath i mean that we know the essence and that we know thedefinition of the essence and the are the three andthere are two questions which may be raised about anything 
 cle how two 
 ath sometimes a person may give the name and ask the definition orhe may give the definition and ask the name i may illustrate what imean in this way 
 cle how 
 ath number like some other things is capable of being dividedinto equal parts when thus divided number is named even and thedefinition of the name even is number divisible into two equalparts 
 cle true 
 ath i mean that when we are asked about the definition and givethe name or when we are asked about the name and give either case whether we give name or definition wespeak of the same thing calling even the number which is dividedinto two equal parts 
 cle quite true 
 ath and what is the definition of that which is named soul canwe conceive of any other than that which has been already which can move itself 
 cle you mean to say that the essence which is defined as is the same with that which has the name soul 
 ath yes and if this is true do we still maintain that there isanything wanting in the proof that the soul is the first origin andmoving power of all that is or has become or will be and theircontraries when she has been clearly shown to be the source of changeand motion in all things 
 cle certainly not the soul as being the source of motion has beenmost satisfactorily shown to be the oldest of all things 
 ath and is not that motion which is produced in another byreason of another but never has any power at all beingin truth the change of an inanimate body to be reckoned second or byany lower number which you may prefer 
 cle exactly 
 ath then we are right and speak the most perfect and absolutetruth when we say that the soul is prior to the body and that thebody is second and comes afterwards and is born to obey the is the ruler 
 cle nothing can be more true 
 ath do you remember our old admission that if the soul was priorto the body the things of the soul were also prior to those of thebody 
 cle certainly 
 ath then characters and manners and wishes and reasonings andtrue opinions and reflections and recollections are prior tolength and breadth and depth and strength of bodies if the soul isprior to the body 
 cle to be sure 
 ath in the next place must we not of necessity admit that the soulis the cause of good and evil base and honourable just and of all other opposites if we suppose her to be the cause of allthings 
 cle we must 
 ath and as the soul orders and inhabits all things that moving must we not say that she orders also the heavens 
 cle of course 
 ath one soul or more more than will answer for you at anyrate we must not suppose that there are less than theauthor of good and the other of evil 
 cle very true 
 ath yes very true the soul then directs all things in heaven andearth and sea by her movements and these are described by consideration attention deliberation opinion true andfalse joy and sorrow confidence fear hatred love and otherprimary motions akin to these which again receive the secondarymotions of corporeal substances and guide all things to growth anddecay to composition and decomposition and to the qualities whichaccompany them such as heat and cold heaviness and and softness blackness and whiteness bitterness andsweetness and all those other qualities which the soul a goddess when truly receiving the divine mind shedisciplines all things rightly to their happiness but when she is thecompanion of folly she does the very contrary of all this shall weassume so much or do we still entertain doubts 
 cle there is no room at all for doubt 
 ath shall we say then that it is the soul which controls heaven andearth and the whole it is a principle of wisdom andvirtue or a principle which has neither wisdom nor virtue supposethat we make answer as follows 
 cle how would you answer 
 ath if my friend we say that the whole path and movement ofheaven and of all that is therein is by nature akin to themovement and revolution and calculation of mind and proceeds bykindred laws then as is plain we must say that the best soultakes care of the world and guides it along the good path 
 cle true 
 ath but if the world moves wildly and irregularly then the evilsoul guides it 
 cle true again 
 ath of what nature is the movement of this question itis not easy to give an intelligent answer and therefore i ought toassist you in framing one 
 cle very good 
 ath then let us not answer as if we would look straight at the ourselves darkness at mean as if we were under theimpression that we could see with mortal eyes or know adequatelythe nature of will be safer to look at the image only 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath let us select of the ten motions the one which mind chieflyresembles this i will bring to your recollection and will thenmake the answer on behalf of us all 
 cle that will be excellent 
 ath you will surely remember our saying that all things were eitherat rest or in motion 
 cle i do 
 ath and that of things in motion some were moving in one place andothers in more than one 
 cle yes 
 ath of these two kinds of motion that which moves in one placemust move about a centre like globes made in a lathe and is mostentirely akin and similar to the circular movement of mind 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath in saying that both mind and the motion which is in one placemove in the same and like manner in and about the same and inrelation to the same and according to one proportion and order andare like the motion of a globe we invented a fair image which doesno discredit to our ingenuity 
 cle it does us great credit 
 ath and the motion of the other sort which is not after the samemanner nor in the same nor about the same nor in relation to thesame nor in one place nor in order nor according to any rule orproportion may be said to be akin to senselessness and folly 
 cle that is most true 
 ath then after what has been said there is no difficulty indistinctly stating that since soul carries all things round eitherthe best soul or the contrary must of necessity carry round andorder and arrange the revolution of the heaven 
 cle and judging from what has been said stranger there would beimpiety in asserting that any but the most perfect soul or soulscarries round the heavens 
 ath you have understood my meaning right well cleinias and nowlet me ask you another question 
 cle what are you going to ask 
 ath if the soul carries round the sun and moon and the otherstars does she not carry round each individual of them 
 cle certainly 
 ath then of one of them let us speak and the same argument willapply to all 
 cle which will you take 
 ath every one sees the body of the sun but no one sees his the soul of any other body living or dead and yet there isgreat reason to believe that this nature unperceived by any of oursenses is circumfused around them all but is perceived by therefore by mind and reflection only let us apprehend thefollowing point 
 cle what is that 
 ath if the soul carries round the sun we shall not be far wrong insupposing one of three alternatives 
 cle what are they 
 ath either the soul which moves the sun this way and within the circular and visible body like the soul whichcarries us about every way or the soul provides herself with anexternal body of fire or air as some affirm and violently propelsbody by body or thirdly she is without such abody but guides thesun by some extraordinary and wonderful power 
 cle yes certainly the soul can only order all things in one ofthese three ways 
 ath and this soul of the sun which is therefore better than thesun whether taking the sun about in a chariot to give light to acting from without or in whatever way ought by every man to bedeemed a god 
 cle yes by every man who has the least particle of sense 
 ath and of the stars too and of the moon and of the years andmonths and seasons must we not say in like manner that since asoul or souls having every sort of excellence are the causes of all ofthem those souls are gods whether they are living beings andreside in bodies and in this way order the whole heaven orwhatever be the place and mode of their will any onewho admits all this venture to deny that all things full of gods 
 cle no one stranger would be such a madman 
 ath and now megillus and cleinias let us offer terms to him whohas hitherto denied the existence of the gods and leave him 
 cle what terms 
 ath either he shall teach us that we were wrong in saying thatthe soul is the original of all things and arguing accordingly he be not able to say anything better then he must yield to us andlive for the remainder of his life in the belief that there us see then whether we have said enough or not enough tothose who deny that there are gods 
 cle enough stranger 
 ath then to them we will say no more and now we are to address himwho believing that there are gods believes also that they take noheed of human affairs to him we thou best of men inbelieving that there are gods you are led by some affinity to attracts you towards your kindred and makes you honour andbelieve in them but the fortunes of evil and unrighteous men inprivate as well as public life which though not really happy arewrongly counted happy in the judgment of men and are celebratedboth by poets and prose draw you aside from your naturalpiety perhaps you have seen impious men growing old and leaving children in high offices and their prosperity shakesyour have known or heard or been yourself an eyewitness ofmany monstrous impieties and have beheld men by such criminalmeans from small beginnings attaining to sovereignty and thepinnacle of greatness and considering all these things you do notlike to accuse the gods of them because they are your so from some want of reasoning power and also from anunwillingness to find fault with them you have come to believe thatthey exist indeed but have no thought or care of human things your present evil opinion may not grow to still greaterimpiety and that we may if possible use arguments which may conjureaway the evil before it arrives we will add another argument tothat originally addressed to him who utterly denied the existence ofthe gods and do you megillus and cleinias answer for the youngman as you did before and if any impediment comes in our way iwill take the word out of your mouths and carry you over the river asi did just now 
 cle very good do as you say and we will help you as well as wecan 
 ath there will probably be no difficulty in proving to him that thegods care about the small as well as about the great for he waspresent and heard what was said that they are perfectly good andthat the care of all things is most entirely natural to them 
 cle no doubt he heard that 
 ath let us consider together in the next place what we mean by thisvirtue which we ascribe to them surely we should say that to betemperate and to possess mind belongs to virtue and the contrary tovice 
 cle certainly 
 ath yes and courage is a part of virtue and cowardice of vice 
 cle true 
 ath and the one is honourable and the other dishonourable 
 cle to be sure 
 ath and the one like other meaner things is a human the gods have no part in anything of the sort 
 cle that again is what everybody will admit 
 ath but do we imagine carelessness and idleness and luxury to bevirtues what do you think 
 cle decidedly not 
 ath they rank under the opposite class 
 cle yes 
 ath and their opposites therefore would fall under the oppositeclass 
 cle yes 
 ath but are we to suppose that one who possesses all these goodqualities will be luxurious and heedless and idle like those whom thepoet compares to stingless drones 
 cle and the comparison is a most just one 
 ath surely god must not be supposed to have a nature which hehimself who dares to say this sort of thing must not betolerated for a moment 
 cle of course not how could he have 
 ath should we not on any principle be entirely mistaken in praisingany one who has some special business entrusted to him if he have amind which takes care of great matters and no care of small he who acts in this way whether he be god or man must actfrom one of two principles 
 cle what are they 
 ath either he must think that the neglect of the small matters isof no consequence to the whole or if he knows that they are ofconsequence and he neglects them his neglect must be attributed tocarelessness and indolence is there any other way in which hisneglect can be explained for surely when it is impossible for him totake care of all he is not negligent if he fails to attend to thesethings great or small which a god or some inferior being might bewanting in strength or capacity to manage 
 cle certainly not 
 ath now then let us examine the offenders who both alike confessthat there are gods but with a one saying that theymay be appeased and the other that they have no care of smallmatters there are three of us and two of them and we will say the first place you both acknowledge that the gods hear andsee and know all things and that nothing can escape them which ismatter of sense and you admit this 
 cle yes 
 ath and do you admit also that they have all power which mortalsand immortals can have 
 cle they will of course admit this also 
 ath and surely we three and they in that they are good and perfect 
 cle assuredly 
 ath but if they are such as we conceive them to be can wepossibly suppose that they ever act in the spirit of carelessnessand indolence for in us inactivity is the child of cowardice andcarelessness of inactivity and indolence 
 cle most true 
 ath then not from inactivity and carelessness is any god evernegligent for there is no cowardice in them 
 cle that is very true 
 ath then the alternative which remains is that if the gods neglectthe lighter and lesser concerns of the universe they neglect thembecause they know that they ought not to care about other alternative is there but the opposite of theirknowing 
 cle there is none 
 ath and o most excellent and best of men do i understand you tomean that they are careless because they are ignorant and do not knowthat they ought to take care or that they know and yet like themeanest sort of men knowing the better choose the worse because theyare overcome by pleasures and pains 
 cle impossible 
 ath do not all human things partake of the nature of soul and isnot man the most religious of all animals 
 cle that is not to be denied 
 ath and we acknowledge that all mortal creatures are the propertyof the gods to whom also the whole of heaven belongs 
 cle certainly 
 ath and therefore whether a person says that these things areto the gods great or either case it would not be naturalfor the gods who own us and who are the most careful and the bestof owners to neglect is also a further consideration 
 cle what is it 
 ath sensation and power are in an inverse ratio to each other inrespect to their case and difficulty 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath i mean that there is greater difficulty in seeing and hearingthe small than the great but more facility in moving andcontrolling and taking care of and unimportant things than of theiropposites 
 cle far more 
 ath suppose the case of a physician who is willing and able to curesome living thing as a will the whole fare at his hands ifhe takes care only of the greater and neglects the parts which arelesser 
 cle decidedly not well 
 ath no better would be the result with pilots or generals orhouseholders or statesmen or any other such class if theyneglected the small and regarded only the the builderssay the larger stones do not lie well without the lesser 
 cle of course not 
 ath let us not then deem god inferior to human workmen who inproportion to their skill finish and perfect their works small aswell as great by one and the same art or that god the wisest ofbeings who is both willing and able to take care is like a or a coward who turns his back upon labour andgives no thought to smaller and easier matters but to the greateronly 
 cle never stranger let us admit a supposition about the godswhich is both impious and false 
 ath i think that we have now argued enough with him who delights toaccuse the gods of neglect 
 cle yes 
 ath he has been forced to acknowledge that he is in error but hestill seems to me to need some words of consolation 
 cle what consolation will you offer him 
 ath let us say to the ruler of the universe hasordered all things with a view to the excellence and preservation ofthe whole and each part as far as may be has an action andpassion appropriate to it over these down to the least fraction ofthem ministers have been appointed to preside who have wrought outtheir perfection with infinitesimal exactness and one of theseportions of the universe is thine own unhappy man which howeverlittle contributes to the whole and you do not seem to be aware thatthis and every other creation is for the sake of the whole and inorder that the life of the whole may be blessed and that you arecreated for the sake of the whole and not the whole for the sake ofyou for every physician and every skilled artist does all thingsfor the sake of the whole directing his effort towards the commongood executing the part for the sake of the whole and not thewhole for the sake of the part and you are annoyed because you areignorant how what is best for you happens to you and to theuniverse as far as the laws of the common creation admit now as thesoul combining first with one body and then with another undergoes allsorts of changes either of herself or through the influence ofanother soul all that remains to the player of the game is that heshould shift the pieces sending the better nature to the betterplace and the worse to the worse and so assigning to them theirproper portion 
 cle in what way do you mean 
 ath in a way which may be supposed to make the care of all thingseasy to the gods if any one were to form or fashion all thingswithout any regard to the for example he formed a livingelement of water out of fire instead of forming many things out ofone or one out of many in regular order attaining to a first or secondor third birth the transmutation would have been infinite but nowthe ruler of the world has a wonderfully easy task 
 cle how so 
 ath i will the king saw that our actions had that there was much virtue in them and much vice and that thesoul and body although not like the gods of popular yet having once come into existence were indestructible forif either of them had been destroyed there would have been nogeneration of living beings and when he observed that the good ofthe soul was ever by nature designed to profit men and the evil toharm seeing all this contrived so to place each of the partsthat their position might in the easiest and best manner procure thevictory of good and the defeat of evil in the whole and hecontrived a general plan by which a thing of a certain nature founda certain seat and room but the formation of qualities he left to thewills of individuals for every one of us is made pretty much whathe is by the bent of his desires and the nature of his soul 
 cle yes that is probably true 
 ath then all things which have a soul change and possess inthemselves a principle of change and in changing move according tolaw and to the order of destiny natures which have undergone a lesserchange move less and on the surface but those which havesuffered more change and have become more criminal sink into theabyss that is to say into hades and other places in the world which the very names terrify men and which they picture tothemselves as in a dream both while alive and when released fromthe body and whenever the soul receives more of good or evil from herown energy and the strong influence of she has communionwith divine virtue and becomes divine she is carried into another andbetter place which is perfect in holiness but when she has communionwith evil then she also changes the place of her life 
 this is the justice of the gods who inhabit youth or young man who fancy that you are neglected by the that if you become worse you shall go to the worse souls or ifbetter to the better and in every succession of life and death youwill do and suffer what like may fitly suffer at the hands of is the justice of heaven which neither you nor any otherunfortunate will ever glory in escaping and which the ordainingpowers have specially ordained take good heed thereof for it will besure to take heed of you if you am small and will creep intothe depths of the earth or i am high and will fly up to heaven youare not so small or so high but that you shall pay the fittingpenalty either here or in the world below or in some still moresavage place whither you shall be conveyed this is also theexplanation of the fate of those whom you saw who had done unholy andevil deeds and from small beginnings had grown great and you fanciedthat from being miserable they had become happy and in their in a mirror you seemed to see the universal neglect of the knowing how they make all things work together and contribute tothe great whole and thinkest thou bold man that thou needest not toknow who knows it not can never form any true idea of thehappiness or unhappiness of life or hold any rational discourserespecting either if cleinias and this our reverend company succeedin bringing to you that you know not what you say of the gods thenwill god help you but should you desire to hear more listen towhat we say to the third opponent if you have any understandingwhatsoever for i think that we have sufficiently proved the existenceof the gods and that they care for other notion that theyare appeased by the wicked and take gifts is what we must notconcede to any one and what every man should disprove to the utmostof his power 
 cle very good let us do as you say 
 ath well then by the gods themselves i conjure you to they are to be propitiated how are they to be are they and what is their nature must they not be at leastrulers who have to order unceasingly the whole heaven 
 cle true 
 ath and to what earthly rulers can they be compared or who tothem how in the less can we find an image of the greater are theycharioteers of contending pairs of steeds or pilots of they might be compared to the generals of armies or theymight be likened to physicians providing against the diseases whichmake war upon the body or to husbandmen observing anxiously theeffects of the seasons on the growth of plants or i perhaps toshepherds of flocks for as we acknowledge the world to be full ofmany goods and also of evils and of more evils than goods thereis as we affirm an immortal conflict going on among us whichrequires marvellous watchfulness and in that conflict the gods anddemigods are our allies and we are their property injustice andinsolence and folly are the destruction of us and justice andtemperance and wisdom are our salvation and the place of these latteris in the life of the gods although some vestige of them mayoccasionally be discerned among mankind but upon this earth we knowthat there dwell souls possessing an unjust spirit who may becompared to brute animals which fawn upon their keepers whether dogsor shepherds or the best and most perfect masters for they in likemanner as the voices of the wicked declare prevail by flattery andprayers and incantations and are allowed to make their gains withimpunity and this sin which is termed dishonesty is an evil ofthe same kind as what is termed disease in living bodies or pestilencein years or seasons of the year and in cities and governments hasanother name which is injustice 
 cle quite true 
 ath what else can he say who declares that the gods are alwayslenient to the doers of unjust acts if they divide the spoil withthem as if wolves were to toss a portion of their prey to the they mollified by the gift suffered them to tear the not he who maintains that the gods can be propitiated argue thus 
 cle precisely so 
 ath and to which of the classes of guardianswould any man compare the gods without absurdity will he say thatthey are like pilots who are themselves turned away from their dutyby libations of wine and the savour of fat and at last overturnboth ship and sailors 
 cle assuredly not 
 ath and surely they are not like charioteers who are bribed to giveup the victory to other chariots 
 cle that would be a fearful image of the gods 
 ath nor are they like generals or physicians or husbandmen orshepherds and no one would compare them to dogs who have silencedby wolves 
 cle a thing not to be spoken of 
 ath and are not all the gods the chiefest of all guardians anddo they not guard our highest interests 
 cle yes the chiefest 
 ath and shall we say that those who guard our noblest are the best of guardians are inferior in virtue to dogs andto men even of moderate excellence who would never betray justice forthe sake of gifts which unjust men impiously offer them 
 cle certainly not nor is such a notion to be endured and he whoholds this opinion may be fairly singled out and characterized as ofall impious men the wickedest and most impious 
 ath then are the three the gods exist and thatthey take care of men and that they can never be persuaded to doinjustice now sufficiently demonstrated may we say that they are 
 cle you have our entire assent to your words 
 ath i have spoken with vehemence because i am zealous againstevil men and i will tell dear cleinias why i am so i would not havethe wicked think that having the superiority in argument they may doas they please and act according to their various imaginations aboutthe gods and this zeal has led me to speak too vehemently but ifwe have at all succeeded in persuading the men to hate themselvesand love their opposites the prelude of our laws about impiety willnot have been spoken in vain 
 cle so let us hope and even if we have failed the style of ourargument will not discredit the lawgiver 
 ath after the prelude shall follow a discourse which will be theinterpreter of the law this shall proclaim to all they must depart from their ways and go over to thepious and to those who disobey let the law about impiety be a man is guilty of any impiety in word or deed any onewho happens to present shall give information to the magistrates inaid of the law and let the magistrates who first receive theinformation bring him before the appointed court according to the if a magistrate after receiving information refuses to act heshall be tried for impiety at the instance of any one who is willingto vindicate the laws and if any one be cast the court shallestimate the punishment of each act of impiety and let all suchcriminals be imprisoned there shall be three prisons in the first of them is to be the common prison in the neighbourhood ofthe agora for the of the generality of offenders anotheris to be in the neighbourhood of the nocturnal council and is to becalled the house of reformation another to be situated in somewild and desolate region in the centre of the country shall be calledby some name expressive of retribution now men fall into impietyfrom three causes which have been already mentioned and from each ofthese causes arise two sorts of impiety in all six which are worthdistinguishing and should not all have the same punishment for hewho does not believe in gods and yet has a righteous nature hatesthe wicked and dislikes and refuses to do injustice and avoidsunrighteous men and loves the righteous but they who besidesbelieving that the world is devoid of gods are intemperate and haveat the same time good memories and quick wits are worse althoughboth of them are unbelievers much less injury is done by the one thanby the other the one may talk loosely about the gods and aboutsacrifices and oaths and perhaps by laughing at other men he may makethem like himself if he be not punished but the other who holdsthe same opinions and is called a clever man is full of stratagem of this class deal in prophecy and jugglery of all out of their ranks sometimes come tyrants and demagogues andgenerals and hierophants of private mysteries and the sophists asthey are termed with their ingenious devices there are many kinds ofunbelievers but two only for whom legislation is required one thehypocritical sort whose crime is deserving of death many timesover while the other needs only bonds and admonition in likemanner also the notion that the gods take no thought of men producestwo other sorts of crimes and the notion that they may be propitiatedproduces two more assuming these divisions let those who have beenmade what they are only from want of understanding and not frommalice or an evil nature be placed by the judge in the house ofreformation and ordered to suffer imprisonment during a period of notless than five years and in the meantime let them have no intercoursewith the other citizens except with members of the nocturnal with them let them converse with a view to the improvement oftheir health and when the time of their imprisonment hasexpired if any of them be of sound mind let him be restored to sanecompany but if not and if he be condemned a second time let himbe punished with death as to that class of monstrous natures whonot only believe that there are no gods or that they are to be propitiated but in contempt of mankind conjure the soulsof the living and say that they can conjure the dead and promise tocharm the gods with sacrifices and prayers and will utterly overthrowindividuals and whole houses and states for the sake of who is guilty of any of these things be condemned by the courtto be bound according to law in the prison which is in the centre ofthe land and let no freeman ever approach him but let him receivethe rations of food appointed by the guardians of the law from thehands of the public slaves and when he is dead let him be cast beyondthe borders unburied and if any freeman assist in burying him lethim pay the penalty of impiety to any one who is willing to bring asuit against him but if he leaves behind him children who are fitto be citizens let the guardians of orphans take care of them justas they would of any other orphans from the day on which their fatheris convicted 
 in all these cases there should be one law which will make men ingeneral less liable to transgress in word or deed and less they will not be allowed to practise religious ritescontrary to law and let this be the simple form of the manshall have sacred rites in a private house when he would him go to the temples and hand over his offerings to the priestsand priestesses who see to the sanctity of such things and let himpray himself and let any one who pleases join with him in prayer thereason of this is as and temples are not easilyinstituted and to establish them rightly is the work of a mightyintellect and women especially and men too when they are sick or indanger or in any sort of difficulty or again on their receivingany good fortune have a way of consecrating the occasion vowingsacrifices and promising shrines to gods demigods and sons of when they are awakened by terrible apparitions and dreams orremember visions they find in altars and temples the remedies ofthem and will fill every house and village with them placing them inthe open air or wherever they may have had such visions and with aview to all these cases we should obey the law the law has alsoregard to the impious and would not have them fancy that by thesecret performance of these raising temples and by buildingaltars in private houses they can propitiate the god secretly withsacrifices and prayers while they are really multiplying their crimesinfinitely bringing guilt from heaven upon themselves and alsoupon those who permit them and who are better men than they the consequence is that the whole state reaps the fruit of theirimpiety which in a certain sense is deserved assuredly god willnot blame the legislator who will enact the following oneshall possess shrines of the gods in private houses and he who isfound to possess them and perform any sacred rites not the offender to be some man or woman who is notguilty of any other great and impious be informedagainst by him who is acquainted with the fact which shall beannounced by him to the guardians of the law and let them issueorders that he or she shall carry away their private rites to thepublic temples and if they do not persuade them let them inflict apenalty on them until they comply and if a person be proven guilty ofimpiety not merely from childish levity but such as men maybe guilty of whether he have sacrificed publicly or privately toany gods let him be punished with death for his sacrifice is the deed has been done in earnest or only from childishlevity let the guardians of the law determine before they bringthe matter into court and prosecute the offender for impiety

 and now having spoken of assaults let us sum up all acts ofviolence under a single law which shall be as one shalltake or carry away any of his goods neither shall heuse anything which is his without the consent of theowner for these are the offences which are and have been and willever be the source of all the aforesaid evils the greatest of themare excesses and insolences of youth and are offences against thegreatest when they are done against religion and especially greatwhen in violation of public and holy rites or of the in which tribes and phratries share and in the second degreegreat when they are committed against private rites and in the third degree not to repeat the acts formerly insults are offered to parents the fourth kind of violence iswhen any one regardless of the authority of the rulers takes orcarries away or makes use of anything which belongs to them nothaving their consent and the fifth kind is when the violation ofthe civil rights of an individual demands reparation there shouldbe a common law embracing all these cases for we have already said ingeneral terms what shall be the punishment of sacrilege whetherfraudulent or violent and now we have to determine what is to bethe punishment of those who speak or act insolently toward the first we must give them an admonition which may be in thefollowing one who in obedience to the laws believed thatthere were gods ever intentionally did any unholy act or uttered anyunlawful word but he who did must have supposed one of that they did not is the first secondly that if they did they took no care of man orthirdly that they were easily appeased and turned aside from theirpurpose by sacrifices and prayers 
 cleinias what shall we say or do to these persons 
 athenian stranger my good friend let us first hear the jests whichi suspect that they in their superiority will utter against us 
 cle what jests 
 ath they will make some irreverent speech of this of athens and sparta and cnosus they will reply inthat you speak truly for some of us deny the very existence of thegods while others as you say are of opinion that they do not careabout us and others that they are turned from their course bygifts now we have a right to claim as you yourself allowed in thematter of laws that before you are hard upon us and threaten should argue with us and convince should first attempt toteach and persuade us that there are gods by reasonable evidences andalso that they are too good to be unrighteous or to be turned from their course by gifts for when we hear such thingssaid of them by those who are esteemed to be the best of poets andorators and prophets and priests and by innumerable others thethoughts of most of us are not set upon abstaining from unrighteousacts but upon doing them and atoning for them when lawgivers professthat they are gentle and not stern we think that they should first ofall use persuasion to us and show us the existence of gods if not ina better manner than other men at any rate in a truer and whoknows but that we shall hearken to you if then our request is afair one please to accept our challenge 
 cle but is there any difficulty in proving the existence of thegods 
 ath how would you prove it 
 cle how in the first place the earth and the sun and the starsand the universe and the fair order of the seasons and thedivision of them into years and months furnish proofs of theirexistence and also there is the fact that all hellenes and barbariansbelieve in them 
 ath i fear my sweet friend though i will not say that i muchregard the contempt with which the profane will be likely to assailus for you do not understand the nature of their complaint and youfancy that they rush into impiety only from a love of sensualpleasure 
 cle why stranger what other reason is there 
 ath one which you who live in a different atmosphere would neverguess 
 cle what is it 
 ath a very grievous sort of ignorance which is imagined to be thegreatest wisdom 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath at athens there are tales preserved in writing which the virtueof your state as i am informed refuses to admit they speak of thegods in prose as well as verse and the oldest of them tell of theorigin of the heavens and of the world and not far from the beginningof their story they proceed to narrate the birth of the gods andhow after they were born they behaved to one another whether thesestories have in other ways a good or a bad influence i should notlike to be severe upon them because they are ancient but looking atthem with reference to the duties of children to their parents icannot praise them or think that they are useful or at all the words of the ancients i have nothing more to say and ishould wish to say of them only what is pleasing to the gods but asto our younger generation and their wisdom i cannot let them off whenthey do mischief for do but mark the effect of their words whenyou and i argue for the existence of the gods and produce the stars and earth claiming for them a divine being if wewould listen to the aforesaid philosophers we should say that they areearth and stones only which can have no care at all of human that all religion is a cooking up of words and a 
 cle one such teacher o stranger would be bad enough and youimply that there are many of them which is worse 
 ath well then what shall we say or we assume thatsome one is accusing us among unholy men who are trying to escapefrom the effect of our legislation and that they say of that you should legislate on the supposition that there aregods shall we make a defence of ourselves or shall we leave them andreturn to our laws lest the prelude should become longer than thelaw for the discourse will certainly extend to great length if weare to treat the impiously disposed as they desire partlydemonstrating to them at some length the things of which they demandan explanation partly making them afraid or dissatisfied and thenproceed to the requisite enactments 
 cle yes stranger but then how often have we repeated already thaton the present occasion there is no reason why brevity should bepreferred to length who is at our the saying goes and itwould be paltry and ridiculous to prefer the shorter to the better itis a matter of no small consequence in some way or other to provethat there are gods and that they are good and regard justice morethan men do the demonstration of this would be the best and noblestprelude of all our laws and therefore without impatience andwithout hurry let us unreservedly consider the whole up all the power of persuasion which we possess 
 ath seeing you thus in earnest i would fain offer up a prayer thati may i must proceed at once who can be calm when heis called upon to prove the existence of the gods who can avoidhating and abhorring the men who are and have been the cause of thisargument i speak of those who will not believe the tales which theyhave heard as babes and sucklings from their mothers and by them both in jest and earnest like charms who havealso heard them in the sacrificial prayers and seen sightsaccompanying and sounds delightful to theirparents during the sacrifices showing an intense earnestness on behalfof their children and of themselves and with eager interest talkingto the gods and beseeching them as though they were firmly convincedof their existence who likewise see and hear the prostrations andinvocations which are made by hellenes and barbarians at the risingand setting of the sun and moon in all the vicissitudes of as if they thought that there were no gods but as if therecould be no doubt of their existence and no suspicion of when men knowing all these things despise them onno real grounds as would be admitted by all who have any particleof intelligence and when they force us to say what we are now can any one in gentle terms remonstrate with the like of he has to begin by proving to them the very existence of thegods yet the attempt must be made for it would be unseemly thatone half of mankind should go mad in their lust of pleasure and theother half in their indignation at such persons our address tothese lost and perverted natures should not be spoken in us suppose ourselves to select some one of them and gently reasonwith him smothering our my son we will say to him youare young and the advance of time will make you reverse may of theopinions which you now hold wait awhile and do not attempt tojudge at present of the highest things and that is the highest ofwhich you now think know the gods rightly and to liveaccordingly and in the first place let me indicate to you one pointwhich is of great importance and about which i cannot and your friends are not the first who have held thisopinion about the gods there have always been persons more or lessnumerous who have had the same disorder i have known many of can tell you that no one who had taken up in youth thisopinion that the gods do not exist ever continued in the sameuntil he was old the two other notions certainly do continue insome cases but not in many the notion i mean that the godsexist but take no heed of human things and the other notion thatthey do take heed of them but are easily propitiated withsacrifices and prayers as to the opinion about the gods which maysome day become clear to you i advise you go wait and consider ifit be true or not ask of others and above all of the the meantime take care that you do not offend against the gods forthe duty of the legislator is and always will be to teach you thetruth of these matters 
 cle our address stranger thus far is excellent 
 ath quite true megillus and cleinias but i am afraid that we haveunconsciously lighted on a strange doctrine 
 cle what doctrine do you mean 
 ath the wisest of all doctrines in the opinion of many 
 cle i wish that you would speak plainer 
 ath the doctrine that all things do become have become and willbecome some by nature some by art and some by chance 
 cle is not that true 
 ath well philosophers are probably right at any rate we may aswell follow in their track and examine what is the meaning of themand their disciples 
 cle by all means 
 ath they say that the greatest and fairest things are the work ofnature and of chance the lesser of art which receiving fromnature the greater and primeval creations moulds and fashions allthose lesser works which are generally termed artificial 
 cle how is that 
 ath i will explain my meaning still more clearly they say thatfire and water and earth and air all exist by nature and chance andnone of them by art and that as to the bodies which come next and sun and moon and have been created bymeans of these absolutely inanimate existences the elements areseverally moved by chance and some inherent force according to certainaffinities among hot with cold or of dry with moist or ofsoft with hard and according to all the other accidental admixturesof opposites which have been formed by necessity after this fashionand in this manner the whole heaven has been created and all thatis in the heaven as well as animals and all plants and all theseasons come from these elements not by the action of mind as theysay or of any god or from art but as i was saying by nature andchance only art sprang up afterwards and out of these mortal andof mortal birth and produced in play certain images and verypartial imitations of the truth having an affinity to one as music and painting create and their companion arts andthere are other arts which have a serious purpose and with nature such for example as medicine and gymnastic and they say that politics cooperate with nature butin a less degree and have more of art also that legislation isentirely a work of art and is based on assumptions which are nottrue 
 cle how do you mean 
 ath in the first place my dear friend these people would say thatthe gods exist not by nature but by art and by the laws of are different in different places according to the agreement ofthose who make them and that the honourable is one thing by natureand another thing by law and that the principles of justice have noexistence at all in nature but that mankind are always disputingabout them and altering them and that the alterations which aremade by art and by law have no basis in nature but are of authorityfor the moment and at the time at which they are myfriends are the sayings of wise men poets and prose writers whichfind a way into the minds of youth they are told by them that thehighest right is might and in this way the young fall into the idea that the gods are not such as the law bids themimagine and hence arise factions these philosophers inviting them tolead a true life according to nature that is to live in realdominion over others and not in legal subjection to them 
 cle what a dreadful picture stranger have you given and howgreat is the injury which is thus inflicted on young men to the ruinboth of states and families 
 ath true cleinias but then what should the lawgiver do whenthis evil is of long standing should he only rise up in the state andthreaten all mankind proclaiming that if they will not say andthink that the gods are such as the law ordains and this may beextended generally to the honourable the just and to all the highestthings and to all that relates to virtue and vice and if theywill not make their actions conform to the copy which the law givesthem then he who refuses to obey the law shall die or suffer stripesand bonds or privation of citizenship or in some cases be punishedby loss of property and exile should he not rather when he is makinglaws for men at the same time infuse the spirit of persuasion intohis words and mitigate the severity of them as far as he can 
 cle why stranger if such persuasion be at all possible then alegislator who has anything in him ought never to weary ofpersuading men he ought to leave nothing unsaid in support of theancient opinion that there are gods and of all those other truthswhich you were just now mentioning he ought to support the law andalso art and acknowledge that both alike exist by nature and no lessthan nature if they are the creations of mind in accordance withright reason you appear to me to maintain and i am disposed to agreewith you in thinking 
 ath yes my enthusiastic cleinias but are not these things whenspoken to a multitude hard to be understood not to mention thatthey take up a dismal length of time 
 cle why stranger shall we whose patience failed not whendrinking or music were the themes of discourse weary now ofdiscoursing about the gods and about divine things and thegreatest help to rational legislation is that the laws when oncewritten down are always at rest they can be put to the test at anyfuture time and therefore if on first hearing they seem is no reason for apprehension about them because any manhowever dull can go over them and consider them again and again norif they are tedious but useful is there any reason or religion as itseems to me in any man refusing to maintain the principles of them tothe utmost of his power 
 megillus stranger i like what cleinias is saying 
 ath yes megillus and we should do as he proposes for ifimpious discourses were not scattered as i may say throughout theworld there would have been no need for any vindication of theexistence of the seeing that they are spread far and arguments are needed and who should come to the rescue of thegreatest laws when they are being undermined by bad men but thelegislator himself 
 meg there is no more proper champion of them 
 ath well then tell me i must ask you to be not he who talks in this way conceive fire and waterand earth and air to be the first elements of all things these hecalls nature and out of these he supposes the soul to be formedafterwards and this is not a mere conjecture of ours about hismeaning but is what he really means 
 cle very true 
 ath then by heaven we have discovered the source of this vainopinion of all those physical investigators and i would have youexamine their arguments with the utmost care for their impiety is avery serious matter they not only make a bad and mistaken use ofargument but they lead away the minds of others that is my opinionof them 
 cle you are right but i should like to know how this happens 
 ath i fear that the argument may seem singular 
 cle do not hesitate stranger i see that you are afraid of sucha discussion carrying you beyond the limits of legislation but ifthere be no other way of showing our agreement in the belief thatthere are gods of whom the law is said now to approve let us takethis way my good sir 
 ath then i suppose that i must repeat the singular argument ofthose who manufacture the soul according to their own impious affirm that which is the first cause of the generation anddestruction of all things to be not first but last and that whichis last to be first and hence they have fallen into error about thetrue nature of the gods 
 cle still i do not understand you 
 ath nearly all of them my friends seem to be ignorant of thenature and power of the soul especially in what relates to herorigin they do not know that she is among the first of things andbefore all bodies and is the chief author of their changes andtranspositions and if this is true and if the soul is older than thebody must not the things which are of the kindred be ofnecessity prior to those which appertain to the body 
 cle certainly 
 ath then thought and attention and mind and art and law will beprior to that which is hard and soft and heavy and light and thegreat and primitive works and actions will be works of art theywill be the first and after them will come nature and works ofnature which however is a wrong term for men to apply to will follow and will be under the government of art and mind 
 cle but why is the word nature wrong 
 ath because those who use the term mean to say that nature is thefirst creative power but if the soul turn out to be the primevalelement and not fire or air then in the truest sense and beyondother things the soul may be said to exist by nature and this wouldbe true if you proved that the soul is older than the body but nototherwise 
 cle you are quite right 
 ath shall we then take this as the next point to which ourattention should be directed 
 cle by all means 
 ath let us be on our guard lest this most deceptive argument withits youthful looks beguiling us old men give us the slip and makea of us who knows but we may be aiming at the fail of attaining the lesser suppose that we three have to pass arapid river and i being the youngest of the three and experienced inrivers take upon me the duty of making the attempt first by you in safety on the bank i am to examine whether the riveris passable by older men like yourselves and if such appears to bethe case then i shall invite you to follow and my experience willhelp to convey you across but if the river is impassable by you thenthere will have been no danger to anybody but not thatseem to be a very fair proposal i mean to say that the argument inprospect is likely to be too much for you out of your depth andbeyond your strength and i should be afraid that the stream of myquestions might create in you who are not in the habit of and confusion of mind and hence a feeling of unpleasantnessand unsuitableness might arise i think therefore that i had betterfirst ask the questions and then answer them myself while you listenin safety in that way i can carry on the argument until i havecompleted the proof that the soul is prior to the body 
 cle excellent stranger and i hope that you will do as youpropose 
 ath come then and if ever we are to call upon the gods let uscall upon them now in all seriousness to come to the demonstrationof their own existence and so holding fast to the rope we willventure upon the depths of the argument when questions of this sortare asked of me my safest answer would appear to be one says to me o stranger are all things at restand nothing in motion or is the exact opposite of this true or aresome things in motion and others at this i shall reply thatsome things are in motion and others at rest and do not things whichmove a place and are not the things which are at rest at rest in aplace certainly and some move or rest in one place and some inmore places than one you mean to say we shall rejoin that thosethings which rest at the centre move in one place just as thecircumference goes round of globes which are said to be at and we observe that in the revolution the motion whichcarries round the larger and the lesser circle at the same time isproportionally distributed to greater and smaller and is greaterand smaller in a certain proportion here is a wonder which might bethought an impossibility that the same motion should impart swiftnessand slowness in due proportion to larger and lesser circles verytrue and when you speak of bodies moving in many places you seem tome to mean those which move from one place to another and sometimeshave one centre of motion and sometimes more than one because theyturn upon their axis and whenever they meet anything if it bestationary they are divided by it but if they get in the midstbetween bodies which are approaching and moving towards the samespot from opposite directions they unite with them i admit thetruth of what you are saying also when they unite they grow andwhen they are divided they waste is supposing theconstitution of each to remain or if that fails then there is asecond reason of their dissolution and when are all things createdand how clearly they are created when the first principlereceives increase and attains to the second dimension and from thisarrives at the one which is neighbour to this and after reachingthe third becomes perceptible to sense everything which is thuschanging and moving is in process of generation only when at rest hasit real existence but when passing into another state it is destroyedutterly have we not mentioned all motions that there are andcomprehended them under their kinds and numbered them with theexception my friends of two 
 cle which are they 
 ath just the two with which our present enquiry is concerned 
 cle speak plainer 
 ath i suppose that our enquiry has reference to the soul 
 cle very true 
 ath let us assume that there is a motion able to move other not to move is one kind and there is another kindwhich can move itself as well as other things working incomposition and decomposition by increase and diminution andgeneration and is also one of the many kinds ofmotion 
 cle granted 
 ath and we will assume that which moves other and is changed byother to be the ninth and that which changes itself and is with every action and every passion and is thetrue principle of change and motion in all that we shall beinclined to call the tenth 
 cle certainly 
 ath and which of these ten motions ought we to prefer as beingthe mightiest and most efficient 
 cle i must say that the motion which is able to move itself isten thousand times superior to all the others 
 ath very good but may i make one or two corrections in what i havebeen saying 
 cle what are they 
 ath when i spoke of the tenth sort of motion that was not quitecorrect 
 cle what was the error 
 ath according to the true order the tenth was really the firstin generation and power then follows the second which wasstrangely enough termed the ninth by us 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath i mean this when one thing changes another and thatanother of such will there be any primary changing element how can athing which is moved by another ever be the beginning of but when the changes other and that againother and thus thousands upon tens of thousands of bodies are setin motion must not the beginning of all this motion be the changeof the principle 
 cle very true and i quite agree 
 ath or to put the question in another way making answer as most of these philosophers have the audacity toaffirm all things were at rest in one mass which of principles of motion would first spring up among them 
 cle clearly the for there could be no change in themarising out of any external cause the change must first take place inthemselves 
 ath then we must say that being the origin of allmotions and the first which arises among things at rest as well asamong things in motion is the eldest and mightiest principle ofchange and that which is changed by another and yet moves other issecond 
 cle quite true 
 ath at this stage of the argument let us put a question 
 cle what question 
 ath if we were to see this power existing in any earthy watery orfiery substance simple or should we describe it 
 cle you mean to ask whether we should call such a powerlife 
 ath i do 
 cle certainly we should 
 ath and when we see soul in anything must we not do we not admit that this is life 
 cle we must 
 ath and now i beseech you would admit that we have athreefold knowledge of things 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath i mean that we know the essence and that we know thedefinition of the essence and the are the three andthere are two questions which may be raised about anything 
 cle how two 
 ath sometimes a person may give the name and ask the definition orhe may give the definition and ask the name i may illustrate what imean in this way 
 cle how 
 ath number like some other things is capable of being dividedinto equal parts when thus divided number is named even and thedefinition of the name even is number divisible into two equalparts 
 cle true 
 ath i mean that when we are asked about the definition and givethe name or when we are asked about the name and give either case whether we give name or definition wespeak of the same thing calling even the number which is dividedinto two equal parts 
 cle quite true 
 ath and what is the definition of that which is named soul canwe conceive of any other than that which has been already which can move itself 
 cle you mean to say that the essence which is defined as is the same with that which has the name soul 
 ath yes and if this is true do we still maintain that there isanything wanting in the proof that the soul is the first origin andmoving power of all that is or has become or will be and theircontraries when she has been clearly shown to be the source of changeand motion in all things 
 cle certainly not the soul as being the source of motion has beenmost satisfactorily shown to be the oldest of all things 
 ath and is not that motion which is produced in another byreason of another but never has any power at all beingin truth the change of an inanimate body to be reckoned second or byany lower number which you may prefer 
 cle exactly 
 ath then we are right and speak the most perfect and absolutetruth when we say that the soul is prior to the body and that thebody is second and comes afterwards and is born to obey the is the ruler 
 cle nothing can be more true 
 ath do you remember our old admission that if the soul was priorto the body the things of the soul were also prior to those of thebody 
 cle certainly 
 ath then characters and manners and wishes and reasonings andtrue opinions and reflections and recollections are prior tolength and breadth and depth and strength of bodies if the soul isprior to the body 
 cle to be sure 
 ath in the next place must we not of necessity admit that the soulis the cause of good and evil base and honourable just and of all other opposites if we suppose her to be the cause of allthings 
 cle we must 
 ath and as the soul orders and inhabits all things that moving must we not say that she orders also the heavens 
 cle of course 
 ath one soul or more more than will answer for you at anyrate we must not suppose that there are less than theauthor of good and the other of evil 
 cle very true 
 ath yes very true the soul then directs all things in heaven andearth and sea by her movements and these are described by consideration attention deliberation opinion true andfalse joy and sorrow confidence fear hatred love and otherprimary motions akin to these which again receive the secondarymotions of corporeal substances and guide all things to growth anddecay to composition and decomposition and to the qualities whichaccompany them such as heat and cold heaviness and and softness blackness and whiteness bitterness andsweetness and all those other qualities which the soul a goddess when truly receiving the divine mind shedisciplines all things rightly to their happiness but when she is thecompanion of folly she does the very contrary of all this shall weassume so much or do we still entertain doubts 
 cle there is no room at all for doubt 
 ath shall we say then that it is the soul which controls heaven andearth and the whole it is a principle of wisdom andvirtue or a principle which has neither wisdom nor virtue supposethat we make answer as follows 
 cle how would you answer 
 ath if my friend we say that the whole path and movement ofheaven and of all that is therein is by nature akin to themovement and revolution and calculation of mind and proceeds bykindred laws then as is plain we must say that the best soultakes care of the world and guides it along the good path 
 cle true 
 ath but if the world moves wildly and irregularly then the evilsoul guides it 
 cle true again 
 ath of what nature is the movement of this question itis not easy to give an intelligent answer and therefore i ought toassist you in framing one 
 cle very good 
 ath then let us not answer as if we would look straight at the ourselves darkness at mean as if we were under theimpression that we could see with mortal eyes or know adequatelythe nature of will be safer to look at the image only 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath let us select of the ten motions the one which mind chieflyresembles this i will bring to your recollection and will thenmake the answer on behalf of us all 
 cle that will be excellent 
 ath you will surely remember our saying that all things were eitherat rest or in motion 
 cle i do 
 ath and that of things in motion some were moving in one place andothers in more than one 
 cle yes 
 ath of these two kinds of motion that which moves in one placemust move about a centre like globes made in a lathe and is mostentirely akin and similar to the circular movement of mind 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath in saying that both mind and the motion which is in one placemove in the same and like manner in and about the same and inrelation to the same and according to one proportion and order andare like the motion of a globe we invented a fair image which doesno discredit to our ingenuity 
 cle it does us great credit 
 ath and the motion of the other sort which is not after the samemanner nor in the same nor about the same nor in relation to thesame nor in one place nor in order nor according to any rule orproportion may be said to be akin to senselessness and folly 
 cle that is most true 
 ath then after what has been said there is no difficulty indistinctly stating that since soul carries all things round eitherthe best soul or the contrary must of necessity carry round andorder and arrange the revolution of the heaven 
 cle and judging from what has been said stranger there would beimpiety in asserting that any but the most perfect soul or soulscarries round the heavens 
 ath you have understood my meaning right well cleinias and nowlet me ask you another question 
 cle what are you going to ask 
 ath if the soul carries round the sun and moon and the otherstars does she not carry round each individual of them 
 cle certainly 
 ath then of one of them let us speak and the same argument willapply to all 
 cle which will you take 
 ath every one sees the body of the sun but no one sees his the soul of any other body living or dead and yet there isgreat reason to believe that this nature unperceived by any of oursenses is circumfused around them all but is perceived by therefore by mind and reflection only let us apprehend thefollowing point 
 cle what is that 
 ath if the soul carries round the sun we shall not be far wrong insupposing one of three alternatives 
 cle what are they 
 ath either the soul which moves the sun this way and within the circular and visible body like the soul whichcarries us about every way or the soul provides herself with anexternal body of fire or air as some affirm and violently propelsbody by body or thirdly she is without such abody but guides thesun by some extraordinary and wonderful power 
 cle yes certainly the soul can only order all things in one ofthese three ways 
 ath and this soul of the sun which is therefore better than thesun whether taking the sun about in a chariot to give light to acting from without or in whatever way ought by every man to bedeemed a god 
 cle yes by every man who has the least particle of sense 
 ath and of the stars too and of the moon and of the years andmonths and seasons must we not say in like manner that since asoul or souls having every sort of excellence are the causes of all ofthem those souls are gods whether they are living beings andreside in bodies and in this way order the whole heaven orwhatever be the place and mode of their will any onewho admits all this venture to deny that all things full of gods 
 cle no one stranger would be such a madman 
 ath and now megillus and cleinias let us offer terms to him whohas hitherto denied the existence of the gods and leave him 
 cle what terms 
 ath either he shall teach us that we were wrong in saying thatthe soul is the original of all things and arguing accordingly he be not able to say anything better then he must yield to us andlive for the remainder of his life in the belief that there us see then whether we have said enough or not enough tothose who deny that there are gods 
 cle enough stranger 
 ath then to them we will say no more and now we are to address himwho believing that there are gods believes also that they take noheed of human affairs to him we thou best of men inbelieving that there are gods you are led by some affinity to attracts you towards your kindred and makes you honour andbelieve in them but the fortunes of evil and unrighteous men inprivate as well as public life which though not really happy arewrongly counted happy in the judgment of men and are celebratedboth by poets and prose draw you aside from your naturalpiety perhaps you have seen impious men growing old and leaving children in high offices and their prosperity shakesyour have known or heard or been yourself an eyewitness ofmany monstrous impieties and have beheld men by such criminalmeans from small beginnings attaining to sovereignty and thepinnacle of greatness and considering all these things you do notlike to accuse the gods of them because they are your so from some want of reasoning power and also from anunwillingness to find fault with them you have come to believe thatthey exist indeed but have no thought or care of human things your present evil opinion may not grow to still greaterimpiety and that we may if possible use arguments which may conjureaway the evil before it arrives we will add another argument tothat originally addressed to him who utterly denied the existence ofthe gods and do you megillus and cleinias answer for the youngman as you did before and if any impediment comes in our way iwill take the word out of your mouths and carry you over the river asi did just now 
 cle very good do as you say and we will help you as well as wecan 
 ath there will probably be no difficulty in proving to him that thegods care about the small as well as about the great for he waspresent and heard what was said that they are perfectly good andthat the care of all things is most entirely natural to them 
 cle no doubt he heard that 
 ath let us consider together in the next place what we mean by thisvirtue which we ascribe to them surely we should say that to betemperate and to possess mind belongs to virtue and the contrary tovice 
 cle certainly 
 ath yes and courage is a part of virtue and cowardice of vice 
 cle true 
 ath and the one is honourable and the other dishonourable 
 cle to be sure 
 ath and the one like other meaner things is a human the gods have no part in anything of the sort 
 cle that again is what everybody will admit 
 ath but do we imagine carelessness and idleness and luxury to bevirtues what do you think 
 cle decidedly not 
 ath they rank under the opposite class 
 cle yes 
 ath and their opposites therefore would fall under the oppositeclass 
 cle yes 
 ath but are we to suppose that one who possesses all these goodqualities will be luxurious and heedless and idle like those whom thepoet compares to stingless drones 
 cle and the comparison is a most just one 
 ath surely god must not be supposed to have a nature which hehimself who dares to say this sort of thing must not betolerated for a moment 
 cle of course not how could he have 
 ath should we not on any principle be entirely mistaken in praisingany one who has some special business entrusted to him if he have amind which takes care of great matters and no care of small he who acts in this way whether he be god or man must actfrom one of two principles 
 cle what are they 
 ath either he must think that the neglect of the small matters isof no consequence to the whole or if he knows that they are ofconsequence and he neglects them his neglect must be attributed tocarelessness and indolence is there any other way in which hisneglect can be explained for surely when it is impossible for him totake care of all he is not negligent if he fails to attend to thesethings great or small which a god or some inferior being might bewanting in strength or capacity to manage 
 cle certainly not 
 ath now then let us examine the offenders who both alike confessthat there are gods but with a one saying that theymay be appeased and the other that they have no care of smallmatters there are three of us and two of them and we will say the first place you both acknowledge that the gods hear andsee and know all things and that nothing can escape them which ismatter of sense and you admit this 
 cle yes 
 ath and do you admit also that they have all power which mortalsand immortals can have 
 cle they will of course admit this also 
 ath and surely we three and they in that they are good and perfect 
 cle assuredly 
 ath but if they are such as we conceive them to be can wepossibly suppose that they ever act in the spirit of carelessnessand indolence for in us inactivity is the child of cowardice andcarelessness of inactivity and indolence 
 cle most true 
 ath then not from inactivity and carelessness is any god evernegligent for there is no cowardice in them 
 cle that is very true 
 ath then the alternative which remains is that if the gods neglectthe lighter and lesser concerns of the universe they neglect thembecause they know that they ought not to care about other alternative is there but the opposite of theirknowing 
 cle there is none 
 ath and o most excellent and best of men do i understand you tomean that they are careless because they are ignorant and do not knowthat they ought to take care or that they know and yet like themeanest sort of men knowing the better choose the worse because theyare overcome by pleasures and pains 
 cle impossible 
 ath do not all human things partake of the nature of soul and isnot man the most religious of all animals 
 cle that is not to be denied 
 ath and we acknowledge that all mortal creatures are the propertyof the gods to whom also the whole of heaven belongs 
 cle certainly 
 ath and therefore whether a person says that these things areto the gods great or either case it would not be naturalfor the gods who own us and who are the most careful and the bestof owners to neglect is also a further consideration 
 cle what is it 
 ath sensation and power are in an inverse ratio to each other inrespect to their case and difficulty 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath i mean that there is greater difficulty in seeing and hearingthe small than the great but more facility in moving andcontrolling and taking care of and unimportant things than of theiropposites 
 cle far more 
 ath suppose the case of a physician who is willing and able to curesome living thing as a will the whole fare at his hands ifhe takes care only of the greater and neglects the parts which arelesser 
 cle decidedly not well 
 ath no better would be the result with pilots or generals orhouseholders or statesmen or any other such class if theyneglected the small and regarded only the the builderssay the larger stones do not lie well without the lesser 
 cle of course not 
 ath let us not then deem god inferior to human workmen who inproportion to their skill finish and perfect their works small aswell as great by one and the same art or that god the wisest ofbeings who is both willing and able to take care is like a or a coward who turns his back upon labour andgives no thought to smaller and easier matters but to the greateronly 
 cle never stranger let us admit a supposition about the godswhich is both impious and false 
 ath i think that we have now argued enough with him who delights toaccuse the gods of neglect 
 cle yes 
 ath he has been forced to acknowledge that he is in error but hestill seems to me to need some words of consolation 
 cle what consolation will you offer him 
 ath let us say to the ruler of the universe hasordered all things with a view to the excellence and preservation ofthe whole and each part as far as may be has an action andpassion appropriate to it over these down to the least fraction ofthem ministers have been appointed to preside who have wrought outtheir perfection with infinitesimal exactness and one of theseportions of the universe is thine own unhappy man which howeverlittle contributes to the whole and you do not seem to be aware thatthis and every other creation is for the sake of the whole and inorder that the life of the whole may be blessed and that you arecreated for the sake of the whole and not the whole for the sake ofyou for every physician and every skilled artist does all thingsfor the sake of the whole directing his effort towards the commongood executing the part for the sake of the whole and not thewhole for the sake of the part and you are annoyed because you areignorant how what is best for you happens to you and to theuniverse as far as the laws of the common creation admit now as thesoul combining first with one body and then with another undergoes allsorts of changes either of herself or through the influence ofanother soul all that remains to the player of the game is that heshould shift the pieces sending the better nature to the betterplace and the worse to the worse and so assigning to them theirproper portion 
 cle in what way do you mean 
 ath in a way which may be supposed to make the care of all thingseasy to the gods if any one were to form or fashion all thingswithout any regard to the for example he formed a livingelement of water out of fire instead of forming many things out ofone or one out of many in regular order attaining to a first or secondor third birth the transmutation would have been infinite but nowthe ruler of the world has a wonderfully easy task 
 cle how so 
 ath i will the king saw that our actions had that there was much virtue in them and much vice and that thesoul and body although not like the gods of popular yet having once come into existence were indestructible forif either of them had been destroyed there would have been nogeneration of living beings and when he observed that the good ofthe soul was ever by nature designed to profit men and the evil toharm seeing all this contrived so to place each of the partsthat their position might in the easiest and best manner procure thevictory of good and the defeat of evil in the whole and hecontrived a general plan by which a thing of a certain nature founda certain seat and room but the formation of qualities he left to thewills of individuals for every one of us is made pretty much whathe is by the bent of his desires and the nature of his soul 
 cle yes that is probably true 
 ath then all things which have a soul change and possess inthemselves a principle of change and in changing move according tolaw and to the order of destiny natures which have undergone a lesserchange move less and on the surface but those which havesuffered more change and have become more criminal sink into theabyss that is to say into hades and other places in the world which the very names terrify men and which they picture tothemselves as in a dream both while alive and when released fromthe body and whenever the soul receives more of good or evil from herown energy and the strong influence of she has communionwith divine virtue and becomes divine she is carried into another andbetter place which is perfect in holiness but when she has communionwith evil then she also changes the place of her life 
 this is the justice of the gods who inhabit youth or young man who fancy that you are neglected by the that if you become worse you shall go to the worse souls or ifbetter to the better and in every succession of life and death youwill do and suffer what like may fitly suffer at the hands of is the justice of heaven which neither you nor any otherunfortunate will ever glory in escaping and which the ordainingpowers have specially ordained take good heed thereof for it will besure to take heed of you if you am small and will creep intothe depths of the earth or i am high and will fly up to heaven youare not so small or so high but that you shall pay the fittingpenalty either here or in the world below or in some still moresavage place whither you shall be conveyed this is also theexplanation of the fate of those whom you saw who had done unholy andevil deeds and from small beginnings had grown great and you fanciedthat from being miserable they had become happy and in their in a mirror you seemed to see the universal neglect of the knowing how they make all things work together and contribute tothe great whole and thinkest thou bold man that thou needest not toknow who knows it not can never form any true idea of thehappiness or unhappiness of life or hold any rational discourserespecting either if cleinias and this our reverend company succeedin bringing to you that you know not what you say of the gods thenwill god help you but should you desire to hear more listen towhat we say to the third opponent if you have any understandingwhatsoever for i think that we have sufficiently proved the existenceof the gods and that they care for other notion that theyare appeased by the wicked and take gifts is what we must notconcede to any one and what every man should disprove to the utmostof his power 
 cle very good let us do as you say 
 ath well then by the gods themselves i conjure you to they are to be propitiated how are they to be are they and what is their nature must they not be at leastrulers who have to order unceasingly the whole heaven 
 cle true 
 ath and to what earthly rulers can they be compared or who tothem how in the less can we find an image of the greater are theycharioteers of contending pairs of steeds or pilots of they might be compared to the generals of armies or theymight be likened to physicians providing against the diseases whichmake war upon the body or to husbandmen observing anxiously theeffects of the seasons on the growth of plants or i perhaps toshepherds of flocks for as we acknowledge the world to be full ofmany goods and also of evils and of more evils than goods thereis as we affirm an immortal conflict going on among us whichrequires marvellous watchfulness and in that conflict the gods anddemigods are our allies and we are their property injustice andinsolence and folly are the destruction of us and justice andtemperance and wisdom are our salvation and the place of these latteris in the life of the gods although some vestige of them mayoccasionally be discerned among mankind but upon this earth we knowthat there dwell souls possessing an unjust spirit who may becompared to brute animals which fawn upon their keepers whether dogsor shepherds or the best and most perfect masters for they in likemanner as the voices of the wicked declare prevail by flattery andprayers and incantations and are allowed to make their gains withimpunity and this sin which is termed dishonesty is an evil ofthe same kind as what is termed disease in living bodies or pestilencein years or seasons of the year and in cities and governments hasanother name which is injustice 
 cle quite true 
 ath what else can he say who declares that the gods are alwayslenient to the doers of unjust acts if they divide the spoil withthem as if wolves were to toss a portion of their prey to the they mollified by the gift suffered them to tear the not he who maintains that the gods can be propitiated argue thus 
 cle precisely so 
 ath and to which of the classes of guardianswould any man compare the gods without absurdity will he say thatthey are like pilots who are themselves turned away from their dutyby libations of wine and the savour of fat and at last overturnboth ship and sailors 
 cle assuredly not 
 ath and surely they are not like charioteers who are bribed to giveup the victory to other chariots 
 cle that would be a fearful image of the gods 
 ath nor are they like generals or physicians or husbandmen orshepherds and no one would compare them to dogs who have silencedby wolves 
 cle a thing not to be spoken of 
 ath and are not all the gods the chiefest of all guardians anddo they not guard our highest interests 
 cle yes the chiefest 
 ath and shall we say that those who guard our noblest are the best of guardians are inferior in virtue to dogs andto men even of moderate excellence who would never betray justice forthe sake of gifts which unjust men impiously offer them 
 cle certainly not nor is such a notion to be endured and he whoholds this opinion may be fairly singled out and characterized as ofall impious men the wickedest and most impious 
 ath then are the three the gods exist and thatthey take care of men and that they can never be persuaded to doinjustice now sufficiently demonstrated may we say that they are 
 cle you have our entire assent to your words 
 ath i have spoken with vehemence because i am zealous againstevil men and i will tell dear cleinias why i am so i would not havethe wicked think that having the superiority in argument they may doas they please and act according to their various imaginations aboutthe gods and this zeal has led me to speak too vehemently but ifwe have at all succeeded in persuading the men to hate themselvesand love their opposites the prelude of our laws about impiety willnot have been spoken in vain 
 cle so let us hope and even if we have failed the style of ourargument will not discredit the lawgiver 
 ath after the prelude shall follow a discourse which will be theinterpreter of the law this shall proclaim to all they must depart from their ways and go over to thepious and to those who disobey let the law about impiety be a man is guilty of any impiety in word or deed any onewho happens to present shall give information to the magistrates inaid of the law and let the magistrates who first receive theinformation bring him before the appointed court according to the if a magistrate after receiving information refuses to act heshall be tried for impiety at the instance of any one who is willingto vindicate the laws and if any one be cast the court shallestimate the punishment of each act of impiety and let all suchcriminals be imprisoned there shall be three prisons in the first of them is to be the common prison in the neighbourhood ofthe agora for the of the generality of offenders anotheris to be in the neighbourhood of the nocturnal council and is to becalled the house of reformation another to be situated in somewild and desolate region in the centre of the country shall be calledby some name expressive of retribution now men fall into impietyfrom three causes which have been already mentioned and from each ofthese causes arise two sorts of impiety in all six which are worthdistinguishing and should not all have the same punishment for hewho does not believe in gods and yet has a righteous nature hatesthe wicked and dislikes and refuses to do injustice and avoidsunrighteous men and loves the righteous but they who besidesbelieving that the world is devoid of gods are intemperate and haveat the same time good memories and quick wits are worse althoughboth of them are unbelievers much less injury is done by the one thanby the other the one may talk loosely about the gods and aboutsacrifices and oaths and perhaps by laughing at other men he may makethem like himself if he be not punished but the other who holdsthe same opinions and is called a clever man is full of stratagem of this class deal in prophecy and jugglery of all out of their ranks sometimes come tyrants and demagogues andgenerals and hierophants of private mysteries and the sophists asthey are termed with their ingenious devices there are many kinds ofunbelievers but two only for whom legislation is required one thehypocritical sort whose crime is deserving of death many timesover while the other needs only bonds and admonition in likemanner also the notion that the gods take no thought of men producestwo other sorts of crimes and the notion that they may be propitiatedproduces two more assuming these divisions let those who have beenmade what they are only from want of understanding and not frommalice or an evil nature be placed by the judge in the house ofreformation and ordered to suffer imprisonment during a period of notless than five years and in the meantime let them have no intercoursewith the other citizens except with members of the nocturnal with them let them converse with a view to the improvement oftheir health and when the time of their imprisonment hasexpired if any of them be of sound mind let him be restored to sanecompany but if not and if he be condemned a second time let himbe punished with death as to that class of monstrous natures whonot only believe that there are no gods or that they are to be propitiated but in contempt of mankind conjure the soulsof the living and say that they can conjure the dead and promise tocharm the gods with sacrifices and prayers and will utterly overthrowindividuals and whole houses and states for the sake of who is guilty of any of these things be condemned by the courtto be bound according to law in the prison which is in the centre ofthe land and let no freeman ever approach him but let him receivethe rations of food appointed by the guardians of the law from thehands of the public slaves and when he is dead let him be cast beyondthe borders unburied and if any freeman assist in burying him lethim pay the penalty of impiety to any one who is willing to bring asuit against him but if he leaves behind him children who are fitto be citizens let the guardians of orphans take care of them justas they would of any other orphans from the day on which their fatheris convicted 
 in all these cases there should be one law which will make men ingeneral less liable to transgress in word or deed and less they will not be allowed to practise religious ritescontrary to law and let this be the simple form of the manshall have sacred rites in a private house when he would him go to the temples and hand over his offerings to the priestsand priestesses who see to the sanctity of such things and let himpray himself and let any one who pleases join with him in prayer thereason of this is as and temples are not easilyinstituted and to establish them rightly is the work of a mightyintellect and women especially and men too when they are sick or indanger or in any sort of difficulty or again on their receivingany good fortune have a way of consecrating the occasion vowingsacrifices and promising shrines to gods demigods and sons of when they are awakened by terrible apparitions and dreams orremember visions they find in altars and temples the remedies ofthem and will fill every house and village with them placing them inthe open air or wherever they may have had such visions and with aview to all these cases we should obey the law the law has alsoregard to the impious and would not have them fancy that by thesecret performance of these raising temples and by buildingaltars in private houses they can propitiate the god secretly withsacrifices and prayers while they are really multiplying their crimesinfinitely bringing guilt from heaven upon themselves and alsoupon those who permit them and who are better men than they the consequence is that the whole state reaps the fruit of theirimpiety which in a certain sense is deserved assuredly god willnot blame the legislator who will enact the following oneshall possess shrines of the gods in private houses and he who isfound to possess them and perform any sacred rites not the offender to be some man or woman who is notguilty of any other great and impious be informedagainst by him who is acquainted with the fact which shall beannounced by him to the guardians of the law and let them issueorders that he or she shall carry away their private rites to thepublic temples and if they do not persuade them let them inflict apenalty on them until they comply and if a person be proven guilty ofimpiety not merely from childish levity but such as men maybe guilty of whether he have sacrificed publicly or privately toany gods let him be punished with death for his sacrifice is the deed has been done in earnest or only from childishlevity let the guardians of the law determine before they bringthe matter into court and prosecute the offender for impiety
