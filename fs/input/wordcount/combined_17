 harry sat there aware that every head in the great hall had turned to look at him he was stunned he felt numb he was surely dreaming he had not heard correctly 
 
 there was no applause a buzzing as though of angry bees was starting to fill the hall some students were standing up to get a better look at harry as he sat frozen in his seat 
 
 up at the top table professor mcgonagall had got to her feet and swept past ludo bagman and professor karkaroff to whisper urgently to professor dumbledore who bent his ear toward her frowning slightly 
 
 harry turned to ron and hermione beyond them he saw the long gryffindor table all watching him openmouthed 
 
 i put my name in harry said blankly you know i 
 
 both of them stared just as blankly back 
 
 at the top table professor dumbledore had straightened up nodding to professor mcgonagall 
 
 harry potter he called again harry up here if you please 
 
 go on hermione whispered giving harry a slight push 
 
 harry got to his feet trod on the hem of his robes and stumbled slightly he set off up the gap between the gryffindor and hufflepuff tables it felt like an immensely long walk the top table seem to be getting any nearer at all and he could feel hundreds and hundreds of eyes upon him as though each were a searchlight the buzzing grew louder and louder after what seemed like an hour he was right in front of dumbledore feeling the stares of all the teachers upon him 
 
 wellthrough the door harry said dumbledore he smiling 
 
 harry moved off along the teachers table hagrid was seated right at the end he did not wink at harry or wave or give any of his usual signs of greeting he looked completely astonished and stared at harry as he passed like everyone else harry went through the door out of the great hall and found himself in a smaller room lined with paintings of witches and wizards a handsome fire was roaring in the fireplace opposite him 
 
 the faces in the portraits turned to look at him as he entered he saw a wizened witch flit out of the frame of her picture and into the one next to it which contained a wizard with a walrus mustache the wizened witch started whispering in his ear 
 
 viktor krum cedric diggory and fleur delacour were grouped around the fire they looked strangely impressive silhouetted against the flames krum and brooding was leaning against the mantelpiece slightly apart from the other two cedric was standing with his hands behind his back staring into the fire fleur delacour looked around when harry walked in and threw back her sheet of long silvery hair 
 
 what is it she said do zey want us back in ze hall 
 
 she thought he had come to deliver a message harry know how to explain what had just happened he just stood there looking at the three champions it struck him how very tall all of them were 
 
 there was a sound of scurrying feet behind him and ludo bagman entered the room he took harry by the arm and led him forward 
 
 extraordinary he muttered squeezing arm absolutely extraordinary gentlemenlady he added approaching the fireside and addressing the other three may i introduce incredible though it may seem the fourth triwizard champion 
 
 viktor krum straightened up his surly face darkened as he surveyed harry cedric looked nonplussed he looked from bagman to harry and back again as though sure he must have misheard what bagman had said fleur delacour however tossed her hair smiling and said oh vairy funny joke meester bagman 
 
 joke bagman repeated bewildered no no not at all name just came out of the goblet of fire 
 
 thick eyebrows contracted slightly cedric was still looking politely bewildered fleur frowned 
 
 but evidently zair as been a mistake she said contemptuously to bagman e cannot compete e is too young 
 
 wellit is amazing said bagman rubbing his smooth chin and smiling down at harry but as you know the age restriction was only imposed this year as an extra safety measure and as his come out of the gobleti mean i think there can be any ducking out at this down in the rules obligedharry will just have to do the best he 
 
 the door behind them opened again and a large group of people came in professor dumbledore followed closely by mr crouch professor karkaroff madame maxime professor mcgonagall and professor snape harry heard the buzzing of the hundreds of students on the other side of the wall before professor mcgonagall closed the door 
 
 madame maxime said fleur at once striding over to her headmistress zey are saying zat zis little boy is to compete also 
 
 somewhere under numb disbelief he felt a ripple of anger little boy 
 
 madame maxime had drawn herself up to her full and considerable height the top of her handsome head brushed the chandelier and her gigantic bosom swelled 
 
 what is ze meaning of zis she said imperiously 
 
 rather like to know that myself dumbledore said professor karkaroff he was wearing a steely smile and his blue eyes were like chips of ice two hogwarts champions i remember anyone telling me the host school is allowed two champions or have i not read the rules carefully enough 
 
 he gave a short and nasty laugh 
 
 impossible said madame maxime whose enormous hand with its many superb opals was resting upon shoulder ogwarts cannot ave two champions it is most injust 
 
 we were under the impression that your age line would keep out younger contestants dumbledore said karkaroff his steely smile still in place though his eyes were colder than ever otherwise we would of course have brought along a wider selection of candidates from our own schools 
 
 no fault but karkaroff said snape softly his black eyes were alight with malice go blaming dumbledore for determination to break rules he has been crossing lines ever since he arrived here 
 
 thank you severus said dumbledore firmly and snape went quiet though his eyes still glinted malevolently through his curtain of greasy black hair 
 
 professor dumbledore was now looking down at harry who looked right back at him trying to discern the expression of the eyes behind the spectacles 
 
 did you put your name into the goblet of fire harry he asked calmly 
 
 no said harry he was very aware of everybody watching him closely snape made a soft noise of impatient disbelief in the shadows 
 
 did you ask an older student to put it into the goblet of fire for you said professor dumbledore ignoring snape 
 
 no said harry vehemently 
 
 ah but of course e is lying cried madame maxime snape was now shaking his head his lip curling 
 
 he could not have crossed the age line said professor mcgonagall sharply i am sure we are all agreed on that 
 
 must ave made a mistake wiz ze line said madame maxime shrugging 
 
 it is possible of course said dumbledore politely 
 
 dumbledore you know perfectly well you did not make a mistake said professor mcgonagall angrily really what nonsense harry could not have crossed the line himself and as professor dumbledore believes that he did not persuade an older student to do it for him sure that should be good enough for everybody else 
 
 she shot a very angry look at professor snape 
 
 mr crouchmr bagman said karkaroff his voice unctuous once more you are our er objective judges surely you will agree that this is most irregular 
 
 bagman wiped his round boyish face with his handkerchief and looked at mr crouch who was standing outside the circle of the firelight his face half hidden in shadow he looked slightly eerie the half darkness making him look much older giving him an almost appearance when he spoke however it was in his usual curt voice 
 
 we must follow the rules and the rules state clearly that those people whose names come out of the goblet of fire are bound to compete in the tournament 
 
 well barty knows the rule book back to front said bagman beaming and turning back to karkaroff and madame maxime as though the matter was now closed 
 
 i insist upon resubmitting the names of the rest of my students said karkaroff he had dropped his unctuous tone and his smile now his face wore a very ugly look indeed you will set up the goblet of fire once more and we will continue adding names until each school has two champions only fair dumbledore 
 
 but karkaroff it work like that said bagman the goblet of just gone out it reignite until the start of the next tournament 
 
 in which durmstrang will most certainly not be competing exploded karkaroff after all our meetings and negotiations and compromises i little expected something of this nature to occur i have half a mind to leave now 
 
 empty threat karkaroff growled a voice from near the door you leave your champion now got to compete all got to compete binding magical contract like dumbledore said convenient eh 
 
 moody had just entered the room he limped toward the fire and with every right step he took there was a loud clunk 
 
 convenient said karkaroff afraid i understand you moody 
 
 harry could tell he was trying to sound disdainful as though what moody was saying was barely worth his notice but his hands gave him away they had balled themselves into fists 
 
 you said moody quietly very simple karkaroff someone put name in that goblet knowing have to compete if it came out 
 
 evidently someone oo wished to give ogwarts two bites at ze apple said madame maxime 
 
 i quite agree madame maxime said karkaroff bowing to her i shall be lodging complaints with the ministry of magic and the international confederation of wizards 
 
 if got reason to complain potter growled moody butfunny thingi hear him saying a word 
 
 why should e complain burst out fleur delacour stamping her foot e as ze chance to compete e we ave all been oping to be chosen for weeks and weeks ze honor for our schools a thousand galleons in prize money zis is a chance many would die for 
 
 maybe hoping potter is going to die for it said moody with the merest trace of a growl 
 
 an extremely tense silence followed these words ludo bagman who was looking very anxious indeed bounced nervously up and down on his feet and said moody old manwhat a thing to say 
 
 we all know professor moody considers the morning wasted if he discovered six plots to murder him before lunchtime said karkaroff loudly apparently he is now teaching his students to fear assassination too an odd quality in a defense against the dark arts teacher dumbledore but no doubt you had your reasons 
 
 imagining things am i growled moody seeing things eh it was a skilled witch or wizard who put the name in that goblet 
 
 ah what evidence is zere of zat said madame maxime throwing up her huge hands 
 
 because they hoodwinked a very powerful magical object said moody it would have needed an exceptionally strong confundus charm to bamboozle that goblet into forgetting that only three schools compete in the guessing they submitted name under a fourth school to make sure he was the only one in his category 
 
 you seem to have given this a great deal of thought moody said karkaroff coldly and a very ingenious theory it is though of course i heard you recently got it into your head that one of your birthday presents contained a cunningly disguised basilisk egg and smashed it to pieces before realizing it was a carriage clock so understand if we take you entirely seriously 
 
 there are those turn innocent occasions to their advantage moody retorted in a menacing voice my job to think the way dark wizards do karkaroff as you ought to remember 
 
 alastor said dumbledore warningly harry wondered for a moment whom he was speaking to but then realized could hardly be real first name moody fell silent though still surveying karkaroff with satisfaction face was burning 
 
 how this situation arose we do not know said dumbledore speaking to everyone gathered in the room it seems to me however that we have no choice but to accept it both cedric and harry have been chosen to compete in the tournament this therefore they will do 
 
 ah but 
 
 my dear madame maxime if you have an alternative i would be delighted to hear it 
 
 dumbledore waited but madame maxime did not speak she merely glared she the only one either snape looked furious karkaroff livid bagman however looked rather excited 
 
 well shall we crack on then he said rubbing his hands together and smiling around the room got to give our champions their instructions we barty want to do the honors 
 
 mr crouch seemed to come out of a deep reverie 
 
 yes he said instructions yesthe first task 
 
 he moved forward into the firelight close up harry thought he looked ill there were dark shadows beneath his eyes and a thin papery look about his wrinkled skin that had not been there at the quidditch world cup 
 
 the first task is designed to test your daring he told harry cedric fleur and viktor so we are not going to be telling you what it is courage in the face of the unknown is an important quality in a wizardvery important 
 
 the first task will take place on november the in front of the other students and the panel of judges 
 
 the champions are not permitted to ask for or accept help of any kind from their teachers to complete the tasks in the tournament the champions will face the first challenge armed only with their wands they will receive information about the second task when the first is over owing to the demanding and nature of the tournament the champions are exempted from tests 
 
 mr crouch turned to look at dumbledore 
 
 i think all is it albus 
 
 i think so said dumbledore who was looking at mr crouch with mild concern are you sure you like to stay at hogwarts tonight barty 
 
 no dumbledore i must get back to the ministry said mr crouch it is a very busy very difficult time at the left young weatherby in enthusiastica little overenthusiastic if truth be told 
 
 come and have a drink before you go at least said dumbledore 
 
 come on barry staying said bagman brightly all happening at hogwarts now you know much more exciting here than at the office 
 
 i think not ludo said crouch with a touch of his old impatience 
 
 professor karkaroff madame maxime a nightcap said dumbledore 
 
 but madame maxime had already put her arm around shoulders and was leading her swiftly out of the room harry could hear them both talking very fast in french as they went off into the great hall karkaroff beckoned to krum and they too exited though in silence 
 
 harry cedric i suggest you go up to bed said dumbledore smiling at both of them i am sure gryffindor and hufflepuff are waiting to celebrate with you and it would be a shame to deprive them of this excellent excuse to make a great deal of mess and noise 
 
 harry glanced at cedric who nodded and they left together 
 
 the great hall was deserted now the candles had burned low giving the jagged smiles of the pumpkins an eerie flickering quality 
 
 so said cedric with a slight smile playing against each other again 
 
 i said harry he really think of anything to say the inside of his head seemed to be in complete disarray as though his brain had been ransacked 
 
 sotell me said cedric as they reached the entrance hall which was now lit only by torches in the absence of the goblet of fire how did you get your name in 
 
 i said harry staring up at him i put it in i was telling the truth 
 
 ahokay said cedric harry could tell cedric believe him wellsee you then 
 
 instead of going up the marble staircase cedric headed for a door to its right harry stood listening to him going down the stone steps beyond it then slowly he started to climb the marble ones 
 
 was anyone except ron and hermione going to believe him or would they all think put himself in for the tournament yet how could anyone think that when he was facing competitors had three years more magical education than he had when he was now facing tasks that not only sounded very dangerous but which were to be performed in front of hundreds of people yes thought about fantasized about itbut it had been a joke really an idle sort of never really seriously considered entering 
 
 but someone else had considered itsomeone else had wanted him in the tournament and had made sure he was entered why to give him a treat he think so somehow 
 
 to see him make a fool of himself well they were likely to get their wish 
 
 but to get him killed 
 
 was moody just being his usual paranoid self someone have put name in the goblet as a trick a practical joke did anyone really want him dead 
 
 harry was able to answer that at once yes someone wanted him dead someone had wanted him dead ever since he had been a year oldlord voldemort but how could voldemort have ensured that name got into the goblet of fire voldemort was supposed to be far away in some distant country in hiding alonefeeble and powerless 
 
 yet in that dream he had had just before he had awoken with his scar hurting voldemort had not been alonehe had been talking to wormtailplotting murder 
 
 harry got a shock to find himself facing the fat lady already he had barely noticed where his feet were carrying him it was also a surprise to see that she was not alone in her frame the wizened witch who had flitted into her painting when he had joined the champions downstairs was now sitting smugly beside the fat lady she must have dashed through every picture lining seven staircases to reach here before him both she and the fat lady were looking down at him with the keenest interest 
 
 well well well said the fat lady just told me everything just been chosen as school champion then 
 
 balderdash said harry dully 
 
 it most certainly said the pale witch indignantly 
 
 no no vi the password said the fat lady soothingly and she swung forward on her hinges to let harry into the common room 
 
 the blast of noise that met ears when the portrait opened almost knocked him backward next thing he knew he was being wrenched inside the common room by about a dozen pairs of hands and was facing the whole of gryffindor house all of whom were screaming applauding and whistling 
 
 you told us entered bellowed fred he looked half annoyed half deeply impressed 
 
 how did you do it without getting a beard brilliant roared george 
 
 i harry said i know how 
 
 but angelina had now swooped down upon him oh if it be me at least a gryffindor 
 
 be able to pay back diggory for that last quidditch match harry shrieked katie bell another of the gryffindor chasers 
 
 got food harry come and have some 
 
 not hungry i had enough at the feast 
 
 but nobody wanted to hear that he hungry nobody wanted to hear that he put his name in the goblet not one single person seemed to have noticed that he at all in the mood to jordan had unearthed a gryffindor banner from somewhere and he insisted on draping it around harry like a cloak harry get away whenever he tried to sidle over to the staircase up to the dormitories the crowd around him closed ranks forcing another butterbeer on him stuffing crisps and peanuts into his wanted to know how he had done it how he had tricked age line and managed to get his name into the goblet 
 
 i he said over and over again i know how it happened 
 
 but for all the notice anyone took he might just as well not have answered at all 
 
 tired he bellowed finally after nearly half an hour no seriously george going to bed 
 
 he wanted more than anything to find ron and hermione to find a bit of sanity but neither of them seemed to be in the common room insisting that he needed to sleep and almost flattening the little creevey brothers as they attempted to waylay him at the foot of the stairs harry managed to shake everyone off and climb up to the dormitory as fast as he could 
 
 to his great relief he found ron was lying on his bed in the otherwise empty dormitory still fully dressed he looked up when harry slammed the door behind him 
 
 you been harry said 
 
 oh hello said ron 
 
 he was grinning but it was a very odd strained sort of grin harry suddenly became aware that he was still wearing the scarlet gryffindor banner that lee had tied around him he hastened to take it off but it was knotted very tightly ron lay on the bed without moving watching harry struggle to remove it 
 
 so he said when harry had finally removed the banner and thrown it into a corner congratulations 
 
 what mean congratulations said harry staring at ron there was definitely something wrong with the way ron was smiling it was more like a grimace 
 
 wellno one else got across the age line said ron not even fred and george what did you use the invisibility cloak 
 
 the invisibility cloak have got me over that line said harry slowly 
 
 oh right said ron i thought you told me if it was the cloakbecause it covered both of us it but you found another way did you 
 
 listen said harry i put my name in that goblet someone else done it 
 
 ron raised his eyebrows 
 
 what would they do that for 
 
 i dunno said harry he felt it would sound very melodramatic to say to kill me 
 
 eyebrows rose so high that they were in danger of disappearing into his hair 
 
 okay you know you can tell me the truth he said if you want everyone else to know fine but i know why bothering to lie you get into trouble for it did you that friend of the fat that violet already told us all letting you enter a thousand galleons prize money eh and you have to do tests either 
 
 i put my name in that goblet said harry starting to feel angry 
 
 yeah okay said ron in exactly the same sceptical tone as cedric only you said this morning have done it last night and no one seen not stupid you know 
 
 doing a really good impression of it harry snapped 
 
 yeah said ron and there was no trace of a grin forced or otherwise on his face now you want to get to bed harry i expect need to be up early tomorrow for a or something 
 
 he wrenched the hangings shut around his leaving harry standing there by the door staring at the dark red velvet curtains now hiding one of the few people he had been sure would believe him 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire

 harry felt happier for the rest of the weekend than he had done all term he and ron spent much of sunday catching up with all their homework again and although this could hardly be called fun the last burst of autumn sunshine persisted so rather than sitting hunched over tables in the common room they took their work outside and lounged in the shade of a large beech tree on the edge of the lake hermione who of course was up to date with all her work brought more wool outside with her and bewitched her knitting needles so that they flashed and clicked in midair beside her producing more hats and scarves 
 
 knowing they were doing something to resist umbridge and the ministry and that he was a key part of the rebellion gave harry a feeling of immense satisfaction he kept reliving saturdays meeting in his mind all those people coming to him to learn defence against the dark arts and the looks on their faces as they had heard some of the things he had done and cho praising his performance in the triwizard tournamentknowing all those people did not think him a lying weirdo but someone to be admired buoyed him up so much that he was still cheerful on monday morning despite the imminent prospect of all his least favourite classes 
 
 he and ron headed downstairs from their dormitory discussing idea that they were to work on a new move called the sloth grip roll during that nights quidditch practice and not until they were halfway across the sunlit common room did they notice the addition to the room that had already attracted the attention of a small group of people 
 
 a large sign had been affixed to the grffindor noticeboard so large it covered everything else on itthe lists of secondhand spellbooks for sale the regular reminders of school rules from argus filch the quidditch team training timetable the offers to barter certain chocolate frog cards for others the weasleys latest advertisement for testers the dates of the hogsmeade weekends and the lost and found notices the new sign was printed in large black letters and there was a highly seal at the bottom beside a neat and curly signature 
 
 by order of the high inquisitor of hogwarts 
 
 all student organisations societies teams groups and clubs are 
 
 henceforth disbanded 
 
 
 
 an organisation society team group or club is hereby defined 
 
 as a regular meeting of three or more students 
 
 
 
 permission to may be sought from the high inquisitor 
 
 professor umbridge

 the above is in accordance with educational decree 
 
 number 
 
 
 
 signed dolores jane umbridge high inquisitor 
 
 harry and ron read the notice over the heads of some 
 
 does this mean going to shut down the gobstones club one of them asked his friend 
 
 i reckon be ok with gobstones ron said darkly making the jump i think going to be as lucky though do you he asked harry as the hurried away 
 
 harry was reading the notice through again the happiness that had filled him since saturday was gone his insides were pulsing with rage 
 
 this a coincidence he said his hands forming fists she knows 
 
 she said ron at once 
 
 there were people listening in that pub and face it we know how many of the people who turned up we can trust any of them could have run off and told umbridge 
 
 and he had thought they believed him thought they even admired him 
 
 zacharias smith said ron at once punching a fist into his hand ori thought that michael corner had a really shifty look too 
 
 i wonder if seen this yet harry said looking round at the door to the girls dormitories 
 
 go and tell her said ron he bounded forwards pulled open the door and set off up the spiral staircase 
 
 he was on the sixth stair when there was a loud wailing sound and the steps melted together to make a long smooth stone slide like a there was a brief moment when ron tried to keep running arms working madly like windmills then he toppled over backwards and shot down the newly created slide coming to rest on his back at feet 
 
 eri think allowed in the girls dormitories said harry pulling ron to his feet and trying not to laugh 
 
 two girls came zooming gleefully down the stone slide 
 
 oooh who tried to get upstairs they giggled happily leaping to their feet and ogling harry and ron 
 
 me said ron who was still rather dishevelled i realise that would happen not fair he added to harry as the girls headed off for the portrait hole still giggling madly allowed in our dormitory how come not allowed 
 
 well an rule said hermione who had just slid neatly on to a rug in front of them and was now getting to her feet but it says in hogwarts a history that the founders thought boys were less trustworthy than girls anyway why were you trying to get in there 
 
 to see youlook at this said ron dragging her over to the noticeboard 
 
 eyes slid rapidly down the notice her expression became stony 
 
 someone must have blabbed to her ron said angrily 
 
 they have done said hermione in a low voice 
 
 so naive said ron you think just because all honourable and trustworthy 
 
 no they have done because i put a jinx on that piece of parchment we all signed said hermione grimly believe me if run off and told umbridge know exactly who they are and they will really regret it 
 
 happen to them said ron eagerly 
 
 well put it this way said hermione make eloise acne look like a couple of cute freckles come on get down to breakfast and see what the others think i wonder whether this has been put up in all the houses 
 
 it was immediately apparent on entering the great hall that sign had not only appeared in gryffindor tower there was a peculiar intensity about the chatter and an extra measure of movement in the hall as people scurried up and down their tables conferring on what they had read harry ron and hermione had barely taken their seats when neville dean fred george and ginny descended upon them 
 
 did you see it 
 
 reckon she knows 
 
 what are we going to do 
 
 they were all looking at harry he glanced around to make sure there were no teachers near them 
 
 going to do it anyway of course he said quietly 
 
 knew say that said george beaming and thumping harry on the arm 
 
 the prefects as well said fred looking quizzically at ron and hermione 
 
 of course said hermione coolly 
 
 here come ernie and hannah abbott said ron looking over his shoulder and those ravenclaw blokes and smith and no one looks very spotty 
 
 hermione looked alarmed 
 
 never mind spots the idiots come over here now look really suspicioussit down she mouthed to ernie and hannah gesturing frantically to them to rejoin the hufflepuff table later 
 
 tell michael said ginny impatiently swinging herself off her bench the fool honestly 
 
 she hurried off towards the ravenclaw table harry watched her go cho was sitting not far away talking to the friend she had brought along to the head would notice scare her off meeting them again 
 
 but the full repercussions of the sign were not felt until they were leaving the great hall for history of magic 
 
 harry ron 
 
 it was angelina and she was hurrying towards them looking perfectly desperate 
 
 ok said harry quietly when she was near enough to hear him still going to 
 
 you realise including quidditch in this angelina said over him we have to go and ask permission to the gryffindor team 
 
 what said harry 
 
 no way said ron appalled 
 
 you read the sign it mentions teams too so listen harry i am saying this for the last time please please lose your temper with umbridge again or she might not let us play any more 
 
 ok ok said harry for angelina looked as though she was on the verge of tears worry behave myself 
 
 bet umbridge is in history of magic said ron grimly as they set off for lesson she inspected binns yet bet you anything there 
 
 but he was wrong the only teacher present when they entered was professor binns floating an inch or so above his chair as usual and preparing to continue his monotonous drone on giant wars harry did not even attempt to follow what he was saying today he doodled idly on his parchment ignoring frequent glares and nudges until a particularly painful poke in the ribs made him look up angrily 
 
 what 
 
 she pointed at the window harry looked round hedwig was perched on the narrow window ledge gazing through the thick glass at him a letter tied to her leg harry could not understand it they had just had breakfast why on earth she delivered the letter then as usual many of his classmates were pointing out hedwig to each other too 
 
 oh always loved that owl so beautiful harry heard lavender sigh to parvati 
 
 he glanced round at professor binns who continued to read his notes serenely unaware that the attention was even less focused upon him than usual harry slipped quietly off his chair crouched down and hurried along the row to the window where he slid the catch and opened it very slowly 
 
 he had expected hedwig to hold out her leg so that he could remove the letter and then fly off to the owlery but the moment the window was open wide enough she hopped inside hooting dolefully he closed the window with an anxious glance at professor binns crouched low again and sped back to his seat with hedwig on his shoulder he regained his seat transferred hedwig to his lap and made to remove the letter tied to her leg 
 
 only then did he realise that feathers were oddly ruffled some were bent the wrong way and she was holding one of her wings at an odd angle 
 
 hurt harry whispered bending his head low over her hermione and ron leaned in closer hermione even put down her quill something wrong with her wing 
 
 hedwig was quivering when harry made to touch the wing she gave a little jump all her feathers on end as though she was inflating herself and gazed at him reproachfully 
 
 professor binns said harry loudly and everyone in the class turned to look at him not feeling well 
 
 professor binns raised his eyes from his notes looking amazed as always to find the room in front of him full of people 
 
 not feeling well he repeated hazily 
 
 not at all well said harry firmly getting to his feet with hedwig concealed behind his back i think i need to go to the hospital wing 
 
 yes said professor binns clearly very much yes yes hospital wing well off you go then perkins 
 
 once outside the room harry returned hedwig to his shoulder and hurried off up the corridor pausing to think only when he was out of sight of door his first choice of somebody to cure hedwig would have been hagrid of course but as he had no idea where hagrid was his only remaining option was to find professor and hope she would help 
 
 he peered out of a window at the blustery overcast grounds there was no sign of her anywhere near cabin if she was not teaching she was probably in the staff room he set off downstairs hedwig hooting feebly as she swayed on his shoulder 
 
 two stone gargoyles flanked the door as harry approached one of them croaked you should be in class sonny jim 
 
 this is urgent said harry curtly 
 
 ooooh urgent is it said the other gargoyle in a voice well put us in our place it 
 
 harry knocked he heard footsteps then the door opened and he found himself face to face with professor mcgonagall 
 
 you been given another detention she said at once her square spectacles flashing alarmingly 
 
 no professor said harry hastily 
 
 well then why are you out of class 
 
 urgent apparently said the second gargoyle snidely 
 
 looking for professor harry explained my owl injured 
 
 injured owl did you say 
 
 professor appeared at professor shoulder smoking a pipe and holding a copy of the daily prophet 
 
 yes said harry lifting hedwig carefully off his shoulder she turned up after the other post owls and her all funny look 
 
 professor stuck her pipe firmly between her teeth and took hedwig from harry while professor mcgonagall watched 
 
 hmm said professor her pipe waggling slightly as she talked looks like attacked her think what would have done it though thestrals will sometimes go for birds of course but got the hogwarts thestrals not to touch owls 
 
 harry neither knew nor cared what thestrals were he just wanted to know that hedwig was going to be all right professor mcgonagall however looked sharply at harry and said do you know how far this travelled potter 
 
 er said harry from london i think 
 
 he met her eyes briefly and knew by the way her eyebrows had joined in the middle that she understood london to mean number twelve grimmauld place 
 
 professor pulled a monocle out of the inside of her robes and screwed it into her eye to examine wing closely i should be able to sort this out if you leave her with me potter she said she be flying long distances for a few days in any case 
 
 errightthanks said harry just as the bell rang for break 
 
 no problem said professor gruffly turning back into the staff room 
 
 just a moment wilhelmina said professor mcgonagall letter 
 
 oh yeah said harry who had momentarily forgotten the scroll tied to leg professor handed it over and then disappeared into the staff room carrying hedwig who was staring at harry as though unable to believe he would give her away like this feeling slightly guilty he turned to go but professor mcgonagall called him back 
 
 potter 
 
 yes professor 
 
 she glanced up and down the corridor there were students coming from both directions 
 
 bear in mind she said quickly and quietly her eyes on the scroll in his hand that channels of communication in and out of hogwarts may be being watched you 
 
 i said harry but the flood of students rolling along the corridor was almost upon him professor mcgonagall gave him a curt nod and retreated into the staff room leaving harry to be swept out into the courtyard with the crowd he spotted ron and hermione already standing in a sheltered corner their cloak collars turned up against the wind harry slit open the scroll as he hurried towards them and found five words in handwriting 
 
 today same time same place 
 
 is hedwig ok asked hermione anxiously the moment he was within earshot 
 
 where did you take her asked ron 
 
 to said harry and i met mcgonagall listen 
 
 and he told them what professor mcgonagall had said to his surprise neither of the others looked shocked on the contrary they exchanged significant looks 
 
 what said harry looking from ron to hermione and back again 
 
 well i was just saying to ron what if someone had tried to intercept hedwig i mean never been hurt on a flight before has she 
 
 the letter from anyway asked ron taking the note from harry 
 
 snuffles said harry quietly 
 
 same time same place does he mean the fire in the common room 
 
 obviously said hermione also reading the note she looked uneasy i just hope nobody else has read this 
 
 but it was still sealed and everything said harry trying to convince himself as much as her and nobody would understand what it meant if they know where spoken to him before would they 
 
 i know said hermione anxiously hitching her bag back over her shoulder as the bell rang again it be exactly difficult to the scroll by magic and if watching the floo network but i really see how we can warn him not to come without that being intercepted too 
 
 they trudged down the stone steps to the dungeons for potions all three of them lost in thought but as they reached the bottom of the steps they were recalled to themselves by the voice of draco malfoy who was standing just outside classroom door waving around an piece of parchment and talking much louder than was necessary so that they could hear every word 
 
 yeah umbridge gave the slytherin quidditch team permission to continue playing straightaway i went to ask her first thing this morning well it was pretty much automatic i mean she knows my father really well always popping in and out of the ministry be interesting to see whether gryffindor are allowed to keep playing it 
 
 rise hermione whispered imploringly to harry and ron who were both watching malfoy faces set and fists clenched what he wants 
 
 i mean said malfoy raising his voice a little more his grey eyes glittering malevolently in harry and direction if a question of influence with the ministry i think got much chance from what my father says been looking for an excuse to sack arthur weasley for years and as for potter my father says a matter of time before the ministry has him carted off to st apparently got a special ward for people whose brains have been addled by magic 
 
 malfoy made a grotesque face his mouth sagging open and his eyes rolling crabbe and goyle gave their usual grunts of laughter pansy parkinson shrieked with glee 
 
 something collided hard with shoulder knocking him sideways a split second later he realised that neville had just charged past him heading straight for malfoy 
 
 neville no 
 
 harry leapt forward and seized the back of robes neville struggled frantically his fists flailing trying desperately to get at malfoy who looked for a moment extremely shocked 
 
 help me harry flung at ron managing to get an arm around neck and dragging him backwards away from the slytherins crabbe and goyle were flexing their arms as they stepped in front of malfoy ready for the fight ron seized arms and together he and harry succeeded in dragging neville back into the gryffindor line nevilles face was scarlet the pressure harry was exerting on his throat rendered him quite incomprehensible but odd words spluttered from his mouth 
 
 not funny show him 
 
 the dungeon door opened snape appeared there his black eyes swept up the gryffindor line to the point where harry and ron were wrestling with neville 
 
 fighting potter weasley longbottom snape said in his cold sneering voice ten points from gryffindor release longbottom potter or it will be detention inside all of you 
 
 harry let go of neville who stood panting and glaring at him 
 
 i had to stop you harry gasped picking up his bag crabbe and goyle torn you apart 
 
 neville said nothing he merely snatched up his own bag and stalked off into the dungeon 
 
 what in the name of merlin said ron slowly as they followed neville was that about 
 
 harry did not answer he knew exactly why the subject of people who were in st because of magical damage to their brains was highly distressing to neville but he had sworn to dumbledore that he would not tell anyone secret even neville did not know harry knew 
 
 harry ron and hermione took their usual seats at the back of the class pulled out parchment quills and their copies of one thousand magical herbs and class around them was whispering about what neville had just done but when snape closed the dungeon door with an echoing bang everybody immediately fell silent 
 
 you will notice said snape in his low sneering voice that we have a guest with us today 
 
 he gestured towards the dim corner of the dungeon and harry saw professor umbridge sitting there clipboard on her knee he glanced sideways at ron and hermione his eyebrows raised snape and umbridge the two teachers he hated most it was hard to decide which one he wanted to triumph over the other 
 
 we are continuing with our strengthening solution today you will find your mixtures as you left them last lesson it correctly made they should have matured well over the weekendinstructions he waved his wand again on the board carry on 
 
 professor umbridge spent the first half hour of the lesson making notes in her corner harry was very interested in hearing her question snape so interested that he was becoming careless with his potion again 
 
 salamander blood harry hermione moaned grabbing his wrist to prevent him adding the wrong ingredient for the third time not pomegranate juice 
 
 right said harry vaguely putting down the bottle and continuing to watch the corner umbridge had just got to her feet ha he said softly as she strode between two lines of desks towards snape who was bending over dean cauldron 
 
 well the class seem fairly advanced for their level she said briskly to back though i would question whether it is advisable to teach them a potion like the strengthening solution i think the ministry would prefer it if that was removed from the syllabus 
 
 snape straightened up slowly and turned to look at her 
 
 now how long have you been teaching at hogwarts she asked her quill poised over her clipboard 
 
 fourteen years snape replied his expression was unfathomable harry watching him closely added a few drops to his potion it hissed menacingly and turned from turquoise to orange 
 
 you applied first for the defence against the dark arts post i believe professor umbridge asked snape 
 
 yes said snape quietly 
 
 but you were unsuccessful 
 
 lip curled 
 
 obviously 
 
 professor umbridge scribbled on her clipboard 
 
 and you have applied regularly for the defence against the dark arts post since you first joined the school i believe 
 
 yes said snape quietly barely moving his lips he looked very angry 
 
 do you have any idea why dumbledore has consistently refused to appoint you asked umbridge 
 
 i suggest you ask him said snape jerkily 
 
 oh i shall said professor umbridge with a sweet smile 
 
 i suppose this is relevant snape asked his black eyes narrowed 
 
 oh yes said professor umbridge yes the ministry wants a thorough understanding of 
 
 she turned away walked over to pansy parkinson and began questioning her about the lessons snape looked round at harry and their eyes met for a second harry hastily dropped his gaze to his potion which was now congealing foully and giving off a strong smell of burned rubber 
 
 no marks again then potter said snape maliciously emptying cauldron with a wave of his wand you will write me an essay on the correct composition of this potion indicating how and why you went wrong to be handed in next lesson do you understand 
 
 yes said harry furiously snape had already given them homework and he had quidditch practice this evening this would mean another couple of sleepless nights it did not seem possible that he had awoken that morning feeling very happy all he felt now was a fervent desire for this day to end 
 
 maybe skive off divination he said glumly as they stood in the courtyard after lunch the wind whipping at the hems of robes and brims of hats pretend to be ill and do essay instead then i have to stay up half the night 
 
 you skive off divination said hermione severely 
 
 hark talking you walked out of divination you hate trelawney said ron indignantly 
 
 i hate her said hermione loftily i just think an absolutely appalling teacher and a real old fraud but already missed history of magic and i think he ought to miss anything else today 
 
 there was too much truth in this to ignore so half an hour later harry took his seat in the hot overperfumed atmosphere of the divination classroom feeling angry at everybody professor trelawney was yet again handing out copies of the dream thought surely be much better employed doing punishment essay than sitting here trying to find meaning in a lot of dreams 
 
 it seemed however that he was not the only person in divination who was in a temper professor trelawney slammed a copy of the oracle down on the table between harry and ron and swept away her lips pursed she threw the next copy of the oracle at seamus and dean narrowly avoiding head and thrust the final one into chest with such force that he slipped off his pouffe 
 
 well carry on said professor trelawney loudly her voice and somewhat hysterical you know what to do or am i such a teacher that you have never learned how to open a book 
 
 the class stared perplexedly at her then at each other harry however thought he knew what was the matter as professor trelawney flounced back to the teachers chair her magnified eyes full of angry tears he leaned his head closer to and muttered i think got the results of her inspection back 
 
 professor said parvati patil in a hushed voice she and lavender had always rather admired professor trelawney professor is there anythingerwrong 
 
 wrong cried professor trelawney in a voice throbbing with emotion certainly not i have been insulted certainly insinuations have been made against me unfounded accusations levelled but no there is nothing wrong certainly not 
 
 she took a great shuddering breath and looked away from parvati angry tears spilling from under her glasses 
 
 i say nothing she choked of sixteen years of devoted service it has passed apparently unnoticed but i shall not be insulted no i shall not 
 
 but professor insulting you asked parvati timidly 
 
 the establishment said professor trelawney in a deep dramatic wavering voice yes those with eyes too clouded by the mundane to see as i see to know as i know of course we seers have always been feared always persecuted it isalasour fate 
 
 she gulped dabbed at her wet cheeks with the end of her shawl then she pulled a small embroidered handkerchief from her sleeve and blew her nose very hard with a sound like peeves blowing a raspberry 
 
 ron sniggered lavender shot him a disgusted look 
 
 professor said parvati do you mean is it something professor umbridge 
 
 do not speak to me about that woman cried professor trelawney leaping to her feet her beads rattling and her spectacles flashing kindly continue with your work 
 
 and she spent the rest of the lesson striding among them tears still leaking from behind her glasses muttering what sounded like threats under her breath 
 
 may well choose to leave the indignity of it on probation we shall see how she dares 
 
 you and umbridge have got something in common harry told hermione quietly when they met again in defence against the dark arts she obviously reckons an old fraud too looks like put her on probation 
 
 umbridge entered the room as he spoke wearing her black velvet bow and an expression of great smugness 
 
 good afternoon class 
 
 good afternoon professor umbridge they chanted dully 
 
 wands away please 
 
 but there was no answering flurry of movement this time nobody had bothered to take out their wands 
 
 please turn to page of defensive magical theory and read the third chapter entitled the case for responses to magical attack there will be 
 
 no need to talk harry ron and hermione said together under their breaths 
 
 no quidditch practice said angelina in hollow tones when harry ron and hermione entered the common room after dinner that night 
 
 but i kept my temper said harry horrified i say anything to her angelina i swear i 
 
 i know i know said angelina miserably she just said she needed a bit of time to consider 
 
 consider what said ron angrily given the slytherins permission why not us 
 
 but harry could imagine how much umbridge was enjoying holding the threat of no gryffindor quidditch team over their heads and could easily understand why she would not want to relinquish that weapon over them too soon 
 
 well said hermione look on the bright sideat least now have time to do essay 
 
 a bright side is it snapped harry while ron stared incredulously at hermione no quidditch practice and extra potions 
 
 harry slumped down into a chair dragged his potions essay reluctantly from his bag and set to work it was very hard to concentrate even though he knew sirius was not due in the fire until much later he could not help glancing into the flames every few minutes just in case there was also an incredible amount of noise in the room fred and george appeared finally to have perfected one type of skiving snackbox which they were taking turns to demonstrate to a cheering and whooping crowd 
 
 first fred would take a bite out of the orange end of a chew at which he would vomit spectacularly into a bucket they had placed in front of them then he would force down the purple end of the chew at which the vomiting would immediately cease lee jordan who was assisting the demonstration was lazily vanishing the vomit at regular intervals with the same vanishing spell snape kept using on potions 
 
 what with the regular sounds of retching cheering and the sound of fred and george taking advance orders from the crowd harry was finding it exceptionally difficult to focus on the correct method for strengthening solution hermione was not helping matters the cheers and the sound of vomit hitting the bottom of fred and bucket were punctuated by her loud and disapproving sniffs which harry found if anything more distracting 
 
 just go and stop them then he said irritably after crossing out the wrong weight of powdered griffin claw for the fourth time 
 
 i not technically doing anything wrong said hermione through gritted teeth quite within their rights to eat the foul things themselves and i find a rule that says the other idiots entitled to buy them not unless proven to be dangerous in some way and it look as though they are 
 
 she harry and ron watched george into the bucket gulp down the rest of the chew and straighten up beaming with his arms wide to protracted applause 
 
 you know i get why fred and george only got three owls each said harry watching as fred george and lee collected gold from the eager crowd they really know their stuff 
 
 oh they only know flashy stuff of no real use to anyone said hermione disparagingly 
 
 no real use said ron in a strained voice hermione made about galleons already 
 
 it was a long while before the crowd around the weasley twins dispersed then fred lee and george sat up counting their takings even longer so it was well past midnight when harry ron and hermione finally had the common room to themselves at long last fred had closed the doorway to the boys dormitories behind him rattling his box of galleons ostentatiously so that hermione scowled harry who was making very little progress with his potions essay decided to give it up for the night as he put his books away ron who was dozing lightly in an armchair gave a muffled grunt awoke and looked blearily into the fire 
 
 sirius he said 
 
 harry whipped round untidy dark head was sitting in the fire again 
 
 hi he said grinning 
 
 hi chorused harry ron and hermione all three kneeling down on the hearthrug crookshanks purred loudly and approached the fire trying despite the heat to put his face close to 
 
 things said sirius 
 
 not that good said harry as hermione pulled crookshanks back to stop him singeing his whiskers the forced through another decree which means not allowed to have quidditch teams 
 
 or secret defence against the dark arts groups said sirius 
 
 there was a short pause 
 
 how did you know about that harry demanded 
 
 you want to choose your meeting places more carefully said sirius grinning still more broadly the head i ask you 
 
 well it was better than the three broomsticks said hermione defensively always packed with people 
 
 which means have been harder to overhear said sirius got a lot to learn hermione 
 
 who overheard us harry demanded 
 
 mundungus of course said sirius and when they all looked puzzled he laughed he was the witch under the veil 
 
 that was mundungus harry said stunned what was he doing in the head 
 
 what do you think he was doing said sirius impatiently keeping an eye on you of course 
 
 still being followed asked harry angrily 
 
 yeah you are said sirius and just as well it if the first thing going to do on your weekend off is organise an illegal defence group 
 
 but he looked neither angry nor worried on the contrary he was looking at harry with distinct pride 
 
 why was dung hiding from us asked ron sounding disappointed liked seen him 
 
 he was banned from the head twenty years ago said sirius and that got a long memory we lost spare invisibility cloak when sturgis was arrested so been dressing as a witch a lot lately anyway first of all sworn to pass on a message from your mother 
 
 oh yeah said ron sounding apprehensive 
 
 she says on no account whatsoever are you to take part in an illegal secret defence against the dark arts group she says be expelled for sure and your future will be ruined she says there will be plenty of time to learn how to defend yourself later and that you are too young to be worrying about that right now she also eyes turned to the other two advises harry and hermione not to proceed with the group though she accepts that she has no authority over either of them and simply begs them to remember that she has their best interests at heart she would have written all this to you but if the owl had been intercepted all have been in real trouble and she say it for herself because on duty tonight 
 
 on duty doing what said ron quickly 
 
 never you mind just stuff for the order said sirius so fallen to me to be the messenger and make sure you tell her i passed it all on because i think she trusts me to 
 
 there was another pause in which crookshanks mewing attempted to paw head and ron fiddled with a hole in the hearthrug 
 
 so you want me to say not going to take part in the defence group he muttered finally 
 
 me certainly not said sirius looking surprised i think an excellent idea 
 
 you do said harry his heart lifting 
 
 of course i do said sirius think your father and i lain down and taken orders from an old hag like umbridge 
 
 butlast term all you did was tell me to be careful and not take risks 
 
 last year all the evidence was that someone inside hogwarts was trying to kill you harry said sirius impatiently this year we know someone outside hogwarts like to kill us all so i think learning to defend yourselves properly is a very good idea 
 
 and if we do get expelled hermione asked a quizzical look on her face 
 
 hermione this whole thing was your idea said harry staring at her 
 
 i know it was i just wondered what sirius thought she said shrugging 
 
 well better expelled and able to defend yourselves than sitting safely in school without a clue said sirius 
 
 hear hear said harry and ron enthusiastically 
 
 so said sirius how are you organising this group where are you meeting 
 
 well a bit of a problem now said harry dunno where going to be able to go 
 
 how about the shrieking shack suggested sirius 
 
 hey an idea said ron excitedly but hermione made a sceptical noise and all three of them looked at her head turning in the flames 
 
 well sirius just that there were only four of you meeting in the shrieking shack when you were at school said hermione and all of you could transform into animals and i suppose you could all have squeezed under a single invisibility cloak if wanted to but there are of us and none of us is an animagus so we need so much an invisibility cloak as an invisibility marquee 
 
 fair point said sirius looking slightly crestfallen well sure come up with somewhere there used to be a pretty roomy secret passageway behind that big mirror on the fourth floor you might have enough space to practise jinxes in there 
 
 fred and george told me blocked said harry shaking his head caved in or something 
 
 oh said sirius frowning well have a think and get back to 
 
 he broke off his face was suddenly tense alarmed he turned sideways apparently looking into the solid brick wall of the fireplace 
 
 sirius said harry anxiously 
 
 but he had vanished harry gaped at the flames for a moment then turned to look at ron and hermione 
 
 why did he 
 
 hermione gave a horrified gasp and leapt to her feet still staring at the fire 
 
 a hand had appeared amongst the flames groping as though to catch hold of something a stubby hand covered in ugly rings 
 
 the three of them ran for it at the door of the boys dormitory harry looked back hand was still making snatching movements amongst the flames as though she knew exactly where hair had been moments before and was determined to seize it 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter seventeen a sluggish memorycontents prev chapter next chapter 
 late in the afternoon a few days after new year harry ron and ginny lined up beside the kitchen fire to return to hogwarts the ministry had arranged this connection to the floo network to return students quickly and safely to the school only mrs weasley was there to say as mr weasley fred george bill and fleur were all at work mrs weasley dissolved into tears at the moment of parting admittedly it took very little to set her off lately she had been crying on and off ever since percy had stormed from the house on christmas day with his glasses splattered with mashed parsnip for which fred george and ginny all claimed credit 
 
 cry mum said ginny patting her on the back as mrs weasley sobbed into her shoulder okay 
 
 yeah worry about us said ron permitting his mother to plant a very wet kiss on his cheek or about percy such a prat not really a loss is it 
 
 mrs weasley sobbed harder than ever as she enfolded harry in her arms 
 
 promise me look after yourself stay out of trouble 
 
 i always do mrs weasley said harry i like a quiet life you know me 
 
 she gave a watery chuckle and stood back 
 
 be good then all of you 
 
 harry stepped into the emerald fire and shouted hogwarts he had one last fleeting view of the weasleys kitchen and mrs tearful face before the flames engulfed him spinning very fast he caught blurred glimpses of other wizarding rooms which were whipped out of sight before he could get a proper look then he was slowing down finally stopping squarely in the fireplace in professor office she barely glanced up from her work as he clambered out over the grate 
 
 evening potter try not to get too much ash on the carpet 
 
 no professor 
 
 harry straightened his glasses and flattened his hair as ron came spinning into view when ginny had arrived all three of them trooped out of office and off toward gryffindor tower harry glanced out of the corridor windows as they passed the sun was already sinking over grounds carpeted in deeper snow than had lain over the burrow garden in the distance he could see hagrid feeding buckbeak in front of his cabin 
 
 baubles said ron confidently when they reached the fat lady who was looking rather paler than usual and winced at his loud voice 
 
 no she said 
 
 what mean no 
 
 there is a new password she said and please shout 
 
 but been away we supposed to 
 
 harry ginny 
 
 hermione was hurrying toward them very and wearing a cloak hat and gloves 
 
 i got back a couple of hours ago just been down to visit hagrid and bucki mean witherwings she said breathlessly did you have a good christmas 
 
 yeah said ron at once pretty eventful rufus scrim 
 
 got something for you harry said hermione neither looking at ron nor giving any sign that she had heard him oh hang onpassword abstinence 
 
 precisely said the fat lady in a feeble voice and swung forward to reveal the portrait hole 
 
 up with her asked harry 
 
 overindulged over christmas apparently said hermione rolling her eyes as she led the way into the packed common room she and her friend violet drank their way through all the wine in that picture of drunk monks down by the charms corridor anyway 
 
 she rummaged in her pocket for a moment then pulled out a scroll of parchment with writing on it 
 
 great said harry unrolling it at once to discover that his next lesson with dumbledore was scheduled for the following night got loads to tell himand you sit down 
 
 but at that moment there was a loud squeal of and lavender brown came hurtling out of nowhere and flung herself into arms several onlookers sniggered hermione gave a tinkling laugh and said a table over here coming ginny 
 
 no thanks i said meet dean said ginny though harry could not help noticing that she did not sound very enthusiastic leaving ron and lavender locked in a kind of vertical wrestling match harry led hermione over to the spare table 
 
 so how was your christmas 
 
 oh fine she shrugged nothing special how was it at 
 
 tell you in a minute said harry look hermione you 
 
 no i she said flatly so even ask 
 
 i thought maybe you know over christmas 
 
 it was the fat lady who drank a vat of wine harry not me so what was this important news you wanted to tell me 
 
 she looked too fierce to argue with at that moment so harry dropped the subject of ron and recounted all that he had overheard between malfoy and snape 
 
 when he had finished hermione sat in thought for a moment and then said you think 
 
 he was pretending to offer help so that he could trick malfoy into telling him what doing 
 
 well yes said hermione 
 
 dad and lupin think so harry said grudgingly but this definitely proves planning something you deny that 
 
 no i she answered slowly 
 
 and acting on orders just like i said 
 
 hmm did either of them actually mention name 
 
 harry frowned trying to remember 
 
 not sure snape definitely said your master and who else would that be 
 
 i know said hermione biting her lip maybe his father 
 
 she stared across the room apparently lost in thought not even noticing lavender tickling ron lupin 
 
 not great said harry and he told her all about mission among the werewolves and the difficulties he was facing have you heard of this fenrir greyback 
 
 yes i have said hermione sounding startled and so have you harry 
 
 when history of magic you know full well i never listened 
 
 no no not history of magic malfoy threatened borgin with him said hermione back in knockturn alley you remember he told borgin that greyback was an old family friend and that be checking up on progress 
 
 harry gaped at her i forgot but this proves malfoy is a death eater how else could he be in contact with greyback and telling him what to do 
 
 it is pretty suspicious breathed hermione unless 
 
 oh come on said harry in exasperation you get round this one 
 
 well there is the possibility it was an empty threat 
 
 unbelievable you are said harry shaking his head see right be eating your words hermione just like the ministry oh yeah i had a row with rufus scrimgeour as well 
 
 and the rest of the evening passed amicably with both of them abusing the minister of magic for hermione like ron thought that after all the ministry had put harry through the previous year they had a great deal of nerve asking him for help now 
 
 the new term started next morning with a pleasant surprise for the a large sign had been pinned to the common room notice boards overnight 
 
 apparition lessons 
 
 if you are seventeen years of age or will turn seventeen on or before the st august next you are eligible for a course of apparition lessons from a ministry of magic apparition instructor 
 
 please sign below if you would like to participate 
 
 cost galleons 
 
 harry and ron joined the crowd that was jostling around the notice and taking it in turns to write their names at the bottom ron was just taking out his quill to sign after hermione when lavender crept up behind him slipped her hands over his eyes and trilled guess who harry turned to see hermione stalking off he caught up with her having no wish to stay behind with ron and lavender but to his surprise ron caught up with them only a little way beyond the portrait hole his ears bright red and his expression disgruntled without a word hermione sped up to walk with neville 
 
 soapparition said ron his tone making it perfectly plain that harry was not to mention what had just happened should be a laugh eh 
 
 i dunno said harry maybe better when you do it yourself i enjoy it much when dumbledore took me along for the ride 
 
 i forgot already done it better pass my test first time said ron looking anxious fred and george did 
 
 charlie failed though he 
 
 yeah but bigger than me ron held his arms out from his body as though he was a gorilla so fred and george go on about it much not to his face anyway 
 
 when can we take the actual test 
 
 soon as seventeen only march for me 
 
 yeah but you be able to apparate in here not in the castle 
 
 not the point is it everyone would know i could apparate if i wanted 
 
 ron was not the only one to be excited at the prospect of apparition all that day there was much talk about the forthcoming lessons a great deal of store was set by being able to vanish and reappear at will 
 
 how cool will it be when we can just seamus clicked his ringers to indicate disappearance me cousin fergus does it just to annoy me you wait till i can do it back never have another peaceful moment 
 
 lost in visions of this happy prospect he flicked his wand a little too enthusiastically so that instead of producing the fountain of pure water that was the object of charms lesson he let out a hoselike jet that ricocheted off the ceiling and knocked professor flitwick flat on his face 
 
 already apparated ron told a slightly abashed seamus after professor flitwick had dried himself off with a wave of his wand and set seamus lines i am a wizard not a baboon brandishing a stick dumersomeone took him you know 
 
 whoa whispered seamus and he dean and neville put their heads a little closer to hear what apparition felt like for the rest of the day harry was besieged with requests from the other sixth years to describe the sensation of apparition all of them seemed awed rather than put off when he told them how uncomfortable it was and he was still answering detailed questions at ten to eight that evening when he was forced to lie and say that he needed to return a book to the library so as to escape in time for his lesson with dumbledore 
 
 the lamps in office were lit the portraits of previous headmasters were snoring gently in their frames and the pensieve was ready upon the desk once more hands lay on either side of it the right one as blackened and as ever it did not seem to have healed at all and harry wondered for perhaps the hundredth time what had caused such a distinctive injury but did not ask dumbledore had said that he would know eventually and there was in any case another subject he wanted to discuss but before harry could say anything about snape and malfoy dumbledore spoke 
 
 i hear that you met the minister of magic over christmas 
 
 yes said harry not very happy with me 
 
 no sighed dumbledore he is not very happy with me either we must try not to sink beneath our anguish harry but battle on 
 
 harry grinned 
 
 he wanted me to tell the wizarding community that the doing a wonderful job 
 
 dumbledore smiled 
 
 it was idea originally you know during his last days in office when he was trying desperately to cling to his post he sought a meeting with you hoping that you would give him your support 
 
 after everything fudge did last year said harry angrily after umbridge 
 
 i told cornelius there was no chance of it but the idea did not die when he left office within hours of appointment we met and he demanded that i arrange a meeting with you 
 
 so why you argued harry blurted out it was in the daily prophet 
 
 the prophet is bound to report the truth occasionally said dumbledore if only accidentally yes that was why we argued well it appears that rufus found a way to corner you at last 
 
 he accused me of being man through and through 
 
 how very rude of him 
 
 i told him i was 
 
 dumbledore opened his mouth to speak and then closed it again behind harry fawkes the phoenix let out a low soft musical cry to intense embarrassment he suddenly realized that bright blue eyes looked rather watery and stared hastily at his own knees when dumbledore spoke however his voice was quite steady 
 
 i am very touched harry 
 
 scrimgeour wanted to know where you go when not at hogwarts said harry still looking fixedly at his knees 
 
 yes he is very nosy about that said dumbledore now sounding cheerful and harry thought it safe to look up again he has even attempted to have me followed amusing really he set dawlish to tail me it kind i have already been forced to jinx dawlish once i did it again with the greatest regret 
 
 so they still know where you go asked harry hoping for more information on this intriguing subject but dumbledore merely smiled over the top of his spectacles 
 
 no they and the time is not quite right for you to know either now i suggest we press on unless anything else 
 
 there is actually sir said harry about malfoy and snape 
 
 professor snape harry 
 
 yes sir i overheard them during professor party well i followed them actually 
 
 dumbledore listened to story with an impassive face when harry had finished he did not speak for a few moments then said thank you for telling me this harry but i suggest that you put it out of your mind i do not think that it is of great importance 
 
 not of great importance repeated harry incredulously professor did you understand 
 
 yes harry blessed as i am with extraordinary brainpower i understood everything you told me said dumbledore a little sharply i think you might even consider the possibility that i understood more than you did again i am glad that you have confided in me but let me reassure you that you have not told me anything that causes me disquiet 
 
 harry sat in seething silence glaring at dumbledore what was going on did this mean that dumbledore had indeed ordered snape to find out what malfoy was doing in which case he had already heard everything harry had just told him from snape or was he really worried by what he had heard but pretending not to be 
 
 so sir said harry in what he hoped was a polite calm voice you definitely still trust 
 
 i have been tolerant enough to answer that question already said dumbledore but he did not sound very tolerant anymore my answer has not changed 
 
 i should think not said a snide voice phineas nigellus was evidently only pretending to be asleep dumbledore ignored him 
 
 and now harry i must insist that we press on i have more important things to discuss with you this evening 
 
 harry sat there feeling mutinous how would it be if he refused to permit the change of subject if he insisted upon arguing the case against malfoy as though he had read mind dumbledore shook his head 
 
 ah harry how often this happens even between the best of friends each of us believes that what he has to say is much more important than anything the other might have to contribute 
 
 i think what got to say is unimportant sir said harry stiffly 
 
 well you are quite right because it is not said dumbledore briskly i have two more memories to show you this evening both obtained with enormous difficulty and the second of them is i think the most important i have collected 
 
 harry did not say anything to this he still felt angry at the reception his confidences had received but could not see what was to be gained by arguing further 
 
 so said dumbledore in a ringing voice we meet this evening to continue the tale of tom riddle whom we left last lesson poised on the threshold of his years at hogwarts you will remember how excited he was to hear that he was a wizard that he refused my company on a trip to diagon alley and that i in turn warned him against continued thievery when he arrived at school 
 
 well the start of the school year arrived and with it came tom riddle a quiet boy in his robes who lined up with the other first years to be sorted he was placed in slytherin house almost the moment that the sorting hat touched his head continued dumbledore waving his blackened hand toward the shelf over his head where the sorting hat sat ancient and unmoving how soon riddle learned that the famous founder of the house could talk to snakes i do not know perhaps that very evening the knowledge can only have excited him and increased his sense of 
 
 however if he was frightening or impressing fellow slytherins with displays of parseltongue in their common room no hint of it reached the staff he showed no sign of outward arrogance or aggression at all as an unusually talented and very orphan he naturally drew attention and sympathy from the staff almost from the moment of his arrival he seemed police quiet and thirsty for knowledge nearly all were most favorably impressed by him 
 
 you tell them sir what been like when you met him at the orphanage asked harry 
 
 no i did not though he had shown no hint of remorse it was possible that he felt sorry for how he had behaved before and was resolved to turn over a fresh leaf i chose to give him that chance 
 
 dumbledore paused and looked inquiringly at harry who had opened his mouth to speak here again was tendency to trust people in spite of overwhelming evidence that they did not deserve it but then harry remembered something 
 
 but you really trust him sir did you he told me the riddle who came out of that diary said dumbledore never seemed to like me as much as the other teachers did 
 
 let us say that i did not take it for granted that he was trustworthy said dumbledore i had as i have already indicated resolved to keep a close eye upon him and so i did i cannot pretend that i gleaned a great deal from my observations at first he was very guarded with me he felt i am sure that in the thrill of discovering his true identity he had told me a little too much he was careful never to reveal as much again but he could not take back what he had let slip in his excitement nor what mrs cole had confided in me however he had the sense never to try and charm me as he charmed so many of my colleagues 
 
 as he moved up the school he gathered about him a group of dedicated friends i call them that for want of a better term although as i have already indicated riddle undoubtedly felt no affection for any of them this group had a kind of dark glamour within the castle they were a motley collection a mixture of the weak seeking protection the ambitious seeking some shared glory and the thuggish gravitating toward a leader who could show them more refined forms of cruelty in other words they were the forerunners of the death eaters and indeed some of them became the first death eaters after leaving hogwarts 
 
 rigidly controlled by riddle they were never detected in open although their seven years at hogwarts were marked by a number of nasty incidents to which they were never satisfactorily linked the most serious of which was of course the opening of the chamber of secrets which resulted in the death of a girl as you know hagrid was wrongly accused of that crime 
 
 i have not been able to find many memories of riddle at hogwarts said dumbledore placing his withered hand on the pensieve few who knew him then are prepared to talk about him they are too terrified what i know i found out after he had left hogwarts after much painstaking effort after tracing those few who could be tricked into speaking after searching old records and questioning muggle and wizard witnesses alike 
 
 those whom i could persuade to talk told me that riddle was obsessed with his parentage this is understandable of course he had grown up in an orphanage and naturally wished to know how he came to be there it seems that he searched in vain for some trace of tom riddle senior on the shields in the trophy room on the lists of prefects in the old school records even in the books of wizarding history finally he was forced to accept that his father had never set foot in hogwarts i believe that it was then that he dropped the name forever assumed the identity of lord voldemort and began his investigations into his previously despised familythe woman whom you will remember he had thought could not be a witch if she had succumbed to the shameful human weakness of death 
 
 all he had to go upon was the single name marvolo which he knew from those who ran the orphanage had been his name finally after painstaking research through old books of wizarding families he discovered the existence of surviving line in the summer of his sixteenth year he left the orphanage to which he returned annually and set off to find his gaunt relatives and now harry if you will stand 
 
 dumbledore rose and harry saw that he was again holding a small crystal bottle filled with swirling pearly memory 
 
 i was very lucky to collect this he said as he poured the gleaming mass into the pensieve as you will understand when we have experienced it shall we 
 
 harry stepped up to the stone basin and bowed obediently until his face sank through the surface of the memory he felt the familiar sensation of falling through nothingness and then landed upon a dirty stone floor in almost total darkness 
 
 it took him several seconds to recognize the place by which time dumbledore had landed beside him the gaunts house was now more indescribably filthy than anywhere harry had ever seen the ceiling was thick with cobwebs the floor coated in grime moldy and rotting food lay upon the table amidst a mass of crusted pots the only light came from a single guttering candle placed at the feet of a man with hair and beard so overgrown harry could see neither eyes nor mouth he was slumped in an armchair by the fire and harry wondered for a moment whether he was dead but then there came a loud knock on the door and the man jerked awake raising a wand in his right hand and a short knife in his left 
 
 the door creaked open there on the threshold holding an lamp stood a boy harry recognized at once tall pale and handsomethe teenage voldemort 
 
 eyes moved slowly around the hovel and then found the man in the armchair for a few seconds they looked at each other then the man staggered upright the many empty bottles at his feet clattering and tinkling across the floor 
 
 you he bellowed you 
 
 and he hurtled drunkenly at riddle wand and knife held aloft 
 
 stop 
 
 riddle spoke in parseltongue the man skidded into the table sending moldy pots crashing to the floor he stared at riddle there was a long silence while they contemplated each other the man broke it 
 
 you speak it 
 
 yes i speak it said riddle he moved forward into the room allowing the door to swing shut behind him harry could not help but feel a resentful admiration for complete lack of fear his race merely expressed disgust and perhaps disappointment 
 
 where is marvolo he asked 
 
 dead said the other died years ago he 
 
 riddle frowned 
 
 who are you then 
 
 morfin i 
 
 son 
 
 course i am then 
 
 morfin pushed the hair out of his dirty face the better to see riddle and harry saw that he wore ring on his right hand 
 
 i thought you was that muggle whispered morfin you look mighty like that muggle 
 
 what muggle said riddle sharply 
 
 that muggle what my sister took a fancy to that muggle what lives in the big house over the way said morfin and he spat unexpectedly upon the floor between them you look right like him riddle but older now e you now i think on it 
 
 morfin looked slightly dazed and swayed a little still clutching the edge of the table for support 
 
 he come back see he added stupidly 
 
 voldemort was gazing at morfin as though appraising his possibilities now he moved a little closer and said riddle came back 
 
 ar he left her and serve her right marrying filth said morfin spitting on the floor again robbed us mind before she ran off the locket eh locket 
 
 voldemort did not answer morfin was working himself into a rage again he brandished his knife and shouted dishonored us she did that little slut and you coming here and asking questions about all that over innit over 
 
 he looked away staggering slightly and voldemort moved forward as he did so an unnatural darkness fell extinguishing lamp and candle extinguishing everything fingers closed tightly around arm and they were soaring back into the present again the soft golden light in office seemed to dazzle eyes after that impenetrable darkness 
 
 is that all said harry at once why did it go dark what happened 
 
 because morfin could not remember anything from that point onward said dumbledore gesturing harry back into his seat when he awoke next morning he was lying on the floor quite alone ring had gone 
 
 meanwhile in the village of little hangleton a maid was running along the high street screaming that there were three bodies lying in the drawing room of the big house tom riddle senior and his mother and father 
 
 the muggle authorities were perplexed as far as i am aware they do not know to this day how the riddles died for the avada kedavra curse does not usually leave any sign of damage the exception sits before me dumbledore added with a nod to scar the ministry on the other hand knew at once that this was a murder they also knew that a convicted lived across the valley from the riddle house a who had already been imprisoned once for attacking one of the murdered people 
 
 so the ministry called upon morfin they did not need to question him to use veritaserum or legilimency he admitted to the murder on the spot giving details only the murderer could know he was proud he said to have killed the muggles had been awaiting his chance all these years he handed over his wand which was proved at once to have been used to kill the riddles and he permitted himself to be led off to azkaban without a fight all that disturbed him was the fact that his fathers ring had disappeared kill me for losing it he told his captors over and over again kill me for losing his ring and that apparently was all he ever said again he lived out the remainder of his life in azkaban lamenting the loss of last heirloom and is buried beside the prison alongside the other poor souls who have expired within its walls 
 
 so voldemort stole wand and used it said harry sitting up straight 
 
 right said dumbledore we have no memories to show us this but i think we can be fairly sure what happened voldemort stupefied his uncle took his wand and proceeded across the valley to the big house over the way there he murdered the muggle man who had abandoned his witch mother and for good measure his muggle grandparents thus obliterating the last of the unworthy riddle line and revenging himself upon the father who never wanted him then he returned to the gaunt hovel performed the complex bit of magic that would implant a false memory in his mind laid wand beside its unconscious owner pocketed the ancient ring he wore and departed 
 
 and morfin never realized he done it 
 
 never said dumbledore he gave as i say a full and boastful confession 
 
 but he had this real memory in him all the time 
 
 yes but it took a great deal of skilled legilimency to coax it out of him said dumbledore and why should anybody delve further into mind when he had already confessed to the crime however i was able to secure a visit to morfin in the last weeks of his life by which time i was attempting to discover as much as i could about past i extracted this memory with difficulty when i saw what it contained i attempted to use it to secure release from azkaban before the ministry reached their decision however morfin had died 
 
 but how come the ministry realize that voldemort had done all that to morfin harry asked angrily he was underage at the time he i thought they could detect underage magic 
 
 you are quite rightthey can detect magic but not the perpetrator you will remember that you were blamed by the ministry for the hover charm that was in fact cast by 
 
 dobby growled harry this injustice still rankled so if underage and you do magic inside an adult witch or house the ministry know 
 
 they will certainly be unable to tell who performed the magic said dumbledore smiling slightly at the look of great indignation on face they rely on witch and wizard parents to enforce their obedience while within their walls 
 
 well rubbish snapped harry look what happened here look what happened to morfin 
 
 i agree said dumbledore whatever morfin was he did not deserve to die as he did blamed for murders he had not committed but it is getting late and i want you to see this other memory before we part 
 
 dumbledore took from an inside pocket another crystal phial and harry fell silent at once remembering that dumbledore had said it was the most important one he had collected harry noticed that the contents proved difficult to empty into the pensieve as though they had congealed slightly did memories go bad 
 
 this will not take long said dumbledore when he had finally emptied the phial we shall be back before you know it once more into the pensieve then 
 
 and harry fell again through the silver surface landing this time right in front of a man he recognized at once 
 
 it was a much younger horace slughorn harry was so used to him bald that he found the sight of slughorn with thick shiny hair quite disconcerting it looked as though he had had his head thatched though there was already a shiny bald patch on his crown his mustache less massive than it was these days was he was not quite as rotund as the slughorn harry knew though the golden buttons on his richly embroidered waistcoat were taking a fair amount of strain his little feet resting upon a velvet pouffe he was sitting well back in a comfortable winged armchair one hand grasping a small glass of wine the other searching through a box of crystalized pineapple 
 
 harry looked around as dumbledore appeared beside him and saw that they were standing in office half a dozen boys were sitting around slughorn all on harder or lower seats than his and all in their harry recognized voldemort at once his was the most handsome face and he looked the most relaxed of all the boys his right hand lay negligently upon the arm of his chair with a jolt harry saw that he was wearing ring he had already killed his father 
 
 sir is it true that professor merrythought is retiring he asked 
 
 tom tom if i knew i tell you said slughorn wagging a reproving finger at riddle though ruining the effect slightly by winking i must say like to know where you get your information boy more knowledgeable than half the staff you are 
 
 riddle smiled the other boys laughed and cast him admiring looks 
 
 what with your uncanny ability to know things you and your careful flattery of the people who matterthank you for the pineapple by the way quite right it is my favorite 
 
 as several of the boys tittered something very odd happened the whole room was suddenly filled with a thick white fog so that harry could see nothing but the face of dumbledore who was standing beside him then voice rang out through the mist unnaturally loudly go wrong boy mark my words 
 
 the fog cleared as suddenly as it had appeared and yet nobody made any allusion to it nor did anybody look as though anything unusual had just happened bewildered harry looked around as a small golden clock standing upon desk chimed eleven 
 
 good gracious is it that time already said slughorn better get going boys or all be in trouble lestrange i want your essay by tomorrow or detention same goes for you avery 
 
 slughorn pulled himself out of his armchair and carried his empty glass over to his desk as the boys filed out voldemort however stayed behind harry could tell he had dawdled deliberately wanting to be last in the room with slughorn 
 
 look sharp tom said slughorn turning around and finding him still present you want to be caught out of bed out of hours and you a prefect 
 
 sir i wanted to ask you something 
 
 ask away then ask away 
 
 sir i wondered what you know about about horcruxes 
 
 and it happened all over again the dense fog filled the room so that harry could not see slughorn or voldemort at all only dumbledore smiling serenely beside him then voice boomed out again just as it had done before 
 
 i know anything about horcruxes and i tell you if i did now get out of here at once and let me catch you mentioning them again 
 
 well that said dumbledore placidly beside harry time to go 
 
 and feet left the floor to fall seconds later back onto the rug in front of desk 
 
 all there is said harry blankly 
 
 dumbledore had said that this was the most important memory of all but he could not see what was so significant about it admittedly the fog and the fact that nobody seemed to have noticed it was odd but other than that nothing seemed to have happened except that voldemort had asked a question and failed to get an answer 
 
 as you might have noticed said dumbledore reseating himself behind his desk that memory has been tampered with 
 
 tampered with repeated harry sitting back down too 
 
 certainly said dumbledore professor slughorn has meddled with his own recollections 
 
 but why would he do that 
 
 because i think he is ashamed of what he remembers said dumbledore he has tried to rework the memory to show himself in a better light obliterating those parts which he does not wish me to see it is as you will have noticed very crudely done and that is all to the good for it shows that the true memory is still there beneath the alterations 
 
 and so for the first time i am giving you homework harry it will be your job to persuade professor slughorn to divulge the real memory which will undoubtedly be our most crucial piece of information of all 
 
 harry stared at him 
 
 but surely sir he said keeping his voice as respectful as possible you need meyou could use legilimency or veritaserum 
 
 professor slughorn is an extremely able wizard who will be expecting both said dumbledore he is much more accomplished at occlumency than poor morfin gaunt and i would be astonished if he has not carried an antidote to veritaserum with him ever since i coerced him into giving me this travesty of a recollection 
 
 no i think it would be foolish to attempt to wrest the truth from professor slughorn by force and might do much more harm than good i do not wish him to leave hogwarts however he has his weaknesses like the rest of us and i believe that you are the one person who might be able to penetrate his defenses it is most important that we secure the true memory harry how important we will only know when we have seen the real thing so good luck and goodnight 
 
 a little taken aback by the abrupt dismissal harry got to his feet quickly good night sir 
 
 as he closed the study door behind him he distinctly heard phineas nigellus say i see why the boy should be able to do it better than you dumbledore 
 
 i expect you to phineas replied dumbledore and fawkes gave another low musical cry 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the half blood prince 
 

lionfish nov chapter seventeen bathildas secretcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 harry stop 
 
 whats wrong 
 
 they had only just reached the grave of the unknown abbott 
 
 theres someone there someone watching us i can tell there over by the bushes 
 
 they stood quite still holding on to each other gazing at the dense black boundary of the graveyard harry could not see anything 
 
 are you sure 
 
 i saw something move i could have sworn i did 
 
 she broke from him to free her wand arm 
 
 we look like muggles harry pointed out 
 
 muggles whove just been laying flowers on your parents grave harry im sure theres someone over there 
 
 harry thought of a history of magic the graveyard was supposed to be haunted what if c but then he heard a rustle and saw a little eddy of dislodged snow in the bush to which hermione had pointed ghosts could not move snow 
 
 its a cat said harry after a second or two or a bird if it was a death eater wed be dead by now but lets get out of here and we can put the cloak back on 
 
 they glanced back repeatedly as they made their way out of the graveyard harry who did not feel as sanguine as he had pretended when reassuring hermione was glad to reach the gate and the slippery pavement they pulled the invisibility cloak back over themselves the pub was fuller than before many voices inside it were now singing the carol that they had heard as they approached the church for a moment harry considered suggesting they take refuge inside it but before he could say anything hermione murmured lets go this way and pulled him down the dark street leading out of the village in the opposite direction from which they had entered harry could make out the point where the cottages ended and the lane turned into open country again they walked as quickly as they dared past more windows sparkling with multicolored lights the outlines of christmas trees dark through the curtains 
 
 how are we going to find bathildas house asked hermione who was shivering a little and kept glancing back over her shoulder harry what do you think harry 
 
 she tugged at this arm but harry was not paying attention he was looking toward the dark mass that stood at the very end of this row of houses next moment he sped up dragging hermione along with him she slipped a little on the ice 
 
 harry c 
 
 look look at it hermione 
 
 i dont oh 
 
 he could see it the fidelius charm must have died with james and lily the hedge had grown wild in the sixteen years since hagrid had taken harry from the rubble that lay scattered amongst the grass most of the cottage was still standing though entirely covered in the dark ivy and snow but the right side of the top floor had been blown apart that harry was sure was where the curse had backfired he and hermione stood at the gate gazing up at the wreck of what must once have been a cottage just like those that flanked it 
 
 i wonder why nobodys ever rebuilt it whispered hermione 
 
 maybe you cant rebuild it harry replied maybe its like the injuries from dark magic and you cant repair the damage 
 
 he slipped a hand from beneath the cloak and grasped the snowy and thickly rusted gate not wishing to open it but simply so hed some part of the house 
 
 youre not going to go inside it looks unsafe it might c oh harry look 
 
 his touch on the gate seemed to have done it a sign had risen out of the ground in front of them up thorough the tangles of nettles and weeds like some bizarre flower and in golden letters upon the wood it said 
 
 on this spot on this night of october lily and james potter lost their lives their son harry remains the only wizard ever to have survived the killing curse this house invisible to muggles has been left in its ruined state as a monument to the potters and as a reminder of the violence that tore apart their family 
 
 and all around these neatly lettered words scribbles had been added by other witches and wizards who had come to see the place where the boy who lived had escaped some had merely signed their names in everlasting ink others had carved their initials into the wood still others had left messages the most recent of these shining brightly over sixteen years worth of magical graffiti all said similar things 
 
 good luck harry wherever you are 
 
 if you read this harry were all behind you 
 
 long live harry potter 
 
 they shouldnt have written on the sign said hermione indignant 
 
 but harry beamed at her 
 
 its brilliant im glad they did i 
 
 he broke off a heavily muffled figure was hobbling up the lane toward them silhouetted by the bright lights in the distant square harry thought though it was hard to judge that the figure was a woman she was moving slowly possibly frightened of slipping on the snowy ground her stoop her stoutness her shuffling gait all gave an impression of extreme age they watched in silence as she drew nearer harry was waiting to see whether she would turn into any of the cottages she was passing but he knew instinctively that she would not at last she came to a halt a few yards from them and simply stood there in the middle of the frozen road facing them 
 
 he did not need hermiones pinch to his arm there was next to no chance that this woman was a muggle she was standing there gazing at a house that ought to have been completely invisible to her if she was not a witch even assuming that she was a witch however it was odd behavior to come out on a night this cold simply to look at an old ruin by all the rules of normal magic meanwhile she ought not to be able to see hermione and him at all nevertheless harry had the strangest feeling that she knew that they were there and also who they were just as he had reached this uneasy conclusion she raised a gloved hand and beckoned 
 
 hermione moved closer to him under the cloak her arm pressed against his 
 
 how does she know 
 
 he shook his head the woman beckoned again more vigorously harry could think of many reasons not to obey the summons and yet his suspicions about her identity were growing stronger every moment that they stood facing each other in the deserted street 
 
 was it possible that she had been waiting for them all these long months that dumbledore had told her to wait and that harry would come in the end was it not likely that it was she who had moved in the shadows in the graveyard and had followed them to this spot even her ability to sense them suggested some power that he had never encountered before 
 
 finally harry spoke causing hermione to gasp and jump 
 
 are you bathilda 
 
 the muffled figure nodded and beckoned again 
 
 beneath the cloak harry and hermione looked at each other harry raised his eyebrows hermione gave a tiny nervous nod 
 
 they stepped toward the woman and at once she turned and hobbled off back the way they had come leading them past several houses she turned in at a gate they followed her up the front path through a garden nearly as overgrown as the one they had just left she fumbled for a moment with a key at the front door then opened it and stepped back to let them pass 
 
 she smelled bad or perhaps it was her house harry wrinkled his nose as they sidled past her and pulled off the cloak now that he was beside her he realized how tiny she was bowed down with age she came barely level with his chest she closed the door behind them her knuckles blue and mottled against the peeling paint then turned and peered into harrys face her eyes were thick with cataracts and sunken into folds of transparent skin and her whole face was dotted with broken veins and liver spots he wondered whether she could make him out at all even if she could it was the balding muggle whose identity he had stolen that she would see 
 
 the odor of old age of dust of unwashed clothes and stale food intensified as the unwound a black shawl revealing a head of scant white hair through which the scalp showed clearly 
 
 bathilda harry repeated 
 
 she nodded again harry became aware of the locket against his skin the thing inside it that sometimes ticked or beat had woken he could feel it pulsing through the cold gold did it know could it sense that the thing that would destroy it was near 
 
 bathilda shuffled past them pushing hermione aside as though she had not seen her and vanished into what seemed to be a sitting room 
 
 harry im not sure about this breathed hermione 
 
 look at the size of her i think we could overpower her if we had to said harry listen i should have told you i knew she wasnt all there muriel called her gaga 
 
 come called bathilda from the next room 
 
 hermione jumped and clutched harrys arm 
 
 its okay said harry reassuringly and he led the way into the sitting room 
 
 bathilda was tottering around the place lighting candles but it was still very dark not to mention extremely dirty thick dust crunched beneath their feet and harrys nose detected underneath the dank and mildewed smell something worse like meat gone bad he wondered when was the last time anyone had been inside bathildas house to check whether she was coping she seemed to have forgotten that she could do magic too for she lit the candles clumsily by hand her trailing lace cuff in constant danger of catching fire 
 
 let me do that offered harry and he took the matches from her she stood watching him as he finished lighting the candle stubs that stood on saucers around the room perched precariously on stacks of books and on side tables crammed with cracked and moldy cups 
 
 the last surface on which harry spotted a candle was a chest of drawers on which there stood a large number of photographs when the flame danced into life its reflection wavered on their dusty glass and silver he saw a few tiny movements from the pictures as bathilda fumbled with logs for the fire he muttered tergeo the dust vanished from the photographs and he saw at once that half a dozen were missing from the largest and most ornate frames he wondered whether bathilda or somebody else had removed them then the sight of a photograph near the back of the collection caught his eye and he snatched it up 
 
 it was the thief the young man who had perched on gregorovitchs windowsill smiling lazily up at harry out of the silver frame and it came to harry instantly where he had seen the boy before in the life and lies of albus dumbledore arm in arm with the teenage dumbledore and that must be where all the missing photographs were in ritas book 
 
 mrs c miss c bagshot he said and his voice shook slightly who is this 
 
 bathilda was standing in the middle of the room watching hermione light the fire for her 
 
 miss bagshot harry repeated and he advanced with the picture in his hands as the flames burst into life in the fireplace bathilda looked up at his voice and the horcrux beat faster upon his chest 
 
 who is this person harry asked her pushing the picture forward 
 
 she peered at it solemnly then up at harry 
 
 do you know who this is he repeated in a much slower and louder voice than usual this man do you know him whats he called 
 
 bathilda merely looked vague harry felt an awful frustration how had rita skeeter unlocked bathildas memories 
 
 who is this man he repeated loudly 
 
 harry what area you doing asked hermione 
 
 this picture hermione its the thief the thief who stole from gregorovitch please he said to bathilda who is this 
 
 but she only stared at him 
 
 why did you ask us to come with you mrs c miss c bagshot asked hermione raising her own voice was there something you wanted to tell us 
 
 giving no sign that she had heard hermione bathilda now shuffled a few steps closer to harry with a little jerk of her head she looked back into the hall 
 
 you want us to leave he asked 
 
 she repeated the gesture this time pointing firstly at him then at herself then at the ceiling 
 
 oh right hermione i think she wants me to go upstairs with her 
 
 all right said hermione lets go 
 
 but when hermione moved bathilda shook her head with surprising vigor once more pointing first at harry then to herself 
 
 she wants me to go with her alone 
 
 why asked hermione and her voice rang out sharp and clear in the candlelit room the old lady shook her head a little at the loud noise 
 
 maybe dumbledore told her to give the sword to me and only to me 
 
 do you really think she knows who you are 
 
 yes said harry looking down into the milky eyes fixed upon his own i think she does 
 
 well okay then but be quick harry 
 
 lead the way harry told bathilda 
 
 she seemed to understand because she shuffled around him toward the door harry glanced back at hermione with a reassuring smile but he was not sure she had seen it she stood hugging herself in the midst of the candlelit squalor looking toward the bookcase as harry walked out of the room unseen by both hermione and bathilda he slipped the photograph of the unknown thief inside his jacket 
 
 the stairs were steep and narrow harry was half tempted to place his hands on stout bathildas backside to ensure that she did not topple over backward on top of him which seemed only too likely slowly wheezing a little she climbed to the upper landing turned immediately right and led him into a bedroom 
 
 it was and smelled horrible harry had just made out a chamber pot protruding from under the bed before bathilda closed the door and even that was swallowed by the darkness 
 
 lumos said harry and his wand ignited he gave a start bathilda had moved close to him in those few seconds of darkness and he had not heard her approach 
 
 you are potter she whispered 
 
 yes i am 
 
 she nodded slowly solemnly harry felt the horcrux beating fast faster than his own heart it was an unpleasant agitating sensation 
 
 have you got anything for me harry asked but she seemed distracted by his lit 
 
 have you got anything for me he repeated 
 
 then she closed her eyes and several things happened at once harrys scar prickled painfully the horcrux twitched so that the front of his sweater actually moved the dark fetid room dissolved momentarily he felt a leap of joy and spoke in a high cold voice hold him 
 
 harry swayed where he stood the dark room seemed to close around him again he did not know what had just happened 
 
 have you got anything for me he asked for a third time much louder 
 
 over here she whispered pointing to the corner harry raised his wand and saw the outline of a cluttered dressing table beneath the curtained window 
 
 this time she did not lead him harry edged between her and the unmade bed his wand raised he did not want to look away from her 
 
 what is it he asked as he reached the dressing table which was heaped high with what looked and smelled like dirty laundry 
 
 there she said pointing at the shapeless mass 
 
 and in the instant that he looked away his eyes taking the tangled mess for a sword hilt a ruby she moved weirdly he saw it out of the corner of his eye panic made him turn and horror paralyzed him as he saw the old body collapsing and the great snake pouring from the place where her neck had been 
 
 the snake struck as he raised his wand the force of the bite to his forearm sent the wand spinning up toward the ceiling its light swung dizzyingly around the room and was extinguished then a powerful blow from the tail to his midriff knocked the breath out of him he fell backward onto the dressing table into the mound of filthy clothing c 
 
 he rolled sideways narrowly avoiding the snakes tail which thrashed down upon the table where he had been a second earlier fragments of the glass surface rained upon him as he hit the floor from below he heard hermione call harry 
 
 he could not get enough breath into his lungs to call back then a heavy smooth mass smashed him to the floor and he felt it slide over him powerful muscular c 
 
 no he gasped pinned to the floor 
 
 yes whispered the voice yesss hold you hold you 
 
 accio accio wand 
 
 but nothing happened and he needed his hands to try to force the snake from him as it coiled itself around his torso squeezing the air from him pressing the horcrux hard into his chest a circle of ice that throbbed with life inches from his own frantic heart and his brain was flooding with cold white light all thought obliterated his own breath drowned distant footsteps everything going 
 
 a metal heart was banging outside his chest and now he was flying flying with triumph in his heart without need of broomstick or thestral 
 
 he was abruptly awake in the darkness nagini had released him he scrambled up and saw the snake outlined against the landing light it struck and hermione dived aside with a shriek her deflected curse hit the curtained window which shattered frozen air filled the room as harry ducked to avoid another shower of broken glass and his foot slipped on a something c his wand c 
 
 he bent and snatched it up but now the room was full of the snake its tail thrashing hermione was nowhere to be seen and for a moment harry thought the worst but then there was a loud bang and a flash of red light and the snake flew into the air smacking harry hard in the face as it went coil after heavy coil rising up to the ceiling harry raised his wand but as he did so his scar seared more painfully more powerfully than it had done in years 
 
 hes coming hermione hes coming 
 
 as he yelled the snake fell hissing wildly everything was chaos it smashed shelves from the wall and splintered china flew everywhere as harry jumped over the bed and seized the dark shape he knew to be hermione c 
 
 she shrieked with pain as he pulled her back across the bed the snake reared again but harry knew that worse than the snake was coming was perhaps already at the gate his head was going to split open with the pain from his scar c 
 
 the snake lunged as he took a running leap dragging hermione with him as it struck hermione screamed confringo and her spell flew around the room exploding the wardrobe mirror and ricocheting back at them bouncing from floor to ceiling harry felt the heat of it sear the back of his hand glass cut his cheek as pulling hermione with him he leapt from bed to broken dressing table and then straight out of the smashed window into nothingness her scream reverberating through the night as they twisted in midair 
 
 and then his scar burst open and he was voldemort and he was running across the fetid bedroom his long white hands clutching at the windowsill as he glimpsed the bald man and the little woman twist and vanish and he screamed with rage a scream that mingled with the girls that echoed across the dark gardens over the church bells ringing in christmas day 
 
 and his scream was harrys scream his pain was harrys pain that it could happen here where it had happened before here within sight of that house where he had come so close to knowing what it was to die to die the pain was so terrible ripped from his body but if he had no body why did his head hurt so badly if he was dead how cold he feel so unbearably didnt pain cease with death didnt it go 
 
 the night wet and windy two children dressed as pumpkins waddling across the square and the shop windows covered in paper spiders all the tawdry muggle trappings of a world in which they did not believe and he was gliding along that sense of purpose and power and rightness in him that he always knew on these occasions not anger that was for weaker souls than he but triumph yes he had waited for this he had hoped for it 
 
 nice costume mister 
 
 he saw the small boys smile falter as he ran near enough to see beneath the hood of the cloak saw the fear cloud his pained face then the child turned and ran away beneath the robe he fingered the handle of his wand one simple movement and the child would never reach his mother but unnecessary quite unnecessary 
 
 and along a new and darker street he moved and now his destination was in sight at last the fidelius charm broken though they did not know it yet and he made less noise than the dead leaves slithering along the pavement as he drew level with the dark hedge and steered over it 
 
 they had not drawn the curtains he saw them quite clearly in their little sitting room the tall man in his glasses making puffs of colored smoke erupt from his wand for the amusement of the small boy in his blue pajamas the child was laughing and trying to catch the smoke to grab it in his small fist 
 
 a door opened and the mother entered saying words he cold not hear her long hair falling over her face now the father scooped up the son and handed him to the mother he threw his wand down upon the sofa and stretched yawning 
 
 the gate creaked a little as he pushed it open but james potter did not hear his white hand pulled out the wand beneath his cloak and pointed it at the door which burst open 
 
 he was over the threshold as james came sprinting into the hall it was easy too easy he had not even picked up his wand 
 
 lily take harry and go its him go run ill hold him off 
 
 hold him off without a wand in his hand he laughed before casting the curse 
 
 avada kedavra 
 
 the green light filled the cramped hallway it lit the pram pushed against the wall it made the banisters glow like lighting rods and james potter fell like a marionette whose strings were cut 
 
 he could hear her screaming from the upper floor trapped but as long as she was sensible she at least had nothing to fear he climbed the steps listening with faint amusement to her attempts to barricade herself in she had no wand upon her either how stupid they were and how trusting thinking that their safety lay in friends that weapons could be discarded even for moments 
 
 he forced the door open cast aside the chair and boxes hastily piled against it with one lazy wave of his wand and there she stood the child in her arms at the sight of him she dropped her son into the crib behind her and threw her arms wide as if this would help as if in shielding him from sight she hoped to be chosen instead 
 
 not harry not harry please not harry 
 
 stand aside you silly girl stand aside now 
 
 not harry please no take me kill me instead c 
 
 this is my last warning c 
 
 not harry please have mercy have mercy not harry not harry please c ill do anything 
 
 stand aside stand aside girl 
 
 he could have forced her away from the crib but it seemed more prudent to finish them all 
 
 the green light flashed around the room and she dropped like her husband the child had not cried all this time he could stand clutching the bars of his crib and he looked up into the intruders face with a kind of bright interest perhaps thinking that it was his father who hid beneath the cloak making more pretty lights and his mother would pop up any moment laughing c 
 
 he pointed the wand very carefully into the boys face he wanted to see it happen the destruction of this one inexplicable danger the child began to cry it had seen that he was not james he did not like it crying he had never been able to stomach the small ones whining in the orphanage c 
 
 avada kedavra 
 
 and then he broke he was nothing nothing but pain and terror and he must hide himself not here in the rubble of the ruined house where the child was trapped screaming but far away far away 
 
 no he moaned 
 
 the snake rustled on the filthy cluttered floor and he had killed the boy and yet he was the boy 
 
 no 
 
 and now he stood at the broken window of bathildas house immersed in memories of his greatest loss and at his feet the great snake slithered over broken china and glass he looked down and saw something something incredible 
 
 no 
 
 harry its all right youre all right 
 
 he stooped down and picked up the smashed photograph there he was the unknown thief the thief he was seeking 
 
 no i dropped it i dropped it 
 
 harry its okay wake up wake up 
 
 he was harry harry not voldemort and the thing that was rustling was not a snake he opened his eyes 
 
 harry hermione whispered do you feel all c all right 
 
 yes he lied 
 
 he was in the tent lying on one of the lower bunks beneath a heap of blankets he could tell that it was almost dawn by the stillness and quality of the cold flat light beyond the canvas ceiling he was drenched in sweat he could feel it on the sheets and blankets 
 
 we got away 
 
 yes said hermione i had to use a hover charm to get you into your bunk i couldnt lift you youve been well you havent been quite 
 
 there were purple shadows under her brown eyes and he noticed a small sponge in her hand she had been wiping his face 
 
 youve been ill she finished quite ill 
 
 how long ago did we leave 
 
 hours ago its nearly morning 
 
 and ive been what unconscious 
 
 not exactly said hermione uncomfortably youve been shouting and moaning and things she added in a tone that made harry feel uneasy what had he done screamed curses like voldemort cried like the baby in the crib 
 
 i couldnt get the horcrux off you hermione said and he knew she wanted to change the subject it was stuck stuck to your chest youve got a mark im sorry i had to use a severing charm to get it away the snake hit you too but ive cleaned the wound and put some dittany on it 
 
 he pulled the sweaty he was wearing away from himself and looked down there was a scarlet oval over his heart where the locket had burned him he could also see the half healed puncture marks to his forearm 
 
 whereve you put the horcrux 
 
 in my bag i think we should keep it off for a while 
 
 he lay back on his pillows and looked into her pinched gray face 
 
 we shouldnt have gone to godrics hollow its my fault its all my fault hermione im sorry 
 
 its not you fault i wanted to go too i really thought dumbledore might have left the sword there for you 
 
 yeah well we got that wrong didnt we 
 
 what happened harry what happened when she took you upstairs was the snake hiding somewhere did it just come out and kill her and attack you 
 
 no he said she was the snake or the snake was her all along 
 
 
 
 he closed his eyes he could still smell bathildas house on him it made the whole thing horribly vivid 
 
 bathilda mustve been dead a while the snake was was inside her put it there in godrics hollow to wait you were right he knew id go back 
 
 the snake was inside her 
 
 he opened his eyes again hermione looked revolted nauseated 
 
 lupin said there would be magic wed never imagined harry said she didnt want to talk in front of you because it was parseltongue all parseltongue and i didnt realize but of course i could understand her once we were up in the room the snake sent a message to i heard it happen inside my head i felt him get excited he said to keep me there and then 
 
 he remembered the snake coming out of bathildas neck hermione did not need to know the details 
 
 she changed changed into the snake and attacked 
 
 he looked down at the puncture marks 
 
 it wasnt supposed to kill me just keep me there till came 
 
 if he had only managed to kill the snake it would have been worth it all of it sick at heart he sat up and threw back the covers 
 
 harry no im sure you ought to rest 
 
 youre the one who needs sleep no offense but you look terrible im fine ill keep watch for a while wheres my wand 
 
 she did not answer she merely looked at him 
 
 wheres my wand hermione 
 
 she was biting her lip and tears swam in her eyes 
 
 harry 
 
 wheres my wand 
 
 she reached down beside the bed and held it out to him 
 
 the holly and phoenix wand was nearly severed in two one fragile strand of phoenix feather kept both pieces hanging together the wood had splintered apart completely harry took it into his hands as though it was a living thing that had suffered a terrible injury he could not think properly everything was a blur of panic and fear then he held out the want to hermione 
 
 mend it please 
 
 harry i dont think when its broken like this c 
 
 please hermione try 
 
 
 
 the dangling half of the wand resealed itself harry held it up 
 
 lumos 
 
 the wand sparked feebly then went out harry pointed it at hermione 
 
 expelliarmus 
 
 hermiones wand gave a little jerk but did not leave her hand the feeble attempt at magic was too much for harrys wand which split into two again he stared at it aghast unable to take in what he was seeing the wand that had survived so much 
 
 harry hermione whispered so quietly he could hardly hear her im so so sorry i think it was me as we were leaving you know the snake was coming for us and so i cast a blasting curse and it rebounded everywhere and it must have c must have hit c 
 
 it was an accident said harry mechanically he felt empty stunned well c well find a way to repair it 
 
 harry i dont think were going to be able to said hermione the ears trickling down her face remember remember ron when he broke his wand crashing the car it was never the same again he had to get a new one 
 
 harry thought of ollivander kidnapped and held hostage by voldemort of gregorovitch who was dead how was he supposed to find himself a new wand 
 
 well he said in a falsely voice well ill just borrow yours for now then while i keep watch 
 
 her face glazed with tears hermione handed over her wand and he left her sitting beside his bed desiring nothing more than to get away from her

 a domestic drama please said little anna for the others 
 are so fond of that do you know one 
 
 i know a hundred said grandpapa those that are most in 
 favor are from the french but they are not good for little girls 
 in the meantime we may take one of the prettiest for inside 
 all very much alike now i shake the pen so 
 now the play new now listen to the 
 
 
 and grandpapa took a newspaper and read as if he were reading 
 from it 
 the and the good head

 miss glove a daughter mr de boots a suitor 
 and now going to begin the curtain rises we have no

 now listen to what the waistcoat says little anna said 
 grandpapa now the speaking the waistcoat has a 
 laydown collar and is very modest but he knows his own value and 
 has quite a right to say what he says 
 
 i a spot on me goodness of material ought to be 
 appreciated i am of real silk and have strings to me 
 
 on the wedding day but no longer you keep your color 
 in the wash this is mr who is speaking mr de boots 
 is of strong leather and yet very delicate he can 
 creak and clank with his spurs and has an italian physiognomy 
 but they ought to speak in verses said anna for heard 
 the most charming way of all 
 
 they can do that too replied grandpapa and if the public 
 demands it they will talk in that way just look at little miss 
 glove how pointing her fingers 
 could i but have my love 
 who then so happy as glove 
 ah 
 if i from him must part 
 sure twill break my heart

 i see heigho 
 and therefore crow 
 kikkeriki in the lofty hall 
 now comes the exciting part little anna this is the most 
 important in all the play mr waistcoat undoes himself and addresses his speech to you that you may applaud but leave it alone considered more genteel 
 
 i am driven to extremities take care of yourself now comes the 
 plot you are the and i am the good head snap there you

 and now the old replies 
 though all ear 
 very stupid i appear 
 my humor gone i fear 
 and i feel my hollow not here 
 ah never my dear 
 did i feel so queer 
 oh pray let me out 
 and like a lamb led to slaughter 
 betroth you no doubt 
 to my daughter 
 is the play over already asked little anna 
 by no means replied grandpapa only all over with mr 
 de boots now the lovers kneel down and one of them sings 
 father 
 and the other 
 come do as you ought to do 
 bless your son and daughter 
 and they receive his blessing and celebrate their wedding and all 
 the pieces of furniture sing in chorus 
 klink clanks 
 a thousand thanks 
 and now the play is over 
 and now applaud said grandpapa call them all out 
 and the pieces of furniture too for they are of mahogany 
 
 and is not our play just as good as those which the others have 
 in the real theatre 
 
 our play is much better said grandpapa it is shorter the 
 performers are natural and it has passed away the interval before

 and jams it under his chin his head snaps back as the wall goes red his swivel chair does a slow and creaks to a final stop troopers rise slowly gazing in horror

 red 
 but there are times i curse him for the dreams he left behind 
 he senses a presence looks over his shoulder a rita 
 hayworth poster on his wall he gets out of bed rita just 
 keeps smiling inscrutable as red watches a brilliant round glow builds behind the poster shining from the tunnel the poster rips free charred to ash in the blink of an eye as a shaft of holy white light stabs into the cell sunlight red staggers back against the glare 
 a whirlwind kicks up whipping everything into the air the hole in the wall is like a giant vacuum cleaner papers book toiletries bedding if it nailed down it gets sucked down the hole toward the light red fights it but the suction drags him closer and closer 
 pov 
 and camera rockets into the hole getting sucked down an endless tunnel at impossible speed the roar of air mixing with his scream closer and closer to the light 
 and erupting out the other side into total silence and a beautiful white beach the pacific ocean before us enormous beautiful beyond description all we hear now are the gentle sound of waves 
 red 
 dreams where i am lost in a warm place with no memory 
 a lone figure stands at edge camera keeps moving 
 coming up behind him and tracking around to reveal red 
 red 
 an ocean so big it strikes me dumb waves so quiet they strike me deaf sunshine so bright it strikes me blind it is a place that is blue 
 beyond reason bluer than can possibly exist bluer than my mind 
 can possibly grasp 
 aerial shot 
 nothing for a million miles but beach sky and water red is a tiny speck at edge just another grain of sand

 book friends of the a b c 
 chapter iii 
 
 marius astonishments 
 in a few days marius had become friend 
 youth is the season for prompt welding and the rapid healing of scars marius breathed freely in society a decidedly new thing for him 
 courfeyrac put no questions to him 
 he did not even think of such a thing 
 at that age faces disclose everything on the spot 
 words are superfluous 
 there are young men of whom it can be said that their countenances chatter 
 one looks at them and one knows them 
 one morning however courfeyrac abruptly addressed this interrogation to him 
 by the way have you any political opinions 
 the idea said marius almost affronted by the question 
 what are you 
 a 
 the gray hue of a reassured rat said courfeyrac 
 on the following day courfeyrac introduced marius at the cafe musain then he whispered in his ear with a smile 
 i must give you your entry to the revolution 
 and he led him to the hall of the friends of the a b c he presented him to the other comrades saying this simple word which marius did not understand 
 a pupil 
 marius had fallen into a of wits 
 however although he was silent and grave he was none the less both winged and armed 
 marius up to that time solitary and inclined to soliloquy and to asides both by habit and by taste was a little fluttered by this covey of young men around him 
 all these various initiatives solicited his attention at once and pulled him about the tumultuous movements of these minds at liberty and at work set his ideas in a whirl 
 sometimes in his trouble they fled so far from him that he had difficulty in recovering them he heard them talk of philosophy of literature of art of history of religion in unexpected fashion 
 he caught glimpses of strange aspects and as he did not place them in proper perspective he was not altogether sure that it was not chaos that he grasped on abandoning his opinions for the opinions of his father he had supposed himself fixed he now suspected with uneasiness and without daring to avow it to himself that he was not the angle at which he saw everything began to be displaced anew a certain oscillation set all the horizons of his brains in motion an odd internal upsetting 
 he almost suffered from it 
 it seemed as though there were no consecrated things for those young men 
 marius heard singular propositions on every sort of subject which embarrassed his still timid mind 
 a theatre poster presented itself adorned with the title of a tragedy from the ancient repertory called classic 
 down with tragedy dear to the bourgeois cried bahorel 
 and marius heard combeferre reply 
 you are wrong bahorel 
 the bourgeoisie loves tragedy and the bourgeoisie must be left at peace on that score bewigged tragedy has a reason for its existence and i am not one of those who by order of aeschylus contest its right to existence there are rough outlines in nature there are in creation parodies a beak which is not a beak wings which are not wings gills which are not gills paws which are not paws a cry of pain which arouses a desire to laugh there is the duck now since poultry exists by the side of the bird i do not see why classic tragedy should not exist in the face of antique tragedy 
 or chance decreed that marius should traverse rue rousseau between enjolras and courfeyrac 
 courfeyrac took his arm 
 pay attention 
 this is the rue platriere now called rue rousseau on account of a singular household which lived in it sixty years ago 
 this consisted of and therese from time to time little beings were born there 
 therese gave birth to them represented them as foundlings 
 and enjolras addressed courfeyrac roughly 
 silence in the presence of i admire that man he denied his own children that may be but he adopted the people 
 not one of these young men articulated the word 
 the emperor jean prouvaire alone sometimes said napoleon all the others said bonaparte 
 enjolras pronounced it buonaparte 
 marius was vaguely surprised

 in the tavern before which stood the covered cart there were already some five officers mary hendrikhovna a plump little blonde german in a dressing jacket and nightcap was sitting on a broad bench in the front corner her husband the doctor lay asleep behind her rostov and ilyin on entering the room were welcomed with merry shouts and laughter 
 dear me how jolly we are said rostov laughing 
 and why do you stand there gaping 
 what swells they are why the water streams from them make our drawing room so wet 
 mess mary dress cried other voices 
 rostov and ilyin hastened to find a corner where they could change into dry clothes without offending mary modesty they were going into a tiny recess behind a partition to change but found it completely filled by three officers who sat playing cards by the light of a solitary candle on an empty box and these officers would on no account yield their position mary hendrikhovna obliged them with the loan of a petticoat to be used as a curtain and behind that screen rostov and ilyin helped by lavrushka who had brought their kits changed their wet things for dry ones 
 a fire was made up in the dilapidated brick stove a board was found fixed on two saddles and covered with a horsecloth a small samovar was produced and a cellaret and half a bottle of rum and having asked mary hendrikhovna to preside they all crowded round her one offered her a clean handkerchief to wipe her charming hands another spread a jacket under her little feet to keep them from the damp another hung his coat over the window to keep out the draft and yet another waved the flies off her face lest he should wake up 
 leave him alone said mary hendrikhovna smiling timidly and happily he is sleeping well as it is after a sleepless night 
 oh no mary hendrikhovna replied the officer one must look after the doctor perhaps take pity on me someday when it comes to cutting off a leg or an arm for me 
 there were only three tumblers the water was so muddy that one could not make out whether the tea was strong or weak and the samovar held only six tumblers of water but this made it all the pleasanter to take turns in order of seniority to receive tumbler from mary plump little hands with their short and not overclean nails all the officers appeared to be and really were in love with her that evening even those playing cards behind the partition soon left their game and came over to the samovar yielding to the general mood of courting mary hendrikhovna she seeing herself surrounded by such brilliant and polite young men beamed with satisfaction try as she might to hide it and perturbed as she evidently was each time her husband moved in his sleep behind her 
 there was only one spoon sugar was more plentiful than anything else but it took too long to dissolve so it was decided that mary hendrikhovna should stir the sugar for everyone in turn rostov received his tumbler and adding some rum to it asked mary hendrikhovna to stir it 
 but you take it without sugar she said smiling all the time as if everything she said and everything the others said was very amusing and had a double meaning 
 it is not the sugar i want but only that your little hand should stir my tea 
 mary hendrikhovna assented and began looking for the spoon which someone meanwhile had pounced on 
 use your finger mary hendrikhovna it will be still nicer said rostov 
 too hot she replied blushing with pleasure 
 ilyin put a few drops of rum into the bucket of water and brought it to mary hendrikhovna asking her to stir it with her finger 
 this is my cup said he only dip your finger in it and drink it all up 
 when they had emptied the samovar rostov took a pack of cards and proposed that they should play kings with mary hendrikhovna they drew lots to settle who should make up her set at suggestion it was agreed that whoever became king should have the right to kiss mary hand and that the booby should go to refill and reheat the samovar for the doctor when the latter awoke 
 well but supposing mary hendrikhovna is king asked ilyin 
 as it is she is queen and her word is law 
 they had hardly begun to play before the disheveled head suddenly appeared from behind mary hendrikhovna he had been awake for some time listening to what was being said and evidently found nothing entertaining or amusing in what was going on his face was sad and depressed without greeting the officers he scratched himself and asked to be allowed to pass as they were blocking the way as soon as he had left the room all the officers burst into loud laughter and mary hendrikhovna blushed till her eyes filled with tears and thereby became still more attractive to them returning from the yard the doctor told his wife who had ceased to smile so happily and looked at him in alarm awaiting her sentence that the rain had ceased and they must go to sleep in their covered cart or everything in it would be stolen 
 but send an orderly two of them said rostov what an idea doctor 
 stand guard on it myself said ilyin 
 no gentlemen you have had your sleep but i have not slept for two nights replied the doctor and he sat down morosely beside his wife waiting for the game to end 
 seeing his gloomy face as he frowned at his wife the officers grew still merrier and some of them could not refrain from laughter for which they hurriedly sought plausible pretexts when he had gone taking his wife with him and had settled down with her in their covered cart the officers lay down in the tavern covering themselves with their wet cloaks but they did not sleep for a long time now they exchanged remarks recalling the uneasiness and his delight now they ran out into the porch and reported what was taking place in the covered trap several times rostov covering his head tried to go to sleep but some remark would arouse him and conversation would be resumed to the accompaniment of unreasoning merry childlike laughter

 book friends of the a b c 
 chapter iv 
 
 the back room of the cafe musain 
 one of the conversations among the young men at which marius was present and in which he sometimes joined was a veritable shock to his mind 
 this took place in the back room of the cafe musain 
 nearly all the friends of the a b c had convened that evening 
 the argand lamp was solemnly lighted 
 they talked of one thing and another without passion and with noise 
 with the exception of enjolras and marius who held their peace all were haranguing rather at conversations between comrades sometimes are subject to these peaceable tumults 
 it was a game and an uproar as much as a conversation 
 they tossed words to each other and caught them up in turn 
 they were chattering in all quarters 
 no woman was admitted to this back room except louison the of the cafe who passed through it from time to time to go to her washing in the lavatory 
 grantaire thoroughly drunk was deafening the corner of which he had taken possession reasoning and contradicting at the top of his lungs and shouting 
 i am thirsty 
 mortals i am dreaming 
 that the tun of heidelberg has an attack of apoplexy and that i am one of the dozen leeches which will be applied to it 
 i want a drink 
 i desire to forget life life is a hideous invention of i know not whom 
 it lasts no time at all and is worth nothing 
 one breaks neck in living life is a theatre set in which there are but few practicable entrances happiness is an antique reliquary painted on one side only ecclesiastes says 
 all is vanity 
 i agree with that good man who never existed perhaps 
 zero not wishing to go stark naked clothed himself in vanity 
 o vanity 
 the patching up of everything with big words a kitchen is a laboratory a dancer is a professor an acrobat is a gymnast a boxer is a pugilist an apothecary is a chemist a wigmaker is an artist a hodman is an architect a jockey is a sportsman a is a pterigybranche 
 vanity has a right and a wrong side the right side is stupid it is the negro with his glass beads the wrong side is foolish it is the philosopher with his rags 
 i weep over the one and i laugh over the other what are called honors and dignities and even dignity and honor are generally of pinchbeck 
 kings make playthings of human pride caligula made a horse a consul charles ii 
 made a knight of a sirloin 
 wrap yourself up now then between consul incitatus and baronet roastbeef 
 as for the intrinsic value of people it is no longer respectable in the least 
 listen to the panegyric which neighbor makes of neighbor 
 white on white is ferocious if the lily could speak what a setting down it would give the dove a bigoted woman prating of a devout woman is more venomous than the asp and the cobra 
 it is a shame that i am ignorant otherwise i would quote to you a mass of things but i know nothing for instance i have always been witty when i was a pupil of gros instead of daubing wretched little pictures i passed my time in pilfering apples rapin is the masculine of rapine 
 so much for myself as for the rest of you you are worth no more than i am i scoff at your perfections excellencies and qualities every good quality tends towards a defect economy borders on avarice the generous man is next door to the prodigal the brave man rubs elbows with the braggart he who says very pious says a trifle bigoted there are just as many vices in virtue as there are holes in diogenes cloak 
 whom do you admire the slain or the slayer caesar or brutus 
 generally men are in favor of the slayer long live brutus he has slain 
 there lies the virtue 
 virtue granted but madness also 
 there are queer spots on those great men the brutus who killed caesar was in love with the statue of a little boy this statue was from the hand of the greek sculptor strongylion who also carved that figure of an amazon known as the beautiful leg eucnemos which nero carried with him in his travels 
 this strongylion left but two statues which placed nero and brutus in accord brutus was in love with the one nero with the other 
 all history is nothing but wearisome repetition 
 one century is the plagiarist of the other 
 the battle of marengo copies the battle of pydna the tolbiac of clovis and the austerlitz of napoleon are as like each other as two drops of water 
 i attach much importance to victory nothing is so stupid as to conquer true glory lies in convincing but try to prove something 
 if you are content with success what mediocrity and with conquering what wretchedness 
 alas vanity and cowardice everywhere 
 everything obeys success even grammar si volet usus says horace 
 therefore i disdain the human race shall we descend to the party at all 
 do you wish me to begin admiring the peoples 
 what people if you please 
 shall it be greece the athenians those parisians of days gone by slew phocion as we might say coligny and fawned upon tyrants to such an extent that anacephorus said of pisistratus 
 his urine attracts the bees the most prominent man in greece for fifty years was that grammarian philetas who was so small and so thin that he was obliged to load his shoes with lead in order not to be blown away by the wind there stood on the great square in corinth a statue carved by silanion and catalogued by pliny this statue represented episthates what did episthates do 
 he invented a trip 
 that sums up greece and glory 
 let us pass on to others 
 shall i admire england shall i admire france 
 france 
 why 
 because of paris 
 i have just told you my opinion of athens 
 england 
 why 
 because of london i hate carthage 
 and then london the metropolis of luxury is the headquarters of wretchedness 
 there are a hundred deaths a year of hunger in the parish of alone 
 such is albion i add as the climax that i have seen an englishwoman dancing in a wreath of roses and blue spectacles 
 a fig then for england if i do not admire john bull shall i admire brother jonathan i have but little taste for that brother 
 take away time is money what remains of england 
 take away cotton is king what remains of america 
 germany is the lymph italy is the bile shall we go into ecstasies over russia 
 voltaire admired it 
 he also admired china 
 i admit that russia has its beauties among others a stout despotism but i pity the despots 
 their health is delicate a decapitated alexis a poignarded peter a strangled paul another paul crushed flat with kicks divers ivans strangled with their throats cut numerous nicholases and basils poisoned all this indicates that the palace of the emperors of russia is in a condition of flagrant insalubrity 
 all civilized peoples offer this detail to the admiration of the thinker war now war civilized war exhausts and sums up all the forms of ruffianism from the brigandage of the trabuceros in the gorges of mont jaxa to the marauding of the comanche indians in the doubtful pass bah you will say to me but europe is certainly better than asia i admit that asia is a farce but i do not precisely see what you find to laugh at in the grand lama you peoples of the west who have mingled with your fashions and your elegances all the complicated filth of majesty from the dirty chemise of queen isabella to the of the dauphin 
 gentlemen of the human race i tell you not a bit of it 
 it is at brussels that the most beer is consumed at stockholm the most brandy at madrid the most chocolate at amsterdam the most gin at london the most wine at constantinople the most coffee at paris the most absinthe there are all the useful notions 
 paris carries the day in short in paris even the are sybarites diogenes would have loved to be a of the place maubert better than to be a philosopher at the piraeus 
 learn this in addition the wineshops of the ragpickers are called bibines the most celebrated are the saucepan and the hence goguettes caboulots bouibuis mastroquets bastringues manezingues bibines of the caravanseries of the caliphs i certify to you i am a voluptuary i eat at at forty sous a head i must have persian carpets to roll naked cleopatra in 
 where is cleopatra 
 ah 
 so it is you louison 
 good day 
 the slang term for a assistant 
 thus did grantaire more than intoxicated launch into speech catching at the in her passage from his corner in the back room of the cafe musain 
 bossuet extending his hand towards him tried to impose silence on him and grantaire began again worse than ever 
 aigle de meaux down with your paws 
 you produce on me no effect with your gesture of hippocrates refusing artaxerxes i excuse you from the task of soothing me 
 moreover i am sad what do you wish me to say to you 
 man is evil man is deformed the butterfly is a success man is a failure 
 god made a mistake with that animal 
 a crowd offers a choice of ugliness the first comer is a wretch with infame infamous 
 yes i have the spleen complicated with melancholy with homesickness plus hypochondria and i am vexed and i rage and i yawn and i am bored and i am tired to death and i am stupid let god go to the devil 
 silence then capital r resumed bossuet who was discussing a point of law behind the scenes and who was plunged more than waist high in a phrase of judicial slang of which this is the conclusion 
 and as for me although i am hardly a legist and at the most an amateur attorney i maintain this 
 that in accordance with the terms of the customs of normandy at and for each year an equivalent must be paid to the profit of the lord of the manor saving the rights of others and by all and several the proprietors as well as those seized with inheritance and that for all emphyteuses leases freeholds contracts of domain mortgages 
 echo plaintive nymph hummed grantaire 
 near grantaire an almost silent table a sheet of paper an inkstand and a pen between two glasses of brandy announced that a vaudeville was being sketched out 
 this great affair was being discussed in a low voice and the two heads at work touched each other 
 let us begin by finding names when one has the names one finds the subject 
 that is true 
 dictate 
 i will write 
 monsieur dorimon 
 an independent gentleman 
 of course 
 his daughter celestine 
 tine 
 what next 
 colonel sainval 
 sainval is stale 
 i should say valsin 
 beside the vaudeville aspirants another group which was also taking advantage of the uproar to talk low was discussing a duel an old fellow of thirty was counselling a young one of eighteen and explaining to him what sort of an adversary he had to deal with 
 the deuce 
 look out for yourself 
 he is a fine swordsman 
 his play is neat 
 he has the attack no wasted feints wrist dash lightning a just parade mathematical parries bigre and he is 
 in the angle opposite grantaire joly and bahorel were playing dominoes and talking of love 
 you are in luck that you are joly was saying 
 you have a mistress who is always laughing 
 that is a fault of hers returned bahorel 
 mistress does wrong to laugh 
 that encourages one to deceive her 
 to see her gay removes your remorse if you see her sad your conscience pricks you 
 ingrate a woman who laughs is such a good thing 
 and you never quarrel 
 that is because of the treaty which we have made 
 on forming our little holy alliance we assigned ourselves each our frontier which we never cross 
 what is situated on the side of winter belongs to vaud on the side of the wind to gex 
 hence the peace 
 peace is happiness digesting 
 and you jolllly where do you stand in your entanglement with mamselle you know whom i mean 
 she sulks at me with cruel patience 
 yet you are a lover to soften the heart with gauntness 
 alas 
 in your place i would let her alone 
 that is easy enough to say 
 and to do 
 is not her name musichetta 
 yes 
 ah my poor bahorel she is a superb girl very literary with tiny feet little hands she dresses well and is white and dimpled with the eyes of a i am wild over her 
 my dear fellow then in order to please her you must be elegant and produce effects with your knees 
 buy a good pair of trousers of cloth at that will assist 
 at what price shouted grantaire 
 the third corner was delivered up to a poetical discussion pagan mythology was giving battle to christian mythology the question was about olympus whose part was taken by jean prouvaire out of pure romanticism 
 jean prouvaire was timid only in repose 
 once excited he burst forth a sort of mirth accentuated his enthusiasm and he was at once both laughing and lyric 
 let us not insult the gods said he 
 the gods may not have taken their departure 
 jupiter does not impress me as dead the gods are dreams you say 
 well even in nature such as it is after the flight of these dreams we still find all the grand old pagan myths 
 such and such a mountain with the profile of a citadel like the vignemale for example is still to me the headdress of cybele it has not been proved to me that pan does not come at night to breathe into the hollow trunks of the willows stopping up the holes in turn with his fingers and i have always believed that io had something to do with the cascade of pissevache 
 in the last corner they were talking politics 
 the charter which had been granted was getting roughly handled 
 combeferre was upholding it weakly 
 courfeyrac was energetically making a breach in it on the table lay an unfortunate copy of the famous touquet charter courfeyrac had seized it and was brandishing it mingling with his arguments the rattling of this sheet of paper 
 in the first place i have any kings if it were only from an economical point of view i want any a king is a parasite 
 one does not have kings gratis 
 listen to this the dearness of kings 
 at the death of francois i the national debt of france amounted to an income of thirty thousand livres at the death of louis xiv 
 it was two milliards six hundred millions at livres the mark which was equivalent in according to desmarets to four milliards five hundred millions which would be equivalent to twelve milliards 
 in the second place and no offence to combeferre a charter granted is but a poor expedient of civilization 
 to save the transition to soften the passage to deaden the shock to cause the nation to pass insensibly from the monarchy to democracy by the practice of constitutional detestable reasons all those are no no let us never enlighten the people with false daylight principles dwindle and pale in your constitutional cellar no illegitimacy no compromise no grant from the king to the people in all such grants there is an article 
 by the side of the hand which gives there is the claw which snatches back 
 i refuse your charter a charter is a mask the lie lurks beneath it a people which accepts a charter abdicates 
 the law is only the law when entire 
 no no charter 
 it was winter a couple of fagots were crackling in the fireplace this was tempting and courfeyrac could not resist 
 he crumpled the poor touquet charter in his fist and flung it in the fire the paper flashed up 
 combeferre watched the masterpiece of louis xviii burn philosophically and contented himself with saying 
 the charter metamorphosed into flame 
 and sarcasms sallies jests that french thing which is called entrain and that english thing which is called humor good and bad taste good and bad reasons all the wild pyrotechnics of dialogue mounting together and crossing from all points of the room produced a sort of merry bombardment over their heads

 chapter xiv 
 
 it was nearly three but no one was yet asleep when the quartermaster appeared with an order to move on to the little town of ostrovna still laughing and talking the officers began hurriedly getting ready and again boiled again boiled some muddy water in the samovar but rostov went off to his squadron without waiting for tea day was breaking the rain had ceased and the clouds were dispersing it felt damp and cold especially in clothes that were still moist as they left the tavern in the twilight of the dawn rostov and ilyin both glanced under the wet and glistening leather hood of the cart from under the apron of which his feet were sticking out and in the middle of which his nightcap was visible and her sleepy breathing audible 
 she really is a dear little thing said rostov to ilyin who was following him 
 a charming woman said ilyin with all the gravity of a boy of sixteen 
 half an hour later the squadron was lined up on the road the command was heard to mount and the soldiers crossed themselves and mounted rostov riding in front gave the order forward and the hussars with clanking sabers and subdued talk their horses hoofs splashing in the mud defiled in fours and moved along the broad road planted with birch trees on each side following the infantry and a battery that had gone on in front 
 tattered clouds reddening in the east were scudding before the wind it was growing lighter and lighter that curly grass which always grows by country roadsides became clearly visible still wet with the rain the drooping branches of the birches also wet swayed in the wind and flung down bright drops of water to one side the soldiers faces were more and more clearly visible rostov always closely followed by ilyin rode along the side of the road between two rows of birch trees 
 when campaigning rostov allowed himself the indulgence of riding not a regimental but a cossack horse a judge of horses and a sportsman he had lately procured himself a large fine mettlesome donets horse with light mane and tail and when he rode it no one could outgallop him to ride this horse was a pleasure to him and he thought of the horse of the morning of the wife but not once of the impending danger 
 formerly when going into action rostov had felt afraid now he had not the least feeling of fear he was fearless not because he had grown used to being under fire one cannot grow used to danger but because he had learned how to manage his thoughts when in danger he had grown accustomed when going into action to think about anything but what would seem most likely to interest him the impending danger during the first period of his service hard as he tried and much as he reproached himself with cowardice he had not been able to do this but with time it had come of itself now he rode beside ilyin under the birch trees occasionally plucking leaves from a branch that met his hand sometimes touching his side with his foot or without turning round handing a pipe he had finished to an hussar riding behind him with as calm and careless an air as though he were merely out for a ride he glanced with pity at the excited face of ilyin who talked much and in great agitation he knew from experience the tormenting expectation of terror and death the cornet was suffering and knew that only time could help him 
 as soon as the sun appeared in a clear strip of sky beneath the clouds the wind fell as if it dared not spoil the beauty of the summer morning after the storm drops still continued to fall but vertically now and all was still the whole sun appeared on the horizon and disappeared behind a long narrow cloud that hung above it a few minutes later it reappeared brighter still from behind the top of the cloud tearing its edge everything grew bright and glittered and with that light and as if in reply to it came the sound of guns ahead of them 
 before rostov had had time to consider and determine the distance of that firing count adjutant came galloping from vitebsk with orders to advance at a trot along the road 
 the squadron overtook and passed the infantry and the battery which had also quickened their pace rode down a hill and passing through an empty and deserted village again ascended the horses began to lather and the men to flush 
 halt dress your ranks the order of the regimental commander was heard ahead forward by the left walk march came the order from in front 
 and the hussars passing along the line of troops on the left flank of our position halted behind our uhlans who were in the front line to the right stood our infantry in a dense column they were the reserve higher up the hill on the very horizon our guns were visible through the wonderfully clear air brightly illuminated by slanting morning sunbeams in front beyond a hollow dale could be seen the columns and guns our advanced line already in action could be heard briskly exchanging shots with the enemy in the dale 
 at these sounds long unheard spirits rose as at the strains of the merriest music cracked the shots now together now several quickly one after another again all was silent and then again it sounded as if someone were walking on detonators and exploding them 
 the hussars remained in the same place for about an hour a cannonade began count ostermann with his suite rode up behind the squadron halted spoke to the commander of the regiment and rode up the hill to the guns 
 after ostermann had gone a command rang out to the uhlans 
 form column prepare to charge 
 the infantry in front of them parted into platoons to allow the cavalry to pass the uhlans started the streamers on their spears fluttering and trotted downhill toward the french cavalry which was seen below to the left 
 as soon as the uhlans descended the hill the hussars were ordered up the hill to support the battery as they took the places vacated by the uhlans bullets came from the front whining and whistling but fell spent without taking effect 
 the sounds which he had not heard for so long had an even more pleasurable and exhilarating effect on rostov than the previous sounds of firing drawing himself up he viewed the field of battle opening out before him from the hill and with his whole soul followed the movement of the uhlans they swooped down close to the french dragoons something confused happened there amid the smoke and five minutes later our uhlans were galloping back not to the place they had occupied but more to the left and among the uhlans on chestnut horses and behind them in a large group blue french dragoons on gray horses could be seen

 enlargement of horizon 
 the shocks of youthful minds among themselves have this admirable property that one can never foresee the spark nor divine the lightning flash 
 what will dart out presently 
 no one knows the burst of laughter starts from a tender feeling 
 at the moment of jest the serious makes its entry 
 impulses depend on the first chance word 
 the spirit of each is sovereign jest suffices to open the field to the unexpected 
 these are conversations with abrupt turns in which the perspective changes suddenly chance is the of such conversations 
 a severe thought starting oddly from a clash of words suddenly traversed the conflict of quips in which grantaire bahorel prouvaire bossuet combeferre and courfeyrac were confusedly fencing 
 how does a phrase crop up in a dialogue 
 whence comes it that it suddenly impresses itself on the attention of those who hear it we have just said that no one knows anything about it 
 in the midst of the uproar bossuet all at once terminated some apostrophe to combeferre with this date 
 june th waterloo 
 at this name of waterloo marius who was leaning his elbows on a table beside a glass of water removed his wrist from beneath his chin and began to gaze fixedly at the audience 
 pardieu exclaimed courfeyrac parbleu was falling into disuse at this period that number is strange and strikes me 
 it is fatal number 
 place louis in front and brumaire behind you have the whole destiny of the man with this significant peculiarity that the end treads close on the heels of the commencement 
 enjolras who had remained mute up to that point broke the silence and addressed this remark to combeferre 
 you mean to say the crime and the expiation 
 this word crime overpassed the measure of what marius who was already greatly agitated by the abrupt evocation of waterloo could accept 
 he rose walked slowly to the map of france spread out on the wall and at whose base an island was visible in a separate compartment laid his finger on this compartment and said 
 corsica a little island which has rendered france very great 
 this was like a breath of icy air 
 all ceased talking 
 they felt that something was on the point of occurring 
 bahorel replying to bossuet was just assuming an attitude of the torso to which he was addicted 
 he gave it up to listen 
 enjolras whose blue eye was not fixed on any one and who seemed to be gazing at space replied without glancing at marius 
 france needs no corsica to be great 
 france is great because she is france 
 quia nomina leo 
 marius felt no desire to retreat he turned towards enjolras and his voice burst forth with a vibration which came from a quiver of his very being 
 god forbid that i should diminish france 
 but amalgamating napoleon with her is not diminishing her 
 come let us argue the question i am a new comer among you but i will confess that you amaze me where do we stand 
 who are we 
 who are you 
 who am i 
 let us come to an explanation about the emperor 
 i hear you say buonaparte accenting the u like the royalists 
 i warn you that my grandfather does better still he says buonaparte i thought you were young men 
 where then is your enthusiasm 
 and what are you doing with it 
 whom do you admire if you do not admire the emperor and what more do you want 
 if you will have none of that great man what great men would you like 
 he had everything 
 he was complete he had in his brain the sum of human faculties 
 he made codes like justinian he dictated like caesar his conversation was mingled with the of pascal with the thunderclap of tacitus he made history and he wrote it his bulletins are iliads he combined the cipher of newton with the metaphor of mahomet he left behind him in the east words as great as the pyramids at tilsit he taught emperors majesty at the academy of sciences he replied to laplace in the council of state be held his own against merlin he gave a soul to the geometry of the first and to the chicanery of the last he was a legist with the attorneys and sidereal with the astronomers like cromwell blowing out one of two candles he went to the temple to bargain for a curtain tassel he saw everything he knew everything which did not prevent him from laughing beside the cradle of his little child and all at once frightened europe lent an ear armies put themselves in motion parks of artillery rumbled pontoons stretched over the rivers clouds of cavalry galloped in the storm cries trumpets a trembling of thrones in every direction the frontiers of kingdoms oscillated on the map the sound of a superhuman sword was heard as it was drawn from its sheath they beheld him him rise erect on the horizon with a blazing brand in his hand and a glow in his eyes unfolding amid the thunder his two wings the grand army and the old guard and he was the archangel of war 
 all held their peace and enjolras bowed his head 
 silence always produces somewhat the effect of acquiescence of the enemy being driven to the wall 
 marius continued with increased enthusiasm and almost without pausing for breath 
 let us be just my friends 
 what a splendid destiny for a nation to be the empire of such an emperor when that nation is france and when it adds its own genius to the genius of that man 
 to appear and to reign to march and to triumph to have for all capitals to take his grenadiers and to make kings of them to decree the falls of dynasties and to transfigure europe at the pace of a charge to make you feel that when you threaten you lay your hand on the hilt of the sword of god to follow in a single man hannibal caesar charlemagne to be the people of some one who mingles with your dawns the startling announcement of a battle won to have the cannon of the invalides to rouse you in the morning to hurl into abysses of light prodigious words which flame forever marengo arcola austerlitz jena wagram to cause constellations of victories to flash forth at each instant from the zenith of the centuries to make the french empire a pendant to the roman empire to be the great nation and to give birth to the grand army to make its legions fly forth over all the earth as a mountain sends out its eagles on all sides to conquer to dominate to strike with lightning to be in europe a sort of nation gilded through glory to sound athwart the centuries a of titans to conquer the world twice by conquest and by dazzling that is sublime and what greater thing is there 
 to be free said combeferre 
 marius lowered his head in his turn that cold and simple word had traversed his epic effusion like a blade of steel and he felt it vanishing within him 
 when he raised his eyes combeferre was no longer there 
 probably satisfied with his reply to the apotheosis he had just taken his departure and all with the exception of enjolras had followed him 
 the room had been emptied 
 enjolras left alone with marius was gazing gravely at him 
 marius however having rallied his ideas to some extent did not consider himself beaten there lingered in him a trace of inward fermentation which was on the point no doubt of translating itself into syllogisms arrayed against enjolras when all of a sudden they heard some one singing on the stairs as he went 
 it was combeferre and this is what he was singing si cesar donne la gloire et la guerre 
 et me fallait quitter de ma mere 
 je dirais au grand cesar reprends ton sceptre et ton char 
 mieux ma mere o gue 
 mieux ma mere 
 if cesar had given me glory and war and i were obliged to quit my love i would say to great caesar take back thy sceptre and thy chariot i prefer the love of my mother 
 the wild and tender accents with which combeferre sang communicated to this couplet a sort of strange grandeur 
 marius thoughtfully and with his eyes diked on the ceiling repeated almost mechanically my mother 
 at that moment he felt enjolras hand on his shoulder 
 citizen said enjolras to him my mother is the republic

 rostov with his keen eye was one of the first to catch sight of these blue french dragoons pursuing our uhlans nearer and nearer in disorderly crowds came the uhlans and the french dragoons pursuing them he could already see how these men who looked so small at the foot of the hill jostled and overtook one another waving their arms and their sabers in the air 
 rostov gazed at what was happening before him as at a hunt he felt instinctively that if the hussars struck at the french dragoons now the latter could not withstand them but if a charge was to be made it must be done now at that very moment or it would be too late he looked around a captain standing beside him was gazing like himself with eyes fixed on the cavalry below them 
 andrew sevastyanych said rostov you know we could crush them 
 a fine thing too replied the captain and really 
 rostov without waiting to hear him out touched his horse galloped to the front of his squadron and before he had time to finish giving the word of command the whole squadron sharing his feeling was following him rostov himself did not know how or why he did it he acted as he did when hunting without reflecting or considering he saw the dragoons near and that they were galloping in disorder he knew they could not withstand an attack knew there was only that moment and that if he let it slip it would not return the bullets were whining and whistling so stimulatingly around him and his horse was so eager to go that he could not restrain himself he touched his horse gave the word of command and immediately hearing behind him the tramp of the horses of his deployed squadron rode at full trot downhill toward the dragoons hardly had they reached the bottom of the hill before their pace instinctively changed to a gallop which grew faster and faster as they drew nearer to our uhlans and the french dragoons who galloped after them the dragoons were now close at hand on seeing the hussars the foremost began to turn while those behind began to halt with the same feeling with which he had galloped across the path of a wolf rostov gave rein to his donets horse and galloped to intersect the path of the dragoons disordered lines one uhlan stopped another who was on foot flung himself to the ground to avoid being knocked over and a riderless horse fell in among the hussars nearly all the french dragoons were galloping back rostov picking out one on a gray horse dashed after him on the way he came upon a bush his gallant horse cleared it and almost before he had righted himself in his saddle he saw that he would immediately overtake the enemy he had selected that frenchman by his uniform an officer was going at a gallop crouching on his gray horse and urging it on with his saber in another moment horse dashed its breast against the hindquarters of the horse almost knocking it over and at the same instant rostov without knowing why raised his saber and struck the frenchman with it 
 the instant he had done this all animation vanished the officer fell not so much from the blow which had but slightly cut his arm above the elbow as from the shock to his horse and from fright rostov reined in his horse and his eyes sought his foe to see whom he had vanquished the french dragoon officer was hopping with one foot on the ground the other being caught in the stirrup his eyes screwed up with fear as if he every moment expected another blow gazed up at rostov with shrinking terror his pale and face fair and young with a dimple in the chin and eyes was not an face at all suited to a battlefield but a most ordinary homelike face before rostov had decided what to do with him the officer cried i surrender he hurriedly but vainly tried to get his foot out of the stirrup and did not remove his frightened blue eyes from face some hussars who galloped up disengaged his foot and helped him into the saddle on all sides the hussars were busy with the dragoons one was wounded but though his face was bleeding he would not give up his horse another was perched up behind an hussar with his arms round him a third was being helped by an hussar to mount his horse in front the french infantry were firing as they ran the hussars galloped hastily back with their prisoners rostov galloped back with the rest aware of an unpleasant feeling of depression in his heart something vague and confused which he could not at all account for had come over him with the capture of that officer and the blow he had dealt him 
 count met the returning hussars sent for rostov thanked him and said he would report his gallant deed to the emperor and would recommend him for a st cross when sent for by count ostermann rostov remembering that he had charged without orders felt sure his commander was sending for him to punish him for breach of discipline flattering words and promise of a reward should therefore have struck him all the more pleasantly but he still felt that same vaguely disagreeable feeling of moral nausea but what on earth is worrying me he asked himself as he rode back from the general ilyin no safe have i disgraced myself in any way no not it something else resembling remorse tormented him yes oh yes that french officer with the dimple and i remember how my arm paused when i raised it 
 rostov saw the prisoners being led away and galloped after them to have a look at his frenchman with the dimple on his chin he was sitting in his foreign uniform on an hussar packhorse and looked anxiously about him the sword cut on his arm could scarcely be called a wound he glanced at rostov with a feigned smile and waved his hand in greeting rostov still had the same indefinite feeling as of shame 
 all that day and the next his friends and comrades noticed that rostov without being dull or angry was silent thoughtful and preoccupied he drank reluctantly tried to remain alone and kept turning something over in his mind 
 rostov was always thinking about that brilliant exploit of his which to his amazement had gained him the st cross and even given him a reputation for bravery and there was something he could not at all understand so others are even more afraid than i am he thought so all there is in what is called heroism and heroism and did i do it for my sake and how was he to blame with his dimple and blue eyes and how frightened he was he thought that i should kill him why should i kill him my hand trembled and they have given me a st cross i make it out at all 
 but while nicholas was considering these questions and still could reach no clear solution of what puzzled him so the wheel of fortune in the service as often happens turned in his favor after the affair at ostrovna he was brought into notice received command of an hussar battalion and when a brave officer was needed he was chosen

 res angusta 
 that evening left marius profoundly shaken and with a melancholy shadow in his soul 
 he felt what the earth may possibly feel at the moment when it is torn open with the iron in order that grain may be deposited within it it feels only the wound the quiver of the germ and the joy of the fruit only arrive later 
 marius was gloomy 
 he had but just acquired a faith must he then reject it already 
 he affirmed to himself that he would not he declared to himself that he would not doubt and he began to doubt in spite of himself 
 to stand between two religions from one of which you have not as yet emerged and another into which you have not yet entered is intolerable and twilight is pleasing only to souls 
 marius was and he required the true light 
 the of doubt pained him whatever may have been his desire to remain where he was he could not halt there he was irresistibly constrained to continue to advance to examine to think to march further 
 whither would this lead him he feared after having taken so many steps which had brought him nearer to his father to now take a step which should estrange him from that father 
 his discomfort was augmented by all the reflections which occurred to him 
 an escarpment rose around him he was in accord neither with his grandfather nor with his friends daring in the eyes of the one he was behind the times in the eyes of the others and he recognized the fact that he was doubly isolated on the side of age and on the side of youth 
 he ceased to go to the cafe musain 
 in the troubled state of his conscience he no longer thought of certain serious sides of existence 
 the realities of life do not allow themselves to be forgotten 
 they soon elbowed him abruptly 
 one morning the proprietor of the hotel entered marius room and said to him 
 monsieur courfeyrac answered for you 
 yes 
 but i must have my money 
 request courfeyrac to come and talk with me said marius 
 courfeyrac having made his appearance the host left them marius then told him what it had not before occurred to him to relate that he was the same as alone in the world and had no relatives 
 what is to become of you said courfeyrac 
 i do not know in the least replied marius 
 what are you going to do 
 i do not know 
 have you any money 
 fifteen francs 
 do you want me to lend you some 
 never 
 have you clothes 
 here is what i have 
 have you trinkets 
 a watch 
 silver 
 gold here it is 
 i know a who will take your and a pair of trousers 
 that is good 
 you will then have only a pair of trousers a waistcoat a hat and a coat 
 and my boots 
 what you will not go barefoot 
 what opulence 
 that will be enough 
 i know a watchmaker who will buy your watch 
 that is good 
 no it is not good 
 what will you do after that 
 whatever is necessary 
 anything honest that is to say 
 do you know english 
 no 
 do you know german 
 no 
 so much the worse 
 why 
 because one of my friends a publisher is getting up a sort of an encyclopaedia for which you might have translated english or german articles 
 it is badly paid work but one can live by it 
 i will learn english and german 
 and in the meanwhile 
 in the meanwhile i will live on my clothes and my watch 
 the was sent for 
 he paid twenty francs for the garments 
 they went to the he bought the watch for francs 
 that is not bad said marius to courfeyrac on their return to the hotel with my fifteen francs that makes eighty 
 and the hotel bill observed courfeyrac 
 hello i had forgotten that said marius 
 the landlord presented his bill which had to be paid on the spot it amounted to seventy francs 
 i have ten francs left said marius 
 the deuce exclaimed courfeyrac you will eat up five francs while you are learning english and five while learning german that will be swallowing a tongue very fast or a hundred sous very slowly 
 in the meantime aunt gillenormand a rather person at bottom in difficulties had finally hunted up marius abode 
 one morning on his return from the marius found a letter from his aunt and the sixty pistoles that is to say six hundred francs in gold in a sealed box 
 marius sent back the thirty louis to his aunt with a respectful letter in which he stated that he had sufficient means of subsistence and that he should be able thenceforth to supply all his needs at that moment he had three francs left 
 his aunt did not inform his grandfather of this refusal for fear of exasperating him 
 besides had he not said 
 let me never hear the name of that again 
 marius left the hotel de la porte as he did not wish to run in debt there

 on receiving news of illness the countess though not quite well yet and still weak went to moscow with petya and the rest of the household and the whole family moved from marya house to their own and settled down in town 
 illness was so serious that fortunately for her and for her parents the consideration of all that had caused the illness her conduct and the breaking off of her engagement receded into the background she was so ill that it was impossible for them to consider in how far she was to blame for what had happened she could not eat or sleep grew visibly thinner coughed and as the doctors made them feel was in danger they could not think of anything but how to help her doctors came to see her singly and in consultation talked much in french german and latin blamed one another and prescribed a great variety of medicines for all the diseases known to them but the simple idea never occurred to any of them that they could not know the disease natasha was suffering from as no disease suffered by a live man can be known for every living person has his own peculiarities and always has his own peculiar personal novel complicated disease unknown to medicine not a disease of the lungs liver skin heart nerves and so on mentioned in medical books but a disease consisting of one of the innumerable combinations of the maladies of those organs this simple thought could not occur to the doctors as it cannot occur to a wizard that he is unable to work his charms because the business of their lives was to cure and they received money for it and had spent the best years of their lives on that business but above all that thought was kept out of their minds by the fact that they saw they were really useful as in fact they were to the whole rostov family their usefulness did not depend on making the patient swallow substances for the most part harmful the harm was scarcely perceptible as they were given in small doses but they were useful necessary and indispensable because they satisfied a mental need of the invalid and of those who loved her and that is why there are and always will be wise women homeopaths and allopaths they satisfied that eternal human need for hope of relief for sympathy and that something should be done which is felt by those who are suffering they satisfied the need seen in its most elementary form in a child when it wants to have a place rubbed that has been hurt a child knocks itself and runs at once to the arms of its mother or nurse to have the aching spot rubbed or kissed and it feels better when this is done the child cannot believe that the strongest and wisest of its people have no remedy for its pain and the hope of relief and the expression of its sympathy while she rubs the bump comforts it the doctors were of use to natasha because they kissed and rubbed her bump assuring her that it would soon pass if only the coachman went to the in the arbat and got a powder and some pills in a pretty box of a ruble and seventy kopeks and if she took those powders in boiled water at intervals of precisely two hours neither more nor less 
 what would sonya and the count and countess have done how would they have looked if nothing had been done if there had not been those pills to give by the clock the warm drinks the chicken cutlets and all the other details of life ordered by the doctors the carrying out of which supplied an occupation and consolation to the family circle how would the count have borne his dearly loved illness had he not known that it was costing him a thousand rubles and that he would not grudge thousands more to benefit her or had he not known that if her illness continued he would not grudge yet other thousands and would take her abroad for consultations there and had he not been able to explain the details of how metivier and feller had not understood the symptoms but frise had and mudrov had diagnosed them even better what would the countess have done had she not been able sometimes to scold the invalid for not strictly obeying the orders 
 never get well like that she would say forgetting her grief in her vexation if you obey the doctor and take your medicine at the right time you trifle with it you know or it may turn to pneumonia she would go on deriving much comfort from the utterance of that foreign word incomprehensible to others as well as to herself 
 what would sonya have done without the glad consciousness that she had not undressed during the first three nights in order to be ready to carry out all the injunctions with precision and that she still kept awake at night so as not to miss the proper time when the slightly harmful pills in the little gilt box had to be administered even to natasha herself it was pleasant to see that so many sacrifices were being made for her sake and to know that she had to take medicine at certain hours though she declared that no medicine would cure her and that it was all nonsense and it was even pleasant to be able to show by disregarding the orders that she did not believe in medical treatment and did not value her life 
 the doctor came every day felt her pulse looked at her tongue and regardless of her face joked with her but when he had gone into another room to which the countess hurriedly followed him he assumed a grave air and thoughtfully shaking his head said that though there was danger he had hopes of the effect of this last medicine and one must wait and see that the malady was chiefly mental but and the countess trying to conceal the action from herself and from him slipped a gold coin into his hand and always returned to the patient with a more tranquil mind 
 the symptoms of illness were that she ate little slept little coughed and was always the doctors said that she could not get on without medical treatment so they kept her in the stifling atmosphere of the town and the rostovs did not move to the country that summer of 
 in spite of the many pills she swallowed and the drops and powders out of the little bottles and boxes of which madame schoss who was fond of such things made a large collection and in spite of being deprived of the country life to which she was accustomed youth prevailed grief began to be overlaid by the impressions of daily life it ceased to press so painfully on her heart it gradually faded into the past and she began to recover physically

 marius indigent 
 life became hard for marius 
 it was nothing to eat his clothes and his watch 
 he ate of that terrible inexpressible thing that is called de la vache enrage that is to say he endured great hardships and privations 
 a terrible thing it is containing days without bread nights without sleep evenings without a candle a hearth without a fire weeks without work a future without hope a coat out at the elbows an old hat which evokes the laughter of young girls a door which one finds locked on one at night because rent is not paid the insolence of the porter and the man the sneers of neighbors humiliations dignity trampled on work of whatever nature accepted disgusts bitterness despondency 
 marius learned how all this is eaten and how such are often the only things which one has to devour 
 at that moment of his existence when a man needs his pride because he needs love he felt that he was jeered at because he was badly dressed and ridiculous because he was poor at the age when youth swells the heart with imperial pride he dropped his eyes more than once on his dilapidated boots and he knew the unjust shame and the poignant blushes of wretchedness admirable and terrible trial from which the feeble emerge base from which the strong emerge sublime 
 a crucible into which destiny casts a man whenever it desires a scoundrel or a 
 for many great deeds are performed in petty combats 
 there are instances of bravery ignored and obstinate which defend themselves step by step in that fatal onslaught of necessities and turpitudes noble and mysterious triumphs which no eye beholds which are requited with no renown which are saluted with no trumpet blast life misfortune isolation abandonment poverty are the fields of battle which have their heroes obscure heroes who are sometimes grander than the heroes who win renown 
 firm and rare natures are thus created misery almost always a is sometimes a mother destitution gives birth to might of soul and spirit distress is the nurse of pride unhappiness is a good milk for the magnanimous 
 there came a moment in marius life when he swept his own landing when he bought his worth of brie cheese at the when he waited until twilight had fallen to slip into the and purchase a loaf which he carried off furtively to his attic as though he had stolen it 
 sometimes there could be seen gliding into the shop on the corner in the midst of the bantering cooks who elbowed him an awkward young man carrying big books under his arm who had a timid yet angry air who on entering removed his hat from a brow whereon stood drops of perspiration made a profound bow to the astonished wife asked for a mutton cutlet paid six or seven sous for it wrapped it up in a paper put it under his arm between two books and went away it was marius 
 on this cutlet which he cooked for himself he lived for three days 
 on the first day he ate the meat on the second he ate the fat on the third he gnawed the bone 
 aunt gillenormand made repeated attempts and sent him the sixty pistoles several times marius returned them on every occasion saying that he needed nothing 
 he was still in mourning for his father when the revolution which we have just described was effected within him 
 from that time forth he had not put off his black garments 
 but his garments were quitting him 
 the day came when he had no longer a coat the trousers would go next 
 what was to be done 
 courfeyrac to whom he had on his side done some good turns gave him an old coat for thirty sous marius got it turned by some porter or other and it was a new coat 
 but this coat was green 
 then marius ceased to go out until after nightfall 
 this made his coat black as he wished always to appear in mourning he clothed himself with the night 
 in spite of all this he got admitted to practice as a lawyer he was supposed to live in room which was decent and where a certain number of backed up and completed by several dilapidated volumes of romance passed as the library required by the regulations 
 he had his letters addressed to quarters 
 when marius became a lawyer he informed his grandfather of the fact in a letter which was cold but full of submission and respect m gillenormand trembled as he took the letter read it tore it in four pieces and threw it into the two or three days later mademoiselle gillenormand heard her father who was alone in his room talking aloud to himself 
 he always did this whenever he was greatly agitated 
 she listened and the old man was saying if you were not a fool you would know that one cannot be a baron and a lawyer at the same time

 natasha was calmer but no happier she not merely avoided all external forms of pleasure balls promenades concerts and theaters but she never laughed without a sound of tears in her laughter she could not sing as soon as she began to laugh or tried to sing by herself tears choked her tears of remorse tears at the recollection of those pure times which could never return tears of vexation that she should so uselessly have ruined her young life which might have been so happy laughter and singing in particular seemed to her like a blasphemy in face of her sorrow without any need of no wish to coquet ever entered her head she said and felt at that time that no man was more to her than nastasya ivanovna the buffoon something stood sentinel within her and forbade her every joy besides she had lost all the old interests of her carefree girlish life that had been so full of hope the previous autumn the hunting uncle and the christmas holidays spent with nicholas at otradnoe were what she recalled oftenest and most painfully what would she not have given to bring back even a single day of that time but it was gone forever her presentiment at the time had not deceived her that that state of freedom and readiness for any enjoyment would not return again yet it was necessary to live on 
 it comforted her to reflect that she was not better as she had formerly imagined but worse much worse than anybody else in the world but this was not enough she knew that and asked herself what next but there was nothing to come there was no joy in life yet life was passing natasha apparently tried not to be a burden or a hindrance to anyone but wanted nothing for herself she kept away from everyone in the house and felt at ease only with her brother petya she liked to be with him better than with the others and when alone with him she sometimes laughed she hardly ever left the house and of those who came to see them was glad to see only one person pierre it would have been impossible to treat her with more delicacy greater care and at the same time more seriously than did count bezukhov natasha unconsciously felt this delicacy and so found great pleasure in his society but she was not even grateful to him for it nothing good on part seemed to her to be an effort it seemed so natural for him to be kind to everyone that there was no merit in his kindness sometimes natasha noticed embarrassment and awkwardness on his part in her presence especially when he wanted to do something to please her or feared that something they spoke of would awaken memories distressing to her she noticed this and attributed it to his general kindness and shyness which she imagined must be the same toward everyone as it was to her after those involuntary words that if he were free he would have asked on his knees for her hand and her love uttered at a moment when she was so strongly agitated pierre never spoke to natasha of his feelings and it seemed plain to her that those words which had then so comforted her were spoken as all sorts of meaningless words are spoken to comfort a crying child it was not because pierre was a married man but because natasha felt very strongly with him that moral barrier the absence of which she had experienced with kuragin that it never entered her head that the relations between him and herself could lead to love on her part still less on his or even to the kind of tender romantic friendship between a man and a woman of which she had known several instances 
 before the end of the fast of st peter agrafena ivanovna belova a country neighbor of the rostovs came to moscow to pay her devotions at the shrines of the moscow saints she suggested that natasha should fast and prepare for holy communion and natasha gladly welcomed the idea despite the orders that she should not go out early in the morning natasha insisted on fasting and preparing for the sacrament not as they generally prepared for it in the rostov family by attending three services in their own house but as agrafena ivanovna did by going to church every day for a week and not once missing vespers matins or mass 
 the countess was pleased with zeal after the poor results of the medical treatment in the depths of her heart she hoped that prayer might help her daughter more than medicines and though not without fear and concealing it from the doctor she agreed to wish and entrusted her to belova agrafena ivanovna used to come to wake natasha at three in the morning but generally found her already awake she was afraid of being late for matins hastily washing and meekly putting on her shabbiest dress and an old mantilla natasha shivering in the fresh air went out into the deserted streets lit by the clear light of dawn by agrafena advice natasha prepared herself not in their own parish but at a church where according to the devout agrafena ivanovna the priest was a man of very severe and lofty life there were never many people in the church natasha always stood beside belova in the customary place before an icon of the blessed virgin let into the screen before the choir on the left side and a feeling new to her of humility before something great and incomprehensible seized her when at that unusual morning hour gazing at the dark face of the virgin illuminated by the candles burning before it and by the morning light falling from the window she listened to the words of the service which she tried to follow with understanding when she understood them her personal feeling became interwoven in the prayers with shades of its own when she did not understand it was sweeter still to think that the wish to understand everything is pride that it is impossible to understand all that it is only necessary to believe and to commit oneself to god whom she felt guiding her soul at those moments she crossed herself bowed low and when she did not understand in horror at her own vileness simply asked god to forgive her everything everything to have mercy upon her the prayers to which she surrendered herself most of all were those of repentance on her way home at an early hour when she met no one but bricklayers going to work or men sweeping the street and everybody within the houses was still asleep natasha experienced a feeling new to her a sense of the possibility of correcting her faults the possibility of a new clean life and of happiness 
 during the whole week she spent in this way that feeling grew every day and the happiness of taking communion or communing as agrafena ivanovna joyously playing with the word called it seemed to natasha so great that she felt she should never live till that blessed sunday 
 but the happy day came and on that memorable sunday when dressed in white muslin she returned home after communion for the first time for many months she felt calm and not oppressed by the thought of the life that lay before her 
 the doctor who came to see her that day ordered her to continue the powders he had prescribed a fortnight previously 
 she must certainly go on taking them morning and evening said he evidently sincerely satisfied with his success only please be particular about it 
 be quite easy he continued playfully as he adroitly took the gold coin in his palm she will soon be singing and frolicking about the last medicine has done her a very great deal of good she has freshened up very much 
 the countess with a cheerful expression on her face looked down at her nails and spat a little for luck as she returned to the drawing room

 marius poor 
 it is the same with wretchedness as with everything else 
 it ends by becoming bearable 
 it finally assumes a form and adjusts itself one vegetates that is to say one develops in a certain meagre fashion which is however sufficient for life 
 this is the mode in which the existence of marius pontmercy was arranged 
 he had passed the worst straits the narrow pass was opening out a little in front of him 
 by dint of toil perseverance courage and will he had managed to draw from his work about seven hundred francs a year he had learned german and english thanks to courfeyrac who had put him in communication with his friend the publisher marius filled the modest post of utility man in the literature of the publishing house he drew up prospectuses translated newspapers annotated editions compiled biographies etc net product year in and year out seven hundred francs 
 he lived on it 
 how 
 not so badly we will explain 
 marius occupied in the gorbeau house for an annual sum of thirty francs a den minus a fireplace called a cabinet which contained only the most indispensable articles of furniture 
 this furniture belonged to him 
 he gave three francs a month to the old principal tenant to come and sweep his hole and to bring him a little hot water every morning a fresh egg and a penny roll 
 he breakfasted on this egg and roll 
 his breakfast varied in cost from two to four sous according as eggs were dear or cheap 
 at six in the evening he descended the rue to dine at opposite the on the corner of the rue des mathurins 
 he ate no soup 
 he took a plate of meat a of vegetables for three sous and a dessert for three sous he got as much bread as he wished 
 as for wine he drank water 
 when he paid at the desk where madam rousseau at that period still plump and rosy majestically presided he gave a sou to the waiter and madam rousseau gave him a smile then he went away 
 for sixteen sous he had a smile and a dinner 
 this restaurant rousseau where so few bottles and so many water carafes were emptied was a calming potion rather than a restaurant it no longer exists 
 the proprietor had a fine nickname 
 he was called rousseau the aquatic 
 thus breakfast four sous dinner sixteen sous his food cost him twenty sous a day which made three hundred and francs a year 
 add the thirty francs for rent and the francs to the old woman plus a few trifling expenses for four hundred and fifty francs marius was fed lodged and waited on his clothing cost him a hundred francs his linen fifty francs his washing fifty francs the whole did not exceed six hundred and fifty francs 
 he was rich 
 he sometimes lent ten francs to a friend courfeyrac had once been able to borrow sixty francs of him as far as fire was concerned as marius had no fireplace he had simplified matters 
 marius always had two complete suits of clothes the one old for every day the other brand new for special occasions both were black 
 he had but three shirts one on his person the second in the commode and the third in the hands he renewed them as they wore out 
 they were always ragged which caused him to button his coat to the chin 
 it had required years for marius to attain to this flourishing condition hard years difficult some of them to traverse others to climb marius had not failed for a single day 
 he had endured everything in the way of destitution he had done everything except contract debts he did himself the justice to say that he had never owed any one a sou a debt was to him the beginning of slavery 
 he even said to himself that a creditor is worse than a master for the master possesses only your person a creditor possesses your dignity and can administer to it a box on the ear 
 rather than borrow he went without food he had passed many a day fasting 
 feeling that all extremes meet and that if one is not on guard lowered fortunes may lead to baseness of soul he kept a jealous watch on his pride such and such a formality or action which in any other situation would have appeared merely a deference to him now seemed insipidity and he nerved himself against it 
 his face wore a sort of severe flush he was timid even to rudeness 
 during all these trials he had felt himself encouraged and even uplifted at times by a secret force that he possessed within himself the soul aids the body and at certain moments raises it it is the only bird which bears up its own cage 
 besides his name another name was graven in marius heart the name of thenardier 
 marius with his grave and enthusiastic nature surrounded with a sort of aureole the man to whom in his thoughts he owed his intrepid sergeant who had saved the colonel amid the bullets and the of waterloo he never separated the memory of this man from the memory of his father and he associated them in his veneration 
 it was a sort of worship in two steps with the grand altar for the colonel and the lesser one for thenardier 
 what redoubled the tenderness of his gratitude towards thenardier was the idea of the distress into which he knew that thenardier had fallen and which had engulfed the latter marius had learned at montfermeil of the ruin and bankruptcy of the unfortunate since that time he had made efforts to find traces of him and to reach him in that dark abyss of misery in which thenardier had disappeared 
 marius had beaten the whole country he had gone to chelles to bondy to gourney to nogent to lagny he had persisted for three years expending in these explorations the little money which he had laid by 
 no one had been able to give him any news of thenardier 
 he was supposed to have gone abroad his creditors had also sought him with less love than marius but with as much assiduity and had not been able to lay their hands on him 
 marius blamed himself and was almost angry with himself for his lack of success in his researches 
 it was the only debt left him by the colonel and marius made it a matter of honor to pay it what he thought when my father lay dying on the field of battle did thenardier contrive to find him amid the smoke and the and bear him off on his shoulders and yet he owed him nothing and i who owe so much to thenardier cannot join him in this shadow where he is lying in the pangs of death and in my turn bring him back from death to life 
 oh 
 i will find him to find thenardier in fact marius would have given one of his arms to rescue him from his misery he would have sacrificed all his blood to see thenardier to render thenardier some service to say to him you do not know me well i do know you 
 here i am 
 dispose of me this was marius sweetest and most magnificent dream

 at the beginning of july more and more disquieting reports about the war began to spread in moscow people spoke of an appeal by the emperor to the people and of his coming himself from the army to moscow and as up to the eleventh of july no manifesto or appeal had been received exaggerated reports became current about them and about the position of russia it was said that the emperor was leaving the army because it was in danger it was said that smolensk had surrendered that napoleon had an army of a million and only a miracle could save russia 
 on the eleventh of july which was saturday the manifesto was received but was not yet in print and pierre who was at the rostovs promised to come to dinner next day sunday and bring a copy of the manifesto and appeal which he would obtain from count rostopchin 
 that sunday the rostovs went to mass at the razumovskis private chapel as usual it was a hot july day even at ten when the rostovs got out of their carriage at the chapel the sultry air the shouts of hawkers the light and gay summer clothes of the crowd the dusty leaves of the trees on the boulevard the sounds of the band and the white trousers of a battalion marching to parade the rattling of wheels on the cobblestones and the brilliant hot sunshine were all full of that summer languor that content and discontent with the present which is most strongly felt on a bright hot day in town all the moscow notabilities all the rostovs acquaintances were at the razumovskis chapel for as if expecting something to happen many wealthy families who usually left town for their country estates had not gone away that summer as natasha at her side passed through the crowd behind a liveried footman who cleared the way for them she heard a young man speaking about her in too loud a whisper 
 rostova the one who 
 much thinner but all the same pretty 
 she heard or thought she heard the names of kuragin and bolkonski but she was always imagining that it always seemed to her that everyone who looked at her was thinking only of what had happened to her with a sinking heart wretched as she always was now when she found herself in a crowd natasha in her lilac silk dress trimmed with black lace walked as women can walk with the more repose and stateliness the greater the pain and shame in her soul she knew for certain that she was pretty but this no longer gave her satisfaction as it used to on the contrary it tormented her more than anything else of late and particularly so on this bright hot summer day in town sunday again another week past she thought recalling that she had been here the sunday before and always the same life that is no life and the same surroundings in which it used to be so easy to live pretty young and i know that now i am good i used to be bad but now i know i am good she thought but yet my best years are slipping by and are no good to anyone she stood by her side and exchanged nods with acquaintances near her from habit she scrutinized the ladies dresses condemned the bearing of a lady standing close by who was not crossing herself properly but in a cramped manner and again she thought with vexation that she was herself being judged and was judging others and suddenly at the sound of the service she felt horrified at her own vileness horrified that the former purity of her soul was again lost to her 
 a comely old man was conducting the service with that mild solemnity which has so elevating and soothing an effect on the souls of the worshipers the gates of the sanctuary screen were closed the curtain was slowly drawn and from behind it a soft mysterious voice pronounced some words tears the cause of which she herself did not understand made breast heave and a joyous but oppressive feeling agitated her 
 teach me what i should do how to live my life how i may grow good forever forever she pleaded 
 the deacon came out onto the raised space before the altar screen and holding his thumb extended drew his long hair from under his dalmatic and making the sign of the cross on his breast began in a loud and solemn voice to recite the words of the prayer 
 in peace let us pray unto the lord 
 as one community without distinction of class without enmity united by brotherly love let us pray thought natasha 
 for the peace that is from above and for the salvation of our souls 
 for the world of angels and all the spirits who dwell above us prayed natasha 
 when they prayed for the warriors she thought of her brother and denisov when they prayed for all traveling by land and sea she remembered prince andrew prayed for him and asked god to forgive her all the wrongs she had done him when they prayed for those who love us she prayed for the members of her own family her father and mother and sonya realizing for the first time how wrongly she had acted toward them and feeling all the strength of her love for them when they prayed for those who hate us she tried to think of her enemies and people who hated her in order to pray for them she included among her enemies the creditors and all who had business dealings with her father and always at the thought of enemies and those who hated her she remembered anatole who had done her so much harm and though he did not hate her she gladly prayed for him as for an enemy only at prayer did she feel able to think clearly and calmly of prince andrew and anatole as men for whom her feelings were as nothing compared with her awe and devotion to god when they prayed for the imperial family and the synod she bowed very low and made the sign of the cross saying to herself that even if she did not understand still she could not doubt and at any rate loved the governing synod and prayed for it 
 when he had finished the litany the deacon crossed the stole over his breast and said let us commit ourselves and our whole lives to christ the lord 
 commit ourselves to god natasha inwardly repeated lord god i submit myself to thy will she thought i want nothing wish for nothing teach me what to do and how to use my will take me take me prayed natasha with impatient emotion in her heart not crossing herself but letting her slender arms hang down as if expecting some invisible power at any moment to take her and deliver her from herself from her regrets desires remorse hopes and sins 
 the countess looked round several times at her softened face and shining eyes and prayed god to help her 
 unexpectedly in the middle of the service and not in the usual order natasha knew so well the deacon brought out a small stool the one he knelt on when praying on trinity sunday and placed it before the doors of the sanctuary screen the priest came out with his purple velvet biretta on his head adjusted his hair and knelt down with an effort everybody followed his example and they looked at one another in surprise then came the prayer just received from the synod a prayer for the deliverance of russia from hostile invasion 
 lord god of might god of our salvation began the priest in that voice clear not grandiloquent but mild in which only the slav clergy read and which acts so irresistibly on a russian heart 
 lord god of might god of our salvation look this day in mercy and blessing on thy humble people and graciously hear us spare us and have mercy upon us this foe confounding thy land desiring to lay waste the whole world rises against us these lawless men are gathered together to overthrow thy kingdom to destroy thy dear jerusalem thy beloved russia to defile thy temples to overthrow thine altars and to desecrate our holy shrines how long o lord how long shall the wicked triumph how long shall they wield unlawful power 
 lord god hear us when we pray to thee strengthen with thy might our most gracious sovereign lord the emperor alexander pavlovich be mindful of his uprightness and meekness reward him according to his righteousness and let it preserve us thy chosen israel bless his counsels his undertakings and his work strengthen his kingdom by thine almighty hand and give him victory over his enemy even as thou gavest moses the victory over amalek gideon over midian and david over goliath preserve his army put a bow of brass in the hands of those who have armed themselves in thy name and gird their loins with strength for the fight take up the spear and shield and arise to help us confound and put to shame those who have devised evil against us may they be before the faces of thy faithful warriors as dust before the wind and may thy mighty angel confound them and put them to flight may they be ensnared when they know it not and may the plots they have laid in secret be turned against them let them fall before thy servants feet and be laid low by our hosts lord thou art able to save both great and small thou art god and man cannot prevail against thee 
 god of our fathers remember thy bounteous mercy and which are from of old turn not thy face from us but be gracious to our unworthiness and in thy great goodness and thy many mercies regard not our transgressions and iniquities create in us a clean heart and renew a right spirit within us strengthen us all in thy faith fortify our hope inspire us with true love one for another arm us with unity of spirit in the righteous defense of the heritage thou gavest to us and to our fathers and let not the scepter of the wicked be exalted against the destiny of those thou hast sanctified 
 o lord our god in whom we believe and in whom we put our trust let us not be confounded in our hope of thy mercy and give us a token of thy blessing that those who hate us and our orthodox faith may see it and be put to shame and perish and may all the nations know that thou art the lord and we are thy people show thy mercy upon us this day o lord and grant us thy salvation make the hearts of thy servants to rejoice in thy mercy smite down our enemies and destroy them swiftly beneath the feet of thy faithful servants for thou art the defense the succor and the victory of them that put their trust in thee and to thee be all glory to father son and holy ghost now and forever world without end amen 
 in receptive condition of soul this prayer affected her strongly she listened to every word about the victory of moses over amalek of gideon over midian and of david over goliath and about the destruction of thy jerusalem and she prayed to god with the tenderness and emotion with which her heart was overflowing but without fully understanding what she was asking of god in that prayer she shared with all her heart in the prayer for the spirit of righteousness for the strengthening of the heart by faith and hope and its animation by love but she could not pray that her enemies might be trampled under foot when but a few minutes before she had been wishing she had more of them that she might pray for them but neither could she doubt the righteousness of the prayer that was being read on bended knees she felt in her heart a devout and tremulous awe at the thought of the punishment that overtakes men for their sins and especially of her own sins and she prayed to god to forgive them all and her too and to give them all and her too peace and happiness and it seemed to her that god heard her prayer

 book excellence of misfortune 
 chapter iii 
 
 marius grown up 
 at this epoch marius was twenty years of age 
 it was three years since he had left his grandfather 
 both parties had remained on the same terms without attempting to approach each other and without seeking to see each other 
 besides what was the use of seeing each other 
 marius was the brass vase while father gillenormand was the iron pot 
 we admit that marius was mistaken as to his heart he had imagined that m gillenormand had never loved him and that that crusty harsh and smiling old fellow who cursed shouted and stormed and brandished his cane cherished for him at the most only that affection which is at once slight and severe of the dotards of comedy 
 marius was in error there are fathers who do not love their children there exists no grandfather who does not adore his grandson 
 at bottom as we have said m gillenormand idolized marius 
 he idolized him after his own fashion with an accompaniment of snappishness and boxes on the ear but this child once gone he felt a black void in his heart he would allow no one to mention the child to him and all the while secretly regretted that he was so well obeyed at first he hoped that this buonapartist this jacobin this terrorist this septembrist would return 
 but the weeks passed by years passed to m great despair the did not make his appearance 
 i could not do otherwise than turn him out said the grandfather to himself and he asked himself if the thing were to do over again would i do it 
 his pride instantly answered yes but his aged head which he shook in silence replied sadly no 
 he had his hours of depression he missed marius 
 old men need affection as they need the sun it is warmth 
 strong as his nature was the absence of marius had wrought some change in him 
 nothing in the world could have induced him to take a step towards that rogue but he suffered he never inquired about him but he thought of him incessantly he lived in the marais in a more and more retired manner he was still merry and violent as of old but his merriment had a convulsive harshness and his violences always terminated in a sort of gentle and gloomy dejection 
 he sometimes said oh if he only would return what a good box on the ear i would give him 
 as for his aunt she thought too little to love much marius was no longer for her much more than a vague black form and she eventually came to occupy herself with him much less than with the cat or the paroquet which she probably had 
 what augmented father secret suffering was that he locked it all up within his breast and did not allow its existence to be divined his sorrow was like those recently invented furnaces which consume their own smoke 
 it sometimes happened that officious busybodies spoke to him of marius and asked him 
 what is your grandson doing what has become of him 
 the old bourgeois replied with a sigh that he was a sad case and giving a fillip to his cuff if he wished to appear gay 
 monsieur le baron de pontmercy is practising pettifogging in some corner or other 
 while the old man regretted marius applauded himself as is the case with all people misfortune had eradicated his bitterness 
 he only thought of m gillenormand in an amiable light but he had set his mind on not receiving anything more from the man who had been unkind to his father this was the mitigated translation of his first indignation moreover he was happy at having suffered and at suffering still it was for his sake 
 the hardness of his life satisfied and pleased him 
 he said to himself with a sort of joy that it was certainly the least he could do that it was an expiation that had it not been for that he would have been punished in some other way and later on for his impious indifference towards his father and such a father that it would not have been just that his father should have all the suffering and he none of it and that in any case what were his toils and his destitution compared with the heroic life that in short the only way for him to approach his father and resemble him was to be brave in the face of indigence as the other had been valiant before the enemy and that that was no doubt what the colonel had meant to imply by the words he will be worthy of it 
 words which marius continued to wear not on his breast since the writing had disappeared but in his heart 
 and then on the day when his grandfather had turned him out of doors he had been only a child now he was a man 
 he felt it 
 misery we repeat had been good for him 
 poverty in youth when it succeeds has this magnificent property about it that it turns the whole will towards effort and the whole soul towards aspiration poverty instantly lays material life bare and renders it hideous hence inexpressible bounds towards the ideal life 
 the wealthy young man has a hundred coarse and brilliant distractions horse races hunting dogs tobacco gaming good repasts and all the rest of it occupations for the baser side of the soul at the expense of the loftier and more delicate sides 
 the poor young man wins his bread with difficulty he eats when he has eaten he has nothing more but meditation 
 he goes to the spectacles which god furnishes gratis he gazes at the sky space the stars flowers children the humanity among which he is suffering the creation amid which he beams he gazes so much on humanity that he perceives its soul he gazes upon creation to such an extent that he beholds god 
 he dreams he feels himself great he dreams on and feels himself tender from the egotism of the man who suffers he passes to the compassion of the man who meditates 
 an admirable sentiment breaks forth in him forgetfulness of self and pity for all as he thinks of the innumerable enjoyments which nature offers gives and lavishes to souls which stand open and refuses to souls that are closed he comes to pity he the millionnaire of the mind the millionnaire of money 
 all hatred departs from his heart in proportion as light penetrates his spirit 
 and is he unhappy no the misery of a young man is never miserable 
 the first young lad who comes to hand however poor he may be with his strength his health his rapid walk his brilliant eyes his warmly circulating blood his black hair his red lips his white teeth his pure breath will always arouse the envy of an aged emperor and then every morning he sets himself afresh to the task of earning his bread and while his hands earn his bread his dorsal column gains pride his brain gathers ideas 
 his task finished he returns to ineffable ecstasies to contemplation to joys he beholds his feet set in afflictions in obstacles on the pavement in the nettles sometimes in the mire his head in the light 
 he is firm serene gentle peaceful attentive serious content with little kindly and he thanks god for having bestowed on him those two forms of riches which many a rich man lacks 
 work which makes him free and thought which makes him dignified 
 this is what had happened with marius 
 to tell the truth he inclined a little too much to the side of contemplation 
 from the day when he had succeeded in earning his living with some approach to certainty he had stopped thinking it good to be poor and retrenching time from his work to give to thought that is to say he sometimes passed entire days in meditation absorbed engulfed like a visionary in the mute voluptuousness of ecstasy and inward radiance he had thus propounded the problem of his life 
 to toil as little as possible at material labor in order to toil as much as possible at the labor which is impalpable in other words to bestow a few hours on real life and to cast the rest to the infinite 
 as he believed that he lacked nothing he did not perceive that contemplation thus understood ends by becoming one of the forms of idleness that he was contenting himself with conquering the first necessities of life and that he was resting from his labors too soon 
 it was evident that for this energetic and enthusiastic nature this could only be a transitory state and that at the first shock against the inevitable complications of destiny marius would awaken 
 in the meantime although he was a lawyer and whatever father gillenormand thought about the matter he was not practising he was not even pettifogging 
 meditation had turned him aside from pleading to haunt attorneys to follow the court to hunt up cases what a bore 
 why should he do it 
 he saw no reason for changing the manner of gaining his livelihood 
 the obscure and publishing establishment had come to mean for him a sure source of work which did not involve too much labor as we have explained and which sufficed for his wants 
 one of the publishers for whom he worked m magimel i think offered to take him into his own house to lodge him well to furnish him with regular occupation and to give him fifteen hundred francs a year 
 to be well lodged 
 fifteen hundred francs 
 no doubt but renounce his liberty 
 be on fixed wages 
 a sort of hired man of letters 
 according to marius opinion if he accepted his position would become both better and worse at the same time he acquired comfort and lost his dignity it was a fine and complete unhappiness converted into a repulsive and ridiculous state of torture something like the case of a blind man who should recover the sight of one eye 
 he refused 
 marius dwelt in solitude 
 owing to his taste for remaining outside of everything and through having been too much alarmed he had not entered decidedly into the group presided over by enjolras they had remained good friends they were ready to assist each other on occasion in every possible way but nothing more marius had two friends 
 one young courfeyrac and one old m mabeuf 
 he inclined more to the old man 
 in the first place he owed to him the revolution which had taken place within him to him he was indebted for having known and loved his father he operated on me for a cataract he said 
 the churchwarden had certainly played a decisive part 
 it was not however that m mabeuf had been anything but the calm and impassive agent of providence in this connection 
 he had enlightened marius by chance and without being aware of the fact as does a candle which some one brings he had been the candle and not the some one 
 as for marius inward political revolution m mabeuf was totally incapable of comprehending it of willing or of directing it 
 as we shall see m mabeuf again later on a few words will not be superfluous

 book nine 
 chapter xix 
 
 from the day when pierre after leaving the rostovs with grateful look fresh in his mind had gazed at the comet that seemed to be fixed in the sky and felt that something new was appearing on his own horizon from that day the problem of the vanity and uselessness of all earthly things that had incessantly tormented him no longer presented itself that terrible question why wherefore which had come to him amid every occupation was now replaced not by another question or by a reply to the former question but by her image when he listened to or himself took part in trivial conversations when he read or heard of human baseness or folly he was not horrified as formerly and did not ask himself why men struggled so about these things when all is so transient and incomprehensible but he remembered her as he had last seen her and all his doubts vanished not because she had answered the questions that had haunted him but because his conception of her transferred him instantly to another a brighter realm of spiritual activity in which no one could be justified or guilty a realm of beauty and love which it was worth living for whatever worldly baseness presented itself to him he said to himself 
 well supposing n n swindled the country and the tsar and the country and the tsar confer honors upon him what does that matter she smiled at me yesterday and asked me to come again and i love her and no one will ever know it and his soul felt calm and peaceful 
 pierre still went into society drank as much and led the same idle and dissipated life because besides the hours he spent at the rostovs there were other hours he had to spend somehow and the habits and acquaintances he had made in moscow formed a current that bore him along irresistibly but latterly when more and more disquieting reports came from the seat of war and health began to improve and she no longer aroused in him the former feeling of careful pity an restlessness which he could not explain took possession of him he felt that the condition he was in could not continue long that a catastrophe was coming which would change his whole life and he impatiently sought everywhere for signs of that approaching catastrophe one of his brother masons had revealed to pierre the following prophecy concerning napoleon drawn from the revelation of st john 
 in chapter verse of the apocalypse it is said 
 here is wisdom let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast for it is the number of a man and his number is six hundred threescore and six and in the fifth verse of the same chapter 
 and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months 
 the french alphabet written out with the same numerical values as the hebrew in which the first nine letters denote units and the others tens will have the following significance 
 a b c d e f g h i k 
 
 lmnopqrs 
 
 tuvwxy 
 
 zz 
 
 writing the words napoleon in numbers it appears that the sum of them is and that napoleon therefore the beast foretold in the apocalypse moreover by applying the same system to the words which was the term allowed to the beast that spoke great things and blasphemies the same number was obtained from which it followed that the limit fixed for power had come in the year when the french emperor was this prophecy pleased pierre very much and he often asked himself what would put an end to the power of the beast that is of napoleon and tried by the same system of using letters as numbers and adding them up to find an answer to the question that engrossed him he wrote the words alexandre la nation russe and added up their numbers but the sums were either more or less than once when making such calculations he wrote down his own name in french comte pierre besouhoff but the sum of the numbers did not come right then he changed the spelling substituting a z for the s and adding de and the article le still without obtaining the desired result then it occurred to him if the answer to the question were contained in his name his nationality would also be given in the answer so he wrote le russe besuhof and adding up the numbers got this was only five too much and five was represented by e the very letter elided from the article le before the word empereur by omitting the e though incorrectly pierre got the answer he sought besuhof made this discovery excited him how or by what means he was connected with the great event foretold in the apocalypse he did not know but he did not doubt that connection for a moment his love for natasha antichrist napoleon the invasion the comet napoleon and besuhof all this had to mature and culminate to lift him out of that spellbound petty sphere of moscow habits in which he felt himself held captive and lead him to a great achievement and great happiness 
 
 on the eve of the sunday when the special prayer was read pierre had promised the rostovs to bring them from count rostopchin whom he knew well both the appeal to the people and the news from the army in the morning when he went to call at he met there a courier fresh from the army an acquaintance of his own who often danced at moscow balls 
 do please for sake relieve me of something said the courier i have a sackful of letters to parents 
 among these letters was one from nicholas rostov to his father pierre took that letter and rostopchin also gave him the appeal to moscow which had just been printed the last army orders and his own most recent bulletin glancing through the army orders pierre found in one of them in the lists of killed wounded and rewarded the name of nicholas rostov awarded a st cross of the fourth class for courage shown in the ostrovna affair and in the same order the name of prince andrew bolkonski appointed to the command of a regiment of chasseurs though he did not want to remind the rostovs of bolkonski pierre could not refrain from making them happy by the news of their having received a decoration so he sent that printed army order and nicholas letter to the rostovs keeping the appeal the bulletin and the other orders to take with him when he went to dinner 
 his conversation with count rostopchin and the tone of anxious hurry the meeting with the courier who talked casually of how badly things were going in the army the rumors of the discovery of spies in moscow and of a leaflet in circulation stating that napoleon promised to be in both the russian capitals by the autumn and the talk of the being expected to arrive next day all aroused with fresh force that feeling of agitation and expectation in pierre which he had been conscious of ever since the appearance of the comet and especially since the beginning of the war 
 he had long been thinking of entering the army and would have done so had he not been hindered first by his membership of the society of freemasons to which he was bound by oath and which preached perpetual peace and the abolition of war and secondly by the fact that when he saw the great mass of muscovites who had donned uniform and were talking patriotism he somehow felt ashamed to take the step but the chief reason for not carrying out his intention to enter the army lay in the vague idea that he was besuhof who had the number of the beast that his part in the great affair of setting a limit to the power of the beast that spoke great and blasphemous things had been predestined from eternity and that therefore he ought not to undertake anything but wait for what was bound to come to pass

 book excellence of misfortune 
 chapter iv 
 
 m mabeuf 
 on the day when m mabeuf said to marius 
 certainly i approve of political opinions he expressed the real state of his mind all political opinions were matters of indifference to him and he approved them all without distinction provided they left him in peace as the greeks called the furies the beautiful the good the charming the eumenides 
 m political opinion consisted in a passionate love for plants and above all for books like all the rest of the world he possessed the termination in ist without which no one could exist at that time but he was neither a royalist a bonapartist a chartist an orleanist nor an anarchist he was a bouquinist a collector of old books 
 he did not understand how men could busy themselves with hating each other because of silly stuff like the charter democracy legitimacy monarchy the republic etc when there were in the world all sorts of mosses grasses and shrubs which they might be looking at and heaps of folios and even of mos which they might turn over 
 he took good care not to become useless having books did not prevent his reading being a botanist did not prevent his being a gardener 
 when he made acquaintance this sympathy had existed between the colonel and what the colonel did for flowers he did for fruits 
 m mabeuf had succeeded in producing seedling pears as savory as the pears of st germain it is from one of his combinations apparently that the october mirabelle now celebrated and no less perfumed than the summer mirabelle owes its origin 
 he went to mass rather from gentleness than from piety and because as he loved the faces of men but hated their noise he found them assembled and silent only in church feeling that he must be something in the state he had chosen the career of warden 
 however he had never succeeded in loving any woman as much as a tulip bulb nor any man as much as an elzevir he had long passed sixty when one day some one asked him have you never been married 
 i have forgotten said he when it sometimes happened to to whom does it not happen to say 
 oh if i were only rich it was not when ogling a pretty girl as was the case with father gillenormand but when contemplating an old book 
 he lived alone with an old housekeeper he was somewhat gouty and when he was asleep his aged fingers stiffened with rheumatism lay crooked up in the folds of his sheets he had composed and published a flora of the environs of cauteretz with colored plates a work which enjoyed a tolerable measure of esteem and which sold well 
 people rang his bell in the rue mesieres two or three times a day to ask for it 
 he drew as much as two thousand francs a year from it this constituted nearly the whole of his fortune 
 although poor he had had the talent to form for himself by dint of patience privations and time a precious collection of rare copies of every sort 
 he never went out without a book under his arm and he often returned with two 
 the sole decoration of the four rooms on the ground floor which composed his lodgings consisted of framed herbariums and engravings of the old masters the sight of a sword or a gun chilled his blood 
 he had never approached a cannon in his life even at the invalides 
 he had a passable stomach a brother who was a cure perfectly white hair no teeth either in his mouth or his mind a trembling in every limb a picard accent an infantile laugh the air of an old sheep and he was easily frightened 
 add to this that he had no other friendship no other acquaintance among the living than an old bookseller of the named royal 
 his dream was to naturalize indigo in france 
 his servant was also a sort of innocent 
 the poor good old woman was a spinster 
 sultan her cat which might have mewed miserere in the sixtine chapel had filled her heart and sufficed for the quantity of passion which existed in her 
 none of her dreams had ever proceeded as far as man 
 she had never been able to get further than her cat 
 like him she had a mustache 
 her glory consisted in her caps which were always white 
 she passed her time on sundays after mass in counting over the linen in her chest and in spreading out on her bed the dresses in the piece which she bought and never had made up 
 she knew how to read 
 m mabeuf had nicknamed her mother plutarque 
 m mabeuf had taken a fancy to marius because marius being young and gentle warmed his age without startling his timidity youth combined with gentleness produces on old people the effect of the sun without wind 
 when marius was saturated with military glory with gunpowder with marches and countermarches and with all those prodigious battles in which his father had given and received such tremendous blows of the sword he went to see m mabeuf and m mabeuf talked to him of his hero from the point of view of flowers 
 his brother the cure died about and almost immediately as when the night is drawing on the whole horizon grew dark for m mabeuf a failure deprived him of the sum of ten thousand francs which was all that he possessed in his right and his own the revolution of july brought a crisis to publishing 
 in a period of embarrassment the first thing which does not sell is a flora the flora of the environs of cauteretz stopped short 
 weeks passed by without a single purchaser 
 sometimes m mabeuf started at the sound of the bell 
 monsieur said mother plutarque sadly it is the in short one day m mabeuf quitted the rue mesieres abdicated the functions of warden gave up sold not a part of his books but of his prints that to which he was the least installed himself in a little house on the rue montparnasse where however he remained but one quarter for two reasons 
 in the first place the ground floor and the garden cost three hundred francs and he dared not spend more than two hundred francs on his rent in the second being near he could hear the which was intolerable to him 
 he carried off his flora his his herbariums his portfolios and his books and established himself near the salpetriere in a sort of thatched cottage of the village of austerlitz where for fifty crowns a year he got three rooms and a garden enclosed by a hedge and containing a well 
 he took advantage of this removal to sell off nearly all his furniture on the day of his entrance into his new quarters he was very gay and drove the nails on which his engravings and herbariums were to hang with his own hands dug in his garden the rest of the day and at night perceiving that mother plutarque had a melancholy air and was very thoughtful he tapped her on the shoulder and said to her with a smile 
 we have the indigo 
 only two visitors the bookseller of the and marius were admitted to view the thatched cottage at austerlitz a brawling name which was to tell the truth extremely disagreeable to him 
 however as we have just pointed out brains which are absorbed in some bit of wisdom or folly or as it often happens in both at once are but slowly accessible to the things of actual life their own destiny is a thing to them 
 there results from such concentration a passivity which if it were the outcome of reasoning would resemble philosophy 
 one declines descends trickles away even crumbles away and yet is hardly conscious of it self it always ends it is true in an awakening but the awakening is tardy in the meantime it seems as though we held ourselves neutral in the game which is going on between our happiness and our unhappiness we are the stake and we look on at the game with indifference 
 it is thus that athwart the cloud which formed about him when all his hopes were extinguished one after the other m mabeuf remained rather puerilely but profoundly serene 
 his habits of mind had the regular swing of a pendulum 
 once mounted on an illusion he went for a very long time even after the illusion had disappeared a clock does not stop short at the precise moment when the key is lost 
 m mabeuf had his innocent pleasures 
 these pleasures were inexpensive and unexpected the merest chance furnished them 
 one day mother plutarque was reading a romance in one corner of the room she was reading aloud finding that she understood better thus to read aloud is to assure self of what one is reading there are people who read very loud and who have the appearance of giving themselves their word of honor as to what they are perusing 
 it was with this sort of energy that mother plutarque was reading the romance which she had in hand 
 m mabeuf heard her without listening to her 
 in the course of her reading mother plutarque came to this phrase it was a question of an officer of dragoons and a beauty 
 the beauty pouted and the dragoon 
 here she interrupted herself to wipe her glasses 
 bouddha and the dragon struck in m mabeuf in a low voice yes it is true that there was a dragon which from the depths of its cave spouted flame through his maw and set the heavens on fire many stars had already been consumed by this monster which besides had the claws of a tiger 
 bouddha went into its den and succeeded in converting the dragon

 a few intimate friends were dining with the rostovs that day as usual on sundays 
 pierre came early so as to find them alone 
 he had grown so stout this year that he would have been abnormal had he not been so tall so broad of limb and so strong that he carried his bulk with evident ease 
 he went up the stairs puffing and muttering something his coachman did not even ask whether he was to wait he knew that when his master was at the rostovs he stayed till midnight the rostovs footman rushed eagerly forward to help him off with his cloak and take his hat and stick pierre from club habit always left both hat and stick in the anteroom 
 the first person he saw in the house was natasha even before he saw her while taking off his cloak he heard her she was practicing solfa exercises in the music room he knew that she had not sung since her illness and so the sound of her voice surprised and delighted him he opened the door softly and saw her in the lilac dress she had worn at church walking about the room singing she had her back to him when he opened the door but when turning quickly she saw his broad surprised face she blushed and came rapidly up to him 
 i want to try to sing again she said adding as if by way of excuse it is at least something to do 
 capital 
 how glad i am come i am so happy today she said with the old animation pierre had not seen in her for along time you know nicholas has received a st cross i am so proud of him 
 oh yes i sent that announcement but i want to interrupt you he added and was about to go to the drawing room 
 natasha stopped him 
 count is it wrong of me to sing she said blushing and fixing her eyes inquiringly on him 
 no why should it be on the contrary but why do you ask me 
 i know myself natasha answered quickly but i should not like to do anything you disapproved of i believe in you completely you know how important you are to me how much done for me she spoke rapidly and did not notice how pierre flushed at her words i saw in that same army order that he bolkonski she whispered the name hastily is in russia and in the army again what do you think she was speaking hurriedly evidently afraid her strength might fail her will he ever forgive me will he not always have a bitter feeling toward me what do you think what do you think 
 i think pierre replied that he has nothing to forgive if i were in his place 
 by association of ideas pierre was at once carried back to the day when trying to comfort her he had said that if he were not himself but the best man in the world and free he would ask on his knees for her hand and the same feeling of pity tenderness and love took possession of him and the same words rose to his lips but she did not give him time to say them 
 yes you you she said uttering the word you rapturously a different thing i know no one kinder more generous or better than you nobody could be had you not been there then and now too i know what would have become of me because 
 tears suddenly rose in her eyes she turned away lifted her music before her eyes began singing again and again began walking up and down the room 
 just then petya came running in from the drawing room 
 petya was now a handsome rosy lad of fifteen with full red lips and resembled natasha he was preparing to enter the university but he and his friend obolenski had lately in secret agreed to join the hussars 
 petya had come rushing out to talk to his namesake about this affair he had asked pierre to find out whether he would be accepted in the hussars 
 pierre walked up and down the drawing room not listening to what petya was saying 
 petya pulled him by the arm to attract his attention 
 well what about my plan peter kirilych for sake you are my only hope said petya 
 oh yes your plan to join the hussars mention it bring it all up today 
 well mon cher have you got the manifesto asked the old count the countess has been to mass at the razumovskis and heard the new prayer she says very fine 
 yes got it said pierre the emperor is to be here tomorrow to be an extraordinary meeting of the nobility and they are talking of a levy of ten men per thousand oh yes let me congratulate you 
 yes yes thank god well and what news from the army 
 we are again retreating they say already near smolensk replied pierre 
 o lord o lord exclaimed the count where is the manifesto 
 the appeal oh yes 
 pierre began feeling in his pockets for the papers but could not find them still slapping his pockets he kissed the hand of the countess who entered the room and glanced uneasily around evidently expecting natasha who had left off singing but had not yet come into the drawing room 
 on my word i know what done with it he said 
 there he is always losing everything remarked the countess 
 natasha entered with a softened and agitated expression of face and sat down looking silently at pierre as soon as she entered features which had been gloomy suddenly lighted up and while still searching for the papers he glanced at her several times 
 no really drive home i must have left them there certainly 
 but be late for dinner 
 oh and my coachman has gone 
 but sonya who had gone to look for the papers in the anteroom had found them in hat where he had carefully tucked them under the lining pierre was about to begin reading 
 no after dinner said the old count evidently expecting much enjoyment from that reading 
 at dinner at which champagne was drunk to the health of the new chevalier of st george shinshin told them the town news of the illness of the old georgian princess of disappearance from moscow and of how some german fellow had been brought to rostopchin and accused of being a french spyer so count rostopchin had told the story and how rostopchin let him go and assured the people that he was not a spire at all but only an old german ruin 
 people are being arrested said the count told the countess she should not speak french so much not the time for it now 
 and have you heard shinshin asked prince golitsyn has engaged a master to teach him russian it is becoming dangerous to speak french in the streets 
 and how about you count peter kirilych if they call up the militia you too will have to mount a horse remarked the old count addressing pierre 
 pierre had been silent and preoccupied all through dinner seeming not to grasp what was said he looked at the count 
 oh yes the war he said no what sort of warrior should i make and yet everything is so strange so strange i make it out i know i am very far from having military tastes but in these times no one can answer for himself 
 after dinner the count settled himself comfortably in an easy chair and with a serious face asked sonya who was considered an excellent reader to read the appeal 
 to moscow our ancient capital 
 the enemy has entered the borders of russia with immense forces he comes to despoil our beloved country 
 sonya read painstakingly in her voice the count listened with closed eyes heaving abrupt sighs at certain passages 
 natasha sat erect gazing with a searching look now at her father and now at pierre 
 pierre felt her eyes on him and tried not to look round the countess shook her head disapprovingly and angrily at every solemn expression in the manifesto in all these words she saw only that the danger threatening her son would not soon be over shinshin with a sarcastic smile on his lips was evidently preparing to make fun of anything that gave him the opportunity reading any remark of the or even the manifesto itself should no better pretext present itself 
 after reading about the dangers that threatened russia the hopes the emperor placed on moscow and especially on its illustrious nobility sonya with a quiver in her voice due chiefly to the attention that was being paid to her read the last words 
 we ourselves will not delay to appear among our people in that capital and in others parts of our realm for consultation and for the direction of all our levies both those now barring the path and those freshly formed to defeat him wherever he may appear may the ruin he hopes to bring upon us recoil on his own head and may europe delivered from bondage glorify the name of russia 
 yes it cried the count opening his moist eyes and sniffing repeatedly as if a strong vinaigrette had been held to his nose and he added let the emperor but say the word and sacrifice everything and begrudge nothing 
 before shinshin had time to utter the joke he was ready to make on the patriotism natasha jumped up from her place and ran to her father 
 what a darling our papa is she cried kissing him and she again looked at pierre with the unconscious coquetry that had returned to her with her better spirits 
 there a patriot for you said shinshin 
 not a patriot at all but simply natasha replied in an injured tone everything seems funny to you but this at all a joke 
 a joke indeed put in the count let him but say the word and all go not germans 
 but did you notice it says for consultation said pierre 
 never mind what for 
 at this moment petya to whom nobody was paying any attention came up to his father with a very flushed face and said in his breaking voice that was now deep and now shrill 
 well papa i tell you definitely and mamma too as you please but i say definitely that you must let me enter the army because i all 
 the countess in dismay looked up to heaven clasped her hands and turned angrily to her husband 
 that comes of your talking said she 
 but the count had already recovered from his excitement 
 come come said he a fine warrior no nonsense you must study 
 not nonsense papa fedya obolenski is younger than i and going too besides all the same i study now when petya stopped short flushed till he perspired but still got out the words when our fatherland is in danger 
 do do nonsense 
 but you said yourself that we would sacrifice everything 
 petya be quiet i tell you cried the count with a glance at his wife who had turned pale and was staring fixedly at her son 
 and i tell you peter kirilych here will also tell you 
 nonsense i tell you your milk has hardly dried on your lips and you want to go into the army there there i tell you and the count moved to go out of the room taking the papers probably to reread them in his study before having a nap 
 well peter kirilych go and have a smoke he said 
 pierre was agitated and undecided unwontedly brilliant eyes continually glancing at him with a more than cordial look had reduced him to this condition 
 no i think go home 
 home why you meant to spend the evening with us you often come nowadays as it is and this girl of mine said the count pointing to natasha only brightens up when here 
 yes i had forgotten i really must go home business said pierre hurriedly 
 well then au revoir said the count and went out of the room 
 why are you going why are you upset asked natasha and she looked challengingly into eyes 
 because i love you was what he wanted to say but he did not say it and only blushed till the tears came and lowered his eyes 
 because it is better for me to come less often because no simply i have business 
 why no tell me natasha began resolutely and suddenly stopped 
 they looked at each other with dismayed and embarrassed faces he tried to smile but could not his smile expressed suffering and he silently kissed her hand and went out 
 pierre made up his mind not to go to the rostovs any more

 poverty a good neighbor for misery 
 marius liked this candid old man who saw himself gradually falling into the clutches of indigence and who came to feel astonishment little by little without however being made melancholy by it marius met courfeyrac and sought out m mabeuf 
 very rarely however twice a month at most 
 marius pleasure consisted in taking long walks alone on the outer boulevards or in the or in the least frequented alleys of the luxembourg 
 he often spent half a day in gazing at a market garden the beds of lettuce the chickens on the the horse turning the the stared at him in surprise and some of them thought his attire suspicious and his mien sinister he was only a poor young man dreaming in an objectless way 
 it was during one of his strolls that he had hit upon the gorbeau house and tempted by its isolation and its cheapness had taken up his abode there 
 he was known there only under the name of m marius 
 some of his old generals or old comrades had invited him to go and see them when they learned about him 
 marius had not refused their invitations 
 they afforded opportunities of talking about his father 
 thus he went from time to time to comte pajol to general bellavesne to general fririon to the invalides there was music and dancing there 
 on such evenings marius put on his new coat 
 but he never went to these evening parties or balls except on days when it was freezing cold because he could not afford a carriage and he did not wish to arrive with boots otherwise than like mirrors 
 he said sometimes but without bitterness 
 men are so made that in a you may be soiled everywhere except on your shoes in order to insure a good reception there only one irreproachable thing is asked of you your conscience 
 no your boots 
 all passions except those of the heart are dissipated by revery marius political fevers vanished thus 
 the revolution of assisted in the process by satisfying and calming him he remained the same setting aside his fits of wrath he still held the same opinions 
 only they had been tempered to speak accurately he had no longer any opinions he had sympathies to what party did he belong 
 to the party of humanity 
 out of humanity he chose france out of the nation he chose the people out of the people he chose the woman 
 it was to that point above all that his pity was directed 
 now he preferred an idea to a deed a poet to a hero and he admired a book like job more than an event like marengo 
 and then when after a day spent in meditation he returned in the evening through the boulevards and caught a glimpse through the branches of the trees of the fathomless space beyond the nameless gleams the abyss the shadow the mystery all that which is only human seemed very pretty indeed to him 
 he thought that he had and he really had in fact arrived at the truth of life and of human philosophy and he had ended by gazing at nothing but heaven the only thing which truth can perceive from the bottom of her well 
 this did not prevent him from multiplying his plans his combinations his scaffoldings his projects for the future 
 in this state of revery an eye which could have cast a glance into marius interior would have been dazzled with the purity of that soul in fact had it been given to our eyes of the flesh to gaze into the consciences of others we should be able to judge a man much more surely according to what he dreams than according to what he thinks 
 there is will in thought there is none in dreams revery which is utterly spontaneous takes and keeps even in the gigantic and the ideal the form of our spirit 
 nothing proceeds more directly and more sincerely from the very depth of our soul than our unpremeditated and boundless aspirations towards the splendors of destiny 
 in these aspirations much more than in deliberate rational coordinated ideas is the real character of a man to be found 
 our chimeras are the things which the most resemble us each one of us dreams of the unknown and the impossible in accordance with his nature 
 towards the middle of this year the old woman who waited on marius told him that his neighbors the wretched jondrette family had been turned out of doors 
 marius who passed nearly the whole of his days out of the house hardly knew that he had any neighbors 
 why are they turned out he asked 
 because they do not pay their rent they owe for two quarters 
 how much is it 
 twenty francs said the old woman 
 marius had thirty francs saved up in a drawer 
 here he said to the old woman take these francs pay for the poor people and give them five francs and do not tell them that it was i

 chapter xxi 
 
 after the definite refusal he had received petya went to his room and there locked himself in and wept bitterly when he came in to tea silent morose and with face everybody pretended not to notice anything 
 next day the emperor arrived in moscow and several of the rostovs domestic serfs begged permission to go to have a look at him that morning petya was a long time dressing and arranging his hair and collar to look like a man he frowned before his looking glass gesticulated shrugged his shoulders and finally without saying a word to anyone took his cap and left the house by the back door trying to avoid notice petya decided to go straight to where the emperor was and to explain frankly to some he imagined the emperor to be always surrounded by that he count rostov in spite of his youth wished to serve his country that youth could be no hindrance to loyalty and that he was ready to while dressing petya had prepared many fine things he meant to say to the 
 it was on the very fact of being so young that petya counted for success in reaching the emperor he even thought how surprised everyone would be at his youthfulness and yet in the arrangement of his collar and hair and by his sedate deliberate walk he wished to appear a man but the farther he went and the more his attention was diverted by the crowds moving toward the kremlin the less he remembered to walk with the sedateness and deliberation of a man as he approached the kremlin he even began to avoid being crushed and resolutely stuck out his elbows in a menacing way but within the trinity gateway he was so pressed to the wall by people who probably were unaware of the patriotic intentions with which he had come that in spite of all his determination he had to give in and stop while carriages passed in rumbling beneath the archway beside petya stood a peasant woman a footman two tradesmen and a discharged soldier after standing some time in the gateway petya tried to move forward in front of the others without waiting for all the carriages to pass and he began resolutely working his way with his elbows but the woman just in front of him who was the first against whom he directed his efforts angrily shouted at him 
 what are you shoving for young lordling you see all standing still then why push 
 anybody can shove said the footman and also began working his elbows to such effect that he pushed petya into a very filthy corner of the gateway 
 petya wiped his perspiring face with his hands and pulled up the damp collar which he had arranged so well at home to seem like a 
 he felt that he no longer looked presentable and feared that if he were now to approach the in that plight he would not be admitted to the emperor but it was impossible to smarten oneself up or move to another place because of the crowd one of the generals who drove past was an acquaintance of the rostovs and petya thought of asking his help but came to the conclusion that that would not be a manly thing to do when the carriages had all passed in the crowd carrying petya with it streamed forward into the kremlin square which was already full of people there were people not only in the square but everywhere on the slopes and on the roofs as soon as petya found himself in the square he clearly heard the sound of bells and the joyous voices of the crowd that filled the whole kremlin 
 for a while the crowd was less dense but suddenly all heads were bared and everyone rushed forward in one direction petya was being pressed so that he could scarcely breathe and everybody shouted hurrah hurrah hurrah petya stood on tiptoe and pushed and pinched but could see nothing except the people about him 
 all the faces bore the same expression of excitement and enthusiasm a wife standing beside petya sobbed and the tears ran down her cheeks 
 father angel dear one she kept repeating wiping away her tears with her fingers 
 hurrah was heard on all sides 
 for a moment the crowd stood still but then it made another rush forward 
 quite beside himself petya clinching his teeth and rolling his eyes ferociously pushed forward elbowing his way and shouting hurrah as if he were prepared that instant to kill himself and everyone else but on both sides of him other people with similarly ferocious faces pushed forward and everybody shouted hurrah 
 so this is what the emperor is thought petya no i petition him myself that would be too bold but in spite of this he continued to struggle desperately forward and from between the backs of those in front he caught glimpses of an open space with a strip of red cloth spread out on it but just then the crowd swayed back the police in front were pushing back those who had pressed too close to the procession the emperor was passing from the palace to the cathedral of the assumption and petya unexpectedly received such a blow on his side and ribs and was squeezed so hard that suddenly everything grew dim before his eyes and he lost consciousness when he came to himself a man of clerical appearance with a tuft of gray hair at the back of his head and wearing a shabby blue cassock probably a church clerk and chanter was holding him under the arm with one hand while warding off the pressure of the crowd with the other 
 crushed the young gentleman said the clerk what are you up to gently crushed him crushed him 
 the emperor entered the cathedral of the assumption the crowd spread out again more evenly and the clerk led petya pale and breathless to the several people were sorry for petya and suddenly a crowd turned toward him and pressed round him those who stood nearest him attended to him unbuttoned his coat seated him on the raised platform of the cannon and reproached those others whoever they might be who had crushed him 
 one might easily get killed that way what do they mean by it killing people poor dear as white as a sheet various voices were heard saying 
 petya soon came to himself the color returned to his face the pain had passed and at the cost of that temporary unpleasantness he had obtained a place by the cannon from where he hoped to see the emperor who would be returning that way petya no longer thought of presenting his petition if he could only see the emperor he would be happy 
 while the service was proceeding in the cathedral of the assumption it was a combined service of prayer on the occasion of the arrival and of thanksgiving for the conclusion of peace with the turks the crowd outside spread out and hawkers appeared selling kvas gingerbread and poppyseed sweets of which petya was particularly fond and ordinary conversation could again be heard a wife was showing a rent in her shawl and telling how much the shawl had cost another was saying that all silk goods had now got dear the clerk who had rescued petya was talking to a functionary about the priests who were officiating that day with the bishop the clerk several times used the word plenary of the service a word petya did not understand two young citizens were joking with some serf girls who were cracking nuts all these conversations especially the joking with the girls were such as might have had a particular charm for petya at his age but they did not interest him now he sat on his elevation the pedestal of the cannon still agitated as before by the thought of the emperor and by his love for him the feeling of pain and fear he had experienced when he was being crushed together with that of rapture still further intensified his sense of the importance of the occasion 
 suddenly the sound of a firing of cannon was heard from the embankment to celebrate the signing of peace with the turks and the crowd rushed impetuously toward the embankment to watch the firing petya too would have run there but the clerk who had taken the young gentleman under his protection stopped him the firing was still proceeding when officers generals and came running out of the cathedral and after them others in a more leisurely manner caps were again raised and those who had run to look at the cannon ran back again at last four men in uniforms and sashes emerged from the cathedral doors hurrah hurrah shouted the crowd again 
 which is he which asked petya in a tearful voice of those around him but no one answered him everybody was too excited and petya fixing on one of those four men whom he could not clearly see for the tears of joy that filled his eyes concentrated all his enthusiasm on him though it happened not to be the emperor frantically shouted hurrah and resolved that tomorrow come what might he would join the army 
 the crowd ran after the emperor followed him to the palace and began to disperse it was already late and petya had not eaten anything and was drenched with perspiration yet he did not go home but stood with that diminishing but still considerable crowd before the palace while the emperor dined looking in at the palace windows expecting he knew not what and envying alike the notables he saw arriving at the entrance to dine with the emperor and the court footmen who served at table glimpses of whom could be seen through the windows 
 while the emperor was dining valuev looking out of the window said 
 the people are still hoping to see your majesty again 
 the dinner was nearly over and the emperor munching a biscuit rose and went out onto the balcony the people with petya among them rushed toward the balcony 
 angel dear one hurrah father cried the crowd and petya with it and again the women and men of weaker mold petya among them wept with joy 
 a largish piece of the biscuit the emperor was holding in his hand broke off fell on the balcony parapet and then to the ground a coachman in a jerkin who stood nearest sprang forward and snatched it up several people in the crowd rushed at the coachman seeing this the emperor had a plateful of biscuits brought him and began throwing them down from the balcony eyes grew bloodshot and still more excited by the danger of being crushed he rushed at the biscuits he did not know why but he had to have a biscuit from the hand and he felt that he must not give way he sprang forward and upset an old woman who was catching at a biscuit the old woman did not consider herself defeated though she was lying on the ground she grabbed at some biscuits but her hand did not reach them petya pushed her hand away with his knee seized a biscuit and as if fearing to be too late again shouted hurrah with a voice already hoarse 
 the emperor went in and after that the greater part of the crowd began to disperse 
 there i said if only we waited and so it was was being joyfully said by various people 
 happy as petya was he felt sad at having to go home knowing that all the enjoyment of that day was over he did not go straight home from the kremlin but called on his friend obolenski who was fifteen and was also entering the regiment on returning home petya announced resolutely and firmly that if he was not allowed to enter the service he would run away and next day count ilya rostov though he had not yet quite yielded went to inquire how he could arrange for petya to serve where there would be least danger

 chapter vi 
 
 the substitute 
 it chanced that the regiment to which lieutenant theodule belonged came to perform garrison duty in paris 
 this inspired aunt gillenormand with a second idea 
 she had on the first occasion hit upon the plan of having marius spied upon by theodule now she plotted to have theodule take marius place 
 at all events and in case the grandfather should feel the vague need of a young face in the rays of dawn are sometimes sweet to was expedient to find another marius 
 take it as a simple erratum she thought such as one sees in books for marius read theodule 
 a grandnephew is almost the same as a grandson in default of a lawyer one takes a lancer 
 one morning when m gillenormand was about to read something in the quotidienne his daughter entered and said to him in her sweetest voice for the question concerned her favorite 
 father theodule is coming to present his respects to you this morning 
 theodule 
 your grandnephew 
 ah said the grandfather 
 then he went back to his reading thought no more of his grandnephew who was merely some theodule or other and soon flew into a rage which almost always happened when he read 
 the sheet which he held although royalist of course announced for the following day without any softening phrases one of these little events which were of daily occurrence at that date in paris 
 that the students of the schools of law and medicine were to assemble on the place du pantheon at deliberate 
 the discussion concerned one of the questions of the moment the artillery of the national guard and a conflict between the minister of war and the militia on the subject of the cannon parked in the courtyard of the louvre the students were to deliberate over this 
 it did not take much more than this to swell m rage 
 he thought of marius who was a student and who would probably go with the rest to deliberate at midday on the place du pantheon 
 as he was indulging in this painful dream lieutenant theodule entered clad in plain clothes as a bourgeois which was clever of him and was discreetly introduced by mademoiselle gillenormand the lancer had reasoned as follows 
 the old druid has not sunk all his money in a life pension 
 it is well to disguise self as a civilian from time to time 
 mademoiselle gillenormand said aloud to her father 
 theodule your grandnephew 
 and in a low voice to the lieutenant 
 approve of everything 
 and she withdrew 
 the lieutenant who was but little accustomed to such venerable encounters stammered with some timidity 
 good day uncle and made a salute composed of the involuntary and mechanical outline of the military salute finished off as a bourgeois salute 
 ah so you that is well sit down said the old gentleman 
 that said he totally forgot the lancer 
 theodule seated himself and m gillenormand rose 
 m gillenormand began to pace back and forth his hands in his pockets talking aloud and twitching with his irritated old fingers at the two watches which he wore in his two fobs 
 that pack of brats they convene on the place du pantheon by my life urchins who were with their nurses but yesterday if one were to squeeze their noses milk would burst out and they deliberate at midday 
 what are we coming to what are we coming to 
 it is clear that we are making for the abyss that is what the descamisados have brought us to 
 to deliberate on the citizen artillery 
 to go and jabber in the open air over the jibes of the national guard 
 and with whom are they to meet there just see whither jacobinism leads 
 i will bet anything you like a million against a counter that there will be no one there but returned convicts and released the republicans and the form but one nose and one handkerchief carnot used to say 
 where would you have me go traitor fouche replied 
 wherever you please imbecile 
 what the republicans are like 
 that is true said theodule 
 m gillenormand half turned his head saw theodule and went on 
 when one reflects that that scoundrel was so vile as to turn carbonaro why did you leave my house 
 to go and become a republican 
 pssst in the first place the people want none of your republic they have common sense they know well that there always have been kings and that there always will be they know well that the people are only the people after all they make sport of it of your republic do you understand idiot 
 is it not a horrible caprice 
 to fall in love with pere duchesne to make at the guillotine to sing romances and play on the guitar under the balcony of enough to make one spit on all these young fellows such fools are they 
 they are all alike 
 not one escapes it suffices for them to breathe the air which blows through the street to lose their senses 
 the nineteenth century is poison the first scamp that happens along lets his beard grow like a thinks himself a real scoundrel and abandons his old relatives a republican a romantic 
 what does that mean romantic do me the favor to tell me what it is 
 all possible follies a year ago they ran to hernani 
 now i just ask you hernani antitheses abominations which are not even written in french and then they have cannons in the courtyard of the louvre such are the rascalities of this age 
 you are right uncle said theodule 
 m gillenormand resumed 
 cannons in the courtyard of the museum 
 for what purpose do you want to fire at the apollo belvedere 
 what have those cartridges to do with the venus de medici 
 oh the young men of the present day are all blackguards 
 what a pretty creature is their benjamin constant 
 and those who are not rascals are simpletons they do all they can to make themselves ugly they are badly dressed they are afraid of women in the presence of petticoats they have a mendicant air which sets the girls into fits of laughter on my word of honor one would say the poor creatures were ashamed of love they are deformed and they complete themselves by being stupid they repeat the puns of tiercelin and potier they have sack coats waistcoats shirts of coarse linen trousers of coarse cloth boots of coarse leather and their rigmarole resembles their plumage one might make use of their jargon to put new soles on their old shoes and all this awkward batch of brats has political opinions if you please 
 political opinions should be strictly forbidden they fabricate systems they recast society they demolish the monarchy they fling all laws to the earth they put the attic in the place and my porter in the place of the king they turn europe they reconstruct the world and all their love affairs consist in staring slily at the ankles of the laundresses as these women climb into their carts 
 ah 
 marius 
 ah you blackguard to go and vociferate on the public place to discuss to debate to take measures 
 they call that measures just god disorder humbles itself and becomes silly 
 i have seen chaos i now see a mess 
 students deliberating on the national guard such a thing could not be seen among the ogibewas nor the cadodaches savages who go naked with their noddles dressed like a shuttlecock with a club in their paws are less of brutes than those bachelors of arts 
 the monkeys 
 and they set up for judges those creatures deliberate and ratiocinate 
 the end of the world is come 
 this is plainly the end of this miserable terraqueous globe a final hiccough was required and france has emitted it deliberate my rascals 
 such things will happen so long as they go and read the newspapers under the arcades of the odeon that costs them a sou and their good sense and their intelligence and their heart and their soul and their wits 
 they emerge thence and decamp from their families 
 all newspapers are pests all even the drapeau blanc 
 at bottom martainville was a jacobin 
 ah just heaven you may boast of having driven your grandfather to despair that you may 
 that is evident said theodule 
 and profiting by the fact that m gillenormand was taking breath the lancer added in a magisterial manner 
 there should be no other newspaper than the moniteur and no other book than the annuaire militaire 
 m gillenormand continued 
 it is like their sieyes 
 a regicide ending in a senator for that is the way they always end 
 they give themselves a scar with the address of thou as citizens in order to get themselves called eventually monsieur le comte 
 monsieur le comte as big as my arm assassins of september 
 the philosopher sieyes i will do myself the justice to say that i have never had any better opinion of the philosophies of all those philosophers than of the spectacles of the grimacer of tivoli 
 one day i saw the senators cross the quai malplaquet in mantles of violet velvet sown with bees with hats a la henri iv 
 they were hideous 
 one would have pronounced them monkeys from the court 
 citizens i declare to you that your progress is madness that your humanity is a dream that your revolution is a crime that your republic is a monster that your young and virgin france comes from the brothel and i maintain it against all whoever you may be whether journalists economists legists or even were you better judges of liberty of equality and fraternity than the knife of the guillotine and that i announce to you my flne fellows

 chapter xxii 
 
 two days later on the fifteenth of july an immense number of carriages were standing outside the sloboda palace 
 the great halls were full in the first were the nobility and gentry in their uniforms in the second bearded merchants in coats of blue cloth and wearing medals in the hall there was an incessant movement and buzz of voices the chief magnates sat on chairs at a large table under the portrait of the emperor but most of the gentry were strolling about the room 
 all these nobles whom pierre met every day at the club or in their own houses were in uniform some in that of day others in that of emperor paul others again in the new uniforms of time or the ordinary uniform of the nobility and the general characteristic of being in uniform imparted something strange and fantastic to these diverse and familiar personalities both old and young the old men toothless bald sallow and bloated or gaunt and wrinkled were especially striking for the most part they sat quietly in their places and were silent or if they walked about and talked attached themselves to someone younger on all these faces as on the faces of the crowd petya had seen in the square there was a striking contradiction the general expectation of a solemn event and at the same time the everyday interests in a boston card party peter the cook zinaida health and so on 
 pierre was there too buttoned up since early morning in a uniform that had become too tight for him he was agitated this extraordinary gathering not only of nobles but also of the les etats generaux evoked in him a whole series of ideas he had long laid aside but which were deeply graven in his soul thoughts of the contrat social and the french revolution the words that had struck him in the appeal that the sovereign was coming to the capital for consultation with his people strengthened this idea and imagining that in this direction something important which he had long awaited was drawing near he strolled about watching and listening to conversations but nowhere finding any confirmation of the ideas that occupied him 
 the manifesto was read evoking enthusiasm and then all moved about discussing it besides the ordinary topics of conversation pierre heard questions of where the marshals of the nobility were to stand when the emperor entered when a ball should be given in the honor whether they should group themselves by districts or by whole provinces and so on but as soon as the war was touched on or what the nobility had been convened for the talk became undecided and indefinite then all preferred listening to speaking 
 a man handsome and virile in the uniform of a retired naval officer was speaking in one of the rooms and a small crowd was pressing round him pierre went up to the circle that had formed round the speaker and listened count ilya rostov in a military uniform of time was sauntering with a pleasant smile among the crowd with all of whom he was acquainted he too approached that group and listened with a kindly smile and nods of approval as he always did to what the speaker was saying the retired naval man was speaking very boldly as was evident from the expression on the faces of the listeners and from the fact that some people pierre knew as the meekest and quietest of men walked away disapprovingly or expressed disagreement with him pierre pushed his way into the middle of the group listened and convinced himself that the man was indeed a liberal but of views quite different from his own the naval officer spoke in a particularly sonorous musical and aristocratic baritone voice pleasantly swallowing his and generally slurring his consonants the voice of a man calling out to his servant heah bwing me my pipe it was indicative of dissipation and the exercise of authority 
 what if the smolensk people have offahd to waise militia for the empewah ah we to take smolensk as our if the noble awistocwacy of the pwovince of moscow thinks fit it can show its loyalty to our the empewah in other ways have we the waising of the militia in the yeah seven all that did was to enwich the pwiests sons and thieves and wobbahs 
 count ilya rostov smiled blandly and nodded approval 
 and was our militia of any use to the empia not at all it only wuined our farming bettah have another conscwiption o ou men will neithah soldiers no peasants and get only depwavity fwom them the nobility gwudge theah lives evewy one of us will go and bwing in more wecwuits and the that was the way he referred to the emperor need only say the word and all die fo him added the orator with animation 
 count mouth watered with pleasure and he nudged pierre but pierre wanted to speak himself he pushed forward feeling stirred but not yet sure what stirred him or what he would say scarcely had he opened his mouth when one of the senators a man without a tooth in his head with a shrewd though angry expression standing near the first speaker interrupted him evidently accustomed to managing debates and to maintaining an argument he began in low but distinct tones 
 i imagine sir said he mumbling with his toothless mouth that we have been summoned here not to discuss whether best for the empire at the present moment to adopt conscription or to call out the militia we have been summoned to reply to the appeal with which our sovereign the emperor has honored us but to judge what is best conscription or the militia we can leave to the supreme authority 
 pierre suddenly saw an outlet for his excitement he hardened his heart against the senator who was introducing this set and narrow attitude into the deliberations of the nobility pierre stepped forward and interrupted him he himself did not yet know what he would say but he began to speak eagerly occasionally lapsing into french or expressing himself in bookish russian 
 excuse me your excellency he began he was well acquainted with the senator but thought it necessary on this occasion to address him formally though i agree with the gentleman he hesitated he wished to say mon tres honorable preopinant my very honorable opponent with the gentleman whom i have not the honor of knowing i suppose that the nobility have been summoned not merely to express their sympathy and enthusiasm but also to consider the means by which we can assist our fatherland i imagine he went on warming to his subject that the emperor himself would not be satisfied to find in us merely owners of serfs whom we are willing to devote to his service and chair a canon we are ready to make of ourselves and not to obtain from us any 
 food for cannon 
 many persons withdrew from the circle noticing the sarcastic smile and the freedom of remarks only count rostov was pleased with them as he had been pleased with those of the naval officer the senator and in general with whatever speech he had last heard 
 i think that before discussing these questions pierre continued we should ask the emperor most respectfully ask his majesty to let us know the number of our troops and the position in which our army and our forces now are and then 
 but scarcely had pierre uttered these words before he was attacked from three sides the most vigorous attack came from an old acquaintance a boston player who had always been well disposed toward him stepan stepanovich adraksin adraksin was in uniform and whether as a result of the uniform or from some other cause pierre saw before him quite a different man with a sudden expression of malevolence on his aged face adraksin shouted at pierre 
 in the first place i tell you we have no right to question the emperor about that and secondly if the russian nobility had that right the emperor could not answer such a question the troops are moved according to the movements and the number of men increases and decreases 
 another voice that of a nobleman of medium height and about forty years of age whom pierre had formerly met at the gypsies and knew as a bad cardplayer and who also transformed by his uniform came up to pierre interrupted adraksin 
 yes and this is not a time for discussing he continued but for acting there is war in russia the enemy is advancing to destroy russia to desecrate the tombs of our fathers to carry off our wives and children the nobleman smote his breast we will all arise every one of us will go for our father the tsar he shouted rolling his bloodshot eyes several approving voices were heard in the crowd we are russians and will not grudge our blood in defense of our faith the throne and the fatherland we must cease raving if we are sons of our fatherland we will show europe how russia rises to the defense of russia 
 pierre wished to reply but could not get in a word he felt that his words apart from what meaning they conveyed were less audible than the sound of his voice 
 count rostov at the back of the crowd was expressing approval several persons briskly turning a shoulder to the orator at the end of a phrase said 
 right quite right just so 
 pierre wished to say that he was ready to sacrifice his money his serfs or himself only one ought to know the state of affairs in order to be able to improve it but he was unable to speak many voices shouted and talked at the same time so that count rostov had not time to signify his approval of them all and the group increased dispersed and then moved with a hum of talk into the largest hall and to the big table not only was attempt to speak unsuccessful but he was rudely interrupted pushed aside and people turned away from him as from a common enemy this happened not because they were displeased by the substance of his speech which had even been forgotten after the many subsequent speeches but to animate it the crowd needed a tangible object to love and a tangible object to hate pierre became the latter many other orators spoke after the excited nobleman and all in the same tone many spoke eloquently and with originality 
 glinka the editor of the russian messenger who was recognized cries of author author were heard in the crowd said that hell must be repulsed by hell and that he had seen a child smiling at lightning flashes and thunderclaps but we will not be that child 
 yes yes at thunderclaps was repeated approvingly in the back rows of the crowd 
 the crowd drew up to the large table at which sat or bald magnates uniformed and besashed almost all of whom pierre had seen in their own homes with their buffoons or playing boston at the clubs with an incessant hum of voices the crowd advanced to the table pressed by the throng against the high backs of the chairs the orators spoke one after another and sometimes two together those standing behind noticed what a speaker omitted to say and hastened to supply it others in that heat and crush racked their brains to find some thought and hastened to utter it the old magnates whom pierre knew sat and turned to look first at one and then at another and their faces for the most part only expressed the fact that they found it very hot pierre however felt excited and the general desire to show that they were ready to go to all lengths which found expression in the tones and looks more than in the substance of the speeches infected him too he did not renounce his opinions but felt himself in some way to blame and wished to justify himself 
 i only said that it would be more to the purpose to make sacrifices when we know what is needed said he trying to be heard above the other voices 
 one of the old men nearest to him looked round but his attention was immediately diverted by an exclamation at the other side of the table 
 yes moscow will be surrendered she will be our expiation shouted one man 
 he is the enemy of mankind cried another allow me to speak gentlemen you are crushing me

 of travel 
 travel in the younger sort is a part of education in the elder a part of experience he that travelleth into a country before he hath some entrance into the language goeth to school and not to travel that young men travel under some tutor or grave servant i allow well so that he be such a one that hath the language and hath been in the country before whereby he may be able to tell them what things are worthy to be seen in the country where they go what acquaintances they are to seek what exercises or discipline the place yieldeth 
 for else young men shall go hooded and look abroad little it is a strange thing that in sea voyages where there is nothing to be seen but sky and sea men should make diaries but in wherein so much is to be obscured for the most part they omit it as if chance were fitter to be registered than observation let diaries therefore be brought in use the things to be seen and observed are the courts of princes specially when they give audience to ambassadors the courts of justice while they sit and hear causes and 
 so of consistories ecclesiastics the churches and monasteries with the monuments which are therein extant the walls and fortifications of cities and towns and so the havens and harbours antiquities and ruins libraries colleges disputations and lectures where any are shipping and navies houses and gardens of state and pleasure near great cities armories arsenals magazines exchanges bourses warehouses exercises of horsemanship fencing training of soldiers and the like comedies such whereunto the better sort of persons do resort treasuries of jewels and robes cabinets and rarities and to conclude whatsoever is memorable in the places where they go after all which the tutors or servants ought to make diligent enquiry as for triumphs masques feasts weddings funerals capital executions and such shows men need not to be put in mind of them yet are they not to be neglected 
 if you will have a young man to put his travel into a little room and in short time to gather much this you must do first as was said he must have some entrance into the language before he goeth then he must have such a servant or tutor as knoweth the country as was likewise said let him carry with him also some card or book describing the country where he travelleth which will be a good key to his enquiry let him keep also a diary let him not stay 
 long in one city or town more or less as the place deserveth but not long nay 
 when he stayeth in one city or town let him change his lodging from one end and part of the town to another which is a great adamant of acquaintance let him sequester himself from the company of his countrymen and diet in such places where mere is good company of the nation where he travelleth let him upon his removes from one place to another procure recommendation to some person of quality residing in the place whither he removeth that he may use his favour in those things he desireth to see or know 
 thus he may abridge his travel with much profit as for the acquaintance 
 which is to be sought in travel that which is most of all profitable is acquaintance with the secretaries and employed men of ambassadors for so in travelling in one country he shall suck the experience of many let him also see and visit imminent persons in all kinds which are of great fame abroad that he may be able to tell how the life agreeth with the same for quarrels they are with care and discretion to be avoided they are commonly for mistresses healths place and words 
 and let a man beware how he keepeth company with choleric and quarrelsome persons for they will engage him into their own quarrels when a traveller returneth home let him not leave the countries where he hath travelled altogether behind him but maintain a correspondence by letters with those of his acquaintance which are of most worth 
 and let his travel appear rather in his discourse than in his apparel 
 or gesture and in his discourse let him be rather advised in his answers then 
 forwards to tell stories and let it appear that he doth not change his country 
 manners for those of foreign parts but only prick in some flowers of mat he hath learned abroad into the customs of his own country

 book fall 
 chapter iii 
 
 the heroism of passive obedience 
 the door opened 
 it opened wide with a rapid movement as though some one had given it an energetic and resolute push 
 a man entered 
 we already know the man 
 it was the wayfarer whom we have seen wandering about in search of shelter 
 he entered advanced a step and halted leaving the door open behind him 
 he had his knapsack on his shoulders his cudgel in his hand a rough audacious weary and violent expression in his eyes 
 the fire on the hearth lighted him up 
 he was hideous it was a sinister apparition 
 madame magloire had not even the strength to utter a cry she trembled and stood with her mouth wide open 
 mademoiselle baptistine turned round beheld the man entering and half started up in terror then turning her head by degrees towards the fireplace again she began to observe her brother and her face became once more profoundly calm and serene 
 the bishop fixed a tranquil eye on the man 
 as he opened his mouth doubtless to ask the what he desired the man rested both hands on his staff directed his gaze at the old man and the two women and without waiting for the bishop to speak he said in a loud voice 
 see here 
 my name is jean valjean 
 i am a convict from the galleys i have passed nineteen years in the galleys 
 i was liberated four days ago and am on my way to pontarlier which is my destination i have been walking for four days since i left toulon 
 i have travelled a dozen leagues on foot 
 this evening when i arrived in these parts i went to an inn and they turned me out because of my yellow passport which i had shown at the i had to do it 
 i went to an inn 
 they said to me be off at both places 
 no one would take me 
 i went to the prison the jailer would not admit me 
 i went into a kennel the dog bit me and chased me off as though he had been a man one would have said that he knew who i was 
 i went into the fields intending to sleep in the open air beneath the stars 
 there were no stars 
 i thought it was going to rain and i the town to seek the recess of a doorway 
 yonder in the square i meant to sleep on a stone bench 
 a good woman pointed out your house to me and said to me knock there 
 i have knocked what is this place 
 do you keep an inn 
 i have one hundred and nine francs fifteen sous which i earned in the galleys by my labor in the course of nineteen years i will pay 
 what is that to me 
 i have money 
 i am very weary twelve leagues on foot i am very hungry 
 are you willing that i should remain 
 madame magloire said the bishop you will set another place 
 the man advanced three paces and approached the lamp which was on the table 
 stop he resumed as though he had not quite understood not it 
 did you hear 
 i am a a convict i come from the galleys 
 he drew from his pocket a large sheet of yellow paper which he unfolded 
 my passport 
 yellow as you see 
 this serves to expel me from every place where i go will you read it 
 i know how to read 
 i learned in the galleys there is a school there for those who choose to learn 
 hold this is what they put on this passport 
 jean valjean discharged convict native is nothing to been nineteen years in the galleys 
 five years for and burglary fourteen years for having attempted to escape on four occasions he is a very dangerous man 
 there 
 every one has cast me out are you willing to receive me 
 is this an inn 
 will you give me something to eat and a bed 
 have you a stable 
 madame magloire said the bishop you will put white sheets on the bed in the alcove 
 we have already explained the character of the two obedience 
 madame magloire retired to execute these orders 
 the bishop turned to the man 
 sit down sir and warm yourself 
 we are going to sup in a few moments and your bed will be prepared while you are supping 
 at this point the man suddenly comprehended 
 the expression of his face up to that time sombre and harsh bore the imprint of stupefaction of doubt of joy and became extraordinary he began stammering like a crazy man 
 really 
 what 
 you will keep me 
 you do not drive me forth a convict 
 you call me sir 
 you do not address me as thou get out of here you dog is what people always say to me 
 i felt sure that you would expel me so i told you at once who i am 
 oh what a good woman that was who directed me hither 
 i am going to sup a bed with a mattress and sheets like the rest of the world a bed it is nineteen years since i have slept in a bed 
 you actually do not want me to go 
 you are good people 
 besides i have money i will pay well 
 pardon me monsieur the but what is your name 
 i will pay anything you ask 
 you are a fine man you are an are you not 
 i am replied the bishop a priest who lives here 
 a priest said the man 
 oh what a fine priest 
 then you are not going to demand any money of me 
 you are the cure are you not the cure of this big church 
 well 
 i am a fool truly i had not perceived your 
 as he spoke he deposited his knapsack and his cudgel in a corner replaced his passport in his pocket and seated himself mademoiselle baptistine gazed mildly at him 
 he continued 
 you are humane monsieur le cure you have not scorned me a good priest is a very good thing 
 then you do not require me to pay 
 no said the bishop keep your money 
 how much have you did you not tell me one hundred and nine francs 
 and fifteen sous added the man 
 one hundred and nine francs fifteen sous 
 and how long did it take you to earn that 
 nineteen years 
 nineteen years 
 the bishop sighed deeply 
 the man continued 
 i have still the whole of my money in four days i have spent only sous which i earned by helping unload some wagons at grasse 
 since you are an abbe i will tell you that we had a chaplain in the galleys 
 and one day i saw a bishop there 
 monseigneur is what they call him 
 he was the bishop of majore at marseilles 
 he is the cure who rules over the other cures you understand 
 pardon me i say that very badly but it is such a thing to me 
 you understand what we are he said mass in the middle of the galleys on an altar 
 he had a pointed thing made of gold on his head it glittered in the bright light of midday 
 we were all ranged in lines on the three sides with cannons with lighted matches facing us 
 we could not see very well 
 he spoke but he was too far off and we did not hear that is what a bishop is like 
 while he was speaking the bishop had gone and shut the door which had remained wide open 
 madame magloire returned 
 she brought a silver fork and spoon which she placed on the table 
 madame magloire said the bishop place those things as near the fire as possible 
 and turning to his guest 
 the night wind is harsh on the alps 
 you must be cold sir 
 each time that he uttered the word sir in his voice which was so gently grave and polished the face lighted up 
 monsieur to a convict is like a glass of water to one of the shipwrecked of the medusa ignominy thirsts for consideration 
 this lamp gives a very bad light said the bishop 
 madame magloire understood him and went to get the two silver candlesticks from the in and placed them lighted on the table 
 monsieur le cure said the man you are good you do not despise me you receive me into your house 
 you light your candles for me yet i have not concealed from you whence i come and that i am an unfortunate man 
 the bishop who was sitting close to him gently touched his hand you could not help telling me who you were 
 this is not my house it is the house of jesus christ 
 this door does not demand of him who enters whether he has a name but whether he has a grief you suffer you are hungry and thirsty you are welcome and do not thank me do not say that i receive you in my house no one is at home here except the man who needs a refuge i say to you who are passing by that you are much more at home here than i am myself 
 everything here is yours 
 what need have i to know your name 
 besides before you told me you had one which i knew 
 the man opened his eyes in astonishment 
 really 
 you knew what i was called 
 yes replied the bishop you are called my brother 
 stop monsieur le cure exclaimed the man 
 i was very hungry when i entered here but you are so good that i no longer know what has happened to me 
 the bishop looked at him and said 
 you have suffered much 
 oh the red coat the ball on the ankle a plank to sleep on heat cold toil the convicts the thrashings the double chain for nothing the cell for one word even sick and in bed still the chain 
 dogs dogs are happier 
 nineteen years 
 i am now there is the yellow passport 
 that is what it is like 
 yes resumed the bishop you have come from a very sad place listen 
 there will be more joy in heaven over the face of a repentant sinner than over the white robes of a hundred just men if you emerge from that sad place with thoughts of hatred and of wrath against mankind you are deserving of pity if you emerge with thoughts of and of peace you are more worthy than any one of us 
 in the meantime madame magloire had served supper 
 soup made with water oil bread and salt a little bacon a bit of mutton figs a fresh cheese and a large loaf of rye bread 
 she had of her own accord added to the ordinary fare a bottle of his old mauves wine 
 the face at once assumed that expression of gayety which is peculiar to hospitable natures 
 to table he cried vivaciously as was his custom when a stranger supped with him he made the man sit on his right 
 mademoiselle baptistine perfectly peaceable and natural took her seat at his left 
 the bishop asked a blessing then helped the soup himself according to his custom 
 the man began to eat with avidity 
 all at once the bishop said 
 it strikes me there is something missing on this table 
 madame magloire had in fact only placed the three sets of forks and spoons which were absolutely necessary 
 now it was the usage of the house when the bishop had any one to supper to lay out the whole six sets of silver on the innocent ostentation 
 this graceful semblance of luxury was a kind of play which was full of charm in that gentle and severe household which raised poverty into dignity 
 madame magloire understood the remark went out without saying a word and a moment later the three sets of silver forks and spoons demanded by the bishop were glittering upon the cloth symmetrically arranged before the three persons seated at the table

 the empire strikes back 
 iv 
 
 six ominous shapes appeared in the black space of the hoth system and loomed likevast demons of destruction ready to unleash the furies of their imperial the largest of the six imperial star destroyer darth vader sat alone in a smallspherical room a single shaft of light gleamed on his black helmet as he satmotionless in his raised meditation chamber 
 as general veers approached the sphere opened slowly the upper half liftinglike a mechanical jaw to veers the dark figure seated inside themouthlike cocoon hardly seemed alive though a powerful aura of sheer evil emanatedfrom him sending a chilling fear through the officer 
 uncertain of his own courage veers took a step forward he had a message todeliver but felt prepared to wait for hours if necessary rather than disturb 
 but vader spoke immediately what is it veers 
 my lord the general replied choosing each word with care the fleet hasmoved out of has detected an energy field protecting an areaof the sixth planet in the hoth system the field is strong enough to deflect anybombardment 
 vader stood rising to his full height his cloak swaying against thefloor so the rebel scum are alerted to our presence furious he clenched hands into fists admiral ozzel came out of too close tothe system 
 he felt surprise was a wiser 
 as clumsy as he is stupid vader cut in breathing heavily a cleanbombardment is impossible through their energy field prepare your troops for asurface attack 
 with military precision general veers turned and marched out of the meditationroom leaving behind an enraged darth vader alone in the chamber vaderactivated a large viewscreen that showed a brightly lit image of his star bridge 
 admiral ozzel responding to summons stepped forward his facealmost filling the dark monitor screen there was trepidation in when he announced lord vader the fleet has moved out of 
 but reply was addressed to the officer standing slightly behind piett 
 knowing better than to delay captain piett stepped forward instantly as theadmiral staggered back a step his hand automatically reaching for his throat 
 yes my lord piett answered respectfully 
 ozzel began to gag now as his throat as if in the grip of invisible talons beganto constrict 
 make ready to land assault troops beyond the energy field vader deploy the fleet so that nothing can get off that planet in commandnow admiral piett 
 piett was simultaneously pleased and unsettled by this news as he turned tocarry out the orders he saw a figure that might someday be himself facewas hideously contorted as he fought for one final breath of air then he dropped intoa dead heap on the floor 
 the empire had entered the system of hoth 
 rebel troops rushed to their alert stations as the warning alarms wailed throughthe ice tunnels ground crews and droids of all sizes and makes hurried to performtheir assigned duties responding efficiently to the impending imperial threat 
 the armored snowspeeders were fueled as they waited in attack formation toblast out of the main cavern entranceway meanwhile in the hangar princess leiawas addressing a small band of rebel fighter pilots the large transport ship willleave as soon as loaded only two fighter escorts per ship the energyshield can only be opened for a split second so have to stay very close to thetransports 
 hobbie a rebel veteran of many battles looked at the princess with fighters against a star destroyer 
 the ion cannon will fire several blasts which should destroy any ships in yourflight path leia explained when you clear the energy shield you will proceed tothe rendezvous point good luck 
 somewhat reassured hobbie and the other pilots raced toward their fightercockpits 
 meanwhile han was working frantically to complete welding a lifter on themillennium falcon finishing quickly he hopped to the hangar floor and switchedon his comlink all right chewie he said to the hairy figure seated at controls give it a try 
 just then leia walked past throwing him an angry look han looked at hersmugly while the lifters began to rise off the floor whereupon the rightlifter began to shake erratically then broke partially loose to swing back down againwith an embarrassing crash 
 he turned away from leia catching only a glimpse of her face as she mockinglyraised an eyebrow 
 hold it chewie han grunted into his small transmitter 
 the avenger one of the imperial star destroyers hoveredlike a mechanized death angel in the sea of stars outside the hoth system as thecolossal ship began to move closer to the ice world the planet became clearly visiblethrough the windows which stretched meters or more across the huge bridge ofthe warship 
 captain needa commander of the crew gazed out a main port lookingat the planet when a controller came up to him sir rebel ship coming into oursector 
 good needa replied with a gleam in his eyes our first catch of the day 
 their first target will be the power generators general rieekan told theprincess

 a giant metal globe on icy surface rotated into position and angled itsgreat turret gun upward 
 fire came the order from general rieekan 
 suddenly two red beams of destructive energy were released into the cold beams almost immediately overtook the first of the racing rebel transport sped on a direct course toward the huge star destroyer 
 the twin red bolts struck the enormous ship and blasted its conning set off by the blast began to rock the great flying fortress spinning it outof control the star destroyer plunged into deep space as the rebel transport and itstwo fighter escorts streaked off to safety 
 luke skywalker preparing to depart pulled on his gear andwatched the pilots gunners and r units hurrying to complete their tasks hestarted toward the row of snowspeeders that awaited him on his way the youngcommander paused at the tail section of the millennium falcon where han solo andchewbacca were working frenetically on the right lifter 
 chewie luke called take care of yourself and watch over this guy willya 
 the wookie barked a farewell gave luke a big hug then turned back to hiswork on the lifters 
 the two friends luke and han stood looking at each other perhaps for the lasttime 
 i hope you make your peace with jabba luke said at last 
 give em hell kid the corellian responded lightly 
 the young commander began to walk away as memories of exploits shared withhan rushed to his mind he stopped and looked back the falcon and saw his friendstill staring after him as they gazed at each other for a brief moment chewbaccalooked up and knew that each was wishing the other the best wherever theirindividual fates might take them 
 the public address system broke in on their thoughts first transport is rebel announcer proclaimed the good news 
 at the announcement a cheer burst from those gathered in the hangar luketurned and hurried over to his snowspeeder when he reached it dack young gunner was standing outside the ship waiting for him 
 how are you feeling sir dack asked enthusiastically 
 like new dack how about you 
 dack beamed right now i feel like i could take on the whole empiremyself 
 yeah luke said quietly i know what you mean though there were only afew years between them at that moment luke felt centuries older 
 princess voice came over the address system attention speederpiloton the withdrawal signal assemble at south slope your fighters are beingprepared for takeoff code one five will be transmitted when evacuation iscomplete 
 threepio and artoo stood amid the rapidly moving personnel as the pilotsreadied for departure the golden droid tilted slightly as he turned his sensors on thelittle r robot the shadows playing over face gave the illusion that had lengthened into a frown why is it he asked when things seem toget settled everything falls apart leaning forward he gently patted the hull take good care of master luke and take good care of yourself 
 artoo whistled and tooted a then turned to roll down the ice stiffly threepio watched as his stout and faithful friend moved away 
 to an observer it may have seemed that threepio grew but then the first time he had gotten a drop of oil clogged before his optical sensors

 countess rostova with her daughters and a large number of guests was already seated in the drawing room the count took the gentlemen into his study and showed them his choice collection of turkish pipes from time to time he went out to ask she come yet they were expecting marya dmitrievna akhrosimova known in society as le terrible dragon a lady distinguished not for wealth or rank but for common sense and frank plainness of speech marya dmitrievna was known to the imperial family as well as to all moscow and petersburg and both cities wondered at her laughed privately at her rudenesses and told good stories about her while none the less all without exception respected and feared her 
 in the room which was full of tobacco smoke they talked of war that had been announced in a manifesto and about the recruiting none of them had yet seen the manifesto but they all knew it had appeared the count sat on the sofa between two guests who were smoking and talking he neither smoked nor talked but bending his head first to one side and then to the other watched the smokers with evident pleasure and listened to the conversation of his two neighbors whom he egged on against each other 
 one of them was a sallow civilian with a thin and wrinkled face already growing old though he was dressed like a most fashionable young man he sat with his legs up on the sofa as if quite at home and having stuck an amber mouthpiece far into his mouth was inhaling the smoke spasmodically and screwing up his eyes this was an old bachelor shinshin a cousin of the countess a man with a sharp tongue as they said in moscow society he seemed to be condescending to his companion the latter a fresh rosy officer of the guards irreproachably washed brushed and buttoned held his pipe in the middle of his mouth and with red lips gently inhaled the smoke letting it escape from his handsome mouth in rings this was lieutenant berg an officer in the semenov regiment with whom boris was to travel to join the army and about whom natasha had teased her elder sister vera speaking of berg as her intended the count sat between them and listened attentively his favorite occupation when not playing boston a card game he was very fond of was that of listener especially when he succeeded in setting two loquacious talkers at one another 
 well then old chap mon tres honorable alphonse karlovich said shinshin laughing ironically and mixing the most ordinary russian expressions with the choicest french phrases which was a peculiarity of his speech vous comptez vous faire des rentes sur you want to make something out of your company 
 you expect to make an income out of the government 
 no peter nikolaevich i only want to show that in the cavalry the advantages are far less than in the infantry just consider my own position now peter nikolaevich 
 berg always spoke quietly politely and with great precision his conversation always related entirely to himself he would remain calm and silent when the talk related to any topic that had no direct bearing on himself he could remain silent for hours without being at all put out of countenance himself or making others uncomfortable but as soon as the conversation concerned himself he would begin to talk circumstantially and with evident satisfaction 
 consider my position peter nikolaevich were i in the cavalry i should get not more than two hundred rubles every four months even with the rank of lieutenant but as it is i receive two hundred and thirty said he looking at shinshin and the count with a joyful pleasant smile as if it were obvious to him that his success must always be the chief desire of everyone else 
 besides that peter nikolaevich by exchanging into the guards i shall be in a more prominent position continued berg and vacancies occur much more frequently in the foot guards then just think what can be done with two hundred and thirty rubles i even manage to put a little aside and to send something to my father he went on emitting a smoke ring 
 la balance y est a german knows how to skin a flint as the proverb says remarked shinshin moving his pipe to the other side of his mouth and winking at the count 
 so that squares matters 
 the count burst out laughing the other guests seeing that shinshin was talking came up to listen berg oblivious of irony or indifference continued to explain how by exchanging into the guards he had already gained a step on his old comrades of the cadet corps how in wartime the company commander might get killed and he as senior in the company might easily succeed to the post how popular he was with everyone in the regiment and how satisfied his father was with him berg evidently enjoyed narrating all this and did not seem to suspect that others too might have their own interests but all he said was so prettily sedate and the naivete of his youthful egotism was so obvious that he disarmed his hearers 
 well my boy get along wherever you go foot or horse that warrant said shinshin patting him on the shoulder and taking his feet off the sofa 
 berg smiled joyously the count by his guests went into the drawing room 
 it was just the moment before a big dinner when the assembled guests expecting the summons to zakuska avoid engaging in any long conversation but think it necessary to move about and talk in order to show that they are not at all impatient for their food the host and hostess look toward the door and now and then glance at one another and the visitors try to guess from these glances who or what they are waiting for some important relation who has not yet arrived or a dish that is not yet ready 
 hors 
 pierre had come just at dinnertime and was sitting awkwardly in the middle of the drawing room on the first chair he had come across blocking the way for everyone the countess tried to make him talk but he went on naively looking around through his spectacles as if in search of somebody and answered all her questions in monosyllables he was in the way and was the only one who did not notice the fact most of the guests knowing of the affair with the bear looked with curiosity at this big stout quiet man wondering how such a clumsy modest fellow could have played such a prank on a policeman 
 you have only lately arrived the countess asked him 
 oui madame replied he looking around him 
 you have not yet seen my husband 
 non madame he smiled quite inappropriately 
 you have been in paris recently i believe i suppose very interesting 
 very interesting 
 the countess exchanged glances with anna mikhaylovna the latter understood that she was being asked to entertain this young man and sitting down beside him she began to speak about his father but he answered her as he had the countess only in monosyllables the other guests were all conversing with one another the razumovskis it was charming you are very kind countess apraksina was heard on all sides the countess rose and went into the ballroom 
 marya dmitrievna came her voice from there 
 herself came the answer in a rough voice and marya dmitrievna entered the room 
 all the unmarried ladies and even the married ones except the very oldest rose marya dmitrievna paused at the door tall and stout holding high her head with its gray curls she stood surveying the guests and leisurely arranged her wide sleeves as if rolling them up marya dmitrievna always spoke in russian 
 health and happiness to her whose name day we are keeping and to her children she said in her loud voice which drowned all others well you old sinner she went on turning to the count who was kissing her hand feeling dull in moscow i daresay nowhere to hunt with your dogs but what is to be done old man just see how these nestlings are growing up and she pointed to the girls you must look for husbands for them whether you like it or not 
 well said she my cossack marya dmitrievna always called natasha a cossack and she stroked the arm as she came up fearless and gay to kiss her hand i know a scamp of a girl but i like her 
 she took a pair of ruby earrings from her huge reticule and having given them to the rosy natasha who beamed with the pleasure of her fete turned away at once and addressed herself to pierre 
 eh eh friend come here a bit said she assuming a soft high tone of voice come here my friend and she ominously tucked up her sleeves still higher pierre approached looking at her in a childlike way through his spectacles 
 come nearer come nearer friend i used to be the only one to tell your father the truth when he was in favor and in your case my evident duty she paused all were silent expectant of what was to follow for this was dearly only a prelude 
 a fine lad my word a fine lad his father lies on his deathbed and he amuses himself setting a policeman astride a bear for shame sir for shame it would be better if you went to the war 
 she turned away and gave her hand to the count who could hardly keep from laughing 
 well i suppose it is time we were at table said marya dmitrievna 
 the count went in first with marya dmitrievna the countess followed on the arm of a colonel of hussars a man of importance to them because nicholas was to go with him to the regiment then came anna mikhaylovna with shinshin berg gave his arm to vera the smiling julie karagina went in with nicholas after them other couples followed filling the whole dining hall and last of all the children tutors and governesses followed singly the footmen began moving about chairs scraped the band struck up in the gallery and the guests settled down in their places then the strains of the household band were replaced by the clatter of knives and forks the voices of visitors and the soft steps of the footmen at one end of the table sat the countess with marya dmitrievna on her right and anna mikhaylovna on her left the other lady visitors were farther down at the other end sat the count with the hussar colonel on his left and shinshin and the other male visitors on his right midway down the long table on one side sat the grownup young people vera beside berg and pierre beside boris and on the other side the children tutors and governesses from behind the crystal decanters and fruit vases the count kept glancing at his wife and her tall cap with its ribbons and busily filled his neighbors glasses not neglecting his own the countess in turn without omitting her duties as hostess threw significant glances from behind the pineapples at her husband whose face and bald head seemed by their redness to contrast more than usual with his gray hair at the ladies end an even chatter of voices was heard all the time at the end the voices sounded louder and louder especially that of the colonel of hussars who growing more and more flushed ate and drank so much that the count held him up as a pattern to the other guests berg with tender smiles was saying to vera that love is not an earthly but a heavenly feeling boris was telling his new friend pierre who the guests were and exchanging glances with natasha who was sitting opposite pierre spoke little but examined the new faces and ate a great deal of the two soups he chose turtle with savory patties and went on to the game without omitting a single dish or one of the wines these latter the butler thrust mysteriously forward wrapped in a napkin from behind the next shoulders and whispered dry madeira hungarian or rhine wine as the case might be of the four crystal glasses engraved with the monogram that stood before his plate pierre held out one at random and drank with enjoyment gazing with amiability at the other guests natasha who sat opposite was looking at boris as girls of thirteen look at the boy they are in love with and have just kissed for the first time sometimes that same look fell on pierre and that funny lively little look made him inclined to laugh without knowing why 
 nicholas sat at some distance from sonya beside julie karagina to whom he was again talking with the same involuntary smile sonya wore a company smile but was evidently tormented by jealousy now she turned pale now blushed and strained every nerve to overhear what nicholas and julie were saying to one another the governess kept looking round uneasily as if preparing to resent any slight that might be put upon the children the german tutor was trying to remember all the dishes wines and kinds of dessert in order to send a full description of the dinner to his people in germany and he felt greatly offended when the butler with a bottle wrapped in a napkin passed him by he frowned trying to appear as if he did not want any of that wine but was mortified because no one would understand that it was not to quench his thirst or from greediness that he wanted it but simply from a conscientious desire for knowledge

 chapter 
 
 the twelve years continued mrs dean following that dismal period were the happiest of my life my greatest troubles in their passage rose from our little trifling illnesses which she had to experience in common with all children rich and poor for the rest after the first six months she grew like a larch and could walk and talk too in her own way before the heath blossomed a second time over mrs dust she was the most winning thing that ever brought sunshine into a desolate house a real beauty in face with the earnshaws handsome dark eyes but the lintons fair skin and small features and yellow curling hair her spirit was high though not rough and qualified by a heart sensitive and lively to excess in its affections that capacity for intense attachments reminded me of her mother still she did not resemble her for she could be soft and mild as a dove and she had a gentle voice and pensive expression her anger was never furious her love never fierce it was deep and tender however it must be acknowledged she had faults to foil her gifts a propensity to be saucy was one and a perverse will that indulged children invariably acquire whether they be or cross if a servant chanced to vex her it was shall tell papa and if he reproved her even by a look you would have thought it a business i believe he ever did speak a harsh word to her he took her education entirely on himself and made it an amusement fortunately curiosity and a quick intellect urged her into an apt scholar she learned rapidly and eagerly and did honour to his teaching 
 till she reached the age of thirteen she had not once been beyond the range of the park by herself mr linton would take her with him a mile or so outside on rare occasions but he trusted her to no one else gimmerton was an unsubstantial name in her ears the chapel the only building she had approached or entered except her own home wuthering heights and mr heathcliff did not exist for her she was a perfect recluse and apparently perfectly contented sometimes indeed while surveying the country from her nursery window she would observe 
 ellen how long will it be before i can walk to the top of those hills i wonder what lies on the other it the sea 
 no miss cathy i would answer it is hills again just like these 
 and what are those golden rocks like when you stand under them she once asked 
 the abrupt descent of penistone crags particularly attracted her notice especially when the setting sun shone on it and the topmost heights and the whole extent of landscape besides lay in shadow i explained that they were bare masses of stone with hardly enough earth in their clefts to nourish a stunted tree 
 and why are they bright so long after it is evening here she pursued 
 because they are a great deal higher up than we are replied i you could not climb them they are too high and steep in winter the frost is always there before it comes to us and deep into summer i have found snow under that black hollow on the side 
 oh you have been on them she cried gleefully then i can go too when i am a woman has papa been ellen 
 papa would tell you miss i answered hastily that they are not worth the trouble of visiting the moors where you ramble with him are much nicer and thrushcross park is the finest place in the world 
 but i know the park and i know those she murmured to herself and i should delight to look round me from the brow of that tallest point my little pony minny shall take me some time 
 one of the maids mentioning the fairy cave quite turned her head with a desire to fulfil this project she teased mr linton about it and he promised she should have the journey when she got older but miss catherine measured her age by months and now am i old enough to go to penistone crags was the constant question in her mouth the road thither wound close by wuthering heights edgar had not the heart to pass it so she received as constantly the answer not yet love not yet 
 i said mrs heathcliff lived above a dozen years after quitting her husband her family were of a delicate constitution she and edgar both lacked the ruddy health that you will generally meet in these parts what her last illness was i am not certain i conjecture they died of the same thing a kind of fever slow at its commencement but incurable and rapidly consuming life to wards the close she wrote to inform her brother of the probable conclusion of a four months indisposition under which she had suffered and entreated him to come to her if possible for she had much to settle and she wished to bid him adieu and deliver linton safely into his hands her hope was that linton might be left with him as he had been with her his father she would fain convince herself had no desire to assume the burden of his maintenance or education my master hesitated not a moment in complying with her request reluctant as he was to leave home at ordinary calls he flew to answer this commending catherine to my peculiar vigilance in his absence with reiterated orders that she must not wander out of the park even under my escort he did not calculate on her going unaccompanied 
 he was away three weeks the first day or two my charge sat in a corner of the library too sad for either reading or playing in that quiet state she caused me little trouble but it was succeeded by an interval of impatient fretful weariness and being too busy and too old then to run up and down amusing her i hit on a method by which she might entertain herself i used to send her on her travels round the on foot and now on a pony indulging her with a patient audience of all her real and imaginary adventures when she returned 
 the summer shone in full prime and she took such a taste for this solitary rambling that she often contrived to remain out from breakfast till tea and then the evenings were spent in recounting her fanciful tales i did not fear her breaking bounds because the gates were generally locked and i thought she would scarcely venture forth alone if they had stood wide open unluckily my confidence proved misplaced catherine came to me one morning at eight and said she was that day an arabian merchant going to cross the desert with his caravan and i must give her plenty of provision for herself and beasts a horse and three camels personated by a large hound and a couple of pointers i got together good store of dainties and slung them in a basket on one side of the saddle and she sprang up as gay as a fairy sheltered by her hat and gauze veil from the july sun and trotted off with a merry laugh mocking my cautious counsel to avoid galloping and come back early the naughty thing never made her appearance at tea one traveller the hound being an old dog and fond of its ease returned but neither cathy nor the pony nor the two pointers were visible in any direction i dispatched emissaries down this path and that path and at last went wandering in search of her myself there was a labourer working at a fence round a plantation on the borders of the grounds i inquired of him if he had seen our young lady 
 i saw her at morn he replied she would have me to cut her a hazel switch and then she leapt her galloway over the hedge yonder where it is lowest and galloped out of sight 
 you may guess how i felt at hearing this news it struck me directly she must have started for penistone crags what will become of her i ejaculated pushing through a gap which the man was repairing and making straight to the high road i walked as if for a wager mile after mile till a turn brought me in view of the heights but no catherine could i detect far or near the crags lie about a mile and a half beyond mr place and that is four from the grange so i began to fear night would fall ere i could reach them and what if she should have slipped in clambering among them i reflected and been killed or broken some of her bones my suspense was truly painful and at first it gave me delightful relief to observe in hurrying by the farmhouse charlie the fiercest of the pointers lying under a window with swelled head and bleeding ear i opened the wicket and ran to the door knocking vehemently for admittance a woman whom i knew and who formerly lived at gimmerton answered she had been servant there since the death of mr earnshaw 
 ah said she you are come a seeking your little mistress be frightened here safe but glad it the master 
 he is not at home then is he i panted quite breathless with quick walking and alarm 
 no no she replied both he and joseph are off and i think they return this hour or more step in and rest you a bit 
 i entered and beheld my stray lamb seated on the hearth rocking herself in a little chair that had been her when a child her hat was hung against the wall and she seemed perfectly at home laughing and chattering in the best spirits imaginable to a great strong lad of stared at her with considerable curiosity and astonishment comprehending precious little of the fluent succession of remarks and questions which her tongue never ceased pouring forth 
 very well miss i exclaimed concealing my joy under an angry countenance this is your last ride till papa comes back not trust you over the threshold again you naughty naughty girl 
 aha ellen she cried gaily jumping up and running to my side i shall have a pretty story to tell tonight and so found me out have you ever been here in your life before 
 put that hat on and home at once said i dreadfully grieved at you miss cathy done extremely wrong no use pouting and crying that repay the trouble had scouring the country after you to think how mr linton charged me to keep you in and you stealing off so it shows you are a cunning little fox and nobody will put faith in you any more 
 what have i done sobbed she instantly checked papa charged me nothing not scold me never cross like you 
 come come i repeated tie the riband now let us have no petulance oh for shame you thirteen years old and such a baby 
 this exclamation was caused by her pushing the hat from her head and retreating to the chimney out of my reach 
 nay said the servant be hard on the bonny lass mrs dean we made her stop fain have ridden forwards afeard you should be uneasy but hareton offered to go with her and i thought he should a wild road over the hills 
 hareton during the discussion stood with his hands in his pockets too awkward to speak though he looked as if he did not relish my intrusion 
 how long am i to wait i continued disregarding the interference it will be dark in ten minutes where is the pony miss cathy and where is phoenix i shall leave you unless you be quick so please yourself 
 the pony is in the yard she replied and phoenix is shut in there so is charlie i was going to tell you all about it but you are in a bad temper and deserve to hear 
 i picked up her hat and approached to reinstate it but perceiving that the people of the house took her part she commenced capering round the room and on my giving chase ran like a mouse over and under and behind the furniture rendering it ridiculous for me to pursue hareton and the woman laughed and she joined them and waxed more impertinent still till i cried in great irritation 
 well miss cathy if you were aware whose house this is be glad enough to get out 
 your it said she turning to hareton nay he replied looking down and blushing bashfully 
 he could not stand a steady gaze from her eyes though they were just his own 
 whose she asked 
 he coloured deeper with a different feeling muttered an oath and turned away 
 who is his master continued the tiresome girl appealing to me he talked about our house and our folk i thought he had been the son and he never said miss he should have done he if a servant 
 hareton grew black as a thunder cloud at this childish speech i silently shook my questioner and at last succeeded in equipping her for departure 
 now get my horse she said addressing her unknown kinsman as she would one of the at the grange and you may come with me i want to see where the rises in the marsh and to hear about the fairishes as you call them but make haste the matter get my horse i say 
 see thee damned before i be thy servant growled the lad see me what asked catherine in surprise saucy witch he replied 
 there miss cathy you see you have got into pretty company i interposed nice words to be used to a young lady pray begin to dispute with him come let us seek for minny ourselves and begone 
 but ellen cried she staring fixed in astonishment how dare he speak so to me he be made to do as i ask him you wicked creature i shall tell papa what you then 
 hareton did not appear to feel this threat so the tears sprang into her eyes with indignation you bring the pony she exclaimed turning to the woman and let my dog free this moment 
 softly miss answered the addressed lose nothing by being civil though mr hareton there be not the son your cousin and i was never hired to serve you 
 he my cousin cried cathy with a scornful laugh yes indeed responded her reprover 
 oh ellen let them say such things she pursued in great trouble papa is gone to fetch my cousin from london my cousin is a son that stopped and wept outright upset at the bare notion of relationship with such a clown 
 hush hush i whispered people can have many cousins and of all sorts miss cathy without being any the worse for it only they keep their company if they be disagreeable and bad 
 not my cousin ellen she went on gathering fresh grief from reflection and flinging herself into my arms for refuge from the idea 
 i was much vexed at her and the servant for their mutual revelations having no doubt of approaching arrival communicated by the former being reported to mr heathcliff and feeling as confident that first thought on her return would be to seek an explanation of the assertion concerning her kindred hareton recovering from his disgust at being taken for a servant seemed moved by her distress and having fetched the pony round to the door he took to propitiate her a fine terrier whelp from the kennel and putting it into her hand bid her wisht for he meant nought pausing in her lamentations she surveyed him with a glance of awe and horror then burst forth anew 
 i could scarcely refrain from smiling at this antipathy to the poor fellow who was a athletic youth in features and stout and healthy but attired in garments befitting his daily occupations of working on the farm and lounging among the moors after rabbits and game still i thought i could detect in his physiognomy a mind owning better qualities than his father ever possessed good things lost amid a wilderness of weeds to be sure whose rankness far overtopped their neglected growth yet notwithstanding evidence of a wealthy soil that might yield luxuriant crops under other and favourable circumstances mr heathcliff i believe had not treated him physically ill thanks to his fearless nature which offered no temptation to that course of oppression it had none of the timid susceptibility that would have given zest to in judgment he appeared to have bent his malevolence on making him a brute he was never taught to read or write never rebuked for any bad habit which did not annoy his keeper never led a single step towards virtue or guarded by a single precept against vice and from what i heard joseph contributed much to his deterioration by a partiality which prompted him to flatter and pet him as a boy because he was the head of the old family and as he had been in the habit of accusing catherine earnshaw and heathcliff when children of putting the master past his patience and compelling him to seek solace in drink by what he termed their offalld ways so at present he laid the whole burden of faults on the shoulders of the usurper of his property if the lad swore he correct him nor however culpably he behaved it gave joseph satisfaction apparently to watch him go the worst lengths he allowed that he was ruined that his soul was abandoned to perdition but then he reflected that heathcliff must answer for it blood would be required at his hands and there lay immense consolation in that thought joseph had instilled into him a pride of name and of his lineage he would had he dared have fostered hate between him and the present owner of the heights but his dread of that owner amounted to superstition and he confined his feelings regarding him to muttered innuendoes and private comminations i pretend to be intimately acquainted with the mode of living customary in those days at wuthering heights i only speak from hearsay for i saw little the villagers affirmed mr heathcliff was near and a cruel hard landlord to his tenants but the house inside had regained its ancient aspect of comfort under female management and the scenes of riot common in time were not now enacted within its walls the master was too gloomy to seek companionship with any people good or bad and he is yet 
 this however is not making progress with my story miss cathy rejected the peace offering of the terrier and demanded her own dogs charlie and phoenix they came limping and hanging their heads and we set out for home sadly out of sorts every one of us i could not wring from my little lady how she had spent the day except that as i supposed the goal of her pilgrimage was penistone crags and she arrived without adventure to the gate of the farmhouse when hareton happened to issue forth attended by some canine followers who attacked her train they had a smart battle before their owners could separate them that ormed an introduction catherine told hareton who she was nd where she was going and asked him to show her the way finally beguiling him to accompany her he opened the mysteries of the fairy cave and twenty other queer places but being in disgrace i was not favoured with a description of the interesting objects she saw i could gather however that her guide had been a favourite till she hurt his feelings by addressing him as a servant and heathcliffs housekeeper hurt hers by calling him her cousin then the language he had held to her rankled in her heart she who was always love and darling and queen and angel with everybody at the grange to be insulted so shockingly by a stranger she did not comprehend it and hard work i had to obtain a promise that she would not lay the grievance before her father i explained how he objected to the whole household at the heights and how sorry he would be to find she had been there but i insisted most on the fact that if she revealed my negligence of his orders he would perhaps be so angry that i should have to leave and cathy bear that prospect she pledged her word and kept it for my sake after all she was a sweet little girl

 chapter eighteen 
 
 beth did have the fever and was much sicker than anyone but hannah and the doctor suspected the girls knew nothing about illness and mr laurence was not allowed to see her so hannah had everything her own way and busy dr bangs did his best but left a good deal to the excellent nurse meg stayed at home lest she should infect the kings and kept house feeling very anxious and a little guilty when she wrote letters in which no mention was made of illness she could not think it right to deceive her mother but she had been bidden to mind hannah and hannah hear of mrs march bein told and worried just for sech a trifle 
 jo devoted herself to beth day and night not a hard task for beth was very patient and bore her pain uncomplainingly as long as she could control herself but there came a time when during the fever fits she began to talk in a hoarse broken voice to play on the coverlet as if on her beloved little piano and try to sing with a throat so swollen that there was no music left a time when she did not know the familiar faces around her but addressed them by wrong names and called imploringly for her mother then jo grew frightened meg begged to be allowed to write the truth and even hannah said she would think of it though there was no danger yet a letter from washington added to their trouble for mr march had had a relapse and could not think of coming home for a long while 
 how dark the days seemed now how sad and lonely the house and how heavy were the hearts of the sisters as they worked and waited while the shadow of death hovered over the once happy home then it was that margaret sitting alone with tears dropping often on her work felt how rich she had been in things more precious than any luxuries money could love protection peace and health the real blessings of life then it was that jo living in the darkened room with that suffering little sister always before her eyes and that pathetic voice sounding in her ears learned to see the beauty and to sweetness of nature to feel how deep and tender a place she filled in all hearts and to acknowledge the worth of unselfish ambition to live for others and make home happy by that exercise of those simple virtues which all may possess and which all should love and value more than talent wealth or beauty and amy in her exile longed eagerly to be at home that she might work for beth feeling now that no service would be hard or irksome and remembering with regretful grief how many neglected tasks those willing hands had done for her laurie haunted the house like a restless ghost and mr laurence locke the grand piano because he could not bear to be reminded of the young neighbor who used to make the twilight pleasant for him everyone missed beth the milkman baker grocer and butcher inquired how she did poor mrs hummel came to beg pardon for her thoughtlessness and to get a shroud for minna the neighbors sent all sorts of comforts and good wishes and even those who knew her best were surprised to find how many friends shy little beth had made 
 meanwhile she lay on her bed with old joanna at her side for even in her wanderings she did not forget her forlorn protege she longed for her cats but would not have them brought lest they should get sick and in her quiet hours she was full of anxiety about jo she sent loving messages to amy bade them tell her mother that she would write soon and often begged for pencil and paper to try to say a word that father might not think she had neglected him but soon even these intervals of consciousness ended and she lay hour after hour tossing to and fro with incoherent words on her lips or sank into a heavy sleep which brought her no refreshment dr bangs came twice a day hannah sat up at night meg kept a telegram in her desk all ready to send off at any minute and jo never stirred from side 
 the first of december was a wintry day indeed to them for a bitter wind blew snow fell fast and the year seemed getting ready for its death when dr bangs came that morning he looked long at beth held the hot hand in both his own for a minute and laid it gently down saying in a low voice to hannah if mrs march can leave her husband better be sent for 
 hannah nodded without speaking for her lips twitched nervously meg dropped down into a chair as the strength seemed to go out of her limbs at the sound of those words and jo standing with a pale face for a minute ran to the parlor snatched up the telegram and throwing on her things rushed out into the storm she was soon back and while noiselessly taking off her cloak laurie came in with a letter saying that mr march was mending again jo read it thankfully but the heavy weight did not seem lifted off her heart and her face was so full of misery that laurie asked quickly what is it is beth worse 
 sent for mother said jo tugging at her rubber boots with a tragic expression 
 good for you jo did you do it on your own responsibility asked laurie as he seated her in the hall chair and took off the rebellious boots seeing how her hands shook 
 no the doctor told us to 
 oh jo not so bad as that cried laurie with a startled face 
 yes it is she know us she even talk about the flocks of green doves as she calls the vine leaves on the wall she look like my beth and nobody to help us bear it mother and father both gone and god seems so far away i find him 
 as the tears streamed fast down poor cheeks she stretched out her hand in a helpless sort of way as if groping in the dark and laurie took it in his whispering as well as he could with a lump in his throat here hold on tome jo dear 
 she could not speak but she did hold on and the warm grasp of the friendly human hand comforted her sore heart and seemed to lead her nearer to the divine arm which alone could uphold her in her trouble 
 laurie longed to say something tender and comfortable but no fitting words came to him so he stood silent gently stroking her bent head as her mother used to do it was the best thing he could have done far more soothing than the most eloquent words for jo felt the unspoken sympathy and in the silence learned the sweet solace which affection administers to sorrow soon she dried the tears which had relieved her and looked up with a grateful face 
 thank you teddy better now i feel so forlorn and will try to bear it if it comes 
 keep hoping for the best that will help you jo soon your mother will be here and then everything will be all right 
 so glad father is better now she feel so bad about leaving him oh me it does seem as if all the troubles came in a heap and i got the heaviest part on my shoulders sighed jo spreading her wet handkerchief over her knees to dry 
 meg pull fair asked laurie looking indignant 
 oh yes she tries to but she love bethy as i do and she miss her as i shall beth is my conscience and i give her up i i 
 down went face into the wet handkerchief and she cried despairingly for she had kept up bravely till now and never shed a tear laurie drew his hand across his eyes but could not speak till he had subdued the choky feeling in his throat and steadied his lips it might be unmanly but he help it and i am glad of it presently as sobs quieted he said hopefully i think she will die so good and we all love her so much i believe god will take her away yet 
 the good and dear people always do die groaned jo but she stopped crying for her words cheered her up in spite of her own doubts and fears 
 poor girl worn out it like you to be forlorn stop a bit hearten you up in a jiffy 
 laurie went off two stairs at a time and jo laid her wearied head down on little brown hood which no one had thought of moving from the table where she left it it must have possessed some magic for the submissive spirit of its gentle owner seemed to enter into jo and when laurie came running down with a glass of wine she took it with a smile and said bravely i drink health to my beth you are a good doctor teddy and such a comfortable friend how can i ever pay you she added as the wine refreshed her body as the kind words had done her troubled mind 
 send my bill and tonight give you some thing that will warm the cockles of your heart better than quarts of wine said laurie beaming at her with a face of suppressed satisfaction at something 
 what is it cried jo forgetting her woes for a minute in her wonder 
 i telegraphed to your mother yesterday and brooke answered come at once and be here tonight and everything will be all right you glad i did it 
 laurie spoke very fast and turned red and excited all in a minute for he had kept his plot a secret for fear of disappointing the girls or harming beth jo grew quite white flew out of her chair and the moment he stopped speaking she electrified him by throwing her arms round his neck and crying out with a joyful cry oh laurie oh mother i am so glad she did not weep again but laughed hysterically and trembled and clung to her friend as if she was a little bewildered by the sudden news 
 laurie though decidedly amazed behaved with great presence of mind he patted her back soothingly and finding that she was recovering followed it up by a bashful kiss or two which brought jo round at once holding on to the banisters she put him gently away saying breathlessly oh i mean to it was dreadful of me but you were such a dear to go and do it in spite of hannah that i help flying at you tell me all about it and give me wine again it makes me act so 
 i mind laughed laurie as he settled his tie why you see i got fidgety and so did grandpa we thought hannah was overdoing the authority business and your mother ought to know never forgive us if beth well if anything happened you know so i got grandpa to say it was high time we did something and off i pelted to the office yesterday for the doctor looked sober and hannah most took my head off when i proposed a telegram i never can bear to be lorded over so that settled my mind and i did it your mother will come i know and the late train is in at two i shall go for her and only got to bottle up your rapture and keep beth quiet till that blessed lady gets here 
 laurie an angel how shall i ever thank you 
 fly at me again i rather liked it said laurie looking mischievous a thing he had not done for a fortnight 
 no thank you do it by proxy when your grandpa comes tease but go home and rest for be up half the night bless you teddy bless you 
 jo had backed into a corner and as she finished her vanished precipitately into the kitchen where she sat down upon a dresser and told the assembled cats that she was happy oh so happy while laurie departed feeling that he had made a rather neat thing of it 
 the interferingest chap i ever see but i forgive him and do hope mrs march is coming right away said hannah with an air of relief when jo told the good news 
 meg had a quiet rapture and then brooded over the letter while jo set the sickroom in order and hannah knocked up a couple of pies in case of company unexpected a breath of fresh air seemed to blow through the house and something better than sunshine brightened the quiet rooms everything appeared to feel the hopeful change bird began to chirp again and a rose was discovered on bush in the window the fires seemed to burn with unusual cheeriness and every time the girls met their pale faces broke into smiles as they hugged one another whispering encouragingly coming dear coming every one rejoiced but beth she lay in that heavy stupor alike unconscious of hope and joy doubt and danger it was a piteous sight the once rosy face so changed and vacant the once busy hands so weak and wasted the once smiling lips quite dumb and the once pretty hair scattered rough and tangled on the pillow all day she say so only rousing now and then to mutter water with lips so parched they could hardly shape the word all day jo and meg hovered over her watching waiting hoping and trusting in god and mother and all day the snow fell the bitter wind raged and the hours dragged slowly by but night came at last and every time the clock struck the sisters still sitting on either side of the bed looked at each other with brightening eyes for each hour brought help nearer the doctor had been in to say that some change for better or worse would probably take place about midnight at which time he would return 
 hannah quite worn out lay down on the sofa at the foot and fell fast asleep mr laurence marched to and fro in the parlor feeling that he would rather face a rebel battery than mrs countenance as she entered laurie lay on the rug pretending to rest but staring into the fire with the thoughtful look which made his black eyes beautifully soft and clear 
 the girls never forgot that night for no sleep came to them as they kept their watch with that dreadful sense of powerlessness which comes to us in hours like those 
 if god spares beth i never will complain again whispered meg earnestly 
 if god spares beth try to love and serve him all my life answered jo with equal fervor 
 i wish i had no heart it aches so sighed meg after a pause 
 if life is often as hard as this i see how we ever shall get through it added her sister despondently 
 here the clock struck twelve and both forgot themselves in watching beth for they fancied a change passed over her wan face the house was still as death and nothing but the wailing of the wind broke the deep hush weary hannah slept on and no one but the sisters saw the pale shadow which seemed to fall upon the little bed an hour went by and nothing happened except quiet departure for the station another hour still no one came and anxious fears of delay in the storm or accidents by the way or worst of all a great grief at washington haunted the girls 
 it was past two when jo who stood at the window thinking how dreary the world looked in its winding sheet of snow heard a movement by the bed and turning quickly saw meg kneeling before their easy chair with her face hidden a dreadful fear passed coldly over jo as she thought beth is dead and meg is afraid to tell me 
 she was back at her post in an instant and to her excited eyes a great change seemed to have taken place the fever flush and the look of pain were gone and the beloved little face looked so pale and peaceful in its utter repose that jo felt no desire to weep or to lament leaning low over this dearest of her sisters she kissed the damp forehead with her heart on her lips and softly whispered goodby my beth goodby 
 as if awaked by the stir hannah started out of her sleep hurried to the bed looked at beth felt her hands listened at her lips and then throwing her apron over her head sat down to rock to and fro exclaiming under her breath the turned sleepin her damp and she breathes easy praise be given oh my goodness me 
 before the girls could believe the happy truth the doctor came to confirm it he was a homely man but they thought his face quite heavenly when he smiled and said with a fatherly look at them yes my dears i think the little girl will pull through this time keep the house quiet let her sleep and when she wakes give her 
 what they were to give neither heard for both crept into the dark hall and sitting on the stairs held each other close rejoicing with hearts too full for words when they went back to be kissed and cuddled by faithful hannah they found beth lying as she used to do with her cheek pillowed on her hand the dreadful pallor gone and breathing quietly as if just fallen asleep 
 if mother would only come now said jo as the winter night began to wane 
 see said meg coming up with a white rose 
 i thought this would hardly be ready to lay in hand tomorrow if away from us but it has blossomed in the night and now i mean to put it in my vase here so that when the darling wakes the first thing she sees will be the little rose and face 
 never had the sun risen so beautifully and never had the world seemed so lovely as it did to the heavy eyes of meg and jo as they looked out in the early morning when their long sad vigil was done 
 it looks like a fairy world said meg smiling to herself as she stood behind the curtain watching the dazzling sight 
 hark cried jo starting to her feet 
 yes there was a sound of bells at the door below a cry from hannah and then voice saying in a joyful whisper 
 girls come come

lionfish nov chapter eighteen rewardcontents prev chapter 
 for a moment there was silence as harry ron ginny and lockhart stood in the doorway covered in muck and slime and in case blood then there was a scream 
 
 ginny 
 
 it was mrs weasley who had been sitting crying in front of the fire she leapt to her feet closely followed by mr weasley and both of them flung themselves on their daughter 
 
 harry however was looking past them professor dumbledore was standing by the mantelpiece beaming next to professor mcgonagall who was taking great steadying gasps clutching her chest fawkes went whooshing past ear and settled on shoulder just as harry found himself and ron being swept into mrs tight embrace 
 
 you saved her you saved her how did you do it 
 
 i think all like to know that said professor mcgonagall weakly 
 
 mrs weasley let go of harry who hesitated for a moment then walked over to the desk and laid upon it the sorting hat the sword and what remained of diary 
 
 then he started telling them everything for nearly a quarter of an hour he spoke into the rapt silence he told them about hearing the disembodied voice how hermione had finally realized that he was hearing a basilisk in the pipes how he and ron had followed the spiders into the forest that aragog had told them where the last victim of the basilisk had died how he had guessed that moaning myrtle had been the victim and that the entrance to the chamber of secrets might be in her bathroom 
 
 very well professor mcgonagall prompted him as he paused so you found out where the entrance was breaking a hundred school rules into pieces along the way i might add but how on earth did you all get out of there alive potter 
 
 so harry his voice now growing hoarse from all this talking told them about timely arrival and about the sorting hat giving him the sword but then he faltered he had so far avoided mentioning diary or ginny she was standing with her head against mrs shoulder and tears were still coursing silently down her cheeks what if they expelled her harry thought in panic diary work anymore how could they prove it had been he made her do it all 
 
 instinctively harry looked at dumbledore who smiled faintly the firelight glancing off his spectacles 
 
 what interests me most said dumbledore gently is how lord voldemort managed to enchant ginny when my sources tell me he is currently in hiding in the forests of albania 
 
 relief warm sweeping glorious relief swept over harry that said mr weasley in a stunned voice ginny but not ginny been has she 
 
 it was this diary said harry quickly picking it up and showing it to dumbledore riddle wrote it when he was sixteen 
 
 dumbledore took the diary from harry and peered keenly down his long crooked nose at its burnt and soggy pages 
 
 brilliant he said softly of course he was probably the most brilliant student hogwarts has ever seen he turned around to the weasleys who were looking utterly bewildered 
 
 very few people know that lord voldemort was once called tom riddle i taught him myself fifty years ago at hogwarts he disappeared after leaving the school traveled far and wide sank so deeply into the dark arts consorted with the very worst of our kind underwent so many dangerous magical transformations that when he resurfaced as lord voldemort he was barely recognizable hardly anyone connected lord voldemort with the clever handsome boy who was once head boy here 
 
 but ginny said mrs weasley our ginny got to do with with him 
 
 his ginny sobbed writing in it and been back all year 
 
 ginny said mr weasley flabbergasted i taught you anything what have i always told you never trust anything that can think for itself if you see where it keeps its brain why you show the diary to me or your mother a suspicious object like that it was clearly full of dark magic 
 
 i know sobbed ginny i found it inside one of the books mum got me i someone had just left it in there and forgotten about it 
 
 miss weasley should go up to the hospital wing right away dumbledore interrupted in a firm voice this has been a terrible ordeal for her there will be no punishment older and wiser wizards than she have been hoodwinked by lord voldemort he strode over to the door and opened it bed rest and perhaps a large steaming mug of hot chocolate i always find that cheers me up he added twinkling kindly down at her you will find that madam pomfrey is still awake just giving out mandrake juice i daresay the victims will be waking up any moment 
 
 so okay said ron brightly 
 
 there has been no lasting harm done ginny said dumbledore 
 
 mrs weasley led ginny out and mr weasley followed still looking deeply shaken 
 
 you know minerva professor dumbledore said thoughtfully to professor mcgonagall i think all this merits a good feast might i ask you to go and alert the kitchens 
 
 right said professor mcgonagall crisply also moving to the door leave you to deal with potter and weasley shall i 
 
 certainly said dumbledore 
 
 she left and harry and ron gazed uncertainly at dumbledore what exactly had professor mcgonagall meant deal with them surely surely they about to be punished 
 
 i seem to remember telling you both that i would have to expel you if you broke any more school rules said dumbledore 
 
 ron opened his mouth in horror 
 
 which goes to show that the best of us must sometimes eat our words dumbledore went on smiling you will both receive special awards for services to the school and let me see yes i think two hundred points apiece for gryffindor 
 
 ron went as brightly pink as valentine flowers and closed his mouth again 
 
 but one of us seems to be keeping mightily quiet about his part in this dangerous adventure dumbledore added why so modest gilderoy 
 
 harry gave a start he had completely forgotten about lockhart he turned and saw that lockhart was standing in a corner of the room still wearing his vague smile when dumbledore addressed him lockhart looked over his shoulder to see who he was talking to 
 
 professor dumbledore ron said quickly there was an accident down in the chamber of secrets professor lockhart 
 
 am i a professor said lockhart in mild surprise goodness i expect i was hopeless was i 
 
 he tried to do a memory charm and the wand backfired ron explained quietly to dumbledore 
 
 dear me said dumbledore shaking his head his long silver mustache quivering impaled upon your own sword gilderoy 
 
 sword said lockhart dimly got a sword that boy has though he pointed at harry lend you one 
 
 would you mind taking professor lockhart up to the infirmary too dumbledore said to ron like a few more words with harry 
 
 lockhart ambled out ron cast a curious look back at dumbledore and harry as he closed the door 
 
 dumbledore crossed to one of the chairs by the fire 
 
 sit down harry he said and harry sat feeling unaccountably nervous 
 
 first of all harry i want to thank you said dumbledore eyes twinkling again you must have shown me real loyalty down in the chamber nothing but that could have called fawkes to you 
 
 he stroked the phoenix which had fluttered down onto his knee harry grinned awkwardly as dumbledore watched him 
 
 and so you met tom riddle said dumbledore thoughtfully i imagine he was most interested in you 
 
 suddenly something that was nagging at harry came tumbling out of his mouth 
 
 professor dumbledore riddle said like him strange likenesses he said 
 
 did he now said dumbledore looking thoughtfully at harry from under his thick silver eyebrows and what do you think harry 
 
 i think like him said harry more loudly than intended i mean in gryffindor 
 
 but he fell silent a lurking doubt resurfacing in his mind 
 
 professor he started again after a moment the sorting hat told me have done well in slytherin everyone thought i was heir for a while because i can speak parseltongue 
 
 you can speak parseltongue harry said dumbledore calmly because lord voldemort who is the last remaining ancestor of salazar slytherin can speak parseltongue unless much mistaken he transferred some of his own powers to you the night he gave you that scar not something he intended to do sure 
 
 voldemort put a bit of himself in me harry said thunderstruck 
 
 it certainly seems so 
 
 so i should be in slytherin harry said looking desperately into face the sorting hat could see power in me and it 
 
 put you in gryffindor said dumbledore calmly listen to me harry you happen to have many qualities salazar slytherin prized in his students his own very rare gift parseltongue resourcefulness determination a certain disregard for rules he added his mustache quivering again yet the sorting hat placed you in gryffindor you know why that was think 
 
 it only put me in gryffindor said harry in a defeated voice because i asked not to go in slytherin 
 
 exactly said dumbledore beaming once more which makes you very different from tom riddle it is our choices harry that show what we truly are far more than our abilities harry sat motionless in his chair stunned if you want proof harry that you belong in gryffindor i suggest you look more closely at this 
 
 dumbledore reached across to professor desk picked up the silver sword and handed it to harry dully harry turned it over the rubies blazing in the firelight and then he saw the name engraved just below the hilt 
 
 godric gryffindor 
 
 only a true gryffindor could have pulled that out of the hat harry said dumbledore simply 
 
 for a minute neither of them spoke then dumbledore pulled open one of the drawers in professor desk and took out a quill and a bottle of ink 
 
 what you need harry is some food and sleep i suggest you go down to the feast while i write to azkaban we need our gamekeeper back and i must draft an advertisement for the daily prophet too he added thoughtfully be needing a new defense against the dark arts teacher dear me we do seem to run through them we 
 
 harry got up and crossed to the door he had just reached for the handle however when the door burst open so violently that it bounced back off the wall 
 
 lucius malfoy stood there fury in his face and cowering behind his legs heavily wrapped in bandages was dobby 
 
 good evening lucius said dumbledore pleasantly 
 
 mr malfoy almost knocked harry over as he swept into the room dobby went scurrying in after him crouching at the hem of his cloak a look of abject terror on his face 
 
 the elf was carrying a stained rag with which he was attempting to finish cleaning mr malfoys shoes apparently mr malfoy had set out in a great hurry for not only were his shoes but his usually sleek hair was disheveled ignoring the elf bobbing apologetically around his ankles he fixed his cold eyes upon dumbledore 
 
 so he said come back the governors suspended you but you still saw fit to return to hogwarts 
 
 well you see lucius said dumbledore smiling serenely the other eleven governors contacted me today it was something like being caught in a hailstorm of owls to tell the truth heard that arthur weasleys daughter had been killed and wanted me back here at once they seemed to think i was the best man for the job after all very strange tales they told me too several of them seemed to think that you had threatened to curse their families if they agree to suspend me in the first place 
 
 mr malfoy went even paler than usual but his eyes were still slits of fury 
 
 so have you stopped the attacks yet he sneered have you caught the culprit 
 
 we have said dumbledore with a smile 
 
 well said mr malfoy sharply who is it 
 
 the same person as last time lucius said dumbledore but this time lord voldemort was acting through somebody else by means of this diary 
 
 he held up the small black book with the large hole through the center watching mr malfoy closely harry however was watching dobby 
 
 the elf was doing something very odd his great eyes fixed meaningfully on harry he kept pointing at the diary then at mr malfoy and then hitting himself hard on the head with his fist 
 
 i see said mr malfoy slowly to dumbledore 
 
 a clever plan said dumbledore in a level voice still staring mr malfoy straight in the eye because if harry here mr malfoy shot harry a swift sharp look and his friend ron discovered this book why ginny weasley might have taken all the blame no one would ever have been able to prove she acted of her own free will 
 
 mr malfoy said nothing his face was suddenly masklike 
 
 and imagine dumbledore went on what might have happened then the weasleys are one of our most prominent families imagine the effect on arthur weasley and his muggle protection act if his own daughter was discovered attacking and killing very fortunate the diary was discovered and memories wiped from it who knows what the consequences might have been otherwise 
 
 mr malfoy forced himself to speak 
 
 very fortunate he said stiffly 
 
 and still behind his back dobby was pointing first to the diary then to lucius malfoy then punching himself in the head 
 
 and harry suddenly understood he nodded at dobby and dobby backed into a corner now twisting his ears in punishment 
 
 you want to know how ginny got hold of that diary mr malfoy said harry 
 
 lucius malfoy rounded on him 
 
 how should i know how the stupid little girl got hold of it he said 
 
 because you gave it to her said harry in flourish and blotts you picked up her old transfiguration book and slipped the diary inside it you 
 
 he saw mr white hands clench and unclench 
 
 prove it he hissed 
 
 oh no one will be able to do that said dumbledore smiling at harry not now that riddle has vanished from the book on the other hand i would advise you lucius not to go giving out any more of lord old school things if any more of them find their way into innocent hands i think arthur weasley for one will make sure they are traced back to you 
 
 lucius malfoy stood for a moment and harry distinctly saw his right hand twitch as though he was longing to reach for his wand instead he turned to his going dobby 
 
 he wrenched open the door and as the elf came hurrying up to him he kicked him right through it they could hear dobby squealing with pain all the way along the corridor harry stood for a moment thinking hard then it came to him 
 
 professor dumbledore he said hurriedly can i give that diary back to mr malfoy please 
 
 certainly harry said dumbledore calmly but hurry the feast remember harry grabbed the diary and dashed out of the office he could hear squeals of pain receding around the corner quickly wondering if this plan could possibly work harry took off one of his shoes pulled off his slimy filthy sock and stuffed the diary into it then he ran down the dark corridor 
 
 he caught up with them at the top of the stairs 
 
 mr malfoy he gasped skidding to a halt got something for you 
 
 and he forced the smelly sock into lucius hand 
 
 what the 
 
 mr malfoy ripped the sock off the diary threw it aside then looked furiously from the ruined book to meet the same sticky end as your parents one of these days harry potter he said softly they were meddlesome fools too 
 
 he turned to go 
 
 come dobby i said come 
 
 but dobby move he was holding up disgusting slimy sock and looking at it as though it were a priceless treasure 
 
 master has given a sock said the elf in wonderment master gave it to dobby 
 
 that spat mr malfoy what did you say 
 
 got a sock said dobby in disbelief master threw it and dobby caught it and dobby dobby is free 
 
 lucius malfoy stood frozen staring at the elf then he lunged at harry 
 
 lost me my servant boy 
 
 but dobby shouted you shall not harm harry potter 
 
 there was a loud bang and mr malfoy was thrown backward he crashed down the stairs three at a time landing in a crumpled heap on the landing below he got up his face livid and pulled out his wand but dobby raised a long threatening finger 
 
 you shall go now he said fiercely pointing down at mr malfoy you shall not touch harry potter you shall go now 
 
 lucius malfoy had no choice with a last incensed stare at the pair of them he swung his cloak around him and hurried out of sight 
 
 harry potter freed dobby said the elf shrilly gazing up at harry moonlight from the nearest window reflected in his eyes harry potter set dobby free 
 
 least i could do dobby said harry grinning just promise never to try and save my life again 
 
 the ugly brown face split suddenly into a wide toothy smile 
 
 just got one question dobby said harry as dobby pulled on sock with shaking hands you told me all this had nothing to do with remember well 
 
 it was a clue sir said dobby his eyes widening as though this was obvious was giving you a clue the dark lord before he changed his name could be freely named you see 
 
 right said harry weakly well better go a feast and my friend hermione should be awake by now 
 
 dobby threw his arms around middle and hugged him 
 
 harry potter is greater by far than dobby knew he sobbed farewell harry potter 
 
 and with a final loud crack dobby disappeared 
 
 harry had been to several hogwarts feasts but never one quite like this everybody was in their pajamas and the celebration lasted all night harry know whether the best bit was hermione running toward him screaming you solved it you solved it or justin hurrying over from the hufflepuff table to wring his hand and apologize endlessly for suspecting him or hagrid turning up at half past three cuffing harry and ron so hard on the shoulders that they were knocked into their plates of trifle or his and four hundred points for gryffindor securing the house cup for the second year running or professor mcgonagall standing up to tell them all that the exams had been canceled as a school treat oh no said hermione or dumbledore announcing that unfortunately professor lockhart would be unable to return next year owing to the fact that he needed to go away and get his memory back quite a few of the teachers joined in the cheering that greeted this news 
 
 shame said ron helping himself to a jam doughnut he has starting to grow on me 
 
 the rest of the final term passed in a haze of blazing sunshine hogwarts was back to normal with only a few small differences defense against the dark arts classes were canceled but had plenty of practice at that anyway ron told a disgruntled hermione and lucius malfoy had been sacked as a school governor draco was no longer strutting around the school as though he owned the place on the contrary he looked resentful and sulky on the other hand ginny weasley was perfectly happy again 
 
 too soon it was time for the journey home on the hogwarts express harry ron hermione fred george and ginny got a compartment to themselves they made the mos of the last few hours in which they were allowed to do magic before the holidays they played exploding snap set off the very last of fred and filibuster fireworks and practiced disarming each other by magic harry was getting very good at it 
 
 they were almost at cross when harry remembered something 
 
 ginny what did you see percy doing that he want you to tell anyone 
 
 oh that said ginny giggling well got a girlfriend fred dropped a stack of books on head 
 
 what 
 
 that ravenclaw prefect penelope clearwater said ginny who he was writing to all last summer been meeting her all over the school in secret i walked in on them kissing in an empty classroom one day he was so upset when she was you know attacked you tease him will you she added anxiously 
 
 dream of it said fred who was looking like his birthday had come early 
 
 definitely not said george sniggering 
 
 the hogwarts express slowed and finally stopped 
 
 harry pulled out his quill and a bit of parchment and turned to ron and hermione 
 
 this is called a telephone number he told ron scribbling it twice tearing the parchment in two and handing it to them i told your dad how to use a telephone last summer know call me at the dursleys okay i stand another two months with only dudley to talk to 
 
 your aunt and uncle will be proud though they said hermione as they got off the train and joined the crowd thronging toward the enchanted barrier when they hear what you did this year 
 
 proud said harry are you crazy all those times i died and i manage it be furious 
 
 and together they walked back through the gateway to the muggle world 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the chamber of secrets 
 

lionfish nov chapter eighteen moony wormtail padfoot and prongscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 it took a few seconds for the absurdity of this statement to sink in then ron voiced what harry was thinking 
 
 both mental 
 
 ridiculous said hermione faintly 
 
 peter dead said harry he killed him twelve years ago he pointed at black whose face twitched convulsively 
 
 i meant to he growled his yellow teeth bared but little peter got the better of menot this time though 
 
 and crookshanks was thrown to the floor as black lunged at scabbers ron yelled with pain as weight fell on his broken leg 
 
 sirius no lupin yelled launching himself forwards and dragging black away from ron again wait you do it just like that they need to understand got to explain 
 
 we can explain afterwards snarled black trying to throw lupin off one hand was still clawing the air as it tried to reach scabbers who was squealing like a piglet scratching face and neck as he tried to escape 
 
 got a right to know everything lupin panted still trying to restrain black kept him as a pet there are parts of it even i understand and harry you owe harry the truth sirius 
 
 black stopped struggling though his hollowed eyes were still fixed on scabbers who was clamped tightly under bitten scratched and bleeding hands 
 
 all right then black said without taking his eyes off the rat 
 
 tell them whatever you like but make it quick remus i want to commit the murder i was imprisoned for 
 
 nutters both of you said ron shakily looking round at harry and hermione for support had enough of this off 
 
 he tried to heave himself up on his good leg but lupin raised his wand again pointing it at scabbers 
 
 going to hear me out ron he said quietly just keep a tight hold on peter while you listen 
 
 not peter scabbers ron yelled trying to force the rat back into his front pocket but scabbers was fighting too hard ron swayed and overbalanced and harry caught him am pushed him back down to the bed then ignoring black harry turned to lupin 
 
 there were witnesses who saw pettigrew die he said a whole street full of them 
 
 they see what they thought they saw said black savagely still watching scabbers struggling in hands 
 
 everyone thought sirius killed peter said lupin nodding i believed it myself until i saw the map tonight because the map never alive holding him harry 
 
 harry looked down at ron and as their eyes met they agreed silently black and lupin were both out of their minds their story made no sense whatsoever how could scabbers be peter pettigrew azkaban must have unhinged black after all but why was lupin playing along with him 
 
 then hermione spoke in a trembling calm sort of voice as though trying to will professor lupin to talk sensibly 
 
 but professor lupinscabbers be pettigrewit just be true you know it 
 
 why it be true lupin said calmly as though they were in class and hermione had simply spotted a problem in an experiment with grindylows 
 
 because because people would know if peter pettigrew had been an animagus we did animagi in class with professor mcgonagall and i looked them up when i did my homework the ministry of magic keeps tabs on witches and wizards who can become animals a register showing what animal they become and their markings and thingsand i went and looked professor mcgonagall up on the register and there have been only seven animagi this century and name on the list 
 
 harry had barely had time to marvel inwardly at the effort hermione put into her homework when lupin started to laugh 
 
 right again hermione he said but the ministry never knew that here used to be three unregistered animagi running around hogwarts 
 
 if going to tell them the story get a move on remus said black who was still watching every desperate move waited twelve years not going to wait much longer 
 
 all rightbut need to help me sirius said lupin i only know how it began 
 
 lupin broke off there had been a loud creak behind him the bedroom door had opened of its own accord all five of them stared at it then lupin strode toward it and looked out into the landing 
 
 no one there 
 
 this place is haunted said ron 
 
 not said lupin still looking at the door in a puzzled way the shrieking shack was never hauntedthe screams and howls the villagers used to hear were made by me 
 
 he pushed his graying hair out of his eyes thought for a moment then said where all of this starts with my becoming a werewolf none of this could have happened if i been bitterand if i been so foolhardy 
 
 he looked sober and tired ron started to interrupt but hermione said shh she was watching lupin very intently 
 
 i as a very small boy when i received the bite my parents tried everything but in those days there was no cure the potion that professor snape has been making for me is a very recent discovery it makes me safe you see as long as i take it in the week preceding the full moon i keep my mind when i able to curl up in my office a harmless wolf and wait for the moon to wane again 
 
 before the wolfsbane potion was discovered however i became a fully fledged monster once a month it seemed impossible that i would be able to come to hogwarts other parents likely to want their children exposed to me 
 
 but then dumbledore became headmaster and he was sympathetic he said that as long as we took certain precautions there was no reason i come to school lupin sighed and looked directly at harry i told you months ago that the whomping willow was planted the year i came to hogwarts the truth is that it was planted because i came to hogwarts this house lupin looked miserably around the room the tunnel that leads to it they were built for my use once a month i was smuggled out of the castle into this place to transform the tree was placed at the tunnel mouth to stop anyone coming across me while i was dangerous 
 
 harry see where this story was going but he was listening raptly all the same the only sound apart from voice was frightened squeaking 
 
 my transformations in those days were were terrible it is very painful to turn into a werewolf i was separated from humans to bite so i bit and scratched myself instead the villagers heard the noise and the screaming and thought they were hearing particularly violent spirits dumbledore encouraged the rumoreven now when the house has been silent for years the villagers dare approach it 
 
 but apart from my transformations i was happier than i had ever been in my life for the first time ever i had friends three great friends sirius blackpeter pettigrewand of course your father harry james potter 
 
 now my three friends could hardly fail to notice that i disappeared once a month i made up all sorts of stories i told them my mother was ill and that i had to go home to see heri was terrified they would desert me the moment they found out what i was but of course they like you hermione worked out the truth 
 
 and they desert me at all instead they did something for me that would make my transformations not only bearable but the best times of my life they became animagi 
 
 my dad too said harry astounded 
 
 yes indeed said lupin it took them the best part of three years to work out how to do it your father and sirius here were the cleverest students in the school and lucky they were because the animagus transformation can go horribly wrong one reason the ministry keeps a close watch on those attempting to do it peter needed all the help he could get from james and sirius finally in our fifth year they managed it they could each turn into a different animal at will 
 
 but how did that help you said hermione sounding puzzled 
 
 they keep me company as humans so they kept me company as animals said lupin a werewolf is only a danger to people they sneaked out of the castle every month under invisibility cloak they transformedpeter as the smallest could slip beneath the attacking branches and touch the knot that freezes it they would then slip down the tunnel and join me under their influence i became less dangerous my body was still wolfish but my mind seemed to become less so while i was with them 
 
 hurry up remus snarled black who was still watching scabbers with a horrible sort of hunger on his face 
 
 getting there sirius getting therewell highly exciting possibilities were open to us now that we could all transform soon we were leaving the shrieking shack and roaming the school grounds and the village by night sirius and james transformed into such large animals they were able to keep a werewolf in check i doubt whether any hogwarts students ever found out more about the hogwarts grounds and hogsmeade than we did and how we came to write the map and sign it with our nicknames sirius is padfoot peter is wormtail james was prongs 
 
 what sort of animal harry began but hermione cut him off that was still really dangerous running around in the dark with a werewolf what if given the others the slip and bitten somebody 
 
 a thought that still haunts me said lupin heavily and there were near misses many of them we laughed about them afterwards we were young thoughtless carried away with our own cleverness 
 
 i sometimes felt guilty about betraying trust of coursehe had admitted me to hogwarts when no other headmaster would have done so and he had no idea i was breaking the rules he had set down for my own and others safety he never knew i had led three fellow students into becoming animagi illegally but i always managed to forget my guilty feelings every time we sat down to plan our next adventure and i changed 
 
 face had hardened and there was in his voice all this year i have been battling with myself wondering whether i should tell dumbledore that sirius was an animagus but i do it why because i was too cowardly it would have meant admitting that betrayed his trust while i was at school admitting that led others along with meand trust has meant everything to me he let me into hogwarts as a boy and he gave me a job when i have been shunned all my adult life unable to find paid work because of what i am and so i convinced myself that sirius was getting into the school using dark arts he learned from voldemort that being an animagus had nothing to do with itso in a way been right about me all along 
 
 snape said black harshly taking his eyes off scabbers for the first time in minutes and looking up at lupin snape got to do with it 
 
 here sirius said lupin heavily teaching here as well he looked up at harry ron and hermione 
 
 professor snape was at school with us he fought very hard against my appointment to the defense against the dark arts job he has been telling dumbledore all year that i am not to be trusted he has his reasonsyou see sirius here played a trick on him which nearly killed him a trick which involved me 
 
 black made a derisive noise 
 
 it served him right he sneered sneaking around trying to find out what we were up tohoping he could get us expelled 
 
 severus was very interested in where i went every month lupin told harry ron and hermione we were in the same year you know and we er like each other very much he especially disliked james jealous i think of talent on the quidditch fieldanyway snape had seen me crossing the grounds with madam pomfrey one evening as she led me toward the whomping willow to transform sirius thought it would be er amusing to tell snape all he had to do was prod the knot on the tree trunk with a long stick and be able to get in after me well of course snape tried it if got as far as this house have met a fully grown werewolf but your father heard what sirius had done went after snape and pulled him back at great risk to his lifesnape glimpsed me though at the end of the tunnel he was forbidden by dumbledore to tell anybody but from that time on he knew what i was 
 
 so why snape like you said harry slowly because he thought you were in on the joke 
 
 right sneered a cold voice from the wall behind lupin 
 
 severus snape was pulling off the invisibility cloak his wand pointing directly at lupin 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the prisoner of azkaban 
 

lionfish nov chapter eighteen the weighing of the wandscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 when harry woke up on sunday morning it took him a moment to remember why he felt so miserable and worried then the memory of the previous night rolled over him he sat up and ripped back the curtains of his own intending to talk to ron to force ron to believe him only to find that bed was empty he had obviously gone down to breakfast 
 
 harry dressed and went down the spiral staircase into the common room the moment he appeared the people who had already finished breakfast broke into applause again the prospect of going down into the great hall and facing the rest of the gryffindors all treating him like some sort of hero was not inviting it was that however or stay here and allow himself to be cornered by the creevey brothers who were both beckoning frantically to him to join them he walked resolutely over to the portrait hole pushed it open climbed out of it and found himself with hermione 
 
 hello she said holding up a stack of toast which she was carrying in a napkin i brought you to go for a walk 
 
 good idea said harry gratefully 
 
 they went downstairs crossed the entrance hall quickly without looking in at the great hall and were soon striding across the lawn toward the lake where the durmstrang ship was moored reflected blackly in the water it was a chilly morning and they kept moving munching their toast as harry told hermione exactly what had happened after he had left the gryffindor table the night before to his immense relief hermione accepted his story without question 
 
 well of course i knew you entered yourself she said when finished telling her about the scene in the chamber off the hall the look on your face when dumbledore read out your name but the question is who did put it in because right harryi think any student could have done never be able to fool the goblet or get over 
 
 have you seen ron harry interrupted 
 
 hermione hesitated 
 
 ermyeshe was at breakfast she said 
 
 does he still think i entered myself 
 
 wellno i think sonot really said hermione awkwardly 
 
 that supposed to mean not really 
 
 oh harry it obvious hermione said despairingly jealous 
 
 jealous harry said incredulously jealous of what he wants to make a prat of himself in front of the whole school does he 
 
 look said hermione patiently always you who gets all the attention you know it is i know not your fault she added quickly seeing harry open his mouth furiously i know you ask for itbut well you know got all those brothers to compete against at home and his best friend and really famous always shunted to one side whenever people see you and he puts up with it and he never mentions it but i suppose this is just one time too many 
 
 great said harry bitterly really great tell him from me swap any time he wants tell him from me welcome to gawping at my forehead everywhere i go 
 
 not teiling him anything hermione said shortly tell him yourself the only way to sort this out 
 
 not running around after him trying to make him grow up harry said so loudly that several owls in a nearby tree took flight in alarm maybe believe not enjoying myself once got my neck broken or 
 
 not funny said hermione quietly not funny at all she looked extremely anxious harry been thinking you know what got to do you straight away the moment we get back to the castle 
 
 yeah give ron a good kick up the 
 
 write to sirius got to tell him happened he asked you to keep him posted on everything going on at almost as if he expected something like this to happen i brought some parchment and a quill out with me 
 
 come off it said harry looking around to check that they be overheard but the grounds were quite deserted he came back to the country just because my scar twinged probably come bursting right into the castle if i tell him entered me in the triwizard tournament 
 
 want you to tell him said hermione sternly going to find out anyway 
 
 how 
 
 harry this going to be kept quiet said hermione very seriously this famous and famous be really surprised if there anything in the daily prophet about you already in half the books about you knowand sirius would rather hear it from you i know he would 
 
 okay okay write to him said harry throwing his last piece of toast into the lake they both stood and watched it floating there for a moment before a large tentacle rose out of the water and scooped it beneath the surface then they returned to the castle 
 
 whose owl am i going to use harry said as they climbed the stairs he told me not to use hedwig again 
 
 ask ron if you can borrow 
 
 not asking ron for anything harry said flatly 
 
 well borrow one of the school owls then anyone can use them said hermione 
 
 they went up to the owlery hermione gave harry a piece of parchment a quill and a bottle of ink then strolled around the long lines of perches looking at all the different owls while harry sat down against a wall and wrote his letter 
 
 dear sirius 
 you told me to keep you posted on happening at hogwarts so here goes i know if heard but the triwizard happening this year and on saturday night i got picked as a fourth champion i who put my name in the goblet of fire because i the other hogwarts champion is cedric diggory from hufflepuff 
 he paused at this point thinking he had an urge to say something about the large weight of anxiety that seemed to have settled inside his chest since last night but he think how to translate this into words so he simply dipped his quill back into the ink bottle and wrote 
 
 hope okay and buckbeak harry 
 finished he told hermione getting to his feet and brushing straw off his robes at this hedwig fluttered down onto his shoulder and held out her leg 
 
 i use you harry told her looking around for the school owls got to use one of these 
 
 hedwig gave a very loud hoot and took off so suddenly that her talons cut into his shoulder she kept her back to harry all the time he was tying his letter to the leg of a large barn owl when the barn owl had flown off harry reached out to stroke hedwig but she clicked her beak furiously and soared up into the rafters out of reach 
 
 first ron then you harry said angrily this my fault 
 
 
 
 if harry had thought that matters would improve once everyone got used to the idea of him being champion the following day showed him how mistaken he was he could no longer avoid the rest of the school once he was back at lessons and it was clear that the rest of the school just like the gryffindors thought harry had entered himself for the tournament unlike the gryffindors however they did not seem impressed 
 
 the hufflepuffs who were usually on excellent terms with the gryffindors had turned remarkably cold toward the whole lot of them one herbology lesson was enough to demonstrate this it was plain that the hufflepuffs felt that harry had stolen their glory a feeling exacerbated perhaps by the fact that hufflepuff house very rarely got any glory and that cedric was one of the few who had ever given them any having beaten gryffindor once at quidditch ernie macmillan and justin finchfletchley with whom harry normally got on very well did not talk to him even though they were repotting bouncing bulbs at the same tray though they did laugh rather unpleasantly when one of the bouncing bulbs wriggled free from grip and smacked him hard in the face ron talking to harry either hermione sat between them making very forced conversation but though both answered her normally they avoided making eye contact with each other harry thought even professor sprout seemed distant with him but then she was head of hufflepuff house 
 
 he would have been looking forward to seeing hagrid under normal circumstances but care of magical creatures meant seeing the slytherins too the first time he would come with them since becoming champion 
 
 predictably malfoy arrived at cabin with his familiar sneer firmly in place 
 
 ah look boys the champion he said to crabbe and goyle the moment he got within earshot of harry got your autograph books better get a signature now because i doubt going to be around much the triwizard champions have diedhow long reckon going to last potter ten minutes into the first my bet 
 
 crabbe and goyle guffawed sycophantically but malfoy had to stop there because hagrid emerged from the back of his cabin balancing a teetering tower of crates each containing a very large skrewt to the horror hagrid proceeded to explain that the reason the skrewts had been killing one another was an excess of energy and that the solution would be for each student to fix a leash on a skrewt and take it for a short walk the only good thing about this plan was that it distracted malfoy completely 
 
 take this thing for a walk he repeated in disgust staring into one of the boxes and where exactly are we supposed to fix the leash around the sting the blasting end or the sucker 
 
 roun the middle said hagrid demonstrating er yeh might want ter put on yer gloves jus as an extra precaution like harry you come here an help me with this big one 
 
 real intention however was totalk to harry away from the rest of the class he waited until everyone else had set off with their skrewts then turned to harry and said very seriously so yer competin harry in the tournament school champion 
 
 one of the champions harry corrected him 
 
 eyes looked very anxious under his wild eyebrows 
 
 no idea who put yeh in fer it harry 
 
 you believe i do it then said harry concealing with difficulty the rush of gratitude he felt at words 
 
 course i do hagrid grunted yeh say it wasn you an i believe yeh an dumbledore believes yer an all 
 
 wish i knew who did do it said harry bitterly 
 
 the pair of them looked out over the lawn the class was widely scattered now and all in great difficulty the skrewts were now over three feet long and extremely powerful no longer and colorless they had developed a kind of thick grayish shiny armor they looked like a cross between giant scorpions and elongated crabs but still without recognizable heads or eyes they had become immensely strong and very hard to control 
 
 look like havin fun don they hagrid said happily harry assumed he was talking about the skrewts because his classmates certainly every now and then with an alarming bang one of the skrewts ends would explode causing it to shoot forward several yards and more than one person was being dragged along on their stomach trying desperately to get back on their feet 
 
 ah i don know harry hagrid sighed suddenly looking back down at him with a worried expression on his face school championeverythin seems ter happen ter you doesn it 
 
 harry answer yes everything did seem to happen to himthat was more or less what hermione had said as they had walked around the lake and that was the reason according to her that ron was no longer talking to him 
 
 
 
 the next few days were some of worst at hogwarts the closest he had ever come to feeling like this had been during those months in his second year when a large part of the school had suspected him of attacking his fellow students but ron had been on his side then he thought he could have coped with the rest of the behavior if he could just have had ron back as a friend but he going to try and persuade ron to talk to him if ron want to nevertheless it was lonely with dislike pouring in on him from all sides 
 
 he could understand the hufflepuffs attitude even if he like it they had their own champion to support he expected nothing less than vicious insults from the slytherins he was highly unpopular there and always had been because he had helped gryffindor beat them so often both at quidditch and in the championship but he had hoped the ravenclaws might have found it in their hearts to support him as much as cedric he was wrong however most ravenclaws seemed to think that he had been desperate to earn himself a bit more fame by tricking the goblet into accepting his name 
 
 then there was the fact that cedric looked the part of a champion so much more than he did exceptionally handsome with his straight nose dark hair and gray eyes it was hard to say who was receiving more admiration these days cedric or viktor krum harry actually saw the same girls who had been so keen to get autograph begging cedric to sign their school bags one lunchtime 
 
 meanwhile there was no reply from sirius hedwig was refusing to come anywhere near him professor trelawney was predicting his death with even more certainty than usual and he did so badly at summoning charms in professor class that he was given extra homework the only person to get any apart from neville 
 
 really not that difficult harry hermione tried to reassure him as they left class she had been making objects zoom across the room to her all lesson as though she were some sort of weird magnet for board dusters wastepaper baskets and lunascopes you just concentrating properly 
 
 wonder why that was said harry darkly as cedric diggory walked past surrounded by a large group of simpering girls all of whom looked at harry as though he were a particularly large skrewt still never mind eh double potions to look forward to this afternoon 
 
 double potions was always a horrible experience but these days it was nothing short of torture being shut in a dungeon for an hour and a half with snape and the slytherins all of whom seemed determined to punish harry as much as possible for daring to become school champion was about the most unpleasant thing harry could imagine he had already struggled through one worth with hermione sitting next to him intoning ignore them ignore them ignore them under her breath and he see why today should be any better 
 
 when he and hermione arrived at dungeon after lunch they found the slytherins waiting outside each and every one of them wearing a large badge on the front of his or her robes for one wild moment harry thought they were badges then he saw that they all bore the same message in luminous red letters that burnt brightly in the dimly lit underground passage 
 
 support cedric diggory 
 the real hogwarts champion 
 like them potter said malfoy loudly as harry approached and this all they do look 
 
 he pressed his badge into his chest and the message upon it vanished to be replaced by another one which glowed green 
 
 potter stinks 
 the slytherins howled with laughter each of them pressed their badges too until the message potter stinks was shining brightly all around harry he felt the heat rise in his face and neck 
 
 oh very funny hermione said sarcastically to pansy parkinson and her gang of slytherin girls who were laughing harder than anyone really witty 
 
 ron was standing against the wall with dean and seamus he laughing but he sticking up for harry either 
 
 want one granger said malfoy holding out a badge to hermione got loads but touch my hand now just washed it you see want a mudblood sliming it up 
 
 some of the anger harry had been feeling for days and days seemed to burst through a dam in his chest he had reached for his wand before thought what he was doing people all around them scrambled out of the way backing down the corridor 
 
 harry hermione said warningly 
 
 go on then potter malfoy said quietly drawing out his own wand not here to look after you now do it if got the guts 
 
 for a split second they looked into each eyes then at exactly the same time both acted 
 
 funnunculus harry yelled 
 
 densaugeo screamed malfoy 
 
 jets of light shot from both wands hit each other in midair and ricocheted off at angles hit goyle in the face and hit hermione goyle bellowed and put his hands to his nose where great ugly boils were springing up hermione whimpering in panic was clutching her mouth 
 
 hermione 
 
 ron had hurried forward to see what was wrong with her harry turned and saw ron dragging hand away from her face it a pretty sight front teeth already larger than average were now growing at an alarming rate she was looking more and more like a beaver as her teeth elongated past her bottom lip toward her chin she felt them and let out a terrified cry 
 
 and what is all this noise about said a soft deadly voice 
 
 snape had arrived the slytherins clamored to give their explanations snape pointed a long yellow finger at malfoy and said explain 
 
 potter attacked me sir 
 
 we attacked each other at the same time harry shouted 
 
 and he hit goyle look 
 
 snape examined goyle whose face now resembled something that would have been at home in a book on poisonous fungi 
 
 hospital wing goyle snape said calmly 
 
 malfoy got hermione ron said look 
 
 he forced hermione to show snape her teeth she was doing her best to hide them with her hands though this was difficult as they had now grown down past her collar pansy parkinson and the other slytherin girls were doubled up with silent giggles pointing at hermione from behind back 
 
 snape looked coldly at hermione then said i see no difference 
 
 hermione let out a whimper her eyes filled with tears she turned on her heel and ran ran all the way up the corridor and out of sight 
 
 it was lucky perhaps that both harry and ron started shouting at snape at the same time lucky their voices echoed so much in the stone corridor for in the confused din it was impossible for him to hear exactly what they were calling him he got the gist however 
 
 see he said in his silkiest voice fifty points from gryffindor and a detention each for potter and weasley now get inside or be a worth of detentions 
 
 ears were ringing the injustice of it made him want to curse snape into a thousand slimy pieces he passed snape walked with ron to the back of the dungeon and slammed his bag down onto the table ron was shaking with anger too for a moment it felt as though everything was back to normal between them but then ron turned and sat down with dean and seamus instead leaving harry alone at his table on the other side of the dungeon malfoy turned his back on snape and pressed his badge smirking potter stinks flashed once more across the room 
 
 harry sat there staring at snape as the lesson began picturing horrific things happening to only he knew how to do the cruciatus have snape flat on his back like that spider jerking and twitching 
 
 antidotes said snape looking around at them all his cold black eyes glittering unpleasantly you should all have prepared your recipes now i want you to brew them carefully and then we will be selecting someone on whom to test one 
 
 eyes met and harry knew what was coming snape was going to poison him harry imagined picking up his cauldron and sprinting to the front of the class and bringing it down on greasy head and then a knock on the dungeon door burst in on thoughts 
 
 it was colin creevey he edged into the room beaming at harry and walked up to desk at the front of the room 
 
 yes said snape curtly 
 
 please sir supposed to take harry potter upstairs snape stared down his hooked nose at colin whose smile faded from his eager face 
 
 potter has another hour of potions to complete said snape coldly he will come upstairs when this class is finished 
 
 colin went pink 
 
 sir sir mr bagman wants him he said nervously all the champions have got to go i think they want to take photographs 
 
 harry would have given anything he owned to have stopped colin saying those last few words he chanced half a glance at ron but ron was staring determinedly at the ceiling 
 
 very well very well snape snapped potter leave your things here i want you back down here later to test your antidote 
 
 please sir got to take his things with him squeaked cohn all the champions 
 
 very well said snape potter take your bag and get out of my sight 
 
 harry swung his bag over his shoulder got up and headed for the door as he walked through the slytherin desks potter stinks flashed at him from every direction 
 
 amazing it harry said colin starting to speak the moment harry had closed the dungeon door behind him it though you being champion 
 
 yeah really amazing said harry heavily as they set off toward the steps into the entrance hall what do they want photos for colin 
 
 the daily prophet i think 
 
 great said harry dully exactly what i need more publicity 
 
 good luck said colin when they had reached the right room harry knocked on the door and entered 
 
 he was in a fairly small classroom most of the desks had been pushed away to the back of the room leaving a large space in the middle three of them however had been placed in front of the blackboard and covered with a long length of velvet five chairs had been set behind the desks and ludo bagman was sitting in one of them talking to a witch harry had never seen before who was wearing magenta robes 
 
 viktor krum was standing moodily in a corner as usual and not talking to anybody cedric and fheur were in conversation fheur looked a good deal happier than harry had seen her so far she kept throwing back her head so that her long silvery hair caught the light a paunchy man holding a large black camera that was smoking slightly was watching fleur out of the corner of his eye 
 
 bagman suddenly spotted harry got up quickly and bounded forward 
 
 ah here he is champion number four in you come harry in you comenothing to worry about just the wand weighing ceremony the rest of the judges will be here in a moment 
 
 wand weighing harry repeated nervously 
 
 we have to check that your wands are fully functional no problems you know as your most important tools in the tasks ahead said bagman the upstairs now with dumbledore and then going to be a little photo shoot this is rita skeeter he added gesturing toward the witch in magenta robes doing a small piece on the tournament for the daily prophet 
 
 maybe not that small ludo said rita skeeter her eyes on harry 
 
 her hair was set in elaborate and curiously rigid curls that contrasted oddly with her face she wore jeweled spectacles the thick fingers clutching her handbag ended in nails painted crimson 
 
 i wonder if i could have a little word with harry before we start she said to bagman but still gazing fixedly at harry the youngest champion you knowto add a bit of color 
 
 certainly cried bagman that is if harry has no objection 
 
 er said harry 
 
 lovely said rita skeeter and in a second her fingers had upper arm in a surprisingly strong grip and she was steering him out of the room again and opening a nearby door 
 
 we want to be in there with all that noise she said seeah yes this is nice and cozy 
 
 it was a broom cupboard harry stared at her 
 
 come along dear right lovely said rita skeeter again perching herself precariously upon an upturned bucket pushing harry down onto a cardboard box and closing the door throwing them into darkness see now 
 
 she unsnapped her handbag and pulled out a handful of candles which she lit with a wave of her wand and magicked into midair so that they could see what they were doing 
 
 you mind harry if i use a quill it leaves me free to talk to you normally 
 
 a what said harry 
 
 rita smile widened harry counted three gold teeth she reached again into her crocodile bag and drew out a long quill and a roll of parchment which she stretched out between them on a crate of mrs magical mess remover she put the tip of the green quill into her mouth sucked it for a moment with apparent relish then placed it upright on the parchment where it stood balanced on its point quivering slightly 
 
 testingmy name is rita skeeter daily prophet reporter 
 
 harry hooked down quickly at the quill the moment rita skeeter had spoken the green quill had started to scribble skidding across the parchment 
 
 attractive blonde rita skeeter savage quill has punctured many inflated reputations 
 lovely said rita skeeter yet again and she ripped the top piece of parchment off crumpled it up and stuffed it into her handbag now she leaned toward harry and said so harrywhat made you decide to enter the triwizard tournament 
 
 er said harry again but he was distracted by the quill even though he speaking it was dashing across the parchment and in its wake he could make out a fresh sentence 
 
 an ugly scar souvenier of a tragic past disfigures the otherwise charming face of harry potter whose eyes 
 ignore the quill harry said rita skeeter firmly reluctantly harry looked up at her instead now why did you decide to enter the tournament harry 
 
 i said harry i know how my name got into the goblet of fire i put it in there 
 
 rita skeeter raised one heavily penciled eyebrow 
 
 come now harry no need to be scared of getting into trouble we all know you really have entered at all but worry about that our readers hove a rebel 
 
 but i enter harry repeated i know who 
 
 how do you feel about the tasks ahead said rita skeeter excited nervous 
 
 i really thoughtyeah nervous i suppose said harry his insides squirmed uncomfortably as he spoke 
 
 champions have died in the past they said rita skeeter briskly have you thought about that at all 
 
 wellthey say going to be a lot safer this year said harry 
 
 the quill whizzed across the parchment between them back and forward as though it were skating 
 
 of course looked death in the face before you said rita skeeter watching him closely how would you say affected you 
 
 er said harry yet again 
 
 do you think that the trauma in your past might have made you keen to prove yourself to live up to your name do you think that perhaps you were tempted to enter the triwizard tournament because 
 
 i enter said harry starting to feel irritated 
 
 can you remember your parents at all said rita skeeter talking over him 
 
 no said harry 
 
 how do you think feel if they knew you were competing in the triwizard tournament proud worried angry 
 
 harry was feeling really annoyed now how on earth was he to know how his parents would feel if they were alive he could feel rita skeeter watching him very intently frowning he avoided her gaze and hooked down at words the quill had just written 
 
 tears fill those startlingly green eyes as our conversation turns to the parents he can barely remember 
 i have not got tears in my eyes said harry loudly 
 
 before rita skeeter could say a word the door of the broom cupboard was pulled open harry looked around blinking in the bright light albus dumbledore stood there looking down at both of them squashed into the cupboard 
 
 dumbledore cried rita skeeter with every appearance of delight but harry noticed that her quill and the parchment had suddenly vanished from the box of magical mess remover and clawed fingers were hastily snapping shut the clasp of her bag how are you she said standing up and holding out one of her large mannish hands to dumbledore i hope you saw my piece over the summer about the international confederation of wizards conference 
 
 enchantingly nasty said dumbledore his eyes twinkling i particularly enjoyed your description of me as an obsolete dingbat 
 
 rita skeeter look remotely abashed 
 
 i was just making the point that some of your ideas are a little dumbhedore and that many wizards in the street 
 
 i will be delighted to hear the reasoning behind the rudeness rita said dumbledore with a courteous bow and a smile but afraid we will have to discuss the matter later the weighing of the wands is about to start and it cannot take place if one of our champions is hidden in a broom cupboard 
 
 very glad to get away from rita skeeter harry hurried back into the room the other champions were now sitting in chairs near the door and he sat down quickly next to cedric hooking up at the table where four of the five judges were now sitting professor karkaroff madame maxime mr crouch and ludo bagman rita skeeter settled herself down in a corner harry saw her slip the parchment out of her bag again spread it on her knee suck the end of the quill and place it once more on the parchment 
 
 may i introduce mr ollivander said dumbledore taking his place at the judges table and talking to the champions he will be checking your wands to ensure that they are in good condition before the tournament 
 
 harry hooked around and with a jolt of surprise saw an old wizard with large pale eyes standing quietly by the window harry had met mr ollivander before he was the from whom harry had bought his own wand over three years ago in diagon alley 
 
 mademoiselle delacour could we have you first please said mr ollivander stepping into the empty space in the middle of the room 
 
 fleur delacour swept over to mr olhivander and handed him her wand 
 
 hmm he said 
 
 he twirled the wand between his long fingers like a baton and it emitted a number of pink and gold sparks then he held it chose to his eyes and examined it carefully 
 
 yes he said quietly nine and a half inchesinflexiblerosewoodand containingdear me 
 
 an air from ze ead of a veela said fleur one of my 
 
 so fleur was part veela thought harry making a mental note to tell ronthen he remembered that ron speaking to him 
 
 yes said mr ollivander yes never used veela hair myself of course i find it makes for rather temperamental wandshowever to each his own and if this suits you 
 
 mr ollivander ran his fingers along the wand apparently checking for scratches or bumps then he muttered orchideous and a bunch of flowers burst from the wand tip 
 
 very well very well in fine working order said mr ollivander scooping up the flowers and handing them to fleur with her wand mr diggory you next 
 
 fleur glided back to her seat smiling at cedric as he passed her 
 
 ah now this is one of mine it said mr ollivander with much more enthusiasm as cedric handed over his wand yes i remember it well containing a single hair from the tail of a particularly fine male unicornmust have been seventeen hands nearly gored me with his horn after i plucked his tail twelve and a quarter inchesashpleasantly springy in fine conditionyou treat it regularly 
 
 polished it last night said cedric grinning 
 
 harry hooked down at his own wand he could see finger marks all over it he gathered a fistful of robe from his knee and tried to rub it clean surreptitiously several gold sparks shot out of the end of it fleur delacour gave him a very patronizing look and he desisted 
 
 mr ollivander sent a stream of silver smoke rings across the room from the tip of wand pronounced himself satisfied and then said mr krum if you please 
 
 viktor krum got up and slouched and toward mr ollivander he thrust out his wand and stood scowling with his hands in the pockets of his robes 
 
 hmm said mr olhivander this is a gregorovitch creation unless much mistaken a fine though the styling is never quite what ihowever 
 
 he lifted the wand and examined it minutely turning it over and over before his eyes 
 
 yeshornbeam and dragon heartstring he shot at krum who nodded rather thicker than one usually seesquite rigidten and a quarter inchesavis 
 
 the hornbeam wand let off a blast hike a gun and a number of small twittering birds flew out of the end and through the open window into the watery sunlight 
 
 good said mr ollivander handing krum back his wand which leavesmr potter 
 
 harry got to his feet and walked past krum to mr ollivander he handed over his wand 
 
 aaaah yes said mr ohlivander his pale eyes suddenly gleaming yes yes yes how well i remember 
 
 harry could remember too he could remember it as though it had happened yesterday 
 
 four summers ago on his eleventh birthday he had entered mr shop with hagrid to buy a wand mr ollivander had taken his measurements and then started handing him wands to try harry had waved what felt like every wand in the shop until at last he had found the one that suited him this one which was made of holly eleven inches long and contained a single feather from the tail of a phoenix mr ollivander had been very surprised that harry had been so compatible with this wand curious he had said curious and not until harry asked what was curious had mr olhivander explained that the phoenix feather in wand had come from the same bird that had supplied the core of lord 
 
 harry had never shared this piece of information with anybody he was very fond of his wand and as far as he was concerned its relation to wand was something it help rather as he help being related to aunt petunia however he really hoped that mr ollivander about to tell the room about it he had a funny feeling rita quill might just explode with excitement if he did 
 
 mr ollivander spent much longer examining wand than anyone eventually however he made a fountain of wine shoot out of it and handed it back to harry announcing that it was still in perfect condition 
 
 thank you all said dumbledore standing up at the judges table you may go back to your lessons now or perhaps it would be quicker just to go down to dinner as they are about to end 
 
 feeling that at last something had gone right today harry got up to leave but the man with the black camera jumped up and cleared his throat 
 
 photos dumbledore photos cried bagman excitedly all the judges and champions what do you think rita 
 
 er yes do those first said rita skeeter whose eyes were upon harry again and then perhaps some individual shots 
 
 the photographs took a long time madame maxime cast everyone else into shadow wherever she stood and the photographer stand far enough back to get her into the frame eventually she had to sit while everyone else stood around her karkaroff kept twirling his goatee around his finger to give it an extra curl krum whom harry would have thought would have been used to this sort of thing skulked at the back of the group the photographer seemed keenest to get fleur at the front but rita skeeter kept hurrying forward and dragging harry into greater prominence then she insisted on separate shots of all the champions at last they were free to go 
 
 harry went down to dinner hermione there he supposed she was still in the hospital wing having her teeth fixed he ate alone at the end of the table then returned to gryffindor tower thinking of all the extra work on summoning charms that he had to do up in the dormitory he came across ron 
 
 had an owl said ron brusquely the moment he walked in he was pointing at pillow the school barn owl was waiting for him there 
 
 oh right said harry 
 
 and got to do our detentions tomorrow night dungeon said ron 
 
 he then walked straight out of the room not looking at harry for a moment harry considered going after him he sure whether he wanted to talk to him or hit him both seemed quite appealing but the lure of answer was too strong harry strode over to the barn owl took the letter off its leg and unrolled it 
 
 harry 
 i say everything i would like to in a letter too risky in case the owl is intercepted we need to talk can you ensure that you are alone by the fire in gryffindor tower at one in the morning on the nd ofnovember 
 i know better than anyone that you can look after yourself and while around dumbledore and moody i think anyone will be able to hurt you however someone seems to be having a good try entering you in that tournament would have been very risky especially right under nose 
 be on the watch harry i still want to hear about anything unusual let me know about the nd ofnovember as quickly as you can 
 sirius 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire 
 

lionfish nov chapter eighteen armycontents prev chapter next chapter 
 umbridge has been reading your mail harry no other explanation 
 
 you think umbridge attacked hedwig he said outraged 
 
 almost certain of it said hermione grimly watch your frog escaping 
 
 harry pointed his wand at the bullfrog that had been hopping hopefully towards the other side of the tableaccio and it zoomed gloomily back into his hand 
 
 charms was always one of the best lessons in which to enjoy a private chat there was generally so much movement and activity that the danger of being overheard was very slight today with the room full of croaking bullfrogs and cawing ravens and with a heavy downpour of rain clattering and pounding against the classroom windows harry ron and whispered discussion about how umbridge had nearly caught sirius went quite unnoticed 
 
 been suspecting this ever since filch accused you of ordering dungbombs because it seemed such a stupid lie hermione whispered i mean once your letter had been read it would have been quite clear you ordering them so you have been in trouble at a bit of a feeble joke it but then i thought what if somebody just wanted an excuse to read your mail well then it would be a perfect way for umbridge to manage it tip off filch let him do the dirty work and confiscate the letter then either find a way of stealing it from him or else demand to see iti think filch would object he ever stuck up for a rights harry squashing your frog 
 
 harry looked down he was indeed squeezing his bullfrog so tightly its eyes were popping he replaced it hastily upon the desk 
 
 it was a very very close call last night said hermione i just wonder if umbridge knows how close it was silencio 
 
 the bullfrog on which she was practising her silencing charm was struck dumb and glared at her reproachfully 
 
 if caught snuffles 
 
 harry finished the sentence for her 
 
 probably be back in azkaban this morning he waved his wand without really concentrating his bullfrog swelled like a green balloon and emitted a whistle 
 
 silencio said hermione hastily pointing her wand at frog which deflated silently before them well he do it again all i just know how going to let him know we send him an owl 
 
 i reckon risk it again said ron not stupid he knows she nearly got him silencio 
 
 the large and ugly raven in front of him let out a derisive caw 
 
 silencio silencio 
 
 the raven cawed more loudly 
 
 the way moving your wand said hermione watching ron critically you want to wave it more a sharp jab 
 
 ravens are harder than frogs said ron through clenched teeth 
 
 fi ne swap said hermione seizing raven and replacing it with her own fat bullfrog silencio the raven continued to open and close its sharp beak but no sound came out 
 
 very good miss granger said professor squeaky little voice making harry ron and hermione all jump now let me see you try mr weasley 
 
 wha ohoh right said ron very flustered ersilencio 
 
 he jabbed at the bullfrog so hard he poked it in the eye the frog gave a deafening croak and leapt off the desk 
 
 it came as no surprise to any of them that harry and ron were given additional practice of the silencing charm for homework 
 
 they were allowed to remain inside over break due to the downpour outside they found seats in a noisy and overcrowded classroom on the first floor in which peeves was floating dreamily up near the chandelier occasionally blowing an ink pellet at the top of head they had barely sat down when angelina came struggling towards them through the groups of gossiping students 
 
 got permission she said to the quidditch team 
 
 excellent said ron and harry together 
 
 yeah said angelina beaming i went to mcgonagall and i think she might have appealed to dumbledore anyway umbridge had to give in ha so i want you down at the pitch at seven tonight all right because got to make up time you realise only three weeks away from our first match 
 
 she squeezed away from them narrowly dodged an ink pellet from peeves which hit a nearby instead and vanished from sight 
 
 smile slipped slightly as he looked out of the window which was now opaque with hammering rain 
 
 hope this clears up up with you hermione 
 
 she too was gazing at the window but not as though she really saw it her eyes were unfocused and there was a frown on her face 
 
 just thinking she said still frowning at the window 
 
 about siri snuffles said harry 
 
 no not exactly said hermione slowly more wondering i suppose doing the right thing i think we 
 
 harry and ron looked at each other 
 
 well that clears that up said ron it been really annoying if you explained yourself properly 
 
 hermione looked at him as though she had only just realised he was there 
 
 i was just wondering she said her voice stronger now whether doing the right thing starting this defence against the dark arts group 
 
 what said harry and ron together 
 
 hermione it was your idea in the first place said ron indignantly 
 
 i know said hermione twisting her fingers together but after talking to snuffles 
 
 but all for it said harry 
 
 yes said hermione staring at the window again yes what made me think maybe it a good idea after all 
 
 peeves floated over them on his stomach peashooter at the ready automatically all three of them lifted their bags to cover their heads until he had passed 
 
 get this straight said harry angrily as they put their bags back on the floor sirius agrees with us so you think we should do it any more 
 
 hermione looked tense and rather miserable now staring at her own hands she said do you honestly trust his judgement 
 
 yes i do said harry at once always given us great advice 
 
 an ink pellet whizzed past them striking katie bell squarely in the ear hermione watched katie leap to her feet and start throwing things at peeves it was a few moments before hermione spoke again and it sounded as though she was choosing her words very carefully 
 
 you think he has become sort of reckless since been cooped up in grimmauld place you think kind of living through us 
 
 what mean living through us harry retorted 
 
 i mean well i think love to be forming secret defence societies right under the nose of someone from the ministry i think really frustrated at how little he can do where he is so i think keen to kind of egg us on 
 
 ron looked utterly perplexed 
 
 sirius is right he said you do sound just like my mother 
 
 hermione bit her lip and did not answer the bell rang just as peeves swooped down on katie and emptied an entire ink bottle over her head 
 
 the weather did not improve as the day wore on so that at seven that evening when harry and ron went down to the quidditch pitch for practice they were soaked through within minutes their feet slipping and sliding on the sodden grass the sky was a deep thundery grey and it was a relief to gain the warmth and light of the changing rooms even if they knew the respite was only temporary they found fred and george debating whether to use one of their own skiving snackboxes to get out of flying 
 
 but i bet know what done fred said out of the corner of his mouth if only i offered to sell her some puking pastilles yesterday 
 
 we could try the fever fudge george muttered no seen that yet 
 
 does it work enquired ron hopefully as the hammering of rain on the roof intensified and wind howled around the building 
 
 well yeah said fred your go right up 
 
 but you get these massive boils too said george and we worked out how to get rid of them yet 
 
 i see any boils said ron staring at the twins 
 
 no well you said fred darkly not in a place we generally display to the public 
 
 but they make sitting on a broom a right pain in the 
 
 all right everyone listen up said angelina loudly emerging from the office i know not ideal weather but a chance be playing slytherin in conditions like this so a good idea to work out how going to cope with them harry you do something to your glasses to stop the rain fogging them up when we played hufflepuff in that storm 
 
 hermione did it said harry he pulled out his wand tapped his glasses and said impervius 
 
 i think we all ought to try that said angelina if we could just keep the rain off our faces it would really help visibilityall together come go 
 
 they all stowed their wands back in the inside pockets of their robes shouldered their brooms and followed angelina out of the changing rooms 
 
 they squelched through the deepening mud to the middle of the pitch visibility was still very poor even with the impervius charm light was fading fast and curtains of rain were sweeping the grounds 
 
 all right on my whistle shouted angelina 
 
 harry kicked off from the ground spraying mud in all directions and shot upwards the wind pulling him slightly off course 
 
 he had no idea how he was going to see the snitch in this weather he was having enough difficulty seeing the one bludger with which they were practising a minute into the practice it almost unseated him and he had to use the sloth grip roll to avoid it unfortunately angelina did not see this in fact she did not appear to be able to see anything none of them had a clue what the others were doing the wind was picking up even at a distance harry could hear the swishing pounding sounds of the rain pummelling the surface of the lake 
 
 angelina kept them at it for nearly an hour before conceding defeat she led her sodden and disgruntled team back into the changing rooms insisting that the practice had not been a waste of time though without any real conviction in her voice fred and george were looking particularly annoyed both were and winced with every movement harry could hear them complaining in low voices as he towelled his hair dry 
 
 i think a few of mine have ruptured said fred in a hollow voice 
 
 mine said george through clenched teeth throbbing like mad feel bigger if anything 
 
 ouch said harry 
 
 he pressed the towel to his face his eyes screwed tight with pain the scar on his forehead had seared again more painfully than it had in weeks 
 
 up said several voices 
 
 harry emerged from behind his towel the changing room was blurred because he was not wearing his glasses but he could still tell that face was turned towards him 
 
 nothing he muttered ipoked myself in the eye all 
 
 but he gave ron a significant look and the two of them hung back as the rest of the team filed back outside muffled in their cloaks their hats pulled low over their ears 
 
 what happened said ron the moment alicia had disappeared through the door was it your scar 
 
 harry nodded 
 
 but looking scared ron strode across to the window and stared out into the rain hehe be near us now can he 
 
 no harry muttered sinking on to a bench and rubbing his forehead probably miles away it hurt because angry 
 
 harry had not meant to say that at all and heard the words as though a stranger had spoken themyet knew at once that they were true he did not know how he knew it but he did voldemort wherever he was whatever he was doing was in a towering temper 
 
 did you see him said ron looking horrified did you get a vision or something 
 
 harry sat quite still staring at his feet allowing his mind and his memory to relax in the aftermath of the pain 
 
 a confused tangle of shapes a howling rush of voices 
 
 he wants something done and not happening fast enough he said 
 
 again he felt surprised to hear the words coming out of his mouth and yet was quite certain they were true 
 
 but how do you know said ron 
 
 harry shook his head and covered his eyes with his hands pressing down upon them with his palms little stars erupted in them he felt ron sit down on the bench beside him and knew ron was staring at him 
 
 is this what it was about last time said ron in a hushed voice when your scar hurt in office was angry 
 
 harry shook his head 
 
 what is it then 
 
 harry was thinking himself back he had been looking into face his scar had hurt and he had had that odd feeling in his stomach a strange leaping feeling a happy feeling but of course he had not recognised it for what it was as he had been feeling so miserable himself 
 
 last time it was because he was pleased he said really pleased he thought something good was going to happen and the night before we came back to hogwarts he thought back to the moment when his scar had hurt so badly in his and bedroom in grimmauld place he was furious 
 
 he looked round at ron who was gaping at him 
 
 you could take over from trelawney mate he said in an awed voice 
 
 not making prophecies said harry 
 
 no you know what doing ron said sounding both scared and impressed harry reading mind 
 
 no said harry shaking his head more like his mood i suppose just getting flashes of what mood in dumbledore said something like this was happening last year he said that when voldemort was near me or when he was feeling hatred i could tell well now feeling it when pleased too 
 
 there was a pause the wind and rain lashed at the building 
 
 got to tell someone said ron 
 
 i told sirius last time 
 
 well tell him about this time 
 
 can i said harry grimly umbridge is watching the owls and the fires remember 
 
 well then dumbledore 
 
 just told you he already knows said harry shortly getting to his feet taking his cloak off his peg and swinging it around him no point telling him again 
 
 ron did up the fastening of his own cloak watching harry thoughtfully 
 
 want to know he said 
 
 harry shrugged 
 
 still got silencing charms to practise 
 
 they hurried back through the dark grounds sliding and stumbling up the muddy lawns not talking harry was thinking hard what was it that voldemort wanted done that was not happening quickly enough 
 
 got other plans plans he can put into operation very quietly indeed stuff he can only get by stealth like a weapon something he have last time 
 
 harry had not thought about those words in weeks he had been too absorbed in what was going on at hogwarts too busy dwelling on the ongoing battles with umbridge the injustice of all the ministry interference but now they came back to him and made him wonder anger would make sense if he was no nearer to laying hands on the weapon whatever it was had the order thwarted him stopped him from seizing it where was it kept who had it now 
 
 mimbulus mimbletonia said voice and harry came back to his senses just in time to clamber through the portrait hole into the common room 
 
 it appeared that hermione had gone to bed early leaving crookshanks curled in a nearby chair and an assortment of knobbly knitted elf hats lying on a table by the fire harry was rather grateful that she was not around because he did not much want to discuss his scar hurting and have her urge him to go to dumbledore too ron kept throwing him anxious glances but harry pulled out his charms books and set to work on finishing his essay though he was only pretending to concentrate and by the time ron said he was going up to bed too he had written hardly anything 
 
 midnight came and went while harry was reading and rereading a passage about the uses of lovage and sneezewort and not taking in a word of it 
 
 these plantes are moste efficacious in the inflaming of the braine and are therefore much used in confusing and befuddlement draughts where the wizard is desirous of producing and recklessness 
 
 hermione said sirius was becoming reckless cooped up in grimmauld place 
 
 moste efficacious in the inflaming of the braine and are therefore much used 
 
 the daily prophet would think his brain was inflamed if they found out that he knew what voldemort was feeling 
 
 therefore much used in confusing and befuddlement draughts 
 
 confusing was the word all right why did he know what voldemort was feeling what was this weird connection between them which dumbledore had never been able to explain satisfactorily 
 
 where the wizard is desirous 
 
 how harry would like to sleep 
 
 of producing 
 
 it was warm and comfortable in his armchair before the fire with the rain still beating heavily on the windowpanes crookshanks purring and the crackling of the flames 
 
 the book slipped from slack grip and landed with a dull thud on the hearthrug his head lolled sideways 
 
 he was walking once more along a windowless corridor his footsteps echoing in the silence as the door at the end of the passage loomed larger his heart beat fast with excitement if he could only open it enter beyond 
 
 he stretched out his hand his fingertips were inches from it 
 
 harry potter sir 
 
 he awoke with a start the candles had all been extinguished in the common room but there was something moving close by 
 
 whozair said harry sitting upright in his chair the fire was almost out the room very dark 
 
 dobby has your owl sir said a squeaky voice 
 
 dobby said harry thickly peering through the gloom towards the source of the voice 
 
 dobby the was standing beside the table on which hermione had left half a dozen of her knitted hats his large pointed ears were now sticking out from beneath what looked like all the hats hermione had ever knitted he was wearing one on top of the other so that his head seemed elongated by two or three feet and on the very topmost bobble sat hedwig hooting serenely and obviously cured 
 
 dobby volunteered to return harry owl said the elf squeakily with a look of positive adoration on his face professor says she is all well now sir he sank into a deep bow so that his nose brushed the threadbare surface of the hearthrug and hedwig gave an indignant hoot and fluttered on to the arm of chair 
 
 thanks dobby said harry stroking head and blinking hard trying to rid himself of the image of the door in his dream it had been very vivid surveying dobby more closely he noticed that the elf was also wearing several scarves and innumerable socks so that his feet looked far too big for his body 
 
 er have you been taking all the clothes been leaving out 
 
 oh no sir said dobby happily dobby has been taking some for winky too sir 
 
 yeah how is winky asked harry 
 
 ears drooped slightly 
 
 winky is still drinking lots sir he said sadly his enormous round green eyes large as tennis balls downcast she still does not care for clothes harry potter nor do the other none of them will clean gryffindor tower any more not with the hats and socks hidden everywhere they finds them insulting sir dobby does it all himself sir but dobby does not mind sir for he always hopes to meet harry potter and tonight sir he has got his wish dobby sank into a deep bow again but harry potter does not seem happy dobby went on straightening up again and kicking timidly at harry dobby heard him muttering in his sleep was harry potter having bad dreams 
 
 not really bad said harry yawning and rubbing his eyes had worse 
 
 the elf surveyed harry out of his vast eyes then he said very seriously his ears drooping dobby wishes he could help harry potter for harry potter set dobby free and dobby is much much happier now 
 
 harry smiled 
 
 you help me dobby but thanks for the offer 
 
 he bent and picked up his potions book have to try to finish the essay tomorrow he closed the book and as he did so the firelight illuminated the thin white scars on the back of his handthe result of his detentions with umbridge 
 
 wait a moment there is something you can do for me dobby said harry slowly 
 
 the elf looked round beaming 
 
 name it harry potter sir 
 
 i need to find a place where people can practise defence against the dark arts without being discovered by any of the teachers especially harry clenched his hand on the book so that the scars shone pearly white professor umbridge 
 
 he expected the smile to vanish his ears to droop he expected him to say it was impossible or else that he would try to find somewhere but his hopes were not high what he had not expected was for dobby to give a little skip his ears waggling cheerfully and clap his hands together 
 
 dobby knows the perfect place sir he said happily dobby heard tell of it from the other when he came to hogwarts sir it is known by us as the come and go room sir or else as the room of requirement 
 
 why said harry curiously 
 
 because it is a room that a person can only enter said dobby seriously when they have real need of it sometimes it is there and sometimes it is not but when it appears it is always equipped for the needs dobby has used it sir said the elf dropping his voice and looking guilty when winky has been very drunk he has hidden her in the room of requirement and he has found antidotes to butterbeer there and a nice bed to settle her on while she sleeps it off sir and dobby knows mr filch has found extra cleaning materials there when he has run short sir and 
 
 and if you really needed a bathroom said harry suddenly remembering something dumbledore had said at the yule ball the previous christmas would it fill itself with chamber pots 
 
 dobby expects so sir said dobby nodding earnestly it is a most amazing room sir 
 
 how many people know about it said harry sitting up straight er in his chair 
 
 very few sir mostly people stumbles across it when they needs it sir but often they never finds it again for they do not know that it is always there waiting to be called into service sir 
 
 it sounds brilliant said harry his heart racing it sounds perfect dobby when can you show me where it is 
 
 any time harry potter sir said dobby looking delighted at enthusiasm we could go now if you like 
 
 for a moment harry was tempted to go with dobby he was halfway out of his seat intending to hurry upstairs for his invisibility cloak when not for the first time a voice very much like whispered in his ear was after all very late he was exhausted and had essay to finish 
 
 not tonight dobby said harry reluctantly sinking back into his chair this is really important i want to blow it need proper planning listen can you just tell me exactly where this room of requirement is and how to get in there 
 
 their robes billowed and swirled around them as they splashed across the flooded vegetable patch to double herbology where they could hardly hear what professor sprout was saying over the hammering of raindrops hard as hailstones on the greenhouse roof the care of magical creatures lesson was to be relocated from the grounds to a free classroom on the ground floor and to their intense relief angelina had sought out her team at lunch to tell them that quidditch practice was cancelled 
 
 good said harry quietly when she told him because found somewhere to have our first defence meeting tonight eight seventh floor opposite that tapestry of barnabas the barmy being clubbed by those trolls can you tell katie and alicia 
 
 she looked slightly taken aback but promised to tell the others harry returned hungrily to his sausages and mash when he looked up to take a drink of pumpkin juice he found hermione watching him 
 
 what he said thickly 
 
 well just that plans always that safe you remember when he lost you all the bones in your arm 
 
 this room just some mad idea of dumbledore knows about it too he mentioned it to me at the yule ball 
 
 expression cleared 
 
 dumbledore told you about it 
 
 just in passing said harry shrugging 
 
 oh well all right then said hermione briskly and raised no more objections 
 
 together with ron they had spent most of the day seeking out those people who had signed their names to the list in the head and telling them where to meet that evening somewhat to disappointment it was ginny who managed to find cho chang and her friend first however by the end of dinner he was confident that the news had been passed to every one of the people who had turned up in the head 
 
 at half past seven harry ron and hermione left the gryffindor common room harry clutching a certain piece of aged parchment in his hand were allowed to be out in the corridors until nine but all three of them kept looking around nervously as they made their way along the seventh floor 
 
 hold it harry warned unfolding the piece of parchment at the top of the last staircase tapping it with his wand and muttering i solemnly swear that i am up to no good 
 
 a map of hogwarts appeared on the blank surface of the parchment tiny black moving dots labelled with names showed where various people were 
 
 filch is on the second floor said harry holding the map close to his eyes and mrs norris is on the fourth 
 
 and umbridge said hermione anxiously 
 
 in her office said harry pointing ok go 
 
 they hurried along the corridor to the place dobby had described to harry a stretch of blank wall opposite an enormous tapestry depicting barnabas the foolish attempt to train trolls for the ballet 
 
 ok said harry quietly while a troll paused in his relentless clubbing of the ballet teacher to watch them dobby said to walk past this bit of wall three times concentrating hard on what we need 
 
 they did so turning sharply at the window just beyond the blank stretch of wall then at the vase on its other side ron had screwed up his eyes in concentration hermione was whispering something under her breath fists were clenched as he stared ahead of him 
 
 we need somewhere to learn to fight he thought just give us a place to practise somewhere they find us 
 
 harry said hermione sharply as they wheeled around after their third walk past 
 
 a highly polished door had appeared in the wall ron was staring at it looking slightly wary harry reached out seized the brass handle pulled open the door and led the way into a spacious room lit with flickering torches like those that illuminated the dungeons eight floors below 
 
 the walls were lined with wooden bookcases and instead of chairs the re were large silk cushions on the floor a set of shelves at the far end of the room carried a range of instruments such as sneakoscopes secrecy sensors and a large cracked that harry was sure had hung the previous year in the fake office 
 
 these will be good when practising stunning said ron enthusiastically prodding one of the cushions with his foot 
 
 and just look at these books said hermione excitedly running a finger along the spines of the large tomes a compendium of common curses and their the dark arts outsmarted spellwork wow she looked around at harry her face glowing and he saw that the presence of hundreds of books had finally convinced hermione that what they were doing was right harry this is wonderful everything we need here 
 
 and without further ado she slid jinxes for the jinxed from its shelf sank on to the nearest cushion and began to read 
 
 there was a gentle knock on the door harry looked round ginny neville lavender parvati and dean had arrived 
 
 whoa said dean staring around impressed what is this place 
 
 harry began to explain but before he had finished more people had arrived and he had to start all over again by the time eight arrived every cushion was occupied harry moved across to the door and turned the key protruding from the lock it clicked in a satisfyingly loud way and everybody fell silent looking at him hermione carefully marked her page of jinxes for the jinxed and set the book aside 
 
 well said harry slightly nervously this is the place found for practice sessions and found it ok 
 
 fantastic said cho and several people murmured their agreement 
 
 bizarre said fred frowning around at it we once hid from filch in here remember george but it was just a broom cupboard then 
 
 hey harry this stuff asked dean from the rear of the room indicating the sneakoscopes and the 
 
 dark detectors said harry stepping between the cushions to reach them basically they all show when dark wizards or enemies are around but you want to rely on them too much they can be fooled 
 
 he gazed for a moment into the cracked shadowy figures were moving around inside it though none was recognisable he turned his back on it 
 
 well been thinking about the sort of stuff we ought to do first ander he noticed a raised hand what hermione 
 
 i think we ought to elect a leader said hermione 
 
 leader said cho at once looking at hermione as though she were mad 
 
 stomach did yet another 
 
 yes but i think we ought to vote on it properly said hermione unperturbed it makes it formal and it gives him authority soeveryone who thinks harry ought to be our leader 
 
 everybody put up their hand even zacharias smith though he did it very 
 
 erright thanks said harry who could feel his face burning 
 
 i also think we ought to have a name she said brightly her hand still in the air it would promote a feeling of team spirit and unity you think 
 
 can we be the league said angelina hopefully 
 
 or the ministry of magic are morons group suggested fred 
 
 i was thinking said hermione frowning at fred more of a name that tell everyone what we were up to so we can refer to it safely outside meetings 
 
 the defence association said cho the da for short so nobody knows what talking about 
 
 yeah the good said ginny only make it stand for army because the worst fear it 
 
 there was a good deal of appreciative murmuring and laughter at this 
 
 all in favour of the da said hermione bossily kneeling up on her cushion to count a majoritymotion passed 
 
 she pinned the piece of parchment with all of their signatures on it on to the wall and wrote across the top in large letters 
 
 army 
 
 right said harry when she had sat down again shall we get practising then i was thinking the first thing we should do is expelliarmus you know the disarming charm i know pretty basic but found it really useful 
 
 oh please said zacharias smith rolling his eyes and folding his arms i think expelliarmus is exactly going to help us against do you 
 
 used it against him said harry quietly it saved my life in june 
 
 smith opened his mouth stupidly the rest of the room was very quiet 
 
 but if you think beneath you you can leave harry said 
 
 smith did not move nor did anybody else 
 
 ok said harry his mouth slightly drier than usual with all these eyes upon him i reckon we should all divide into pairs and practise 
 
 it felt very odd to be issuing instructions but not nearly as odd as seeing them followed everybody got to their feet at once and divided up predictably neville was left partnerless 
 
 you can practise with me harry told him righton the count of three thenone two three 
 
 the room was suddenly full of shouts of flew in all directions missed spells hit books on shelves and sent them flying into the air harry was too quick for neville whose wand went spinning out of his hand hit the ceiling in a shower of sparks and landed with a clatter on top of a bookshelf from which harry retrieved it with a summoning charm glancing around he thought he had been right to suggest they practise the basics first there was a lot of shoddy spellwork going on many people were not succeeding in disarming their opponents at all but merely causing them to jump backwards a few paces or wince as their feeble spell whooshed over them 
 
 expelliarmus said neville and harry caught unawares felt his wand fly out of his hand 
 
 i did it said neville gleefully never done it beforei did it 
 
 good one said harry encouragingly deciding not to point out that in a real duel opponent was unlikely to be staring in the opposite direction with his wand held loosely at his side listen neville can you take it in turns to practise with ron and hermione for a couple of minutes so i can walk around and see how the rest are doing 
 
 harry moved off into the middle of the room something very odd was happening to zacharias smith every time he opened his mouth to disarm anthony goldstein his own wand would fly out of his hand yet anthony did not seem to be making a sound harry did not have to look far to solve the mystery fred and george were several feet from smith and taking it in turns to point their wands at his back 
 
 sorry harry said george hastily when harry caught his eye resist 
 
 harry walked around the other pairs trying to correct those who were doing the spell wrong ginny was teamed with michael corner she was doing very well whereas michael was either very bad or unwilling to jinx her ernie macmillan was flourishing his wand unnecessarily giving his partner time to get in under his guard the creevey brothers were enthusiastic but erratic and mainly responsible for all the books leaping off the shelves around them luna lovegood was similarly patchy occasionally sending justin wand spinning out of his hand at other times merely causing his hair to stand on end 
 
 ok stop harry shouted stop stop 
 
 i need a whistle he thought and immediately spotted one lying on top of the nearest row of books he caught it up and blew hard everyone lowered their wands 
 
 that bad said harry but definite room for improvement zacharias smith glared at him try again 
 
 he moved off around the room again stopping here and there to make suggestions slowly the general performance improved 
 
 he avoided going near cho and her friend for a while but after walking twice around every other pair in the room felt he could not ignore them any longer 
 
 oh no said cho rather wildly as he approached mean expellimellius ioh sorry marietta 
 
 her sleeve had caught fire marietta extinguished it with her own wand and glared at harry as though it was his fault 
 
 you made me nervous i was doing all right before then cho told harry ruefully 
 
 that was quite good harry lied but when she raised her eyebrows he said well no it was lousy but i know you can do it properly i was watching from over there 
 
 she laughed her friend marietta looked at them rather sourly and turned away 
 
 mind her cho muttered she really want to be here but i made her come with me her parents have forbidden her to do anything that might upset umbridge you seeher mum works for the ministry 
 
 what about your parents asked harry 
 
 well forbidden me to get on the wrong side of umbridge too said cho drawing herself up proudly but if they think not going to fight after what happened to cedric 
 
 she broke off looking rather confused and an awkward silence fell between them terry wand went whizzing past ear and hit alicia spinnet hard on the nose 
 
 well my dad is very supportive of any action said luna lovegood proudly from just behind harry evidently she had been eavesdropping on his conversation while justin attempted to disentangle himself from the robes that had flown up over his head always saying believe anything of fudge i mean the number of goblins fudge has had assassinated and of course he uses the department of mysteries to develop terrible poisons which he secretly feeds to anybody who disagrees with him and then his umgubular slashkilter 
 
 ask harry muttered to cho as she opened her mouth looking puzzled she giggled 
 
 hey harry hermione called from the other end of the room have you checked the time 
 
 he looked down at his watch and was shocked to see it was already ten past nine which meant they needed to get back to their common rooms immediately or risk being caught and punished by filch for being out of bounds he blew his whistle everybody stopped shouting expelliarmus and the last couple of wands clattered to the floor 
 
 well that was pretty good said harry but overrun better leave it here same time same place next week 
 
 sooner said dean thomas eagerly and many people nodded in agreement 
 
 angelina however said quickly the quidditch about to start we need team practices too 
 
 say next wednesday night then said harry we can decide on additional meetings then come on better get going 
 
 he pulled out the map again and checked it carefully for signs of teachers on the seventh floor he let them all leave in threes and fours watching their tiny dots anxiously to see that they returned safely to their dormitories the hufflepuffs to the basement corridor that also led to the kitchens the ravenclaws to a tower on the west side of the castle and the gryffindors along the corridor to the fat portrait 
 
 that was really really good harry said hermione when finally it was just her harry and ron who were left 
 
 yeah it was said ron enthusiastically as they slipped out of the door and watched it melt back into stone behind them did you see me disarm hermione harry 
 
 only once said hermione stung i got you loads more than you got me 
 
 i did not only get you once i got you at least three times 
 
 well if counting the one where you tripped over your own feet and knocked the wand out of my hand 
 
 they argued all the way back to the common room but harry was not listening to them he had one eye on the map but he was also thinking of cho saying he made her nervous 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter eighteen birthday surprisescontents prev chapter next chapter 
 the next day harry confided in both ron and hermione the task that dumbledore had set him though separately for hermione still refused to remain in presence longer than it took to give him a contemptuous look 
 
 ron thought that harry was unlikely to have any trouble with slughorn at all 
 
 he loves you he said over breakfast waving an airy forkful of fried egg refuse you anything will he not his little potions prince just hang back after class this afternoon and ask him 
 
 hermione however took a gloomier view 
 
 he must be determined to hide what really happened if dumbledore get it out of him she said in a low voice as they stood in the deserted snowy courtyard at break horcruxes horcruxes never even heard of them 
 
 you 
 
 harry was disappointed he had hoped that hermione might have been able to give him a clue as to what horcruxes were 
 
 they must be really advanced dark magic or why would voldemort have wanted to know about them i think going to be difficult to get the information harry have to be very careful about how you approach slughorn think out a strategy 
 
 ron reckons i should just hang back after potions this afternoon 
 
 oh well if thinks that better do it she said flaring up at once after all when has judgement ever been faulty 
 
 hermione you 
 
 no she said angrily and stormed away leaving harry alone and in snow 
 
 potions lessons were uncomfortable enough these days seeing as harry ron and hermione had to share a desk today hermione moved her cauldron around the table so that she was close to ernie and ignored both harry and ron 
 
 you done ron muttered to harry looking at haughty profile 
 
 but before harry could answer slughorn was calling for silence from the front of the room 
 
 settle down settle down please quickly now lots of work to get through this afternoon third law who can tell me but miss granger can of course 
 
 hermione recited at top speed 
 
 precisely beamed slughorn ten points for gryffindor now if we accept third law as true 
 
 harry was going to have to take word for it that third law was true because he had not understood any of it nobody apart from hermione seemed to be following what slughorn said next either 
 
 which means of course that assuming we have achieved correct identification of the ingredients by revelaspell our primary aim is not the relatively simple one of selecting antidotes to those ingredients in and of themselves but to find that added component which will by an almost alchemical process transform these disparate elements 
 
 ron was sitting beside harry with his mouth doodling absently on his new copy of advanced ron kept forgetting that he could no longer rely on hermione to help him out of trouble when he failed to grasp what was going on 
 
 and so finished slughorn i want each of you to come and take one of these phials from my desk you are to create an antidote for the poison within it before the end of the lesson good luck and forget your protective gloves 
 
 hermione had left her stool and was halfway towards desk before the rest of the class had realised it was time to move and by the time harry ron and ernie returned to the table she had already tipped the contents of her phial into her cauldron and was kindling a fire underneath it 
 
 a shame that the prince be able to help you much with this harry she said brightly as she straightened up you have to understand the principles involved this time no short cuts or cheats 
 
 annoyed harry uncorked the poison he had taken from desk which was a garish shade of pink tipped it into his cauldron and lit a fire underneath it he did not have the faintest idea what he was supposed to do next he glanced at ron who was now standing there looking rather gormless having copied everything harry had done 
 
 you sure the prince got any tips ron muttered to harry 
 
 harry pulled out his trusty copy of advanced and turned to the chapter on antidotes there was third law stated word for word as hermione had recited it but not a single illuminating note in the hand to explain what it meant apparently the prince like hermione had had no difficulty understanding it 
 
 nothing said harry gloomily 
 
 hermione was now waving her wand enthusiastically over her cauldron unfortunately they could not copy the spell she was doing because she was now so good at incantations that she did not need to say the words aloud ernie macmillan however was muttering specialis revelio over his cauldron which sounded impressive so harry and ron hastened to imitate him 
 
 it took harry only five minutes to realise that his reputation as the best in the class was crashing around his ears slughorn had peered hopefully into his cauldron on his first circuit of the dungeon preparing to exclaim in delight as he usually did and instead had withdrawn his head hastily coughing as the smell of bad eggs overwhelmed him expression could not have been any smugger she had loathed being in every potions class she was now decanting the mysteriously separated ingredients of her poison into ten different crystal phials more to avoid watching this irritating sight than anything else harry bent over the book and turned a few pages with unnecessary force 
 
 and there it was scrawled right across a long list of antidotes 
 
 just shove a bezoar down their throats 
 
 harry stared at these words for a moment he once long ago heard of bezoars snape mentioned them in their first ever potions lesson a stone taken from the stomach of a goat which will protect from most poisons 
 
 it was not an answer to the golpalott problem and had snape still been their teacher harry would not have dared do it but this was a moment for desperate measures he hastened towards the store cupboard and rummaged within it pushing aside unicorn horns and tangles of dried herbs until he found at the very back a small card box on which had been scribbled the word bezoars 
 
 he opened the box just as slughorn called two minutes left everyone inside were half a dozen shrivelled brown objects looking more like kidneys than real stones harry seized one put the box back in the cupboard and hurried back to his cauldron 
 
 up called slughorn genially well see how done blaise what have you got for me 
 
 slowly slughorn moved around the room examining the various antidotes nobody had finished the task although hermione was trying to cram a few more ingredients into her bottle before slughorn reached her ron had given up completely and was merely trying to avoid breathing in the putrid fumes issuing from his cauldron harry stood there waiting the bezoar clutched in a slightly sweaty hand 
 
 slughorn reached their table last he sniffed potion and passed on to with a grimace he did not linger over cauldron but backed away swiftly retching slightly 
 
 and you harry he said what have you got to show me 
 
 harry held out his hand the bezoar sitting on his palm 
 
 slughorn looked down at it for a full ten seconds harry wondered for a moment whether he was going to shout at him then he threw back his head and roared with laughter 
 
 got a nerve boy he boomed taking the bezoar and holding it up so that the class could see it oh like your mother well i fault you a bezoar would certainly act as an antidote to all these potions 
 
 hermione who was and had soot on her nose looked livid her antidote comprising ingredients including a chunk of her own hair bubbled sluggishly behind slughorn who had eyes for nobody but harry 
 
 and you thought of a bezoar all by yourself did you harry she asked through gritted teeth 
 
 the individual spirit a real needs said slughorn happily before harry could reply just like his mother she had the same intuitive grasp of undoubtedly from lily he gets it yes harry yes if got a bezoar to hand of course that would do the trick although as they work on everything and are pretty rare still worth knowing how to mix antidotes 
 
 the only person in the room looking angrier than hermione was malfoy who harry was pleased to see had spilled something that looked like cat sick over himself before either of them could express their fury that harry had come top of the class by not doing any work however the bell rang 
 
 time to pack up said slughorn and an extra ten points to gryffindor for sheer cheek 
 
 still chuckling he waddled back to his desk at the front of the dungeon 
 
 harry dawdled behind taking an inordinate amount of time to do up his bag neither ron nor hermione wished him luck as they left both looked rather annoyed at last harry and slughorn were the only two left in the room 
 
 come on now harry be late for your next lesson said slughorn affably snapping the gold clasps shut on his dragonskin briefcase 
 
 sir said harry reminding himself irresistibly of voldemort i wanted to ask you something 
 
 ask away then my dear boy ask away 
 
 sir i wondered what you know about about horcruxes 
 
 slughorn froze his round face seemed to sink in upon itself he licked his lips and said hoarsely what did you say 
 
 i asked whether you know anything about horcruxes sir you see 
 
 dumbledore put you up to this whispered slughorn 
 
 his voice had changed completely it was not genial any more but shocked terrified he fumbled in his breast pocket and pulled out a handkerchief mopping his sweating brow 
 
 shown you thatthat memory said slughorn well he 
 
 yes said harry deciding on the spot that it was best not to lie 
 
 yes of course said slughorn quietly still dabbing at his white face of course well if seen that memory harry know that i know anythinganything he repeated the word forcefully about horcruxes 
 
 he seized his dragonskin briefcase stuffed his handkerchief back into his pocket and marched to the dungeon door 
 
 sir said harry desperately i just thought there might be a bit more to the memory 
 
 did you said slughorn then you were wrong you wrong 
 
 he bellowed the last word and before harry could say another word slammed the dungeon door behind him 
 
 neither ron nor hermione was at all sympathetic when harry told them of this disastrous interview hermione was still seething at the way harry had triumphed without doing the work properly ron was resentful that harry slipped him a bezoar too 
 
 it just looked stupid if both done it said harry irritably look i had to try and soften him up so i could ask him about voldemort i oh will you get a grip he added in exasperation as ron winced at the sound of the name 
 
 infuriated by his failure and by ron and attitudes harry brooded for the next few days over what to do next about slughorn he decided that for the time being he would let slughorn think that he had forgotten all about horcruxes it was surely best to lull him into a false sense of security before returning to the attack 
 
 when harry did not question slughorn again the potions master reverted to his usual affectionate treatment of him and appeared to have put the matter from his mind harry awaited an invitation to one of his little evening parties determined to accept this time even if he had to reschedule quidditch practice unfortunately however no such invitation arrived harry checked with hermione and ginny neither of them had received an invitation and nor as far as they knew had anybody else harry could not help wondering whether this meant that slughorn was not quite as forgetful as he appeared simply determined to give harry no additional opportunities to question him 
 
 meanwhile the hogwarts library had failed hermione for the first time in living memory she was so shocked she even forgot that she was annoyed at harry for his trick with the bezoar 
 
 i found one single explanation of what horcruxes do she told him not a single one been right through the restricted section and even in the most horrible books where they tell you how to brew the most gruesome potionsnothing all i could find was this in the introduction to magick most the horcrux wickedest of magical inventions we shall not speak nor give direction i mean why mention it then she said impatiently slamming the old book shut it let out a ghostly wail oh shut up she snapped stuffing it back into her bag 
 
 the snow melted around the school as february arrived to be replaced by cold dreary wetness clouds hung low over the castle and a constant fall of chilly rain made the lawns slippery and muddy the upshot of this was that the first apparition lesson which was scheduled for a saturday morning so that no normal lessons would be missed took place in the great hall instead of in the grounds 
 
 when harry and hermione arrived in the hall ron had come down with lavender they found that the tables had disappeared rain lashed against the high windows and the enchanted ceiling swirled darkly above them as they assembled in front of professors mcgonagall snape flitwick and sproutthe heads of houseand a small wizard whom harry took to be the apparition instructor from the ministry he was oddly colourless with transparent eyelashes wispy hair and an insubstantial air as though a single gust of wind might blow him away harry wondered whether constant disappearances and reappearances had somehow diminished his substance or whether this frail build was ideal for anyone wishing to vanish 
 
 good morning said the ministry wizard when all the students had arrived and the heads of house had called for quiet my name is wilkie twycross and i shall be your instructor for the next twelve weeks i hope to be able to prepare you for your apparition test in this time 
 
 malfoy be quiet and pay attention barked professor mcgonagall 
 
 everybody looked round malfoy had flushed a dull pink he looked furious as he stepped away from crabbe with whom he appeared to have been having a whispered argument harry glanced quickly at snape who also looked annoyed though harry strongly suspected that this was less because of rudeness than the fact that mcgonagall had reprimanded one of his house 
 
 by which time many of you may be ready to take your test twycross continued as though there had been no interruption 
 
 as you may know it is usually impossible to apparate or disapparate within hogwarts the headmaster has lifted this enchantment purely within the great hall for one hour so as to enable you to practise may i emphasise that you will not be able to apparate outside the walls of this hall and that you would be unwise to try 
 
 i would like each of you to place yourselves now so that you have a clear five feet of space in front of you 
 
 there was a great scrambling and jostling as people separated banged into each other and ordered others out of their space the heads of house moved among the students marshalling them into position and breaking up arguments 
 
 harry where are you going demanded hermione 
 
 but harry did not answer he was moving quickly through the crowd past the place where professor flitwick was making squeaky attempts to position a few ravenclaws all of whom wanted to be near the front past professor sprout who was chivvying the hufflepuffs into line until by dodging around ernie macmillan he managed to position himself right at the back of the crowd directly behind malfoy who was taking advantage of the general upheaval to continue his argument with crabbe standing five feet away and looking mutinous 
 
 i know how much longer all right malfoy shot at him oblivious to harry standing right behind him taking longer than i thought it would 
 
 crabbe opened his mouth but malfoy appeared to what he was going to say 
 
 look none of your business what doing crabbe you and goyle just do as told and keep a lookout 
 
 tell my friends what up to if i want them to keep a lookout for me harry said just loud enough for malfoy to hear him 
 
 malfoy spun round on the spot his hand flying to his wand but at thai precise moment the four heads of house shouted quiet and silence fell again malfoy turned slowly to face the front 
 
 thank you said twycross now then 
 
 he waved his wand wooden hoops instantly appeared on the floor in from of every student 
 
 the important things to remember when apparating are the three ds said twycross destination determination deliberation 
 
 step one fix your mind firmly upon the desired destination said twycross in this case the interior of your hoop kindly concentrate upon that destination now 
 
 everybody looked around furtively to check that everyone else was staring into their hoop then hastily did as they were told harry gazed at the circular patch of dusty floor enclosed by his hoop and tried hard to think of nothing else this proved impossible as he stop puzzling over what malfoy was doing that needed lookouts 
 
 step two said twycross focus your determination to occupy the visualised space let your yearning to enter it flood from your mind to every particle of your body 
 
 harry glanced around surreptitiously a little way to his left ernie macmillan was contemplating his hoop so hard that his face had turned pink it looked as though he was straining to lay a egg harry bit back a laugh and hastily returned his gaze to his own hoop 
 
 step three called twycross and only when i give the command turn on the spot feeling your way into nothingness moving with deliberation on my command now one 
 
 harry glanced around again lots of people were looking positively alarmed at being asked to apparate so quickly 
 
 two 
 
 harry tried to fix his thoughts on his hoop again he had already forgotten what the three ds stood for 
 
 three 
 
 harry spun on the spot lost his balance and nearly fell over he was not the only one the whole hall was suddenly full of staggering people neville was flat on his back ernie macmillan on the other hand had done a kind of pirouetting leap into his hoop and looked momentarily thrilled until he caught sight of dean thomas roaring with laughter at him 
 
 never mind never mind said twycross dryly who did not seem to have expected anything better adjust your hoops please and back to your original positions 
 
 the second attempt was no better than the first the third was just as bad not until the fourth did anything exciting happen there was a horrible screech of pain and everybody looked around terrified to see susan bones of hufflepuff wobbling in her hoop with her left leg still standing five feet away where she had started 
 
 the heads of house converged on her there was a great bang and a puff of purple smoke which cleared to reveal susan sobbing reunited with her leg but looking horrified 
 
 splinching or the separation of random body parts said wilkie twycross dispassionately occurs when the mind is insufficiently determined you must concentrate continually upon your destination and move without haste but with deliberation thus 
 
 twycross stepped forwards turned gracefully on the spot with his arms outstretched and vanished in a swirl of robes reappearing at the back of the hall remember the three ds he said and try again onetwothree 
 
 but an hour later splinching was still the most interesting thing that had happened twycross did not seem discouraged fastening his cloak at his neck he merely said until next saturday everybody and do not forget destination determination deliberation 
 
 with that he waved his wand vanishing the hoops and walked out of the hall accompanied by professor mcgonagall talk broke out at once as people began moving towards the entrance hall 
 
 how did you do asked ron hurrying towards harry i think i felt something the last time i trieda kind of tingling in my feet 
 
 i expect your trainers are too small said a voice behind them and hermione stalked past smirking 
 
 i feel anything said harry ignoring this interruption but i care about that now 
 
 what mean you care you want to learn to apparate said ron incredulously 
 
 not fussed really i prefer flying said harry glancing over his shoulder to see where malfoy was and speeding up as they came into the entrance hall look hurry up will you something i want to do 
 
 perplexed ron followed harry back to gryffindor tower at a run they were temporarily detained by peeves who had jammed a door on the fourth floor shut and was refusing to let anyone pass until they set fire to their own pants but harry and ron simply turned back and took one of their trusted short cuts within five minutes they were climbing through the portrait hole 
 
 are you going to tell me what doing then asked ron panting slightly 
 
 up here said harry and he crossed the common room and led the way through the door to the boys staircase 
 
 their dormitory was as harry had hoped empty he flung open his trunk and began to rummage in it while ron watched impatiently 
 
 harry 
 
 using crabbe and goyle as lookouts he was arguing with crabbe just now i want to know aha 
 
 he had found it a folded square of apparently blank parchment which he now smoothed out and tapped with the tip of his wand 
 
 i solemnly swear that i am up to no good or malfoy is anyway 
 
 at once the map appeared on the surface here was a detailed plan of every one of the floors and moving around it the tiny labelled black dots that signified each of the occupants 
 
 help me find malfoy said harry urgently 
 
 he laid the map upon his bed and he and ron leaned over it searching 
 
 there said ron after a minute or so in the slytherin common room look with parkinson and zabini and crabbe and goyle 
 
 harry looked down at the map disappointed but rallied almost at once 
 
 well keeping an eye on him from now on he said firmly and the moment i see him lurking somewhere with crabbe and goyle keeping watch outside be on with the old invisibility cloak and off to find out what 
 
 he broke off as neville entered the dormitory bringing with him a strong smell of singed material and began rummaging in his trunk for a fresh pair of pants 
 
 despite his determination to catch malfoy out harry had no luck at all over the next couple of weeks although he consulted the map as often as he could sometimes making unnecessary visits to the bathroom between lessons to search it he did not once see malfoy anywhere suspicious admittedly he spotted crabbe and goyle moving around the castle on their own more often than usual sometimes remaining stationary in deserted corridors but at these times malfoy was not only nowhere near them but impossible to locate on the map at all this was most mysterious harry toyed with the possibility that malfoy was actually leaving the school grounds but could not see how he could be doing it given the very high leve of security now operating within the castle he could only suppose ihat he was missing malfoy amongst the hundreds of tiny black dots upon the map as for the fact that malfoy crabbe and goyle appeared to be going their different ways when they were usually inseparable these things happened as people got olderron and hermione harry reflected sadly were living proof 
 
 february moved towards march with no change in the weather except that it became windy as well as wet to general indignation a sign went up on all noticeboards that the next trip into hogsmeade had been cancelled ron was furious 
 
 it was on my birthday he said i was looking forward to that 
 
 not a big surprise though is it said harry not after what happened to katie 
 
 she had still not returned from st what was more further disappearances had been reported in the daily prophet including several relatives of students at hogwarts 
 
 but now all got to look forward to is stupid apparition said ron grumpily big birthday treat 
 
 three lessons on apparition was proving as difficult as ever though a few more people had managed to splinch themselves frustration was running high and there was a certain amount of towards wilkie twycross and his three ds which had inspired a number of nicknames for him the politest of which were and 
 
 happy birthday ron said harry when they were woken on the first of march by seamus and dean leaving noisily for breakfast have a present 
 
 he threw the package across on to bed where it joined a small pile of them that must harry assumed have been delivered by in the night 
 
 cheers said ron drowsily and as he ripped off the paper harry got out of bed opened his own trunk and began rummaging in it for the map which he hid after every use he turfed out half the contents of his trunk before he found it hiding beneath the socks in which he was still keeping his bottle of lucky potion felix felicis 
 
 right he murmured taking it back to bed with him tapping it quietly and murmuring i solemnly swear that i am up to no good so that neville who was passing the foot of his bed at the time would not hear 
 
 nice one harry said ron enthusiastically waving the new pair of quidditch gloves harry had given him 
 
 no problem said harry as he searched the slytherin dormitory closely for malfoy hey i think in his bed 
 
 ron did not answer he was too busy unwrapping presents every now and then letting out an exclamation of pleasure 
 
 seriously good haul this year he announced holding up a heavy gold watch with odd symbols around the edge and tiny moving stars instead of hands see what mum and dad got me blimey i think come of age next year too 
 
 cool muttered harry sparing the watch a glance before peering more closely at the map where was malfoy he did not seem to be at the slytherin table in the great hall eating breakfast he was nowhere near snape who was sitting in his study he in any of the bathrooms or in the hospital wing 
 
 want one said ron thickly holding out a box of chocolate cauldrons 
 
 no thanks said harry looking up gone again 
 
 have done said ron stuffing a second cauldron into his mouth as he slid out of bed to get dressed come on if you hurry up have to apparate on an might make it easier i suppose 
 
 ron looked thoughtfully at the box of chocolate cauldrons then shrugged and helped himself to a third 
 
 harry tapped the map with his wand muttered mischief managed though it been and got dressed thinking hard there had to be an explanation for periodic disappearances but he simply could not think what it could be the best way of finding out would be to tail him but even with the invisibility cloak this was an impractical idea he had lessons quidditch practice homework and apparition he could not follow malfoy around school all day wilhout his absence being remarked upon 
 
 ready he said to ron 
 
 he was halfway to the dormitory door when he realised that ron had not moved but was leaning on his bedpost staring out of the window with a strangely unfocused look on his face 
 
 ron breakfast 
 
 not hungry 
 
 harry stared at him 
 
 i thought you just said 
 
 well all right come down with you sighed ron but i want to eat 
 
 harry scrutinised him suspiciously 
 
 just eaten half a box of chocolate cauldrons you 
 
 not that ron sighed again you you understand 
 
 fair enough said harry albeit puzzled as he turned to open the door 
 
 harry said ron suddenly 
 
 what 
 
 harry i stand it 
 
 you stand what asked harry now starling to feel definitely alarmed ron was rather pale and looked as though he was about to be sick 
 
 i stop thinking about her said ron hoarsely 
 
 harry gaped at him he had not expected this and was not sure he wanted to hear it friends they might be but if ron started calling lavender he would have to pui his foot down 
 
 why does that stop you having breakfast harry asked trying to inject a note of common sense into the proceedings 
 
 i think she knows i exist said ron with a desperate gesture 
 
 she definitely knows you exist said harry bewildered she keeps snogging you she 
 
 ron blinked 
 
 who are you talking about 
 
 who are you talking about said harry with an increasing sense that all reason had dropped out of the conversation 
 
 romilda vane said ron softly and his whole face seemed to illuminate as he said it as though hit by a ray of purest sunlight 
 
 they stared at each other for almost a whole minute before harry said this is a joke right joking 
 
 i think harry i think i love her said ron in a strangled voice 
 
 okay said harry walking up to ron to get a better look at the glazed eyes and the pallid complexion okay say that again with a straight face 
 
 i love her repeated ron breathlessly have you seen her hair all black and shiny and silky and her eyes her big dark eyes and her 
 
 this is really funny and everything said harry impatiently but over all right drop it 
 
 he turned to leave he had got two steps towards the door when a crashing blow hit him on the right ear staggering he looked round fist was drawn right back his face was contorted with rage he was about to strike again 
 
 harry reacted instinctively his wand was out of his pocket and the incantation sprang to mind without conscious thought levicorpus 
 
 ron yelled as his heel was wrenched upwards once more he dangled helplessly his robes hanging off him 
 
 what was that for harry bellowed 
 
 you insulted her harry you said it was a joke shouted ron who was slowly turning purple in the face as all the blood rushed to his head 
 
 this is insane said harry got into 
 
 and then he saw the box lying open on bed and the truth hit him with the force of a stampeding troll 
 
 where did you get those chocolate cauldrons 
 
 they were a birthday present shouted ron revolving slowly in midair as he struggled to get free i offered you one i 
 
 you just picked them up off the floor you 
 
 fallen off my bed all right let me go 
 
 they fall off your bed you prat you understand they were mine i chucked them out of my trunk when i was looking for the map the chocolate cauldrons romilda gave me before christmas and all spiked with love potion 
 
 but only one word of this seemed to have registered with ron 
 
 romilda he repeated did you say romilda harrydo you know her can you introduce me 
 
 harry stared at the dangling ron whose face now looked tremendously hopeful and fought a strong desire to laugh a part of himthe part closest to his throbbing right earwas quite keen on the idea of letting ron down and watching him run amok until the effects of the potion wore off but on the other hand they were supposed to be friends ron had not been himself when he had attacked and harry thought that he would deserve another punching if he permitted ron to declare undying love for romilda vane 
 
 yeah introduce you said harry thinking fast going to let you down now okay 
 
 he sent ron crashing back to the floor his ear did hurt quite a lot but ron simply bounded to his feet again grinning 
 
 be in office said harry confidently leading the way to the door 
 
 why will she be in there asked ron anxiously hurrying to keep up 
 
 oh she has extra potions lessons with him said harry inventing wildly 
 
 maybe i could ask if i can have them with her said ron eagerly 
 
 great idea said harry 
 
 lavender was waiting beside the portrait hole a complication harry had not foreseen 
 
 late she pouted got you a birthday 
 
 leave me alone said ron impatiently going to introduce me to romilda vane 
 
 and without another word to her he pushed his way out of the portrait hole harry tried to make an apologetic face to lavender but it might have turned out simply amused because she looked more offended than ever as the fat lady swung shut behind them 
 
 harry had been slightly worried that slughorn might be at breakfast but he answered his office door at the first knock wearing a green velvet and matching nightcap and looking rather 
 
 harry he mumbled this is very early for a call i generally sleep late on a saturday 
 
 professor really sorry to disturb you said harry as quietly as possible while ron stood on tiptoe attempting to see past slughorn into his room but my friend swallowed a love potion by mistake you make him an antidote could you take him to madam pomfrey but not supposed to have anything from weasleys wizard wheezes and you know awkward questions 
 
 have thought you could have whipped him up a remedy harry an expert potioneer like you asked slughorn 
 
 er said harry somewhat distracted by the fact that ron was now elbowing him in the ribs in an attempt to force his way into the room well never mixed an antidote for a love potion sir and by the time i get it right ron done something serious 
 
 helpfully ron chose this moment to moan i see her harryis he hiding her 
 
 was this potion within date asked slughorn now eyeing ron with professional interest they can strengthen you know the longer kept 
 
 that would explain a lot panted harry now positively wrestling with ron to keep him from knocking slughorn over his birthday professor he added imploringly 
 
 oh all right come in then come in said slughorn got the necessary here in my bag not a difficult antidote 
 
 ron burst through the door into overheated crowded study tripped over a tasselled footstool regained his balance by seizing harry around the neck and muttered she see that did she 
 
 not here yet said harry watching slughorn opening his potion kit and adding a few pinches of this and that to a small crystal bottle 
 
 good said ron fervently how do i look 
 
 very handsome said slughorn smoothly handing ron a glass of clear liquid now drink that up a tonic for the nerves keep you calm when she arrives you know 
 
 brilliant said ron eagerly and he gulped the antidote down noisily 
 
 harry and slughorn watched him for a moment ron beamed at them then very slowly his grin sagged and vanished to be replaced by an expression of utmost horror 
 
 back to normal then said harry grinning slughorn chuckled thanks a lot professor 
 
 mention it mention it said slughorn as ron collapsed into a nearby armchair looking devastated what he needs slughorn continued over to a table loaded with drinks got butterbeer got wine got one last bottle of this mead hmm meant to give that to dumbledore for christmas ah well he shrugged he miss what never had why we open it now and celebrate mr birthday nothing like a fine spirit to chase away the pangs of disappointed love 
 
 he chortled again and harry joined in this was the firsi time he had found himself almost alone with slughorn since his disastrous first attempt to extract the true memory from him perhaps if he could just keep slughorn in a good mood perhaps if they got through enough of the mead 
 
 there you are then said slughorn handing harry and ron a glass of mead each before raising his own well a very happy birthday ralph 
 
 ron whispered harry 
 
 but ron who did not appear to be listening to the toast had already thrown the mead into his mouth and swallowed it 
 
 there was one second hardly more than a heartbeat in which harry knew there was something terribly wrong and slughorn it seemed did not 
 
 and may you have many more 
 
 ron 
 
 ron had dropped his glass he from his chair and then crumpled his extremities jerking uncontrollably foam was dribbling from his mouth and his eyes were bulging from their sockets 
 
 professor harry bellowed do something 
 
 but slughorn seemed paralysed by shock ron twitched and choked his skin was turning blue 
 
 whatbut spluttered slughorn 
 
 harry leapt over a low table and sprinted towards open potion kit pulling out jars and pouches while the terrible sound of gargling breath filled the room then he found itthe shrivelled stone slughorn had taken from him in potions 
 
 he hurtled back to side wrenched open his jaw and thrust the bezoar into his mouth ron gave a great shudder a rattling gasp and his body became limp and still
