 chapter viii 
 
 the last of the infantry hurriedly crossed the bridge squeezing together as they approached it as if passing through a funnel at last the baggage wagons had all crossed the crush was less and the last battalion came onto the bridge only squadron of hussars remained on the farther side of the bridge facing the enemy who could be seen from the hill on the opposite bank but was not yet visible from the bridge for the horizon as seen from the valley through which the river flowed was formed by the rising ground only half a mile away at the foot of the hill lay wasteland over which a few groups of our cossack scouts were moving suddenly on the road at the top of the high ground artillery and troops in blue uniform were seen these were the french a group of cossack scouts retired down the hill at a trot all the officers and men of squadron though they tried to talk of other things and to look in other directions thought only of what was there on the hilltop and kept constantly looking at the patches appearing on the skyline which they knew to be the troops the weather had cleared again since noon and the sun was descending brightly upon the danube and the dark hills around it it was calm and at intervals the bugle calls and the shouts of the enemy could be heard from the hill there was no one now between the squadron and the enemy except a few scattered skirmishers an empty space of some seven hundred yards was all that separated them the enemy ceased firing and that stern threatening inaccessible and intangible line which separates two hostile armies was all the more clearly felt 
 one step beyond that boundary line which resembles the line dividing the living from the dead lies uncertainty suffering and death and what is there who is there there beyond that field that tree that roof lit up by the sun no one knows but one wants to know you fear and yet long to cross that line and know that sooner or later it must be crossed and you will have to find out what is there just as you will inevitably have to learn what lies the other side of death but you are strong healthy cheerful and excited and are surrounded by other such excitedly animated and healthy men so thinks or at any rate feels anyone who comes in sight of the enemy and that feeling gives a particular glamour and glad keenness of impression to everything that takes place at such moments 
 on the high ground where the enemy was the smoke of a cannon rose and a ball flew whistling over the heads of the hussar squadron the officers who had been standing together rode off to their places the hussars began carefully aligning their horses silence fell on the whole squadron all were looking at the enemy in front and at the squadron commander awaiting the word of command a second and a third cannon ball flew past evidently they were firing at the hussars but the balls with rapid rhythmic whistle flew over the heads of the horsemen and fell somewhere beyond them the hussars did not look round but at the sound of each shot as at the word of command the whole squadron with its rows of faces so alike yet so different holding its breath while the ball flew past rose in the stirrups and sank back again the soldiers without turning their heads glanced at one another curious to see their comrades impression every face from to that of the bugler showed one common expression of conflict irritation and excitement around chin and mouth the quartermaster frowned looking at the soldiers as if threatening to punish them cadet mironov ducked every time a ball flew past rostov on the left flank mounted on his rook a handsome horse despite its game leg had the happy air of a schoolboy called up before a large audience for an examination in which he feels sure he will distinguish himself he was glancing at everyone with a clear bright expression as if asking them to notice how calmly he sat under fire but despite himself on his face too that same indication of something new and stern showed round the mouth 
 that curtseying there cadet miwonov not wight look at me cried denisov who unable to keep still on one spot kept turning his horse in front of the squadron 
 the black hairy face of vaska denisov and his whole short sturdy figure with the sinewy hairy hand and stumpy fingers in which he held the hilt of his naked saber looked just as it usually did especially toward evening when he had emptied his second bottle he was only redder than usual with his shaggy head thrown back like birds when they drink pressing his spurs mercilessly into the sides of his good horse bedouin and sitting as though falling backwards in the saddle he galloped to the other flank of the squadron and shouted in a hoarse voice to the men to look to their pistols he rode up to kirsten the staff captain on his steady mare came at a walk to meet him his face with its long mustache was serious as always only his eyes were brighter than usual 
 well what about it said he to denisov it come to a fight see we shall retire 
 the devil only knows what about muttered denisov ah wostov he cried noticing the bright face got it at last 
 and he smiled approvingly evidently pleased with the cadet rostov felt perfectly happy just then the commander appeared on the bridge denisov galloped up to him 
 your excellency let us attack them dwive them off 
 attack indeed said the colonel in a bored voice puckering up his face as if driving off a troublesome fly and why are you stopping here you see the skirmishers are retreating lead the squadron back 
 the squadron crossed the bridge and drew out of range of fire without having lost a single man the second squadron that had been in the front line followed them across and the last cossacks quitted the farther side of the river 
 the two pavlograd squadrons having crossed the bridge retired up the hill one after the other their colonel karl bogdanich schubert came up to squadron and rode at a footpace not far from rostov without taking any notice of him although they were now meeting for the first time since their encounter concerning telyanin rostov feeling that he was at the front and in the power of a man toward whom he now admitted that he had been to blame did not lift his eyes from the athletic back his nape covered with light hair and his red neck it seemed to rostov that bogdanich was only pretending not to notice him and that his whole aim now was to test the courage so he drew himself up and looked around him merrily then it seemed to him that bogdanich rode so near in order to show him his courage next he thought that his enemy would send the squadron on a desperate attack just to punish him rostov then he imagined how after the attack bogdanich would come up to him as he lay wounded and would magnanimously extend the hand of reconciliation 
 the figure of zherkov familiar to the pavlograds as he had but recently left their regiment rode up to the colonel after his dismissal from headquarters zherkov had not remained in the regiment saying he was not such a fool as to slave at the front when he could get more rewards by doing nothing on the staff and had succeeded in attaching himself as an orderly officer to prince bagration he now came to his former chief with an order from the commander of the rear guard 
 colonel he said addressing enemy with an air of gloomy gravity and glancing round at his comrades there is an order to stop and fire the bridge 
 an order to who asked the colonel morosely 
 i myself know to who replied the cornet in a serious tone but the prince told me to go and tell the colonel that the hussars must return quickly and fire the bridge 
 zherkov was followed by an officer of the suite who rode up to the colonel of hussars with the same order after him the stout nesvitski came galloping up on a cossack horse that could scarcely carry his weight 
 this colonel he shouted as he approached i told you to fire the bridge and now someone has gone and blundered they are all beside themselves over there and one make anything out 
 the colonel deliberately stopped the regiment and turned to nesvitski 
 you spoke to me of inflammable material said he but you said nothing about firing it 
 but my dear sir said nesvitski as he drew up taking off his cap and smoothing his hair wet with perspiration with his plump hand i telling you to fire the bridge when inflammable material had been put in position 
 i am not your dear sir mr staff officer and you did not tell me to burn the bridge i know the service and it is my habit orders strictly to obey you said the bridge would be burned but who would it burn i could not know by the holy spirit 
 ah always the way said nesvitski with a wave of the hand how did you get here said he turning to zherkov 
 on the same business but you are damp let me wring you out 
 you were saying mr staff officer continued the colonel in an offended tone 
 colonel interrupted the officer of the suite you must be quick or the enemy will bring up his guns to use grapeshot 
 the colonel looked silently at the officer of the suite at the stout staff officer and at zherkov and he frowned 
 i will the bridge fire he said in a solemn tone as if to announce that in spite of all the unpleasantness he had to endure he would still do the right thing 
 striking his horse with his long muscular legs as if it were to blame for everything the colonel moved forward and ordered the second squadron that in which rostov was serving under denisov to return to the bridge 
 there just as i thought said rostov to himself he wishes to test me his heart contracted and the blood rushed to his face let him see whether i am a coward he thought 
 again on all the bright faces of the squadron the serious expression appeared that they had worn when under fire rostov watched his enemy the colonel closely to find in his face confirmation of his own conjecture but the colonel did not once glance at rostov and looked as he always did when at the front solemn and stern then came the word of command 
 look sharp look sharp several voices repeated around him 
 their sabers catching in the bridles and their spurs jingling the hussars hastily dismounted not knowing what they were to do the men were crossing themselves rostov no longer looked at the colonel he had no time he was afraid of falling behind the hussars so much afraid that his heart stood still his hand trembled as he gave his horse into an charge and he felt the blood rush to his heart with a thud denisov rode past him leaning back and shouting something rostov saw nothing but the hussars running all around him their spurs catching and their sabers clattering 
 stretchers shouted someone behind him 
 rostov did not think what this call for stretchers meant he ran on trying only to be ahead of the others but just at the bridge not looking at the ground he came on some sticky trodden mud stumbled and fell on his hands the others outstripped him 
 at boss zides captain he heard the voice of the colonel who having ridden ahead had pulled up his horse near the bridge with a triumphant cheerful face 
 rostov wiping his muddy hands on his breeches looked at his enemy and was about to run on thinking that the farther he went to the front the better but bogdanich without looking at or recognizing rostov shouted to him 
 that running on the middle of the bridge to the right come back cadet he cried angrily and turning to denisov who showing off his courage had ridden on to the planks of the bridge 
 why run risks captain you should dismount he said 
 oh every bullet has its billet answered vaska denisov turning in his saddle 
 meanwhile nesvitski zherkov and the officer of the suite were standing together out of range of the shots watching now the small group of men with yellow shakos jackets braided with cord and blue riding breeches who were swarming near the bridge and then at what was approaching in the distance from the opposite side the blue uniforms and groups with horses easily recognizable as artillery 
 will they burn the bridge or not get there first will they get there and fire the bridge or will the french get within grapeshot range and wipe them out these were the questions each man of the troops on the high ground above the bridge involuntarily asked himself with a sinking heart watching the bridge and the hussars in the bright evening light and the blue tunics advancing from the other side with their bayonets and guns 
 ugh the hussars will get it hot said nesvitski they are within grapeshot range now 
 he have taken so many men said the officer of the suite 
 true enough answered nesvitski two smart fellows could have done the job just as well 
 ah your excellency put in zherkov his eyes fixed on the hussars but still with that naive air that made it impossible to know whether he was speaking in jest or in earnest ah your excellency how you look at things send two men and who then would give us the vladimir medal and ribbon but now even if they do get peppered the squadron may be recommended for honors and he may get a ribbon our bogdanich knows how things are done 
 there now said the officer of the suite grapeshot 
 he pointed to the french guns the limbers of which were being detached and hurriedly removed 
 on the french side amid the groups with cannon a cloud of smoke appeared then a second and a third almost simultaneously and at the moment when the first report was heard a fourth was seen then two reports one after another and a third 
 oh oh groaned nesvitski as if in fierce pain seizing the officer of the suite by the arm look a man has fallen fallen fallen 
 two i think 
 if i were tsar i would never go to war said nesvitski turning away 
 the french guns were hastily reloaded the infantry in their blue uniforms advanced toward the bridge at a run smoke appeared again but at irregular intervals and grapeshot cracked and rattled onto the bridge but this time nesvitski could not see what was happening there as a dense cloud of smoke arose from it the hussars had succeeded in setting it on fire and the french batteries were now firing at them no longer to hinder them but because the guns were trained and there was someone to fire at 
 the french had time to fire three rounds of grapeshot before the hussars got back to their horses two were misdirected and the shot went too high but the last round fell in the midst of a group of hussars and knocked three of them over 
 rostov absorbed by his relations with bogdanich had paused on the bridge not knowing what to do there was no one to hew down as he had always imagined battles to himself nor could he help to fire the bridge because he had not brought any burning straw with him like the other soldiers he stood looking about him when suddenly he heard a rattle on the bridge as if nuts were being spilt and the hussar nearest to him fell against the rails with a groan rostov ran up to him with the others again someone shouted stretchers four men seized the hussar and began lifting him 
 oooh for sake let me alone cried the wounded man but still he was lifted and laid on the stretcher 
 nicholas rostov turned away and as if searching for something gazed into the distance at the waters of the danube at the sky and at the sun how beautiful the sky looked how blue how calm and how deep how bright and glorious was the setting sun with what soft glitter the waters of the distant danube shone and fairer still were the faraway blue mountains beyond the river the nunnery the mysterious gorges and the pine forests veiled in the mist of their summits there was peace and happiness i should wishing for nothing else nothing if only i were there thought rostov in myself alone and in that sunshine there is so much happiness but here groans suffering fear and this uncertainty and hurry there they are shouting again and again are all running back somewhere and i shall run with them and it death is here above me and around another instant and i shall never again see the sun this water that gorge 
 at that instant the sun began to hide behind the clouds and other stretchers came into view before rostov and the fear of death and of the stretchers and love of the sun and of life all merged into one feeling of sickening agitation 
 o lord god thou who art in that heaven save forgive and protect me rostov whispered 
 the hussars ran back to the men who held their horses their voices sounded louder and calmer the stretchers disappeared from sight 
 well fwiend so smelt powdah shouted vaska denisov just above his ear 
 all over but i am a coward yes a coward thought rostov and sighing deeply he took rook his horse which stood resting one foot from the orderly and began to mount 
 was that grapeshot he asked denisov 
 yes and no mistake cried denisov you worked like wegular bwicks and nasty work an pleasant work hacking away at the dogs but this sort of thing is the very devil with them shooting at you like a target 
 and denisov rode up to a group that had stopped near rostov composed of the colonel nesvitski zherkov and the officer from the suite 
 well it seems that no one has noticed thought rostov and this was true no one had taken any notice for everyone knew the sensation which the cadet under fire for the first time had experienced 
 something for you to report said zherkov see if i get promoted to a sublieutenancy 
 inform the prince that i the bridge fired said the colonel triumphantly and gaily 
 and if he asks about the losses 
 a trifle said the colonel in his bass voice two hussars wounded and one knocked out he added unable to restrain a happy smile and pronouncing the phrase knocked out with ringing distinctness

 chapter 
 
 when jo came home that spring she had been struck with the change in beth no one spoke of it or seemed aware of it for it had come too gradually to startle those who saw her daily but to eyes sharpened by absence it was very plain and a heavy weight fell on heart as she saw her face it was no paler and but littler thinner than in the autumn yet there was a strange transparent look about it as if the mortal was being slowly refined away and the immortal shining through the frail flesh with an indescribably pathetic beauty jo saw and felt it but said nothing at the time and soon the first impression lost much of its power for beth seemed happy no one appeared to doubt that she was better and presently in other cares jo fora time forgot her fear 
 but when laurie was gone and peace prevailed again the vague anxiety returned and haunted her she had confessed her sins and been forgiven but when she showed her savings and proposed a mountain trip beth had thanked her heartily but begged not to go so far away from home another little visit to the seashore would suit her better and as grandma could not be prevailed upon to leave the babies jo took beth down to the quiet place where she could live much in the open air and let the fresh sea breezes blow a little color into her pale cheeks 
 it was not a fashionable place but even among the pleasant people there the girls made few friends preferring to live for one another beth was too shy to enjoy society and jo too wrapped up in her to care for anyone else so they were all in all to each other and came and went quite unconscious of the interest they exited in those about them who watched with sympathetic eyes the strong sister and the feeble one always together as if they felt instinctively that a long separation was not far away 
 they did feel it yet neither spoke of it for often between ourselves and those nearest and dearest to us there exists a reserve which it is very hard to overcome jo felt as if a veil had fallen between her heart and but when she put out her hand to lift it up there seemed something sacred in the silence and she waited for beth to speak she wondered and was thankful also that her parents did not seem to see what she saw and during the quiet weeks when the shadows grew so plain to her she said nothing of it to those at home believing that it would tell itself when beth came back no better she wondered still more if her sister really guessed the hard truth and what thoughts were passing through her mind during the long hours when she lay on the warm rocks with her head in lap while the winds blew healthfully over her and the sea made music at her feet 
 one day beth told her jo thought she was asleep she lay so still and putting down her book sat looking at her with wistful eyes trying to see signs of hope in the faint color on cheeks but she could not find enough to satisfy her for the cheeks were very thin and the hands seemed too feeble to hold even the rosy little shells they had been collecting it came to her then more bitterly than ever that beth was slowly drifting away form her and her arms instinctively tightened their hold upon the dearest treasure she possessed for a minute her eyes were too dim for seeing and when they cleared beth was looking up at her so tenderly that there was hardly any need for her to say jo dear glad you know it tried to tell you but i 
 there was no answer except her cheek against her own not even tears for when most deeply moved jo did not cry she was the weaker then land beth tried to comfort and sustain her with her arms about her and the soothing words she whispered in her ear 
 known it for a good while dear and now used to it it hard to think of or to bear try to see it so and be troubled about me because best indeed it is 
 is this what made you so unhappy in the autumn beth you did not feel it then land keep it to yourself so long did you asked jo refusing to see or say that it was best but glad to know that laurie had no part in trouble 
 yes i gave up hoping then but i like to own it i tried to think it was a sick fancy and would not let it trouble anyone but when i saw you all so well and strong and full of happy plans it was hard to feel that i could never be like you and then i was miserable jo 
 oh beth and you tell me let me comfort and help you how could you shut me out bear it all alone 
 voice was full of tender reproach and her heart ached to think of the solitary struggle that must have gone on while beth learned to say goodbye to health love and live and take up her cross so cheerfully 
 perhaps it was wrong but i tried to do right i sure no one said anything and i hoped i was mistaken it would have 
 been selfish to frighten you all when marmee was so anxious about meg and amy away and you so happy with least i thought so then 
 and i thought you loved him beth and i went away because i cried jo glad to say all the truth 
 beth looked so amazed at the idea that jo smiled in spite of her pain and added softly then you dearie i was afraid it was so and imagined your poor little heart full of lovelornity all that while 
 why jo how could i when he was so fond of you asked beth as innocently as a child i do love him dearly he is so good to me how can i help it but he could never be anything to me but my brother i hope he truly will be sometime 
 not through me said jo decidedly amy is left for him and they would suit excellently but i have no heart for such things now i care what becomes of anybody but you beth you must get well 
 i want to oh so much i try but every day i lose a little and feel more sure that i shall never gain it back like the tide jo when it turns it goes slowly but it be stopped 
 it shall be stopped your tide must not turn so soon nineteen is too young beth i let you go work and pray and fight against it keep you in spite of everything there must be ways it be too late god be so cruel as to take you from me cried poor jo rebelliously for her spirit was far less piously submissive than 
 simple sincere people seldom speak much of their piety it shows itself in acts rather than in words and has more influence than homilies or protestations beth could not reason upon or explain the faith that gave her courage and patience to give up life and cheerfully wait for death like a confiding child she asked no questions but left everything to god and nature father and mother of us all feeling sure that they and they only could teach and strengthen heart and spirit for this life and the life to come she did not rebuke jo with saintly speeches only loved her better for her passionate affection and clung more closely to the dear human love from which our father never means us to be weaned but through which he draws us closer to himself she could not say glad to go for life was very sweet for her she could only sob out i try to be she held fast to jo as the first bitter wave of this great sorrow broke over them together 
 by and by beth said with recovered serenity tell them this when we go home 
 i think they will see it without words sighed jo for now it seemed to her that beth changed every day 
 perhaps not heard that the people who love best are often blindest to such things if they see it you will tell them for me i want any secrets and kinder to prepare them meg has john and the babies to comfort her but you must stand by father and mother you jo 
 if i can but beth i give up yet going to believe that it is a sick fancy and not let you think true said jo trying to speak cheerfully 
 beth lay a minute thinking and then said in her quiet way i know how to express myself and try to anyone but you because i speak out except to my jo i only mean to say that i have a feeling that it never was intended i should live long not like the rest of you i never made any plans about what do when i grew up i never thought of being married as you all did i seem to imagine myself anything but stupid little beth trotting about at home of no use anywhere but there i never wanted to go away and the hard part now is the leaving you all not afraid but it seems as if i should be homesick for you even in heaven 
 jo could not speak and for several minutes there was no sound but the sigh of the wind and the lapping of the tide a gull flew by with the flash of sunshine on its silvery breast beth watched it till it vanished and her eyes were full of sadness a little sand bird came tripping over the beach peeping softly to itself as if enjoying the sun and sea it came quite close to beth and looked at her with a friendly eye and sat upon a warm stone dressing its wet feathers quite at home beth smiled and felt comforted for the tiny thing seemed to offer its small friendship and remind her that a pleasant world was still to be enjoyed 
 dear little bird see jo how tame it is i like peeps better than the gulls they are not so wild and handsome but they seem happy confiding little things i used to call them my birds last summer and mother said they reminded her of me busy creatures always near the shore and always chirping that contented little song of theirs you are the gull jo strong and wild fond of the storm and the wind flying far out to sea and happy all alone meg is the turtledove and amy is like the lark she write about trying to get up among the clouds but always dropping down into its nest again dear little girl so ambitious but her heart is good and tender and no matter how high she flies she never will forget home i hope i shall see her again but she seems so far away 
 she is coming in the spring and i mean that you shall be all ready to see and enjoy her going to have you well and rosy by that time began jo feeling that of all the changes in beth the talking change was the greatest for it seemed to cost no effort now and she thought aloud in a way quite unlike bashful beth 
 jo dear hope any more it do any good sure of that we be miserable but enjoy being together while we wait have happy times for i suffer much and i think the tide will go out easily if you help me 
 jo leaned down to kiss the tranquil face and with that silent kiss she dedicated herself soul and body to beth 
 she was right there was no need of any words when they got home for father and mother saw plainly now what they had prayed to be saved from seeing tired with her short journey beth went at once to bed saying how glad she was to be home and when jo went down she found that she would be spared the hard task of telling secret her father stood leaning his head on the mantelpiece and did not turn as she came in but her mother stretched out her arms as if for help and jo went to comfort her without a word

lionfish nov chapter the parting of the wayscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 dumbledore stood up he stared down at barty crouch for a moment with disgust on his face then he raised his wand once more and ropes flew out of it ropes that twisted themselves around barty crouch binding him tightly he turned to professor mcgonagall 
 
 minerva could i ask you to stand guard here while i take harry upstairs 
 
 of course said professor mcgonagall she looked slightly nauseous as though she had just watched someone being sick however when she drew out her wand and pointed it at barty crouch her hand was quite steady 
 
 severus dumbledore turned to snape please tell madam pomfrey to come down here we need to get alastor moody into the hospital wing then go down into the grounds find cornelius fudge and bring him up to this office he will undoubtedly want to question crouch himself tell him i will be in the hospital wing in half an time if he needs me 
 
 snape nodded silently and swept out of the room 
 
 harry dumbledore said gently 
 
 harry got up and swayed again the pain in his leg which he had not noticed all the time he had been listening to crouch now returned in full measure he also realized that he was shaking dumbledore gripped his arm and helped him out into the dark corridor 
 
 i want you to come up to my office first harry he said quiedy as they headed up the passageway sirius is waiting for us there 
 
 harry nodded a kind of numbness and a sense of complete unreality were upon him but he did not care he was even glad of it he want to have to think about anything that had happened since he had first touched the triwizard cup he want to have to examine the memories fresh and sharp as photographs which kept flashing across his mind moody inside the trunk wormtail slumped on the ground cradling his stump of an arm voldemort rising from the steaming cauldron cedricdeadcedric asking to be returned to his parents 
 
 professor harry mumbled where are mr and mrs diggory 
 
 they are with professor sprout said dumbledore his voice which had been so calm throughout the interrogation of barty crouch shook very slightly for the first time she was head of house and knew him best 
 
 they had reached the stone gargoyle dumbledore gave the password it sprang aside and he and harry went up the moving spiral staircase to the oak door dumbledore pushed it open sirius was standing there his face was white and gaunt as it had been when he had escaped azkaban in one swift moment he had crossed the room 
 
 harry are you all right i knew it i knew something like this what happened 
 
 his hands shook as he helped harry into a chair in front of the desk 
 
 what happened he asked more urgently 
 
 dumbledore began to tell sirius everything barty crouch had said harry was only half listening so tired every bone in his body was aching he wanted nothing more than to sit here undisturbed for hours and hours until he fell asleep and have to think or feel anymore 
 
 there was a soft rush of wings fawkes the phoenix had left his perch flown across the office and landed on knee 
 
 lo fawkes said harry quietly he stroked the beautiful plumage fawkes blinked peacefully up at him there was something comforting about his warm weight 
 
 dumbledore stopped talking he sat down opposite harry behind his desk he was looking at harry who avoided his eyes dumbledore was going to question him he was going to make harry relive everything 
 
 i need to know what happened after you touched the portkey in the maze harry said dumbledore 
 
 we can leave that till morning we dumbledore said sirius harshly he had put a hand on shoulder let him have a sleep let him rest 
 
 harry felt a rush of gratitude toward sirius but dumbledore took no notice of words he leaned forward toward harry very unwillingly harry raised his head and looked into those blue eyes 
 
 if i thought i could help you dumbledore said gently by putting you into an enchanted sleep and allowing you to postpone the moment when you would have to think about what has happened tonight i would do it but i know better numbing the pain for a while will make it worse when you finally feel it you have shown bravery beyond anything i could have expected of you i ask you to demonstrate your courage one more time i ask you to tell us what happened 
 
 the phoenix let out one soft quavering note it shivered in the air and harry felt as though a drop of hot liquid had slipped down his throat into his stomach warming him and strengthening him 
 
 he took a deep breath and began to tell them as he spoke visions of everything that had passed that night seemed to rise before his eyes he saw the sparkling surface of the potion that had revived voldemort he saw the death eaters apparating between the graves around them he saw body lying on the ground beside the cup 
 
 once or twice sirius made a noise as though about to say something his hand still tight on shoulder but dumbledore raised his hand to stop him and harry was glad of this because it was easier to keep going now he had started it was even a relief he felt almost as though something poisonous were being extracted from him it was costing him every bit of determination he had to keep talking yet he sensed that once he had finished he would feel better 
 
 when harry told of wormtail piercing his arm with the dagger however sirius let out a vehement exclamation and dumbledore stood up so quickly that harry started dumbledore walked around the desk and told harry to stretch out his arm harry showed them both the place where his robes were torn and the cut beneath them 
 
 he said my blood would make him stronger than if used someone harry told dumbledore he said the protection my my mother left in me have it too and he was right he could touch me without hurting himself he touched my face 
 
 for a fleeting instant harry thought he saw a gleam of something like triumph in eyes but next second harry was sure he had imagined it for when dumbledore had returned to his seat behind the desk he looked as old and weary as harry had ever seen him 
 
 very well he said sitting down again voldemort has overcome that particular barrier harry continue please 
 
 harry went on he explained how voldemort had emerged from the cauldron and told them all he could remember of speech to the death eaters then he told how voldemort had untied him returned his wand to him and prepared to duel 
 
 but when he reached the part where the golden beam of light had connected his and wands he found his throat obstructed he tried to keep talking but the memories of what had come out of wand were flooding into his mind he could see cedric emerging see the old man bertha jorkinshis fatherhis mother 
 
 he was glad when sirius broke the silence 
 
 the wands connected he said looking from harry to dumbledore why 
 
 harry looked up at dumbledore again on whose face there was an arrested look 
 
 priori incantatem he muttered 
 
 his eyes gazed into and it was almost as though an invisible beam of understanding shot between them 
 
 the reverse spell effect said sirius sharply 
 
 exactly said dumbledore wand and wand share cores each of them contains a feather from the tail of the same phoenix this phoenix in fact he added and he pointed at the bird perching peacefully on knee 
 
 my feather came from fawkes harry said amazed 
 
 yes said dumbledore mr ollivander wrote to tell me you had bought the second wand the moment you left his shop four years ago 
 
 so what happens when a wand meets its brother said sirius 
 
 they will not work properly against each other said dumbledore if however the owners of the wands force the wands to do battlea very rare effect will take place one of the wands will force the other to regurgitate spells it has performed in reverse the most recent firstand then those which preceded it 
 
 he looked interrogatively at harry and harry nodded 
 
 which means said dumbledore slowly his eyes upon face that some form of cedric must have reappeared 
 
 harry nodded again 
 
 diggory came back to life said sirius sharply 
 
 no spell can reawaken the dead said dumbledore heavily all that would have happened is a kind of reverse echo a shadow of the living cedric would have emerged from the wandam i correct harry 
 
 he spoke to me harry said he was suddenly shaking again thethe ghost cedric or whatever he was spoke 
 
 an echo said dumbledore which retained appearance and character i am guessing other such forms appearedless recent victims of wand 
 
 an old man harry said his throat still constricted bertha jorkins and 
 
 your parents said dumbledore quietly 
 
 yes said harry 
 
 grip on shoulder was now so tight it was painful 
 
 the last murders the wand performed said dumbledore nodding in reverse order more would have appeared of course had you maintained the connection very well harry these echoes these shadowswhat did they do 
 
 harry described how the figures that had emerged from the wand had prowled the edges of the golden web how voldemort had seemed to fear them how the shadow of mother had told him what to do how had made its final request 
 
 at this point harry found he could not continue he looked around at sirius and saw that he had his face in his hands 
 
 harry suddenly became aware that fawkes had left his knee the phoenix had fluttered to the floor it was resting its beautiful head against injured leg and thick pearly tears were falling from its eyes onto the wound left by the spider the pain vanished the skin mended his leg was repaired 
 
 i will say it again said dumbledore as the phoenix rose into the air and resettled itself upon the perch beside the door you have shown bravery beyond anything i could have expected of you tonight harry you have shown bravery equal to those who died fighting voldemort at the height of his powers you have shouldered a grown burden and found yourself equal to it and you have now given us all we have a right to expect you will come with me to the hospital wing i do not want you returning to the dormitory tonight a sleeping potion and some peacesirius would you like to stay with him 
 
 sirius nodded and stood up he transformed back into the great black dog and walked with harry and dumbledore out of the office accompanying them down a flight of stairs to the hospital wing 
 
 when dumbledore pushed open the door harry saw mrs weasley bill ron and hermione grouped around a madam pomfrey they appeared to be demanding to know where harry was and what had happened to him all of them whipped around as harry dumbledore and the black dog entered and mrs weasley let out a kind of muffled scream 
 
 harry oh harry 
 
 she started to hurry toward him but dumbledore moved between them 
 
 molly he said holding up a hand please listen to me for a moment harry has been through a terrible ordeal tonight he has just had to relive it for me what he needs now is sleep and peace and quiet if he would like you all to stay with him he added looking around at ron hermione and bill too you may do so but i do not want you questioning him until he is ready to answer and certainly not this evening 
 
 mrs weasley nodded she was very white she rounded on ron hermione and bill as though they were being noisy and hissed did you hear he needs quiet 
 
 headmaster said madam pomfrey staring at the great black dog that was sirius may i ask what 
 
 this dog will be remaining with harry for a while said dumbledore simply i assure you he is extremely well trained harry i will wait while you get into bed 
 
 harry felt an inexpressible sense of gratitude to dumbledore for asking the others not to question him it as though he want them there but the thought of explaining it all over again the idea of reliving it one more time was more than he could stand 
 
 i will be back to see you as soon as i have met with fudge harry said dumbledore i would like you to remain here tomorrow until i have spoken to the school he left 
 
 as madam pomfrey led harry to a nearby bed he caught sight of the real moody lying motionless in a bed at the far end of the room his wooden leg and magical eye were lying on the bedside table 
 
 is he okay harry asked 
 
 be fine said madam pomfrey giving harry some pajamas and pulling screens around him he took off his robes pulled on the pajamas and got into bed ron hermione bill mrs weasley and the black dog came around the screen and settled themselves in chairs on either side of him ron and hermione were looking at him almost cautiously as though scared of him 
 
 all right he told them just tired 
 
 mrs eyes filled with tears as she smoothed his unnecessarily 
 
 madam pomfrey who had bustled off to her office returned holding a small bottle of some purple potion and a goblet 
 
 need to drink all of this harry she said a potion for dreamless sleep 
 
 harry took the goblet and drank a few mouthfuls he felt himself becoming drowsy at once everything around him became hazy the lamps around the hospital wing seemed to be winking at him in a friendly way through the screen around his bed his body felt as though it was sinking deeper into the warmth of the feather matress before he could finish the potion before he could say another word his exhaustion had carried him off to sleep 
 
 
 
 harry woke up so warm so very sleepy that he open his eyes wanting to drop off again the room was still dimly lit he was sure it was still nighttime and had a feeling that he have been asleep very long 
 
 then he heard whispering around him 
 
 wake him if they shut up 
 
 what are they shouting about nothing else can have happened can it 
 
 harry opened his eyes blearily someone had removed his glasses he could see the fuzzy outlines of mrs weasley and bill close by mrs weasley was on her feet 
 
 voice she whispered and minerva it but what are they arguing about 
 
 now harry could hear them too people shouting and running toward the hospital wing 
 
 regrettable but all the same minerva cornelius fudge was saying loudly 
 
 you should never have brought it inside the castle yelled professor mcgonagall when dumbledore finds out 
 
 harry heard the hospital doors burst open unnoticed by any of the people around his bed all of whom were staring at the door as bill pulled back the screens harry sat up and put his glasses back on 
 
 fudge came striding up the ward professors mcgonagall and snape were at his heels 
 
 dumbledore fudge demanded of mrs weasley 
 
 not here said mrs weasley angrily this is a hospital wing minister you think do better to 
 
 but the door opened and dumbledore came sweeping up the ward 
 
 what has happened said dumbledore sharply looking from fudge to professor mcgonagall why are you disturbing these people minerva surprised at you i asked you to stand guard over barty crouch 
 
 there is no need to stand guard over him anymore dumbledore she shrieked the minister has seen to that 
 
 harry had never seen professor mcgonagall lose control like this there were angry blotches of color in her cheeks and a hands were balled into fists she was trembling with fury 
 
 when we told mr fudge that we had caught the death eater responsible for events said snape in a low voice he seemed to feel his personal safety was in question he insisted on summoning a dementor to accompany him into the castle he brought it up to the office where barty crouch 
 
 i told him you would not agree dumbledore mcgonagall fumed i told him you would never allow dementors to set foot inside the castle but 
 
 my dear woman roared fudge who likewise looked angrier than harry had ever seen him as minister of magic it is my decision whether i wish to bring protection with me when interviewing a possibly dangerous 
 
 but professor voice drowned 
 
 the moment that that thing entered the room she screamed pointing at fudge trembling all over it swooped down on crouch and and 
 
 harry felt a chill in his stomach as professor mcgonagall struggled to find words to describe what had happened he did not need her to finish her sentence he knew what the dementor must have done it had administered its fatal kiss to barty crouch it had sucked his soul out through his mouth he was worse than dead 
 
 by all accounts he is no loss blustered fudge it seems he has been responsible for several deaths 
 
 but he cannot now give testimony cornelius said dumbledore he was staring hard at fudge as though seeing him plainly for the first time he cannot give evidence about why he killed those people 
 
 why he killed them well no mystery is it blustered fudge he was a raving lunatic from what minerva and severus have told me he seems to have thought he was doing it all on instructions 
 
 lord voldemort was giving him instructions cornelius dumbledore said those peoples deaths were mere of a plan to restore voldemort to full strength again the plan succeeded voldemort has been restored to his body 
 
 fudge looked as though someone had just swung a heavy weight into his face dazed and blinking he stared back at dumbledore as if he quite believe what he had just heard he began to sputter still goggling at dumbledore 
 
 preposterous come now dumbledore 
 
 as minerva and severus have doubtless told you said dumbledore we heard barty crouch confess under the influence of veritaserum he told us how he was smuggled out of azkaban and how voldemort learning of his continued existence from bertha jorkins went to free him from his father and used him to capture harry the plan worked i tell you crouch has helped voldemort to return 
 
 see here dumbledore said fudge and harry was astonished to see a slight smile dawning on his face you you seriously believe that back come now come nowcertainly crouch may have believed himself to be acting upon orders but to take the word of a lunatic like that dumbledore 
 
 when harry touched the triwizard cup tonight he was transported straight to voldemort said dumbledore steadily he witnessed lord rebirth i will explain it all to you if you will step up to my office 
 
 dumbledore glanced around at harry and saw that he was awake but shook his head and said i am afraid i cannot permit you to question harry tonight 
 
 curious smile lingered he too glanced at harry then looked back at dumbledore and said you are er prepared to take word on this are you dumbledore 
 
 there was a silence which was broken by sirius growling his hackles were raised and he was baring his teeth at fudge 
 
 certainly i believe harry said dumbledore his eyes were blazing now i heard confession and i heard account of what happened after he touched the triwizard cup the two stories make sense they explain everything that has happened since bertha jorkins disappeared last summer 
 
 fudge still had that strange smile on his face once again he glanced at harry before answering 
 
 you are prepared to believe that lord voldemort has returned on the word of a lunatic murderer and a boy whowell 
 
 fudge shot harry another look and harry suddenly understood 
 
 been reading rita skeeter mr fudge he said quietly 
 
 ron hermione mrs weasley and bill all jumped none of them had realized that harry was awake 
 
 fudge reddened slightly but a defiant and obstinate look came over his face 
 
 and if i have he said looking at dumbledore if i have discovered that been keeping certain facts about the boy very quiet a parselmouth eh and having funny turns all over the place 
 
 i assume that you are referring to the pains harry has been experiencing in his scar said dumbledore coolly 
 
 you admit that he has been having these pains then said fudge quickly headaches nightmares possibly hallucinations 
 
 listen to me cornelius said dumbledore taking a step toward fudge and once again he seemed to radiate that indefinable sense of power that harry had felt after dumbledore had stunned young crouch harry is as sane as you or i that scar upon his forehead has not addled his brains i believe it hurts him when lord voldemort is close by or feeling particularly murderous 
 
 fudge had taken half a step back from dumbledore but he looked no less stubborn 
 
 forgive me dumbledore but never heard of a curse scar acting as an alarm bell before 
 
 look i saw voldemort come back harry shouted he tried to get out of bed again but mrs weasley forced him back i saw the death eaters i can give you their names lucius malfoy 
 
 snape made a sudden movement but as harry looked at him eyes flew back to fudge 
 
 malfoy was cleared said fudge visibly affronted a very old family donations to excellent causes 
 
 macnair harry continued 
 
 also cleared now working for the ministry 
 
 avery nott crabbe goyle 
 
 you are merely repeating the names of those who were acquitted of being death eaters thirteen years ago said fudge angrily you could have found those names in old reports of the trials for heavens sake dumbledore the boy was full of some crackpot story at the end of last year too his tales are getting taller and still swallowing them the boy can talk to snakes dumbledore and you still think trustworthy 
 
 you fool professor mcgonagall cried cedric diggory mr crouch these deaths were not the random work of a lunatic 
 
 i see no evidence to the contrary shouted fudge now matching her anger his face purpling it seems to me that you are all determined to start a panic that will destabilize everything we have worked for these last thirteen years 
 
 harry believe what he was hearing he had always thought of fudge as a kindly figure a little blustering a little pompous but essentially but now a short angry wizard stood before him refusing to accept the prospect of disruption in his comfortable and ordered world to believe that voldemort could have risen 
 
 voldemort has returned dumbledore repeated if you accept that fact straightaway fudge and take the necessary measures we may still be able to save the situation the first and most essential step is to remove azkaban from the control of the dementors 
 
 preposterous shouted fudge again remove the dementors be kicked out of office for suggesting it half of us only feel safe in our beds at night because we know the dementors are standing guard at azkaban 
 
 the rest of us sleep less soundly in our beds cornelius knowing that you have put lord most dangerous supporters in the care of creatures who will join him the instant he asks them said dumbledore they will not remain loyal to you fudge voldemort can offer them much more scope for their powers and their pleasures than you can with the dementors behind him and his old supporters returned to him you will be to stop him regaining the sort of power he had thirteen years ago 
 
 fudge was opening and closing his mouth as though no words could express his outrage 
 
 the second step you must take and at once dumbledore pressed on is to send envoys to the giants 
 
 envoys to the giants fudge shrieked finding his tongue again what madness is this 
 
 extend them the hand of friendship now before it is too late said dumbledore or voldemort will persuade them as he did before that he alone among wizards will give them their rights and their freedom 
 
 you you cannot be serious fudge gasped shaking his head and retreating further from dumbledore if the magical community got wind that i had approached the giants people hate them dumbledore end of my career 
 
 you are blinded said dumbledore his voice rising now the aura of power around him palpable his eyes blazing once more by the love of the office you hold cornelius you place too much importance and you always have done on the purity of blood you fail to recognize that it matters not what someone is born but what they grow to be your dementor has just destroyed the last remaining member of a family as old as any and see what that man chose to make of his life i tell you now take the steps i have suggested and you will be remembered in office or out as one of the bravest and greatest ministers of magic we have ever known fail to act and history will remember you as the man who stepped aside and allowed voldemort a second chance to destroy the world we have tried to rebuild 
 
 insane whispered fudge still backing away mad 
 
 and then there was silence madam pomfrey was standing frozen at the foot of bed her hands over her mouth was still standing over harry her hand on his shoulder to prevent him from rising bill ron and hermione were staring at fudge 
 
 if your determination to shut your eyes will carry you as far as this cornelius said dumbledore we have reached a parting of the ways you must act as you see fit and i i shall act as i see fit 
 
 voice carried no hint of a threat it sounded like a mere statement but fudge bristled as though dumbledore were advancing upon him with a wand 
 
 now see here dumbledore he said waving a threatening finger given you free rein always had a lot of respect for you i might not have agreed with some of your decisions but kept quiet there many have let you hire werewolves or keep hagrid or decide what to teach your students without reference to the ministry but if going to work against me 
 
 the only one against whom i intend to work said dumbledore is lord voldemort if you are against him then we remain cornelius on the same side 
 
 it seemed fudge could think of no answer to this he rocked backward and forward on his small feet for a moment and spun his bowler hat in his hands finally he said with a hint of a plea in his voice he be back dumbledore he just be 
 
 snape strode forward past dumbledore pulling up the left sleeve of his robes as he went he stuck out his forearm and showed it to fudge who recoiled 
 
 there said snape harshly there the dark mark it is not as clear as it was an hour or so ago when it burned black but you can still see it every death eater had the sign burned into him by the dark lord it was a means of distinguishing one another and his means of summoning us to him when he touched the mark of any death eater we were to disapparate and apparate instantly at his side this mark has been growing clearer all year too why do you think karkaroff fled tonight we both felt the mark burn we both knew he had returned karkaroff fears the dark vengeance he betrayed too many of his fellow death eaters to be sure of a welcome back into the fold 
 
 fudge stepped back from snape too he was shaking his head he did not seem to have taken in a word snape had said he stared apparently repelled by the ugly mark on arm then looked up at dumbledore and whispered i know what you and your staff are playing at dumbledore but i have heard enough i have no more to add i will be in touch with you tomorrow dumbledore to discuss the running of this school i must return to the ministry 
 
 he had almost reached the door when he paused he turned around strode back down the dormitory and stopped at bed 
 
 your winnings he said shortly taking a large bag of gold out of his pocket and dropping it onto bedside table one thousand galleons there should have been a presentation ceremony but under the circumstances 
 
 he crammed his bowler hat onto his head and walked out of the room slamming the door behind him the moment he had disappeared dumbledore turned to look at the group around bed 
 
 there is work to be done he said mollyam i right in thinking that i can count on you and arthur 
 
 of course you can said mrs weasley she was white to the lips but she looked resolute we know what fudge is fondness for muggles that has held him back at the ministry all these years fudge thinks he lacks proper wizarding pride 
 
 then i need to send a message to arthur said dumbledore all those that we can persuade of the truth must be notified immediately and he is well placed to contact those at the ministry who are not as shortsighted as cornelius 
 
 go to dad said bill standing up go now 
 
 excellent said dumbledore tell him what has happened tell him i will be in direct contact with him shortly he will need to be discreet however if fudge thinks i am interfering at the ministry 
 
 leave it to me said bill 
 
 he clapped a hand on shoulder kissed his mother on the cheek pulled on his cloak and strode quickly from the room 
 
 minerva said dumbledore turning to professor mcgonagall i want to see hagrid in my office as soon as possible also if she will consent to come madame maxime 
 
 professor mcgonagall nodded and left without a word 
 
 poppy dumbledore said to madam pomfrey would you be very kind and go down to professor office where i think you will find a called winky in considerable distress do what you can for her and take her back to the kitchens i think dobby will look after her for us 
 
 very very well said madam pomfrey looking startled and she too left 
 
 dumbledore made sure that the door was closed and that madam footsteps had died away before he spoke again 
 
 and now he said it is time for two of our number to recognize each other for what they are siriusif you could resume your usual form 
 
 the great black dog looked up at dumbledore then in an instant turned back into a man 
 
 mrs weasley screamed and leapt back from the bed 
 
 sirius black she shrieked pointing at him 
 
 mum shut up ron yelled okay 
 
 snape had not yelled or jumped backward but the look on his face was one of mingled fury and horror 
 
 him he snarled staring at sirius whose face showed equal dislike what is he doing here 
 
 he is here at my invitation said dumbledore looking between them as are you severus i trust you both it is time for you to lay aside your old differences and trust each other 
 
 harry thought dumbledore was asking for a near miracle sirius and snape were eyeing each other with the utmost loathing 
 
 i will settle in the short term said dumbledore with a bite of impatience in his voice for a lack of open hostility you will shake hands you are on the same side now time is short and unless the few of us who know the truth do not stand united there is no hope for any us 
 
 very slowly but still glaring at each other as though each wished the other nothing but ill sirius and snape moved toward each other and shook hands they let go extremely quickly 
 
 that will do to be going on with said dumbledore stepping between them once more now i have work for each of you attitude though not unexpected changes everything sirius i need you to set off at once you are to alert remus lupin arabella figg mundungus fletcher the old crowd lie low at for a while i will contact you there 
 
 but said harry 
 
 he wanted sirius to stay he did not want to have to say goodbye again so quickly 
 
 see me very soon harry said sirius turning to him i promise you but i must do what i can you understand you 
 
 yeah said harry yeahof course i do 
 
 sirius grasped his hand briefly nodded to dumbledore transformed again into the black dog and ran the length of the room to the door whose handle he turned with a paw then he was gone 
 
 severus said dumbledore turning to snape you know what i must ask you to do if you are readyif you are prepared 
 
 i am said snape 
 
 he looked slightly paler than usual and his cold black eyes glittered strangely 
 
 then good luck said dumbledore and he watched with a trace of apprehension on his face as snape swept wordlessly after sirius 
 
 it was several minutes before dumbledore spoke again 
 
 i must go downstairs he said finally i must see the harry take the rest of your potion i will see all of you later 
 
 harry slumped back against his pillows as dumbledore disappeared hermione ron and mrs weasley were all looking at him none of them spoke for a very long time 
 
 got to take the rest of your potion harry mrs weasley said at last her hand nudged the sack of gold on his bedside cabinet as she reached for the bottle and the goblet you have a good long sleep try and think about something else for a whilethink about what going to buy with your winnings 
 
 i want that gold said harry in an expressionless voice you have it anyone can have it i have won it it been 
 
 the thing against which he had been fighting on and off ever since he had come out of the maze was threatening to overpower him he could feel a burning prickling feeling in the inner corners of his eyes he blinked and stared up at the ceiling 
 
 it your fault harry mrs weasley whispered 
 
 i told him to take the cup with me said harry 
 
 now the burning feeling was in his throat too he wished ron would look away 
 
 mrs weasley set the potion down on the bedside cabinet bent down and put her arms around harry he had no memory of ever being hugged like this as though by a mother the full weight of everything he had seen that night seemed to fall in upon him as mrs weasley held him to her his face his voice the sight of cedric dead on the ground all started spinning in his head until he could hardly bear it until he was screwing up his face against the howl of misery fighting to get out of him 
 
 there was a loud slamming noise and mrs weasley and harry broke apart hermione was standing by the window she was holding something tight in her hand 
 
 sorry she whispered 
 
 your potion harry said mrs weasley quickly wiping her eyes on the back of her hand 
 
 harry drank it in one gulp the effect was instantaneous heavy irresistible waves of dreamless sleep broke over him he fell back onto his pillows and thought no more 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire 
 

lionfish nov chapter the only one he ever fearedcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 he gone harry yelled 
 
 he did not believe it he would not believe it still he fought lupin with every bit of strength he had lupin did not understand people hid behind that curtain harry had heard them whispering the first time he had entered the room sirius was hiding simply lurking out of sight 
 
 sirius he bellowed sirius 
 
 he come back harry said lupin his voice breaking as he struggled to contain harry he come back because d 
 
 heisnot dead roared harry sirius 
 
 there was movement going on around them pointless bustling the flashes of more spells to harry it was meaningless noise the deflected curses flying past them did not matter nothing mattered except that lupin should stop pretending that siriuswho was standing feet from them behind that old curtainwas not going to emerge at any moment shaking back his dark hair and eager to the battle 
 
 lupin dragged harry away from the dais harry still staring at the archway was angry at sirius now for keeping him waiting 
 
 but some part of him realised even as he fought to break free from lupin that sirius had never kept him waiting before sirius had risked everything always to see harry to help him if sirius was not reappearing out of that archway when harry was yelling for him as though his life depended on it the only possible explanation was that he could not come back that he really was 
 
 dumbledore had most of the remaining death eaters grouped in the middle of the room seemingly immobilised by invisible ropes moody had crawled across the room to where tonks lay and was attempting to revive her behind the dais there were still flashes of light grunts and crieskingsley had run forward to continue duel with bellatrix 
 
 harry 
 
 neville had slid down the stone benches one by one to the place where harry stood harry was no longer struggling against lupin who maintained a precautionary grip on his arm nevertheless 
 
 harry really sorry said neville his legs were still dancing uncontrollably was dad manwas sirius black aa friend of yours 
 
 harry nodded 
 
 here said lupin quietly and pointing his wand at legs he said finite the spell was lifted legs fell back to the floor and remained still face was pale find the others where are they all neville 
 
 lupin turned away from the archway as he spoke it sounded as though every word was causing him pain 
 
 all back dere said neville a brain addacked ron bud i dink all righdand unconscious bud we could feel a bulse 
 
 there was a loud bang and a yell from behind the dais harry saw kingsley hit the ground yelling in pain bellatrix lestrange turned tail and ran as dumbledore whipped around he aimed a spell at her but she deflected it she was halfway up the steps now 
 
 harryno cried lupin but harry had already ripped his arm from slackened grip 
 
 she killed sirius bellowed harry she killed kill her 
 
 and he was off scrambling up the stone benches people were shouting behind him but he did not care the hem of robes whipped out of sight ahead and they were back in the room where the brains were swimming 
 
 she aimed a curse over her shoulder the tank rose into the air and tipped harry was deluged in the potion within the brains slipped and slid over him and began spinning their long coloured tentacles but he shouted wingardium leviosa and they flew off him up into the air slipping and sliding he ran on towards the door he leapt over luna who was groaning on the floor past ginny who said harrywhat past ron who giggled feebly and hermione who was still unconscious he wrenched open the door into the circular black hall and saw bellatrix disappearing through a door on the other side of the room beyond her was the corridor leading back to the lifts 
 
 he ran but she had slammed the door behind her and the walls were already rotating once more he was surrounded by streaks of blue light from the whirling candelabra 
 
 the exit he shouted desperately as the wall rumbled to a halt again the way out 
 
 the room seemed to have been waiting for him to ask the door right behind him flew open and the corridor towards the lifts stretched ahead of him and empty he ran 
 
 he could hear a lift clattering ahead he sprinted up the passageway swung around the corner and slammed his fist on to the button to call a second lift it jangled and banged lower and lower the grilles slid open and harry dashed inside now hammering the button marked atrium the doors slid shut and he was rising 
 
 he forced his way out of the lift before the grilles were fully open and looked around bellatrix was almost at the telephone lift at the other end of the hall but she looked back as he sprinted towards her and aimed another spell at him he dodged behind the fountain of magical brethren the spell zoomed past him and hit the gates at the other end of the atrium so that they rang like bells there were no more footsteps she had stopped running he crouched behind the statues listening 
 
 come out come out little harry she called in her mock baby voice which echoed off the polished wooden floors what did you come after me for then i thought you were here to avenge my dear cousin 
 
 i am shouted harry and a score of ghostly seemed to chorus i am i am i am all around the room 
 
 aaaaaah did you love him little baby potter 
 
 hatred rose in harry such as he had never known before he flung himself out from behind the fountain and bellowed crucio 
 
 bellatrix screamed the spell had knocked her off her feet but she did not writhe and shriek with pain as neville hadshe was already back on her feet breathless no longer laughing harry dodged behind the golden fountain again her hit the head of the handsome wizard which was blown off and landed twenty feet away gouging long scratches into the wooden floor 
 
 never used an unforgivable curse before have you boy she yelled she had abandoned her baby voice now you need to mean them potter you need to really want to cause painto enjoy itrighteous anger hurt me for show you how it is done shall i give you a lesson 
 
 harry was edging around the fountain on the other side when she screamed crucio and he was forced to duck down again as the arm holding its bow span off and landed with a crash on the floor a short distance from the golden head 
 
 potter you cannot win against me she cried 
 
 he could hear her moving to the right trying to get a clear shot of him he backed around the statue away from her crouching behind the legs his head level with the 
 
 i was and am the dark most loyal servant i learned the dark arts from him and i know spells of such power that you pathetic little boy can never hope to compete 
 
 stupefy yelled harry he had edged right around to where the goblin stood beaming up at the now headless wizard and taken aim at her back as she peered around the fountain she reacted so fast he barely had time to duck 
 
 protego 
 
 the jet of red light his own stunning spell bounced back at him harry scrambled back behind the fountain and one of the ears went flying across the room 
 
 potter going to give you one chance shouted bellatrix give me the prophecyroll it out towards me nowand i may spare your life 
 
 well going to have to kill me because gone harry roared and as he shouted it pain seared across his forehead his scar was on fire again and he felt a surge of fury that was quite unconnected with his own rage and he knows said harry with a mad laugh to match own your dear old mate voldemort knows gone not going to be happy with you is he 
 
 what what do you mean she cried and for the first time there was fear in her voice 
 
 the prophecy smashed when i was trying to get neville up the steps what do you think say about that then 
 
 his scar seared and burned the pain of it was making his eyes stream 
 
 liar she shrieked but he could hear the terror behind the anger now got it potter and you will give it to me accio prophecy accio prophecy 
 
 harry laughed again because he knew it would incense her the pain building in his head so badly he thought his skull might burst he waved his empty hand from behind the goblin and withdrew it quickly as she sent another jet of green light flying at him 
 
 nothing there he shouted nothing to summon it smashed and nobody heard what it said tell your boss that 
 
 no she screamed it true lying master i tried i trieddo not punish me 
 
 waste your breath yelled harry his eyes screwed up against the pain in his scar now more terrible than ever he hear you from here 
 
 i potter said a high cold voice 
 
 harry opened his eyes 
 
 tall thin and his terrible snakelike face white and gaunt his scarlet eyes staring lord voldemort had appeared in the middle of the hall his wand pointing at harry who stood frozen quite unable to move 
 
 so you smashed my prophecy said voldemort softly staring at harry with those pitiless red eyes no bella he is not lying i see the truth looking at me from within his worthless mind months of preparation months of effort and my death eaters have let harry potter thwart me again 
 
 master i am sorry i knew not i was fighting the animagus black sobbed bellatrix flinging herself down at feet as he paced slowly nearer master you should know 
 
 be quiet bella said voldemort dangerously i shall deal with you in a moment do you think i have entered the ministry of magic to hear your snivelling apologies 
 
 but masterhe is herehe is below 
 
 voldemort paid no attention 
 
 i have nothing more to say to you potter he said quietly you have irked me too often for too long avada kedavra 
 
 harry had not even opened his mouth to resist his mind was blank his wand pointing uselessly at the floor 
 
 but the headless golden statue of the wizard in the fountain had sprung alive leaping from its plinth to land with a crash on the floor between harry and voldemort the spell merely glanced off its chest as the statue flung out its arms to protect harry 
 
 what cried voldemort staring around and then he breathed dumbledore 
 
 harry looked behind him his heart pounding dumbledore was standing in front of the golden gates 
 
 voldemort raised his wand and another jet of green light streaked at dumbledore who turned and was gone in a whirling of his cloak next second he had reappeared behind voldemort and waved his wand towards the remnants of the fountain the other statues sprang to life the statue of the witch ran at bellatrix who screamed and sent spells streaming uselessly off its chest before it dived at her pinning her to the floor meanwhile the goblin and the scuttled towards the fireplaces set along the wall and the centaur galloped at voldemort who vanished and reappeared beside the pool the headless statue thrust harry backwards away from the fight as dumbledore advanced on voldemort and the golden centaur cantered around them both 
 
 it was foolish to come here tonight tom said dumbledore calmly the aurors are on their way 
 
 by which time i shall be gone and you will be dead spat voldemort he sent another killing curse at dumbledore but missed instead hitting the security desk which burst into flame 
 
 dumbledore flicked his own wand the force of the spell that emanated from it was such that harry though shielded by his golden guard felt his hair stand on end as it passed and this time voldemort was forced to conjure a shining silver shield out of thin air to deflect it the spell whatever it was caused no visible damage to the shield though a deep note reverberated from itan oddly chilling sound 
 
 you do not seek to kill me dumbledore called voldemort his scarlet eyes narrowed over the top of the shield above such brutality are you 
 
 we both know that there are other ways of destroying a man tom dumbledore said calmly continuing to walk towards voldemort as though he had not a fear in the world as though nothing had happened to interrupt his stroll up the hall merely taking your life would not satisfy me i admit 
 
 there is nothing worse than death dumbledore snarled voldemort 
 
 you are quite wrong said dumbledore still closing in upon voldemort and speaking as lightly as though they were discussing the matter over drinks harry felt scared to see him walking along undefended shieldless he wanted to cry out a warning but his headless guard kept shunting him backwards towards the wall blocking his every attempt to get out from behind it indeed your failure to understand that there are things much worse than death has always been your greatest weakness 
 
 another jet of green light flew from behind the silver shield this time it was the centaur galloping in front of dumbledore that took the blast and shattered into a hundred pieces but before the fragments had even hit the floor dumbledore had drawn back his wand and waved it as though brandishing a whip a long thin flame flew from the tip it wrapped itself around voldemort shield and all for a moment it seemed dumbledore had won but then the fiery rope became a serpent which relinquished its hold on voldemort at once and turned hissing furiously to face dumbledore 
 
 voldemort vanished the snake reared from the floor ready to strike 
 
 there was a burst of flame in midair above dumbledore just as voldemort reappeared standing on the plinth in the middle of the pool where so recently the five statues had stood 
 
 look out harry yelled 
 
 but even as he shouted another jet of green light flew at dumbledore from wand and the snake struck 
 
 fawkes swooped down in front of dumbledore opened his beak wide and swallowed the jet of green light whole he burst into flame and fell to the floor small wrinkled and flightless at the same moment dumbledore brandished his wand in one long fluid movementthe snake which had been an instant from sinking its fangs into him flew high into the air and vanished in a wisp of dark smoke and the water in the pool rose up and covered voldemort like a cocoon of molten glass 
 
 for a few seconds voldemort was visible only as a dark rippling faceless figure shimmering and indistinct upon the plinth clearly struggling to throw off the suffocating mass 
 
 then he was gone and the water fell with a crash back into its pool slopping wildly over the sides drenching the polished floor 
 
 master screamed bellatrix 
 
 sure it was over sure voldemort had decided to flee harry made to run out from behind his statue guard but dumbledore bellowed stay where you are harry 
 
 for the first time dumbledore sounded frightened harry could not see why the hall was quite empty but for themselves the sobbing bellatrix still trapped under the witch statue and the baby phoenix fawkes croaking feebly on the floor 
 
 then scar burst open and he knew he was dead it was pain beyond imagining pain past endurance 
 
 he was gone from the hall he was locked in the coils of a creature with red eyes so tightly bound that harry did not know where his body ended and the creatures began they were fused together bound by pain and there was no escape 
 
 and when the creature spoke it used mouth so that in his agony he felt his jaw move 
 
 kill me now dumbledore 
 
 blinded and dying every part of him screaming for release harry felt the creature use him again 
 
 if death is nothing dumbledore kill the boy 
 
 let the pain stop thought harry let him kill us end it dumbledore death is nothing compared to this 
 
 and see sirius again 
 
 and as heart filled with emotion the creatures coils loosened the pain was gone harry was lying face down on the floor his glasses gone shivering as though he lay upon ice not wood 
 
 and there were voices echoing through the hall more voices than there should have been harry opened his eyes saw his glasses lying by the heel of the headless statue that had been guarding him but which now lay flat on its back cracked and immobile he put them on and raised his head a little to find crooked nose inches from his own 
 
 are you all right harry 
 
 yes said harry shaking so violently he could not hold his head up properly yeah voldemort wherewho are all 
 
 the atrium was full of people the floor was reflecting the emerald green flames that had burst into fire in all the fireplaces along one wall and streams of witches and wizards were emerging from them as dumbledore pulled him back to his feet harry saw the tiny gold statues of the and the goblin leading a cornelius fudge forward 
 
 he was there shouted a man with a ponytail who was pointing at a pile of golden rubble on the other side of the hall where bellatrix had lain trapped only moments before i saw him mr fudge i swear it was he grabbed a woman and disapparated 
 
 i know williamson i know i saw him too gibbered fudge who was wearing pyjamas under his pinstriped cloak and was gasping as though he had just run miles beardherehere in the ministry of heavens aboveit seem possiblemy wordhow can this be 
 
 if you proceed downstairs into the department of mysteries cornelius said dumbledore apparently satisfied that harry was all right and walking forwards so that the newcomers realised he was there for the first time a few of them raised their wands others simply looked amazed the statues of the elf and goblin applauded and fudge jumped so much that his feet left the will find several escaped death eaters contained in the death chamber bound by an jinx and awaiting your decision as to what to do with them 
 
 dumbledore gasped fudge beside himself with amazement youhereii 
 
 he looked wildly around at the aurors he had brought with him and it could not have been clearer that he was in half a mind to cry seize him 
 
 cornelius i am ready to fight your menand win again said dumbledore in a thunderous voice but a few minutes ago you saw proof with your own eyes that i have been telling you the truth for a year lord voldemort has returned you have been chasing the wrong man for twelve months and it is time you listened to sense 
 
 blustered fudge looking around as though hoping somebody was going to tell him what to do when nobody did he said very welldawlish williamson go down to the department of mysteries and see dumbledore youyou will need to tell me exactlythe fountain of magical brethrenwhat happened he added in a kind of whimper staring around at the floor where the remains of the statues of the witch wizard and centaur now lay scattered 
 
 we can discuss that after i have sent harry back to hogwarts said dumbledore 
 
 harryharry potter 
 
 fudge wheeled around and stared at harry who was still standing against the wall beside the fallen statue that had guarded him during dumbledore and duel 
 
 hehere said fudge goggling at harry all this about 
 
 i shall explain everything repeated dumbledore when harry is back at school 
 
 he walked away from the pool to the place where the golden head lay on the floor he pointed his wand at it and muttered portus the head glowed blue and trembled noisily against the wooden floor for a few seconds then became still once more 
 
 now see here dumbledore said fudge as dumbledore picked up the head and walked back to harry carrying it you got authorisation for that portkey you do things like that right in front of the minister for magic youyou 
 
 his voice faltered as dumbledore surveyed him magisterially over his spectacles 
 
 you will give the order to remove dolores umbridge from hogwarts said dumbledore you will tell your aurors to stop searching for my care of magical creatures teacher so that he can return to work i will give you dumbledore pulled a watch with twelve hands from his pocket and surveyed an hour of my time tonight in which i think we shall be more than able to cover the important points of what has happened here after that i shall need to return to my school if you need more help from me you are of course more than welcome to contact me at hogwarts letters addressed to the headmaster will find me 
 
 fudge goggled worse than ever his mouth was open and his round face grew pinker under his rumpled grey hair 
 
 iyou 
 
 dumbledore turned his back on him 
 
 take this portkey harry 
 
 he held out the golden head of the statue and harry placed his hand on it past caring what he did next or where he went 
 
 i shall see you in half an hour said dumbledore quietly one two three 
 
 harry felt the familiar sensation of a hook being jerked behind his navel the polished wooden floor was gone from beneath his feet the atrium fudge and dumbledore had all disappeared and he was flying forwards in a whirlwind of colour and sound 
 
 rowling

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the bishop of borglum and his warriors 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 our scene is laid in northern jutland in the wild 
 moor we hear what is called the the peculiar 
 roar of the north sea as it breaks against the western coast of 
 jutland it rolls and thunders with a sound that penetrates for 
 miles into the land and we are quite near the roaring before us 
 rises a great mound of sand a mountain we have long seen and towards which we are wending our way driving slowly along through the deep sand on this mountain of sand is a lofty old building the convent of borglum in one of its wings the larger one there is still a church 
 
 and at this convent we now arrive in the late evening hour but the 
 weather is clear in the bright june night around us and the eye can 
 range far far over field and moor to the bay of aalborg over heath 
 and meadow and far across the deep blue sea 
 
 now we are there and roll past between barns and other farm 
 buildings and at the left of the gate we turn aside to the old castle 
 farm where the lime trees stand in lines along the walls and 
 sheltered from the wind and weather grow so luxuriantly that their 
 twigs and leaves almost conceal the windows 
 
 we mount the winding staircase of stone and march through the 
 long passages under the heavy the wind moans very 
 strangely here both within and without it is hardly known how but 
 the people say yes people say a great many things when they are 
 frightened or want to frighten others they say that the old dead 
 glide silently past us into the church where mass is 
 sung they can be heard in the rushing of the storm and their singing 
 brings up strange thoughts in the hearers thoughts of the old times 
 into which we are carried back 
 
 on the coast a ship is stranded and the warriors are 
 there and spare not those whom the sea has spared the sea washes 
 away the blood that has flowed from the cloven skulls the stranded 
 goods belong to the bishop and there is a store of goods here the 
 sea casts up tubs and barrels filled with costly wine for the 
 convent cellar and in the convent is already good store of beer and 
 mead there is plenty in the kitchen dead game and poultry hams 
 and sausages and fat fish swim in the ponds without 
 
 the bishop of borglum is a mighty lord he has great 
 possessions but still he longs for more everything must bow before 
 the mighty olaf glob his rich cousin at thyland is dead and his 
 widow is to have the rich inheritance but how comes it that one 
 relation is always harder towards another than even strangers would 
 be the husband had possessed all thyland with the 
 exception of the church property her son was not at home in his 
 boyhood he had already started on a journey for his desire was to see foreign lands and strange people for years there had been no news of him perhaps he had been long laid in the grave and would never come back to his home to rule where his mother then ruled 
 
 what has a woman to do with rule said the bishop 
 he summoned the widow before a law court but what did he gain 
 thereby the widow had never been disobedient to the law and was 
 strong in her just rights 
 
 bishop olaf of borglum what dost thou purpose what writest 
 thou on yonder smooth parchment sealing it with thy seal and 
 intrusting it to the horsemen and servants who ride away far away 
 to the city of the pope 
 
 it is the time of falling leaves and of stranded ships and soon 
 icy winter will come 
 
 twice had icy winter returned before the bishop welcomed the 
 horsemen and servants back to their home they came from rome with a papal decree a ban or bull against the widow who had dared to offend the pious bishop cursed be she and all that belongs to her 
 
 let her be expelled from the congregation and the church let no man stretch forth a helping hand to her and let friends and relations 
 avoid her as a plague and a pestilence 
 
 what will not bend must break said the bishop of borglum 
 and all forsake the widow but she holds fast to her god he is 
 her helper and defender 
 
 one servant only an old maid remained faithful to her and 
 with the old servant the widow herself followed the plough and the 
 crop grew although the land had been cursed by the pope and by the 
 bishop 
 
 thou child of perdition i will yet carry out my purpose 
 cried the bishop of borglum now will i lay the hand of the pope upon thee to summon thee before the tribunal that shall condemn thee 
 
 then did the widow yoke the last two oxen that remained to her 
 to a wagon and mounted up on the wagon with her old servant and 
 travelled away across the heath out of the danish land as a 
 stranger she came into a foreign country where a strange tongue was 
 spoken and where new customs prevailed farther and farther she 
 journeyed to where green hills rise into mountains and the vine 
 clothes their sides strange merchants drive by her and they look 
 anxiously after their wagons laden with merchandise they fear an 
 attack from the armed followers of the the two poor 
 women in their humble vehicle drawn by two black oxen travel 
 fearlessly through the dangerous sunken road and through the 
 darksome forest and now they were in franconia and there met them a stalwart knight with a train of twelve armed followers he 
 paused gazed at the strange vehicle and questioned the women as to 
 the goal of their journey and the place whence they came then one 
 of them mentioned thyland in denmark and spoke of her sorrows of her woes which were soon to cease for so divine providence had willed it for the stranger knight is the son he seized her hand he embraced her and the mother wept for years she had not been able to weep but had only bitten her lips till the blood started 
 it is the time of falling leaves and of stranded ships and soon 
 will icy winter come 
 
 the sea rolled to the shore for the cellar 
 in the kitchen the deer roasted on the spit before the fire at 
 borglum it was warm and cheerful in the heated rooms while cold 
 winter raged without when a piece of news was brought to the 
 bishop jens glob of thyland has come back and his mother with 
 him jens glob laid a complaint against the bishop and summoned 
 him before the temporal and the spiritual court 
 
 that will avail him little said the bishop best leave off thy 
 efforts knight jens 
 again it is the time of falling leaves and stranded ships icy 
 winter comes again and the white bees are swarming and sting the 
 face till they melt 
 
 keen weather say the people as they step in 
 jens glob stands so deeply wrapped in thought that he singes 
 the skirt of his wide garment 
 
 thou borglum bishop he exclaims i shall subdue thee after 
 all under the shield of the pope the law cannot reach thee but jens 
 glob shall reach thee 
 
 then he writes a letter to his olaf hase in 
 sallingland and prays that knight to meet him on christmas eve at 
 mass in the church at widberg the bishop himself is to read the 
 mass and consequently will journey from borglum to thyland and 
 this is known to jens glob 
 
 moorland and meadow are covered with ice and snow the marsh 
 will bear horse and rider the bishop with his priests and armed 
 men they ride the shortest way through the waving reeds where the 
 wind moans sadly 
 
 blow thy brazen trumpet thou trumpeter clad in it 
 sounds merrily in the clear air so they ride on over heath and 
 moorland over what is the garden of fata morgana in the hot summer though now icy like all the country towards the church of widberg 
 
 the wind is blowing his trumpet too blowing it harder and harder 
 he blows up a storm a terrible storm that increases more and more 
 towards the church they ride as fast as they may through the storm 
 the church stands firm but the storm careers on over field and 
 moorland over land and sea 
 
 bishop reaches the church but olaf hase will scarce 
 do so however hard he may ride he journeys with his warriors on 
 the farther side of the bay in order that he may help jens glob 
 now that the bishop is to be summoned before the judgment seat of 
 the highest 
 
 the church is the judgment hall the altar is the council table 
 the lights burn clear in the heavy brass candelabra the storm reads 
 out the accusation and the sentence roaming in the air over moor 
 and heath and over the rolling waters no can sail over 
 the bay in such weather as this 
 
 olaf hase makes halt at ottesworde there he dismisses his 
 warriors presents them with their horses and harness and gives 
 them leave to ride home and greet his wife he intends to risk his 
 life alone in the roaring waters but they are to bear witness for him 
 that it is not his fault if jens glob stands without reinforcement 
 in the church at widberg the faithful warriors will not leave him 
 but follow him out into the deep waters ten of them are carried away but olaf hase and two of the youngest men reach the farther have still four miles to ride 
 
 it is past midnight it is christmas the wind has abated the 
 church is lighted up the gleaming radiance shines through the 
 and pours out over meadow and heath the mass has long been finished silence reigns in the church and the wax is heard dropping from the candles to the stone pavement and now olaf hase arrives 
 in the forecourt jens glob greets him kindly and says 
 i have just made an agreement with the bishop 
 sayest thou so replied olaf hase then neither thou nor the 
 bishop shall quit this church alive 
 
 and the sword leaps from the scabbard and olaf hase deals a 
 blow that makes the panel of the church door which jens glob 
 hastily closes between them fly in fragments 
 
 hold brother first hear what the agreement was that i made i 
 have slain the bishop and his warriors and priests they will have 
 no word more to say in the matter nor will i speak again of all the 
 wrong that my mother has endured 
 
 the long wicks of the altar lights glimmer red but there is a 
 redder gleam upon the pavement where the bishop lies with cloven 
 skull and his dead warriors around him in the quiet of the holy 
 christmas night 
 
 and four days afterwards the bells toll for a funeral in the 
 convent of borglum the murdered bishop and the slain warriors and 
 priests are displayed under a black canopy surrounded by candelabra decked with crape there lies the dead man in the black cloak wrought with silver the crozier in the powerless hand that was once so mighty the incense rises in clouds and the monks chant the funeral hymn it sounds like a wail it sounds like a sentence of wrath and condemnation that must be heard far over the land carried by the wind sung by the wind the wail that sometimes is silent but never dies for ever again it rises in song singing even into our own 
 time this legend of the bishop of borglum and his hard nephew it is 
 heard in the dark night by the frightened husbandman driving by in 
 the heavy sandy road past the convent of borglum it is heard by the 
 sleepless listener in the rooms at borglum and not 
 only to the ear of superstition is the sighing and the tread of 
 hurrying feet audible in the long echoing passages leading to the 
 convent door that has long been locked the door still seems to 
 open and the lights seem to flame in the brazen candlesticks the 
 fragrance of incense arises the church gleams in its ancient 
 splendor and the monks sing and say the mass over the slain bishop 
 who lies there in the black mantle with the 
 crozier in his powerless hand and on his pale proud forehead gleams 
 the red wound like fire and there burn the worldly mind and the 
 wicked thoughts 
 
 sink down into his grave into oblivion ye terrible shapes of the 
 times of old 
 hark to the raging of the angry wind sounding above the rolling 
 sea a storm approaches without calling aloud for human lives the 
 sea has not put on a new mind with the new time this night it is a 
 horrible pit to devour up lives and perhaps it may be a 
 glassy mirror even as in the old time that we have buried sleep 
 sweetly if thou canst sleep 
 
 now it is morning 
 
 the new time flings sunshine into the room the wind still keeps 
 up mightily a wreck is announced as in the old time 
 
 during the night down yonder by lokken the little fishing 
 village with the roofs we can see it up here from the 
 window a ship has come ashore it has struck and is fast embedded in the sand but the rocket apparatus has thrown a rope on board and 
 formed a bridge from the wreck to the mainland and all on board are 
 saved and reach the land and are wrapped in warm blankets and 
 they are invited to the farm at the convent of borglum in 
 comfortable rooms they encounter hospitality and friendly faces 
 they are addressed in the language of their country and the piano 
 sounds for them with melodies of their native land and before these 
 have died away the chord has been struck the wire of thought that 
 reaches to the land of the sufferers announces that they are 
 rescued then their anxieties are dispelled and at even they join 
 in the dance at the feast given in the great hall at borglum 
 waltzes and styrian dances are given and danish popular songs and 
 melodies of foreign lands in these modern times 
 blessed be thou new time speak thou of summer and of purer 
 gales send thy sunbeams gleaming into our hearts and thoughts on thy glowing canvas let them be painted the dark legends of the rough hard times that are past

 book shadow supreme dawn 
 chapter vi 
 
 the grass covers and the rain effaces 
 in the cemetery of in the vicinity of the common grave far from the elegant quarter of that city of sepulchres far from all the tombs of fancy which display in the presence of eternity all the hideous fashions of death in a deserted corner beside an old wall beneath a great yew tree over which climbs the wild convolvulus amid dandelions and mosses there lies a stone 
 that stone is no more exempt than others from the leprosy of time of dampness of the lichens and from the defilement of the birds 
 the water turns it green the air blackens it 
 it is not near any path and people are not fond of walking in that direction because the grass is high and their feet are immediately wet 
 when there is a little sunshine the lizards come thither 
 all around there is a quivering of weeds 
 in the spring linnets warble in the trees 
 this stone is perfectly plain 
 in cutting it the only thought was the requirements of the tomb and no other care was taken than to make the stone long enough and narrow enough to cover a man 
 no name is to be read there 
 only many years ago a hand wrote upon it in pencil these four lines which have become gradually illegible beneath the rain and the dust and which are probably effaced 
 il dort quoique le sort fut pour lui bien etrange 
 il vivait il mourut quand il plus son ange 
 la chose simplement arriva 
 comme la nuit se fait lorsque le jour va 
 he sleeps 
 although his fate was very strange he lived 
 he died when he had no longer his angel 
 the thing came to pass simply of itself as the night comes when day is gone 
 letter to m daelli 
 publisher of the italian translation of les miserables in milan 
 october 
 
 you are right sir when you tell me that les miserables is written for all nations 
 i do not know whether it will be read by all but i wrote it for all 
 it is addressed to england as well as to spain to italy as well as to france to germany as well as to ireland to republics which have slaves as well as to empires which have serfs 
 social problems overstep frontiers 
 the sores of the human race those great sores which cover the globe do not halt at the red or blue lines traced upon the map 
 in every place where man is ignorant and despairing in every place where woman is sold for bread wherever the child suffers for lack of the book which should instruct him and of the hearth which should warm him the book of les miserables knocks at the door and says 
 open to me i come for you 
 at the hour of civilization through which we are now passing and which is still so sombre the name is man he is agonizing in all climes and he is groaning in all languages 
 your italy is no more exempt from the evil than is our france 
 your admirable italy has all miseries on the face of it 
 does not banditism that raging form of pauperism inhabit your mountains 
 few nations are more deeply eaten by that ulcer of convents which i have endeavored to fathom 
 in spite of your possessing rome milan naples palermo turin florence sienna pisa mantua bologna ferrara genoa venice a heroic history sublime ruins magnificent ruins and superb cities you are like ourselves poor 
 you are covered with marvels and vermin 
 assuredly the sun of italy is splendid but alas azure in the sky does not prevent rags on man 
 like us you have prejudices superstitions tyrannies fanaticisms blind laws lending assistance to ignorant customs 
 you taste nothing of the present nor of the future without a flavor of the past being mingled with it 
 you have a barbarian the monk and a savage the lazzarone 
 the social question is the same for you as for us 
 there are a few less deaths from hunger with you and a few more from fever your social hygiene is not much better than ours shadows which are protestant in england are catholic in italy but under different names the vescovo is identical with the bishop and it always means night and of pretty nearly the same quality 
 to explain the bible badly amounts to the same thing as to understand the gospel badly 
 is it necessary to emphasize this 
 must this melancholy parallelism be yet more completely verified 
 have you not indigent persons 
 glance below 
 have you not parasites 
 glance up 
 does not that hideous balance whose two scales pauperism and parasitism so mournfully preserve their mutual equilibrium oscillate before you as it does before us 
 where is your army of schoolmasters the only army which civilization acknowledges 
 where are your free and compulsory schools 
 does every one know how to read in the land of dante and of michael angelo 
 have you made public schools of your barracks 
 have you not like ourselves an opulent and a paltry budget of education 
 have not you also that passive obedience which is so easily converted into soldierly obedience military establishment which pushes the regulations to the extreme of firing upon garibaldi that is to say upon the living honor of italy 
 let us subject your social order to examination let us take it where it stands and as it stands let us view its flagrant offences show me the woman and the child 
 it is by the amount of protection with which these two feeble creatures are surrounded that the degree of civilization is to be measured 
 is prostitution less heartrending in naples than in paris 
 what is the amount of truth that springs from your laws and what amount of justice springs from your tribunals 
 do you chance to be so fortunate as to be ignorant of the meaning of those gloomy words 
 public prosecution legal infamy prison the scaffold the executioner the death penalty 
 italians with you as with us beccaria is dead and farinace is alive 
 and then let us scrutinize your state reasons 
 have you a government which comprehends the identity of morality and politics 
 you have reached the point where you grant amnesty to heroes 
 something very similar has been done in france 
 stay let us pass miseries in review let each one contribute his pile you are as rich as we 
 have you not like ourselves two condemnations religious condemnation pronounced by the priest and social condemnation decreed by the judge 
 oh great nation of italy thou resemblest the great nation of france 
 alas our brothers you are like ourselves miserables 
 from the depths of the gloom wherein you dwell you do not see much more distinctly than we the radiant and distant portals of eden 
 only the priests are mistaken 
 these holy portals are before and not behind us 
 i resume 
 this book les miserables is no less your mirror than ours 
 certain men certain castes rise in revolt against this book i understand that 
 mirrors those revealers of the truth are hated that does not prevent them from being of use 
 as for myself i have written for all with a profound love for my own country but without being engrossed by france more than by any other nation 
 in proportion as i advance in life i grow more simple and i become more and more patriotic for humanity 
 this is moreover the tendency of our age and the law of radiance of the french revolution books must cease to be exclusively french italian german spanish or english and become european i say more human if they are to correspond to the enlargement of civilization 
 hence a new logic of art and of certain requirements of composition which modify everything even the conditions formerly narrow of taste and language which must grow broader like all the rest 
 in france certain critics have reproached me to my great delight with having transgressed the bounds of what they call french taste i should be glad if this eulogium were merited 
 in short i am doing what i can i suffer with the same universal suffering and i try to assuage it i possess only the puny forces of a man and i cry to all 
 help me 
 this sir is what your letter prompts me to say i say it for you and for your country 
 if i have insisted so strongly it is because of one phrase in your letter 
 you write 
 there are italians and they are numerous who say 
 this book les miserables is a french book 
 it does not concern us 
 let the french read it as a history we read it as a 
 i repeat whether we be italians or frenchmen misery concerns us all 
 ever since history has been written ever since philosophy has meditated misery has been the garment of the human race the moment has at length arrived for tearing off that rag and for replacing upon the naked limbs of the the sinister fragment of the past with the grand purple robe of the dawn 
 if this letter seems to you of service in enlightening some minds and in dissipating some prejudices you are at liberty to publish it sir 
 accept i pray you a renewed assurance of my very distinguished sentiments

 of masques triumphs 
 these dungs are but toys to come amongst such serious observations but yet since princes will have such things it is better they should be graced with elegancy than daubed with cost dancing to song is a thing of great state and pleasure i understand it that the song be in choir placed aloft and accompanied with some broken music and the ditty fitted to the device acting in song especially in dialogues hath an extreme good grace i say acting not dancing for that is a mean and vulgar thing and the voices of the dialogue would be strong and manly a bass and a tenor no treble and the ditty high and tragical not nice or dainty several choirs placed one over against another and taking the voice by catches give great pleasure 
 turning dances into figure is a childish curiosity and generally let it be noted that those things which i here set down are such as do naturally take the sense and not respect petty wonderments it is true the alterations of scenes so it be quietly and without noise are things of great beauty and pleasure for they feed and relieve the eye before it be full of the same object let the scenes abound with light specially coloured and varied and let the masquers or any other that are to come down from the scene have some motions upon the scene itself before their coming down for it draws the eye strangely and makes it with great pleasure to 
 desire to see that it cannot perfectly discern 
 let the songs be loud and cheerful and not chirpings or pulings let the music likewise be sharp and loud and well placed the colours that show best by candlelight are white carnation and a kind of and oes or spangs as they are of no great cost so they are of most glory 
 as for rich embroidery it is lost and not discerned let the suits of the masquers be graceful and such as become the person when the vizors are off not after examples of known attires turks soldiers mariners and the like let antimasques not be long they have been commonly of fools satyrs baboons antics beasts sprites witches ethiopes pigmies turquets nymphs rustics cupids statues moving and the like 
 as for angels it is not comical enough to put them in and any thing that is hideous as devils giants is on the other side as unfit but chiefly let the music of them be recreative and with some strange changes some sweet odours suddenly coming forth without any drops falling are in such a company as there is steam and heat things of great pleasure and refreshment double masques one of men another of ladies addeth state and variety but all is nothing except the room be kept clear and neat for justs and tourneys and barriers the glories of them are chiefly in the chariots wherein the challengers make their entry especially if they be drawn with strange beasts as lions bears camels and the like 
 or in the devices of their entrance or in the bravery of their liveries or in the goodly furniture of their horses and armour but enough of these toys

 return of the jedi 
 viii 
 
 admiral ackbar stood on the bridge in stunned disbelief looking out the observationwindow at the place where a moment before the rebel star cruiser liberty had justbeen engaged in a furious battle now there was nothing only emptyspace powdered with a fine dust that sparkled in the light of more distant stared in silence 
 around him confusion was rampant flustered controllers were still trying tocontact the liberty while fleet captains ran from screen to port shouting 
 an aide handed ackbar the comlink general voice was comingthrough 
 this is gold leader that blast came from the death star death star is operational 
 we saw it ackbar answered wearily all craft prepare to retreat 
 not going to give up and run lando shouted back come a longway to be in this game 
 we have no choice general calrissian our cruisers repel firepower ofthat magnitude 
 you get a second chance at this admiral han will have that got to give him more time head for those star destroyers 
 ackbar looked around him a huge charge of flak rumbled the ship painting abrief waxen light over the window calrissian was right there would be no secondchance it was now or it was the end 
 he turned to his first star captain move the fleet forward 
 yes sir the man paused sir we stand much of a chance againstthose star destroyers they us and more heavily armored 
 i know ackbar said softly 
 the captain left an aide approached 
 forward ships have made contact with the imperial fleet sir 
 concentrate your fire on their power generators if we can knock out theirshields our fighters might stand a chance against them 
 the ship was rocked by another laserbolt hit to one of the aftgyrostabilizers 
 intensify auxiliary shields someone yelled 
 the pitch of the battle augmented another notch 
 beyond the window of the throne room the rebel fleet was being decimated inthe soundless vacuum of space while inside the only sound was the cackle luke continued his spiral into desperation as the death star laserbeam incinerated ship after ship 
 the emperor hissed your fleet is your friends on the endor moonwill not survive he pushed a comlink button on the arm of his throne and spokeinto it with relish commander jerjerrod should the rebel manage to blow up theshield generator you will turned this battle station onto the endor moon and destroyit 
 yes your highness came the voice over the receiver but we have severalbattalions stationed on 
 you will destroy it the whisper was more final than any scream 
 yes your highness 
 palpatine turned back to former shaking with glee the latter withoutrage 
 there is no escape my young pupil the alliance will will yourfriends 
 face was contorted reflecting his spirit vader watched him carefully asdid the emperor the lightsaber began to shake on its resting place the hand was trembling his lips pulled back in grimace his teeth grinding 
 the emperor smiled good i can feel your anger i am weapon strike me down with all of your hatred and your journey toward thedark side will be complete he laughed and laughed 
 luke was able to resist no longer the lightsaber rattled violently on the thronea moment then flew into his hand impelled by the force he ignited it a momentlater and swung it with his full weight downward toward the skull 
 in that instant blade flashed into view parrying attack an inchabove the head sparks flew like forging steel bathing face in a hellish glare 
 luke jumped back and turned lightsaber upraised to face his father vaderextended his own blade poised to do battle 
 the emperor sighed with pleasure and sat in his throne facing sole audience to this dire aggrieved contest 
 han leia chewbacca and the rest of the strike team were escorted out of thebunker by their captors the sight that greeted them was substantially different fromthe way the grassy area had appeared when entered the clearing was nowfilled with imperial troops 
 hundreds of them in white or black standing at ease someviewing the scene from atop their walkers some leaning on their speederbikes if the situation had appeared hopeless inside the bunker it looked even worsenow 
 han and leia turned to each other full of feeling all struggled for dreamed now even so had each other for a short while atleast come together from opposite ends of a wasteland of emotionalisolation han had never known love so enamored of himself was he leia hadnever known love so wrapped up in social upheaval was she so intent on embracingall of humanity and somewhere between his glassy infatuation for the one and herglowing fervor for the all found a shady place where two could huddle feel nourished 
 but that too was cut short now the end seemed near so much was there tosay they find a single word instead they only joined hands speakingthrough their fingers in these final minutes of companionship 
 when threepio and artoo jauntily entered the clearing beeping andjabbering excitedly to each other they stopped cold in their tracks when they sawwhat the clearing had becomeand found all eyes suddenly focused on them 
 oh dear threepio whimpered in a second he and artoo had turned aroundand run right back into the woods from which just come six stormtrooperscharged in after them 
 the imperial soldiers were in time to see the two droids duck behind a large twenty yards into the forest they rushed after the robots as they roundedthe tree they found artoo and threepio standing there quietly waiting to be guards moved to take them they moved too slowly 
 fifteen ewoks dropped out of the overhanging branches quickly overpoweringthe imperial troops with rocks and clubs at that in a horn to his lips and sounded three long blasts from its bell thatwas the signal for the ewoks to attack 
 hundreds of them descended upon the clearing from all sides throwingthemselves against the might of the imperial army with unrestrained zeal the scenewas unabridged chaos 
 stormtroopers fired their laser pistols at the furry creatures killing or to be overrun by dozens more in their place biker scouts chasedsquealing ewoks into the were knocked from their bikes by volleys ofrocks launched from the trees 
 in the first confused moments of the attack chewie dove into the foliage whilehan and leia hit the dirt in the cover of the arches that flanked the bunker all around kept them pinned from leaving the bunker door itself wasclosed again and locked 
 han punched out the stolen code on the control panel this time thedoor open it had been reprogrammed as soon as been caught theterminal work now he muttered 
 leia stretched for a laser pistol lying in the dirt just out of reach beside a felledstormtrooper shots were crisscrossing from every direction though 
 we need artoo she shouted 
 han nodded took out his comlink pushed the sequence that signaled the littledroid and reached for the weapon leia get as the fighting stormed all aroundthem 
 artoo and threepio were huddled behind a log when artoo got the suddenly blurted out an excited whistle and shot off toward the battlefield 
 artoo threepio shouted where are you going wait for me nearlybeside himself the golden droid tore off after his best friend 
 biker scouts raced over and around the scurrying droids blasting away at theewoks who grew fiercer every time their fur was scorched the little bears werehanging on the legs of the imperial walkers hobbling the appendages with lengths ofvine or injuring the joint mechanisms by forcing pebbles and twigs into the were knocking scouts off their bikes by stringing vine between trees at throatlevel they were throwing rocks jumping out of trees impaling with with nets they were everywhere 
 scores of them rallied behind chewbacca who had grown rather fond of themduring the course of the previous night become their mascot and they hislittle country cousins so it was with a special ferocity now that they came to aid chewie was flinging stormtroopers left and right in a selfless wookieefrenzy any time he saw them physically formed equally cadres to donothing but follow chewbacca and throw themselves upon any soldiers who startedgetting the upper hand with him 
 it was a wild strange battle 
 artoo and threepio finally made it to the bunker door han and leia providedcover fire with guns finally managed to scrounge artoo moved quickly tothe terminal plugged in his computer arm began scanning before evencomputed the weather codes though a laser bolt explosion ripped the cable arm spilling him to the dirt 
 his head began to smolder his fittings to leak all of a sudden everycompartment sprang open every nozzle gushed or smoked every wheel stopped threepio rushed to his wounded companion as han examined thebunker terminal 
 maybe i can hotwire this thing solo mumbled 
 meanwhile the ewoks had erected a primitive catapult at the other side of thefield they fired a large boulder at one of the machine vibratedseriously but did not topple it turned and headed for the catapult laser cannonfiring the ewoks scattered when the walker was ten feet away the ewokschopped a mass of restraining vines and two huge balanced trunks crashed down ontop of the imperial war wagon halting it for good 
 the next phase of the assault began ewoks in started dropping rocks on the stormtroopers or withspears teebo who led the attack was hit in the wing with laser fire during the firstvolley and crashed into a gnarled root a charging walker clumped forward to crushhim but wicket swooped down just in time yanking teebo to safety in swervingout of the way though wicket smashed into a racing speeder allwent tumbling into the dense foliage 
 and so it went 
 the casualties mounted 
 high above it was no different a thousand deadly dogfights and cannonbombardments were erupting all over the skies while the death star laser beammethodically disintegrated the rebel ships 
 in the millennium falcon lando steered like a maniac through an obstaclecourse of the giant floating imperial star laser bolts with flak outracing tie fighters 
 desperately he was shouting into his comlink over the noise of continuousexplosions talking to ackbar in the alliance command ship i said closer movein as close as you can and engage the star destroyers at point blank waythe death star be able to fire at us without knocking out its own ships 
 but no ever gone nose to nose at that range between supervessels liketheir destroyers and our cruisers ackbar fumed at the theiroptions were running out 
 great yelled lando skimming over the surface of the destroyer inventing a new kind of combat 
 we know nothing about the tactics of such a confrontation ackbar protested 
 we know as much as they do lando hollered and think we knowmore bluffing was always dangerous in the last hand but sometimes when allyour money was in the pot it was the only way to lando never played tolose 
 at that we last long against star destroyers ackbar wasalready feeling giddy with resignation 
 last longer than we will against that death star and we might just take afew of them with us lando whooped with a jolt one of his forward guns wasblown away he put the falcon into a controlled spin and careened around the bellyof the imperial leviathan 
 with little else to lose ackbar decided to try strategy in the nextminutes dozens of rebel cruisers moved in astronomically close to the imperial the colossal antagonists began blasting away at each other like tanksat twenty paces while hundreds of tiny fighters raced across their surfaces zippingbetween laser bolts as they chased around the massive hulls 
 slowly luke and vader circled lightsaber high above his head luke readiedhis attack from classic the dark lord held a lateral stance in classicanswer without announcement luke brought his blade straight whenvader moved to parry luke feinted and cut low vader counterparried let theimpact direct his sword toward throatbut luke met the riposte and steppedback the first blows traded without injury again they circled 
 vader was impressed with speed pleased even it was a pity let the boy kill the emperor yet luke ready for that was still a chance luke would return to his friends if he destroyed the emperornow he needed more extensive tutelage by both vader be ready to assume his place at right hand ruling thegalaxy 
 so vader had to shephered the boy through periods like this stop him from doingdamage in the wrong in the right places prematurely 
 before vader could gather his thoughts much further though luke more aggressively he advanced in a flurry of lunges each met with aloud crack of phosphorescent saber the dark lord retreated a step at everyslash swiveling once to bring his cutting beam up luke batted it vader back yet again the lord of the sith momentarily lost his footing onthe stairs and tumbled to his knees 
 luke stood above him at the top of the staircase heady with his own power itwas in his hands now he knew it was he could take vader take his blade take hislife take his place at the side yes even that luke bury thethought this time he gloried in it he engorged himself with its juices felt itspower tingle his cheeks it made him feverish this thought with lust sooverpowering as to totally obliterate all other considerations 
 he had the power the choice was his 
 and then another thought emerged slowly compulsive as an ardent lover hecould destroy the emperor too destroy them both and rule the galaxy avengeand conquer 
 it was a profound moment for luke dizzying yet he did not swoon nordid he recoil 
 he took one step forward 
 for the first time the thought entered consciousness that his son mightbest him he was astounded by the strength luke had acquired since their last the cloud to mention the timing which was honed to this was an unexpected circumstance unexpected andunwelcome vader felt humiliation crawling in on the tail of his first reaction whichwas surprise and his second which was fear and then the edge of the humiliationcurled up to reveal bald anger and now he wanted revenge 
 these things were mirrored each facet by the young jedi who now toweredabove him the emperor watching joyously saw this and goaded luke on to revelin his darkness use your aggressive feelings boy yes let the hate flowthrough you become one with it let it nourish you 
 luke faltered a realized what was happening he was suddenlyconfused again what did he want what should he do his brief exultation hismicrosecond of dark now in a wash of indecision veiled awakening from a passionate flirtation 
 he took a step back lowered his sword relaxed and tried to drive the hatredfrom his being 
 in that instant vader attacked he lunged half up the stairs forcing luke toreverse defensively he bound the blade with his own but luke disengagedand leaped to the safety of an overhead gantry vader jumped over the railing to thefloor beneath the platform on which luke stood 
 i will not fight you father luke stated 
 you are unwise to lower your defenses vader warned his anger was did not want to win if the boy was not battling to the fullest but ifwinning meant he had to kill the boy who fightthen he could do that he wanted luke to be aware of those consequences he wanted luke to knowthis was no longer just a game this was darkness 
 luke heard something else though your thoughts betray you father i feelthe good in youthe conflict you could not bring yourself to kill me destroy me now twice before in have killed him but in the dogfight over the first death star and laterin the lightsaber duel on bespin he thought of leia briefly now howvader had had her in his clutches once had even tortured herbut kill winced to think of her agony but quickly pushed that from his mind the pointwas clear to him now though so often so murky there was still good in his father 
 this accusation really made vader angry he could tolerate much from theinsolent child but this was insufferable he must teach this boy a lesson he wouldnever forget or die learning once again you underestimate the power of the darkside 
 vader threw his scintillating sliced through the supports holding up thegantry on which luke was perched then swept around and flew back into luke tumbled to the ground then rolled down another level under the tiltingplatform in the shadow of the darkened overhang he was out of sight vaderpaced the area like a cat seeking the boy but he enter the shadows of theoverhang 
 you cannot hide forever luke 
 have to come in and get me replied the disembodied voice 
 i will not give you the advantage that easily vader felt his intentionsincreasingly ambiguous in this conflict the purity of his evil was being boy was clever knew he must move with extreme caution now 
 i wish no advantage father i will not fight you heretake my knew full well this might be his end but so be it he would not use darknessto fight darkness perhaps it would be left to leia after all to carry on the him perhaps she would know a way he know perhaps she could finda path for now though he could see only two paths and one was into one was not 
 luke put his lightsaber on the ground and rolled it along the floor toward stopped halfway between them in the middle of the low overhead area the darklord reached out his lightsaber jumped into it he hooked it to hisbelt and with grave uncertainty entered the shadowy overhang 
 he was picking up additional feelings from luke now new crosscurrents ofdoubt remorse regret abandonment shades of pain but somehow nowdirectly related to vader to others toendor ah that was sanctuarymoon where his friends would soon die luke would learn soon enough friendshipwas different on the dark side a different thing altogether 
 give yourself to the dark side luke he entreated it is the only way youcan save your friends yes your thoughts betray you son your feelings for themare strong especially for 
 vader stopped he sensed something 
 luke withdrew further into shadow he tried to hide but there was no way tohide what was in his was in pain her agony cried to him now and hisspirit cried with her he tried to shut it out to shut it up but the cry was loud and stifle it leave it alone had to cradle it openly to give it solace 
 consciousness invaded that private place 
 no screamed luke 
 vader was incredulous sister sister he bellowed your feelings havenow betrayed her tootwins he roared triumphantly was wise to hideher but now his failure is complete his smile was clear to luke through the the shadows through all the realms of darkness if you will not turned tothe dark side perhaps she will 
 this then was breaking point for leia was last unflagginghope if vader turned his twisted misguided cravings on her 
 never he screamed his lightsaber flew off belt into his own as it came to him 
 he rushed to his father with a frenzy never known nor had vader thegladiators battled fiercely sparks flying from the clash of their radiant weapons but itwas soon evident that the advantage was all and he was pressing it theylocked swords body to body when luke pushed vader back to break the clinch thedark lord hit his head on an overhanging beam in the cramped space he stumbledbackward even farther out of the area luke pursued him relentlessly 
 blow upon blow luke forced vader to onto the bridge thatcrossed the vast seemingly bottomless shaft to the power core each stroke saber pummeled vader like accusations like screams like shards of hate 
 the dark lord was driven to his knees he raised his blade to block yetanother luke slashed right hand off at the wrist 
 the hand along with bits of metal wires and electronic devices clattereduselessly away while lightsaber tumbled over the edge of the span into theendless shaft below without a trace 
 luke stared at his twitching severed mechanical then at hisown artificial realized suddenly just how much becomelike his father like the man he hated 
 trembling he stood above vader the point of his glowing blade at the throat he wanted to destroy this thing of darkness this thing that was oncehis father this thing that washim 
 suddenly the emperor was there looking on chuckling with agitation good kill him your hate has made you powerful your destiny and take your place at my side 
 luke stared at his father beneath him then at the emperor then back at was it was the darkness he hated not his father not even theemperor but the darkness in them in them and in himself 
 and the only way to destroy the darkness way to renounce it for good and stood suddenly erect and made the decision for which spent his life inpreparation 
 he hurled his lightsaber away never never will i turn to the dark have failed palpatine i am a jedi as my father was before me 
 the glee turned to a sullen rage so be it jedi if you will not beturned you will be destroyed 
 palpatine raised his spidery arms toward luke blinding white bolts of energycoruscated from his fingers shot across the room like sorcerous lightning and torethrough the insides looking for ground the young jedi was at onceconfounded and in never heard of such a power such a corruption of theforce let alone experienced it 
 but if it was it could be luke raised his armsto deflect the bolts initially he was lightning rebounded from histouch harmlessly into the walls soon though the shocks came with such speedand power they coursed over and into him and he could only shrink before with pain his knees buckling his powers at ebb 
 vader crawled like a wounded animal to his side 
 on endor the battle of the bunker continued stormtroopers kept irradiatingewoks with sophisticated weaponry while the fuzzy little warriors bashed away at theimperial troops with clubs tumbled walkers with logpiles and vine lassoedspeeder bikes with and 
 they felled trees on their foes they dug pits which they covered withbranches and then lured the walkers to chase them until the clumsy armored vehiclestoppled into the dugouts they started rockslides they dammed a small nearbystream and then opened the floodgates deluging a host of troops and two morewalkers they ganged up and then ran away they jumped on top of walkers fromhigh branches and poured pouches of burning in the they usedknives and spears and slings and made scary to confound and dismaythe enemy they were fearless opponents 
 their example made even chewie bolder than was his wont he started havingso much fun swinging on vines and bashing heads he nearly forgot about his laserpistol 
 he swung onto the roof of a walker at one point with teebo and wicket clingingto his back they landed with a thud atop the lurching contraption then made such abanging racket trying to hang on one of stormtroopers inside opened the top hatch tosee what was happening before he could fire his gun chewie plucked him out anddashed him to the and teebo immediately dove into the hatch andsubdued the other trooper 
 ewoks drive an imperial walker much the way they drive but with exhilaration chewie was almost thrown off the top severaltimes but even barking angrily down into the cockpit seem to have ewoks just giggled squealed and careened into another speeder bike 
 chewie climbed down inside it took him half a minute to master technology was pretty standardized and then methodically oneby one he began approaching the other unsuspecting imperial walkers and blastingthem to dust most had no idea what was happening 
 as the giant began going up in flames the ewoks were rallied behind walker the wookiee was turning the tide of battle 
 han meanwhile was still working furiously at the control panel wiressparked each time he refastened another connection but the door kept not crouched at his back firing her laser pistol giving him cover 
 he motioned her at last give me a hand i think got it figured out holdthis 
 he handed her one of the wires she holstered her weapon took the wire hegave her and held it in position as he brought two others over from opposite ends ofthe panel 
 here goes nothing he said 
 the three wires sparked the connection was made there was a sudden loudwhump as a second blast door crashed down in front of the first doubling theimpregnable barrier 
 great now we have two doors to get through leia muttered 
 at that moment she was hit in the arm by a laser bolt and knocked to theground 
 han rushed over to her leia no he cried trying to stop the bleeding 
 princess leia are you all right threepio fretted 
 not bad she shook her head 
 hold it shouted a voice one move and both dead 
 they froze looked up two stormtroopers stood before them weapons 
 stand up one ordered hands raised 
 han and leia looked at each other fixed their gazes deep in each there in the wells of their souls for a suspended eternal moment during whichall was felt understood touched shared 
 gaze was drawn down to surreptitiously eased outher gun and was holding it now at the ready the action was hidden from thetroopers because han was standing in front of leia their view 
 he looked again into her eyes comprehending with a last heartfelt smile hewhispered i love you 
 i know she answered simply 
 then the moment was over and at an unspoken instantaneous signal hanwhirled out of the line of fire as leia blasted at the stormtroopers 
 the air was filled with laser glinting haze like an electronstorm buffeted the area sheared by intense flares 
 as the smoke cleared a giant imperial walker approached stood before him andstopped han looked up to see its laser cannons aimed directly in his face heraised his arms and took a tentative step forward he really sure what he wasgoing to do stay back he said quietly to leia measuring the distance to themachine in his mind 
 that was when the hatch on top of the walker popped open and chewbaccastuck his head out with an ingratiating smile 
 ahr rahr barked the wookiee 
 solo could have kissed him chewie get down here started forward to greet his partner then stopped in no wait an idea

 pursued by the french army of a hundred thousand men under the command of bonaparte encountering a population that was unfriendly to it losing confidence in its allies suffering from shortness of supplies and compelled to act under conditions of war unlike anything that had been foreseen the russian army of thousand men commanded by kutuzov was hurriedly retreating along the danube stopping where overtaken by the enemy and fighting rearguard actions only as far as necessary to enable it to retreat without losing its heavy equipment there had been actions at lambach amstetten and melk but despite the courage and endurance acknowledged even by the enemy with which the russians fought the only consequence of these actions was a yet more rapid retreat austrian troops that had escaped capture at ulm and had joined kutuzov at braunau now separated from the russian army and kutuzov was left with only his own weak and exhausted forces the defense of vienna was no longer to be thought of instead of an offensive the plan of which carefully prepared in accord with the modern science of strategics had been handed to kutuzov when he was in vienna by the austrian hofkriegsrath the sole and almost unattainable aim remaining for him was to effect a junction with the forces that were advancing from russia without losing his army as mack had done at ulm 
 on the of october kutuzov with his army crossed to the left bank of the danube and took up a position for the first time with the river between himself and the main body of the french on the thirtieth he attacked division which was on the left bank and broke it up in this action for the first time trophies were taken banners cannon and two enemy generals for the first time after a retreat the russian troops had halted and after a fight had not only held the field but had repulsed the french though the troops were exhausted and had lost a third of their number in killed wounded sick and stragglers though a number of sick and wounded had been abandoned on the other side of the danube with a letter in which kutuzov entrusted them to the humanity of the enemy and though the big hospitals and the houses in krems converted into military hospitals could no longer accommodate all the sick and wounded yet the stand made at krems and the victory over mortier raised the spirits of the army considerably throughout the whole army and at headquarters most joyful though erroneous rumors were rife of the imaginary approach of columns from russia of some victory gained by the austrians and of the retreat of the frightened bonaparte 
 prince andrew during the battle had been in attendance on the austrian general schmidt who was killed in the action his horse had been wounded under him and his own arm slightly grazed by a bullet as a mark of the commander in special favor he was sent with the news of this victory to the austrian court now no longer at vienna which was threatened by the french but at brunn despite his apparently delicate build prince andrew could endure physical fatigue far better than many very muscular men and on the night of the battle having arrived at krems excited but not weary with dispatches from dokhturov to kutuzov he was sent immediately with a special dispatch to brunn to be so sent meant not only a reward but an important step toward promotion 
 the night was dark but starry the road showed black in the snow that had fallen the previous day the day of the battle reviewing his impressions of the recent battle picturing pleasantly to himself the impression his news of a victory would create or recalling the given him by the commander in chief and his fellow officers prince andrew was galloping along in a post chaise enjoying the feelings of a man who has at length begun to attain a happiness as soon as he closed his eyes his ears seemed filled with the rattle of the wheels and the sensation of victory then he began to imagine that the russians were running away and that he himself was killed but he quickly roused himself with a feeling of joy as if learning afresh that this was not so but that on the contrary the french had run away he again recalled all the details of the victory and his own calm courage during the battle and feeling reassured he dozed off the dark starry night was followed by a bright cheerful morning the snow was thawing in the sunshine the horses galloped quickly and on both sides of the road were forests of different kinds fields and villages 
 at one of the post stations he overtook a convoy of russian wounded the russian officer in charge of the transport lolled back in the front cart shouting and scolding a soldier with coarse abuse in each of the long german carts six or more pale dirty bandaged men were being jolted over the stony road some of them were talking he heard russian words others were eating bread the more severely wounded looked silently with the languid interest of sick children at the envoy hurrying past them 
 prince andrew told his driver to stop and asked a soldier in what action they had been wounded day before yesterday on the danube answered the soldier prince andrew took out his purse and gave the soldier three gold pieces 
 for them all he said to the officer who came up 
 get well soon lads he continued turning to the soldiers plenty to do still 
 what news sir asked the officer evidently anxious to start a conversation 
 good news go on he shouted to the driver and they galloped on 
 it was already quite dark when prince andrew rattled over the paved streets of brunn and found himself surrounded by high buildings the lights of shops houses and street lamps fine carriages and all that atmosphere of a large and active town which is always so attractive to a soldier after camp life despite his rapid journey and sleepless night prince andrew when he drove up to the palace felt even more vigorous and alert than he had done the day before only his eyes gleamed feverishly and his thoughts followed one another with extraordinary clearness and rapidity he again vividly recalled the details of the battle no longer dim but definite and in the concise form concise form in which he imagined himself stating them to the emperor francis he vividly imagined the casual questions that might be put to him and the answers he would give he expected to be at once presented to the emperor at the chief entrance to the palace however an official came running out to meet him and learning that he was a special messenger led him to another entrance 
 to the right from the corridor euer hochgeboren there you will find the adjutant on duty said the official he will conduct you to the minister of war 
 the adjutant on duty meeting prince andrew asked him to wait and went in to the minister of war five minutes later he returned and bowing with particular courtesy ushered prince andrew before him along a corridor to the cabinet where the minister of war was at work the adjutant by his elaborate courtesy appeared to wish to ward off any attempt at familiarity on the part of the russian messenger 
 prince joyous feeling was considerably weakened as he approached the door of the room he felt offended and without his noticing it the feeling of offense immediately turned into one of disdain which was quite uncalled for his fertile mind instantly suggested to him a point of view which gave him a right to despise the adjutant and the minister away from the smell of powder they probably think it easy to gain victories he thought his eyes narrowed disdainfully he entered the room of the minister of war with peculiarly deliberate steps this feeling of disdain was heightened when he saw the minister seated at a large table reading some papers and making pencil notes on them and for the first two or three minutes taking no notice of his arrival a wax candle stood at each side of the bent bald head with its gray temples he went on reading to the end without raising his eyes at the opening of the door and the sound of footsteps 
 take this and deliver it said he to his adjutant handing him the papers and still taking no notice of the special messenger 
 prince andrew felt that either the actions of army interested the minister of war less than any of the other matters he was concerned with or he wanted to give the russian special messenger that impression but that is a matter of perfect indifference to me he thought the minister drew the remaining papers together arranged them evenly and then raised his head he had an intellectual and distinctive head but the instant he turned to prince andrew the firm intelligent expression on his face changed in a way evidently deliberate and habitual to him his face took on the stupid artificial smile which does not even attempt to hide its artificiality of a man who is continually receiving many petitioners one after another 
 from general field marshal kutuzov he asked i hope it is good news there has been an encounter with mortier a victory it was high time 
 he took the dispatch which was addressed to him and began to read it with a mournful expression 
 oh my god my god schmidt he exclaimed in german what a calamity what a calamity 
 having glanced through the dispatch he laid it on the table and looked at prince andrew evidently considering something 
 ah what a calamity you say the affair was decisive but mortier is not captured again he pondered i am very glad you have brought good news though death is a heavy price to pay for the victory his majesty will no doubt wish to see you but not today i thank you you must have a rest be at the levee tomorrow after the parade however i will let you know 
 the stupid smile which had left his face while he was speaking reappeared 
 au revoir thank you very much his majesty will probably desire to see you he added bowing his head 
 when prince andrew left the palace he felt that all the interest and happiness the victory had afforded him had been now left in the indifferent hands of the minister of war and the polite adjutant the whole tenor of his thoughts instantaneously changed the battle seemed the memory of a remote event long past

 chapter 
 
 
 at three in the afternoon all the fashionable world at nice may be seen on the promenade des charming place for the wide walk bordered with palms flowers and tropical shrubs is bounded on one side by the sea on the other by the grand drive lined with hotels and villas while beyond lie orange orchards and the hills many nations are represented many languages spoken many costumes worn and on a sunny day the spectacle is as gay and brilliant as a carnival haughty english lively french sober germans handsome spaniards ugly russians meek jews americans all drive sit or saunter here chatting over the news and criticzing the latest celebrity who has or dickens victor emmanuel or the queen of the sandwich islands the equipages are as varied as the company and attract as much attention especially the low basket barouches in which ladies drive themselves with a pair of dashing ponies gay nets to keep their voluminous flounces from overflowing the diminutive vehicles and little grooms on the perch behind 
 along this walk on christmas day a tall young man walked slowly with his hands behind him and a somewhat absent expression of countenance he looked like an italian was dressed like an englishman and had the independent air of an combination which caused sundry pairs of feminine eyes to look approvingly after him and sundry dandies in black velvet suits with neckties buff gloves and orange flowers in their buttonholes to shrug their shoulders and then envy him his inches there were plenty of pretty faces to admire but the young man took little notice of them except to glance now and then at some blonde girl in blue presently he strolled out of the promenade and stood a moment at the crossing as if undecided whether to go and listen to the band in the jardin publique or to wander along the beach toward castle hill the quick trot of ponies feet made him look up as one of the little carriages containing a single young lady came rapidly down the street the lady was young blonde and dressed in blue he stared a minute then his whole face woke up and waving his hat like a boy he hurried forward to meet her 
 oh laurie is it really you i thought never come cried amy dropping the reins and holding out both hands to the great scandalization of a french mamma who hastened her steps lest she should be demoralized by beholding the free manners of these mad english 
 i was detained by the way but i promised to spend christmas with you and here i am 
 how is your grandfather when did you come where are you staying 
 very the chauvain i called at your hotel but you were out 
 i have so much to say i know where to begin get in and we can talk at our ease i was going for a drive and longing for company saving up for tonight 
 what happens then a ball 
 a christmas party at out hotel there are many americans there and they give it in honor of the day go with us of course aunt will be charmed 
 thank you where now asked laurie leaning back and folding his arms a proceeding which suited amy who preferred to drive for her parasol whip and blue reins over the white ponies backs afforded her infinite satisfaction 
 going to the bankers first for letters and then to castle hill the view is so lovely and i like to feed the peacocks have you ever been there 
 often years ago but i mind having a look at it 
 now tell me all about yourself the last i heard of you your grandfather wrote that he expected you from berlin yes i spent a month there and then joined him in paris where he has settled for the winter he has friends there and finds plenty to amuse him so i go and come and we got on capitally 
 a sociable arrangement said amy missing something in manner though she tell what 
 why you see he hates to travel and i hate to keep still so we each suit ourselves and there is no trouble i am often with him and he enjoys my adventures while i like to feel that someone is glad to see me when i get back from my wanderings dirty old hole it he added with a look of disgust as they drove along the boulevard to the place napoleon in the old city 
 the dirt is picturesque so i mind the river and the hills are delicious and these glimpses of the narrow cross streets are my delight now we shall have to wait for that procession to pass going to the church of st john 
 while laurie listlessly watched the procession of priests under their canopies nuns bearing lighted tapers and some brotherhood in blue chanting as they walked amy watched him and felt a new sort of shyness steal over her for he was changed and she could not find the boy she left in the man beside her he was handsomer than ever and greatly improved she thought but now that the flush of pleasure at meeting her was over he looked tired and sick nor exactly unhappy but older and graver than a year or two of prosperous life should have made him she understand it and did not venture to ask questions so she shook her head and touched up her ponies as the procession wound away across the arches of the paglioni bridge and vanished in the church 
 que she said airing her french which had improved in quantity if not in quality since she came abroad 
 that mademoiselle has made good use of her time and the result is charming replied laurie bowing with his hand on his heart and an admiring look 
 she blushed with pleasure but somehow the compliment did not satisfy her like the blunt praises he used to give her at home when he promenaded round her on festival occasions and tole her she was altogether jolly with a hearty smile and an approving pat on the head she like the new tone for though not blase it sounded indifferent in spite of the look 
 if the way going to grow up i wish stay a boy she thought with a curious sense of disappointment and discomfort trying meantime to seem quite easy and gay 
 at she found the precious home letters and giving the reins to laurie read them luxuriously as they wound up the shady road between green hedges where tea roses bloomed as freshly as in june 
 beth is very poorly mother says i often think i ought to go home but they all say stay so i do for i shall never have another chance like this said amy looking sober over one page 
 i think you are right there you could do nothing at home and it is a great comfort to them to know that you are well and happy and enjoying so much my dear 
 he drew a little nearer and looked more like his old self as he said that and the fear that sometimes weighed on heart was lightened for the look the act the brotherly my dear seemed to assure her that if any trouble did come she would not be alone in a strange land presently she laughed and showed him a small sketch of jo in her scribbling suit with the bow rampantly erect upon her cap and issuing from her mouth the words genius burns 
 laurie smiled took it put it in his vest pocket to keep it from blowing away and listened with interest to the lively letter amy read him 
 this will be a regularly merry christmas to me with presents in the morning you and letters in the afternoon and a party at night said amy as they alighted among the ruins of the old fort and a flock of splendid peacocks came trooping about them tamely waiting to be fed while amy stood laughing on the bank above him as she scattered crumbs to the brilliant birds laurie looked at her as she had looked at him with a natural curiosity to see what changes time and absence had wrought he found nothing to perplex or disappoint much to admire and approve for overlooking a few little affectations of speech and manner she was as sprightly and graceful as ever with the addition of that indescribable something in dress and bearing which we call elegance always mature for her age she had gained a certain aplomb in both carriage and conversation which made her seem more of a woman of the world than she was but her old petulance now and then showed itself her strong will still held its own and her native frankness was unspoiled by foreign polish 
 laurie did not read all this while he watched her feed the peacocks but he saw enough to satisfy and interest him and carried away a pretty little picture of a girl standing in the sunshine which brought out the soft hue of her dress the fresh color of her cheeks the golden gloss of her hair and made her a prominent figure in the pleasant scene 
 as they came up onto the stone plateau that crowns the hill amy waved her hand as if welcoming him to her favorite haunt and said pointing here and there do you remember the cathedral and the corso the fishermen dragging their nets in the bay and the lovely road to villa franca tower just below and best of all that speck far out to sea which they say ils corsica 
 i remember not much changed he answered without enthusiasm 
 what jo would give for a sight of that famous speck said amy feeling in good spirits and anxious to see him so also 
 yes was all he said but he turned and strained his eyes to see the island which a greater usurper than even napoleon now made interesting in his sight 
 take a good look at it for her sake and then come and tell me what you have been doing with yourself all this while said amy seating herself ready for a good talk 
 but she did not get it for though he joined her and answered all her questions freely she could only learn that he had roved about the continent and been to greece so after idling away an hour they drove home again and having paid his respects to mrs carrol laurie left them promising to return in the evening 
 it must be recorded of amy that she deliberately prinked that night time and absence had done its work on both the young people she had seen her old friend in a new light not as our boy but as a handsome and agreeable man and she was conscious of a very natural desire to find favor in his sight amy knew her good points and made the most of them with the taste and skill which is a fortune to a poor and pretty woman 
 tarlatan and tulle were cheap at nice so she enveloped herself in them on such occasions and following the sensible english fashion of simple dress for young girls got up charming little toilettes with fresh flowers a few trinkets and all manner of dainty devices which were both inexpensive and effective it must be confessed that the artist sometimes got possession of the woman and indulged in antique coiffures statuesque attitudes and classic draperies but dear heart we all have out little weaknesses and find it easy to pardon such in the young who satisfy our eyes with their comeliness and keep our hearts merry with their artless vanities 
 i do want him to think i look well and tell them so at home said amy to herself as she put on old white silk ball dress and covered it with a cloud of fresh illusion out of which her white shoulders and golden head emerged with a most artistic effect her hair she had the sense to let alone after gathering up the thick waves and curls into a knot at the back of her head 
 not the fashion but becoming and i afford to make a fright of myself she used to say when advised to frizzle puff or braid as the latest style commanded 
 having no ornaments fine enough for this important occasion amy looped her fleecy skirts with rosy clusters of azalea and framed the white shoulders in delicate green vines remembering the painted boots she surveyed her white satin slippers with girlish satisfaction and chassed down the room admiring her aristocratic feet all by herself 
 my new fan just matches my flowers my gloves fit to a charm and the real lace on mouchoir gives an air to my whole dress if i only had a classical nose and mouth i should be perfectly happy she said surveying herself with a critical eye and a candle in each hand 
 in spite of this affliction she looked unusually gay and graceful as she glided away she seldom did not suit her style she thought for being tall the stately and junoesque was more appropriate than the sportive or piquante she walked up and down the long saloon while waiting for laurie and once arranged herself under the chandelier which had a good effect upon her hair then she thought better of it and went away to the other end of the room as if ashamed of the girlish desire to have the first view a propitious one it so happened that she could not have done a better thing for laurie came in so quietly she did not hear him and as she stood at the distant window with her head half turned and one hand gathering up her dress the slender white figure against the red curtains was as effective as a statue 
 good evening diana said laurie with the look of satisfaction she liked to see in his eyes when they rested on her 
 good evening apollo she answered smiling back at him for he too looked unusually debonair and the thought of entering the ballroom on the arm of such a personable man caused amy to pity the four plain misses davis from the bottom of her heart 
 here are your flowers i arranged them myself remembering that you like what hannah calls a said laurie handing her a delicate nosegay in a holder that she had long coveted as she daily passed it in window 
 how kind you are she exclaimed gratefully if known you were coming have had something ready for you today though not as pretty as this afraid 
 thank you it what it should be but you have improved it he added as she snapped the silver bracelet on her wrist 
 please 
 i thought you liked that sort of thing 
 not from you it sound natural and i like your old bluntness better 
 glad of it he answered with a look of relief then buttoned her gloves for her and asked if his tie was straight just as he used to do when they went to parties together at home 
 the company assembled in the long salle a manger that evening was such as one sees nowhere but on the continent the hospitable americans had invited every acquaintance they had in nice and having no prejudice against titles secured a few to add luster to their christmas ball 
 a russian prince condescended to sit in a corner for an hour and talk with a massive lady dressed like mother in black velvet with a pearl bridle under her chin a polish count aged eighteen devoted himself to the ladies who pronounced him a fascinating dear and a german serene something having come to supper alone roamed vaguely about seeking what he might devour baron private secretary a largenosed jew in tight boots affably beamed upon the world as if his name crowned him with a golden halo a stout frenchman who knew the emperor came to indulge his mania for dancing and lady de jones a british matron adorned the scene with her little family of eight of course there were many american girls handsome english ditto and a few plain but piquante french demoiselles likewise the usual set of traveling young gentlemen who disported themselves gaily while mammas of all nations lined the walls and smiled upon them benignly when they danced with their daughters 
 any young girl can imagine state of mind when she took the stage that night leaning on arm she knew she looked well she loved to dance she felt that her foot was on her native heath in a ballroom and enjoyed the delightful sense of power which comes when young girls first discover the new and lovely kingdom they are born to rule by virtue of beauty youth and womanhood she did pity the davis girls who were awkward plain and destitute of escort except a grim papa and three grimmer maiden aunts and she bowed to them in her friendliest manner as she passed which was good of her as it permitted them to see her dress and burn with curiosity to know who her friend might be with the first burst of the band color rose her eyes began to sparkle and her feet to tap the floor impatiently for she danced well and wanted laurie to know it therefore the shock she received can better be imagined than described when he said in a perfectly tranquil tone do you care to dance 
 one usually does at a ball 
 her amazed look and quick answer caused laurie to repair his error as fast as possible 
 i meant the first dance may i have the honor 
 i can give you one if i put off the count he dances devinely but he will excuse me as you are an old friend said amy hoping that the name would have a good effect and show laurie that she was not to be trifled with nice little boy but rather a short pole to support a daughter of the gods devinely tall and most devinely fair 
 was all the satisfaction she got however 
 the set in which they found themselves was composed of english and amy was compelled to walk decorously through a cotillion feeling all the while as if she could dance the tarantella with relish laurie resigned her to the nice little boy and went to do his duty to flo without securing amy for the joys to come which reprehensible want of forethought was properly punished for she immediately engaged herself till supper meaning to relent if he then gave any signs penitence she showed him her ball book with demure satisfaction when he strolled instead of rushed up to claim her for the next a glorious polka redowa but his polite regrets impose upon her and when she galloped away with the count she saw laurie sit down by her aunt with an actual expression of relief 
 that was unpardonable and amy took no more notice of him for a long while except a word now and then when she came to her chaperon between the dances for a necessary pin or a rest her anger had a good effect however for she hid it under a smiling face and seemed unusually blithe and brilliant eyes followed her with pleasure for she neither romped nor sauntered but danced with spirit and grace making the delightsome pastime what it should be he very naturally fell to studying her from this new point of view and before the evening was half over had decided that little amy was going to make a very charming woman 
 it was a lively scene for soon the spirit of the social season took possession of everyone and christmas merriment made all faces shine hearts happy and heels light the musicians fiddled tooted and banged as if they enjoyed it everybody danced who could and those who admired their neighbors with uncommon warmth the air was dark with davises and many jones gamboled like a flock of young giraffes the golden secretary darted through the room like a meteor with a dashing frenchwoman who carped the floor with her pink satin train the serene teuton found the supper table and was happy eating steadily through the bill of fare and dismayed the garcons by the ravages he committed but the friend covered himself with glory for he danced everything whether he knew it or not and introduced impromptu pirouettes when the figures bewildered him the boyish abandon of that stout man was charming to behold for though he carried weight he danced like an ball he ran he flew he pranced his face glowed his bald head shown his coattails waved wildly his pumps actually twinkled in the air and when the music stopped he wiped the drops from his brow and beamed upon his fellow men like a french pickwick without glasses 
 amy and her pole distinguished themselves by equal enthusiasm but more graceful agility and laurie found himself involuntarily keeping time to the rhythmic rise and fall of the white slippers as they flew by as indefatigably as if winged when little vladimir finally relinquished her with assurances that he was desolated to leave so early she was ready to rest and see how her recreant knight had borne his punishment 
 it had been successful for at blighted affections find a balm in friendly society and young nerves will thrill young blood dance and healthy young spirits rise when subjected to the enchantment of beauty light music and motion laurie had a look as he rose to give her his seat and when he hurried away to bring her some supper she said to herself with a satisfied smile ah i thought that would do him good 
 you look like femme peinte par he said as he fanned her with one hand and held her coffee cup in the other 
 my rouge come off and amy rubbed her brilliant cheek and showed him her white glove with a sober simplicity that made him laugh outright 
 what do you call this stuff he asked touching a fold of her dress that had blown over his knee 
 illusion 
 good name for it very thing it 
 as old as the hills you have seen it on dozens of girls and you never found out that it was pretty till now stupide 
 i never saw it on you before which accounts for the mistake you see 
 none of that it is forbidden rather take coffee than compliments just now no lounge it makes me nervous 
 laurie sat bold upright and meekly took her empty plate feeling an odd sort of pleasure in having little amy order him about for she had lost her shyness now and felt an irrestible desire to trample on him as girls have a delightful way of doing when lords of creation show any signs of subjection 
 where did you learn all this sort of thing he asked with a quizzical look 
 as this sort of thing is rather a vague expression would you kindly explain returned amy knowing perfectly well what he meant but wickedly leaving him to describe what is indescribable 
 general air the style the the know laughed laurie breaking down and helping himself out of his quandary with the new word 
 amy was gratified but of course show it and demurely answered foreign life polishes one in spite of self i study as well as play and as for a little gesture toward her tulle is cheap posies to be had for nothing and i am used to making the most of my poor little things 
 amy rather regretted that last sentence fearing it in good taste but laurie liked her better for it and found himself both admiring and respecting the brave patience that made the most of opportunity and the cheerful spirit that covered poverty with flowers amy did not know why he looked at her so kindly now why he filled up her book with his own name and devoted himself to her for the rest of the evening in the most delightful manner but the impulse that wrought this agreeable change was the result of one of the new impressions which both of them were unconsciously giving and receiving

lionfish nov chapter the beginningcontents prev chapter 
 when he looked back even a month later harry found he had only scattered memories of the next few days it was as though he had been through too much to take in any more the recollections he did have were very painful the worst perhaps was the meeting with the that took place the following morning 
 
 they did not blame him for what had happened on the contrary both thanked him for returning body to them mr diggory sobbed through most of the interview mrs grief seemed to be beyond tears 
 
 he suffered very little then she said when harry had told her how cedric had died and after all amoshe died just when won the tournament he must have been happy 
 
 when they got to their feet she looked down at harry and said you look after yourself now 
 
 harry seized the sack of gold on the bedside table 
 
 you take this he muttered to her it been he got there first you take it 
 
 but she backed away from him 
 
 oh no yours dear i keep it 
 
 
 
 harry returned to gryffindor tower the following evening from what hermione and ron told him dumbledore had spoken to the school that morning at breakfast he had merely requested that they leave harry alone that nobody ask him questions or badger him to tell the story of what had happened in the maze most people he noticed were skirting him in the corridors avoiding his eyes some whispered behind their hands as he passed he guessed that many of them had believed rita article about how disturbed and possibly dangerous he was perhaps they were formulating their own theories about how cedric had died he found he care very much he liked it best when he was with ron and hermione and they were talking about other things or else letting him sit in silence while they played chess he felt as though all three of them had reached an understanding they need to put into words that each was waiting for some sign some word of what was going on outside hogwarts and that it was useless to speculate about what might be coming until they knew anything for certain the only time they touched upon the subject was when ron told harry about a meeting mrs weasley had had with dumbledore before going home 
 
 she went to ask him if you could come straight to us this summer he said but he wants you to go back to the dursleys at least at first 
 
 why said harry 
 
 she said got his reasons said ron shaking his head darkly i suppose got to trust him we 
 
 the only person apart from ron and hermione that harry felt able to talk to was hagrid as there was no longer a defense against the dark arts teacher they had those lessons free they used the one on thursday afternoon to go down and visit hagrid in his cabin it was a bright and sunny day fang bounded out of the open door as they approached barking and wagging his tail madly 
 
 that called hagrid coming to the door harry 
 
 he strode out to meet them pulled harry into a hug ruffled his hair and said good ter see yeh mate good ter see yeh 
 
 they saw two cups and saucers on the wooden table in front of the fireplace when they entered cabin 
 
 bin havin a cuppa with olympe hagrid said jus left 
 
 who said ron curiously 
 
 madame maxime o course said hagrid 
 
 you two made up have you said ron 
 
 dunno what talkin about said hagrid airily fetching more cups from the dresser when he had made tea and offered around a plate of doughy cookies he leaned back in his chair and surveyed harry closely through his eyes

 no not said hagrid course not but yeh will be 
 
 harry said nothing

 hagrid raised his bushy eyebrows at the disbelieving expressions on their faces 
 
 no good sittin worryin abou it he said comin will come an meet it when it does dumbledore told me wha you did harry 
 
 chest swelled as he looked at harry 
 
 yeh did as much as yer father done an i can give yeh no higher praise than that 
 
 harry smiled back at him it was the first time smiled in days dumbledore asked you to do hagrid he asked he sent professor mcgonagall to ask you and madame maxime to meet him that night

 hagrid flinched at the sound of the name 
 
 migh be he said evasively like ter come an visit the las skrewt with me i was jokin jokin he added hastily seeing the looks on their faces 
 
 
 
 it was with a heavy heart that harry packed his trunk up in the dormitory on the night before his return to privet drive he was dreading the leaving feast which was usually a cause for celebration when the winner of the championship would be announced he had avoided being in the great hall when it was full ever since he had left the hospital wing preferring to eat when it was nearly empty to avoid the stares of his fellow students 
 
 when he ron and hermione entered the hall they saw at once that the usual decorations were missing the great hall was normally decorated with the winning colors for the leaving feast tonight however there were black drapes on the wall behind the teachers table harry knew instantly that they were there as a mark of respect to cedric 
 
 the real moody was at the staff table now his wooden leg and his magical eye back in place he was extremely twitchy jumping every time someone spoke to him harry blame him fear of attack was bound to have been increased by his imprisonment in his own trunk professor chair was empty harry wondered as he sat down with the other gryffindors where karkaroff was now and whether voldemort had caught up with him 
 
 madame maxime was still there she was sitting next to hagrid they were talking quietly together further along the table sitting next to professor mcgonagall was snape his eyes lingered on harry for a moment as harry looked at him his expression was difficult to read he looked as sour and unpleasant as ever harry continued to watch him long after snape had looked away 
 
 what was it that snape had done on dumbledores orders the night that voldemort had returned and whywhywas dumbledore so convinced that snape was truly on their side he had been their spy dumbledore had said so in the pensieve snape had turned spy against voldemort at great personal risk was that the job he had taken up again had he made contact with the death eaters perhaps pretended that he had never really gone over to dumbledore that he had been like voldemort himself biding his time 
 
 musings were ended by professor dumbledore who stood up at the staff table the great hall which in any case had been less noisy than it usually was at the leaving feast became very quiet 
 
 the end said dumbledore looking around at them all of another year 
 
 he paused and his eyes fell upon the hufflepuff table theirs had been the most subdued table before he had gotten to his feet and theirs were still the saddest and palest faces in the hall 
 
 there is much that i would like to say to you all tonight said dumbledore but i must first acknowledge the loss of a very fine person who should be sitting here he gestured toward the hufflepuffs enjoying our feast with us i would like you all please to stand and raise your glasses to cedric diggory 
 
 they did it all of them the benches scraped as everyone in the hall stood and raised their goblets and echoed in one loud low rumbling voice cedric diggory 
 
 harry caught a glimpse of cho through the crowd there were tears pouring silently down her face he looked down at the table as they all sat down again 
 
 cedric was a person who exemplified many of the qualities that distinguish hufflepuff house dumbledore continued he was a good and loyal friend a hard worker he valued fair play his death has affected you all whether you knew him well or not i think that you have the right therefore to know exactly how it came about 
 
 harry raised his head and stared at dumbledore 
 
 cedric diggory was murdered by lord voldemort 
 
 a panicked whisper swept the great hall people were staring at dumbledore in disbelief in horror he looked perfectly calm as he watched them mutter themselves into silence 
 
 the ministry of magic dumbledore continued does not wish me to tell you this it is possible that some of your parents will be horrified that i have done so either because they will not believe that lord voldemort has returned or because they think i should not tell you so young as you are it is my belief however that the truth is generally preferable to lies and that any attempt to pretend that cedric died as the result of an accident or some sort of blunder of his own is an insult to his memory 
 
 stunned and frightened every face in the hall was turned toward dumbledore nowor almost every face over at the slytherin table harry saw draco malfoy muttering something to crabbe and goyle harry felt a hot sick swoop of anger in his stomach he forced himself to look back at dumbledore 
 
 there is somebody else who must be mentioned in connection with death dumbledore went on i am talking of course about harry potter 
 
 a kind of ripple crossed the great hall as a few heads turned in direction before flicking back to face dumbledore 
 
 harry potter managed to escape lord voldemort said dumbledore he risked his own life to return body to hogwarts he showed in every respect the sort of bravery that few wizards have ever shown in facing lord voldemort and for this i honor him 
 
 dumbledore turned gravely to harry and raised his goblet once more nearly everyone in the great hall followed suit they murmured his name as they had murmured and drank to him but through a gap in the standing figures harry saw that malfoy crabbe goyle and many of the other slytherins had remained defiantly in their seats their goblets untouched dumbledore who after all possessed no magical eye did not see them 
 
 when everyone had once again resumed their seats dumbledore continued the triwizard aim was to further and promote magical understanding in the light of what has happened of lord return such ties are more important than ever before 
 
 dumbledore looked from madame maxime and hagrid to fleur delacour and her fellow beauxbatons students to viktor krum and the durmstrangs at the slytherin table krum harry saw looked wary almost frightened as though he expected dumbledore to say something harsh 
 
 every guest in this hall said dumbledore and his eyes lingered upon the durmstrang students will be welcomed back here at any time should they wish to come i say to you all once again in the light of lord return we are only as strong as we are united as weak as we are divided lord gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great we can fight it only by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust differences of habit and language are nothing at all if our aims are identical and our hearts are open 
 
 it is my belief and never have i so hoped that i am mistaken that we are all facing dark and difficult times some of you in this hall have already suffered directly at the hands of lord voldemort many of your families have been torn asunder a week ago a student was taken from our midst 
 
 remember cedric remember if the time should come when you have to make a choice between what is right and what is easy remember what happened to a boy who was good and kind and brave because he strayed across the path of lord voldemort remember cedric diggory 
 
 
 
 trunk was packed hedwig was back in her cage on top of it he ron and hermione were waiting in the crowded entrance hall with the rest of the fourth years for the carriages that would take them back to hogsmeade station it was another beautiful day he supposed that privet drive would be hot and leafy its flower beds a riot of color when he arrived there that evening the thought gave him no pleasure at all 
 
 arry 
 
 he looked around fleur delacour was hurrying up the stone steps into the castle beyond her far across the grounds harry could see hagrid helping madame maxime to back two of the giant horses into their harness the beauxbatons carriage was about to take off 
 
 we will see each uzzer again i ope said fleur as she reached him holding out her hand i am oping to get a job ere to improve my eenglish 
 
 very good already said ron in a strangled sort of voice fleur smiled at him hermione scowled 
 
 arry said fleur turning to go it az been a pleasure meeting you 
 
 spirits help but lift slightly as he watched fleur hurry back across the lawns to madame maxime her silvery hair rippling in the sunlight 
 
 wonder how the durmstrang students are getting back said ron d you reckon they can steer that ship without karkaroff 
 
 karkaroff did not steer said a gruff voice he stayed in his cabin and let us do the vork 
 
 krum had come to say to hermione could i have a vord he asked her 
 
 ohyesall right said hermione looking slightly flustered and following krum through the crowd and out of sight 
 
 better hurry up ron called loudly after her the be here in a minute 
 
 he let harry keep a watch for the carriages however and spent the next few minutes craning his neck over the crowd to try and see what krum and hermione might be up to they returned quite soon ron stared at hermione but her face was quite impassive 
 
 i liked diggory said krum abruptly to harry he vos alvays polite to me alvays even though i vos from durmstrang with karkaroff he added scowling 
 
 have you got a new headmaster yet said harry 
 
 krum shrugged he held out his hand as fleur had done shook hand and then ron looked as though he was suffering some sort of painful internal struggle krum had already started walking away when ron burst out can i have your autograph 
 
 hermione turned away smiling at the horseless carriages that were now trundling toward them up the drive as krum looking surprised but gratified signed a fragment of parchment for ron 
 
 
 
 the weather could not have been more different on the journey back to cross than it had been on their way to hogwarts the previous september there a single cloud in the sky harry ron and hermione had managed to get a compartment to themselves pigwidgeon was once again hidden under dress robes to stop him from hooting continually hedwig was dozing her head under her wing and crookshanks was curled up in a spare seat like a large furry ginger cushion harry ron and hermione talked more fully and freely than they had all week as the train sped them southward harry felt as though speech at the leaving feast had unblocked him somehow it was less painful to discuss what had happened now they broke off their conversation about what action dumbledore might be taking even now to stop voldemort only when the lunch trolley arrived 
 
 when hermione returned from the trolley and put her money back into her schoolbag she dislodged a copy of the daily prophet that she had been carrying in there harry looked at it unsure whether he really wanted to know what it might say but hermione seeing him looking at it said calmly nothing in there you can look for yourself but nothing at all been checking every day just a small piece the day after the third task saying you won the tournament they even mention cedric nothing about any of it if you ask me fudge is forcing them to keep quiet 
 
 never keep rita quiet said harry not on a story like this 
 
 oh rita written anything at all since the third task said hermione in an oddly constrained voice as a matter of fact she added her voice now trembling slightly rita skeeter going to be writing anything at all for a while not unless she wants me to spill the beans on her 
 
 what are you talking about said ron 
 
 i found out how she was listening in on private conversations when she supposed to be coming onto the grounds said hermione in a rush 
 
 harry had the impression that hermione had been dying to tell them this for days but that she had restrained herself in light of everything else that had happened 
 
 how was she doing it said harry at once 
 
 how did you find out said ron staring at her 
 
 well it was you really who gave me the idea harry she said 
 
 did i said harry perplexed how 
 
 bugging said hermione happily 
 
 but you said they work 
 
 oh not electronic bugs said hermione no you seerita skeeter voice trembled with quiet triumph is an unregistered animagus she can turn 
 
 hermione pulled a small sealed glass jar out other bag 
 
 into a beetle 
 
 kidding said ron you not 
 
 oh yes she is said hermione happily brandishing the jar at them 
 
 inside were a few twigs and leaves and one large fat beetle 
 
 never kidding ron whispered lifting the jar to his eyes 
 
 no not said hermione beaming i caught her on the windowsill in the hospital wing look very closely and notice the markings around her antennae are exactly like those foul glasses she wears 
 
 harry looked and saw that she was quite right he also remembered something 
 
 there was a beetle on the statue the night we heard hagrid telling madame maxime about his mum 
 
 exactly said hermione and viktor pulled a beetle out of my hair after had our conversation by the lake and unless very much mistaken rita was perched on the windowsill of the divination class the day your scar hurt been buzzing around for stories all year 
 
 when we saw malfoy under that tree said ron slowly 
 
 he was talking to her in his hand said hermione he knew of course how been getting all those nice little interviews with the slytherins they care that she was doing something illegal as long as they were giving her horrible stuff about us and hagrid 
 
 hermione took the glass jar back from ron and smiled at the beetle which buzzed angrily against the glass 
 
 told her let her out when we get back to london said hermione put an unbreakable charm on the jar you see so she transform and told her to keep her quill to herself for a whole year see if she break the habit of writing horrible lies about people 
 
 smiling serenely hermione placed the beetle back inside her schoolbag 
 
 the door of the compartment slid open 
 
 very clever granger said draco malfoy 
 
 crabbe and goyle were standing behind him all three of them looked more pleased with themselves more arrogant and more menacing than harry had ever seen them 
 
 so said malfoy slowly advancing slightly into the compartment and looking slowly around at them a smirk quivering on his lips you caught some pathetic reporter and favorite boy again big deal 
 
 his smirk widened crabbe and goyle leered 
 
 trying not to think about it are we said malfoy softly looking around at all three of them trying to pretend it happened 
 
 get out said harry 
 
 he had not been this close to malfoy since he had watched him muttering to crabbe and goyle during dumbledores speech about cedric he could feel a kind of ringing in his ears his hand gripped his wand under his robes 
 
 picked the losing side potter i warned you i told you you ought to choose your company more carefully remember when we met on the train first day at hogwarts i told you not to hang around with riffraff like this he jerked his head at ron and hermione too late now potter be the first to go now the dark back mudbloods and first well second diggory was the f 
 
 it was as though someone had exploded a box of fireworks within the compartment blinded by the blaze of the spells that had blasted from every direction deafened by a series of bangs harry blinked and looked down at the floor 
 
 malfoy crabbe and goyle were all lying unconscious in the doorway he ron and hermione were on their feet all three of them having used a different hex nor were they the only ones to have done so 
 
 thought see what those three were up to said fred stepping onto goyle and into the compartment he had his wand out and so did george who was careful to tread on malfoy as he followed fred inside 
 
 interesting effect said george looking down at crabbe who used the furnunculus curse 
 
 me said harry 
 
 odd said george lightly i used looks as though those two be mixed he seems to have sprouted little tentacles all over his face well not leave them here they add much to the decor 
 
 ron harry and george kicked rolled and pushed the unconscious malfoy crabbe and goyle each of whom looked distinctly the worse for the jumble of jinxes with which they had been hit out into the corridor then came back into the compartment and rolled the door shut 
 
 exploding snap anyone said fred pulling out a pack of cards 
 
 they were halfway through their fifth game when harry decided to ask them 
 
 you going to tell us then he said to george who you were blackmailing 
 
 oh said george darkly that 
 
 it matter said fred shaking his head impatiently it anything important not now anyway 
 
 given up said george shrugging 
 
 but harry ron and hermione kept on asking and finally fred said all right all right if you really want to knowit was ludo bagman 
 
 bagman said harry sharply are you saying he was involved in 
 
 nah said george gloomily nothing like that stupid git he have the brains 
 
 well what then said ron 
 
 fred hesitated then said you remember that bet we had with him at the quidditch world cup about how ireland would win but krum would get the snitch 
 
 yeah said harry and ron slowly 
 
 well the git paid us in leprechaun gold caught from the irish mascots 
 
 so 
 
 so said fred impatiently it vanished it by next morning it had gone 
 
 but it been an accident it said hermione 
 
 george laughed very bitterly 
 
 yeah what we thought at first we thought if we just wrote to him and told him made a mistake cough up but nothing doing ignored our letter we kept trying to talk to him about it at hogwarts but he was always making some excuse to get away from us 
 
 in the end he turned pretty nasty said fred told us we were too young to gamble and he giving us anything 
 
 so we asked for our money back said george glowering 
 
 he refuse gasped hermione 
 
 right in one said fred 
 
 but that was all your savings said ron 
 
 tell me about it said george course we found out what was going on in the end lee dad had had a bit of trouble getting money off bagman as well turns out in big trouble with the goblins borrowed loads of gold off them a gang of them cornered him in the woods after the world cup and took all the gold he had and it still enough to cover all his debts they followed him all the way to hogwarts to keep an eye on him lost everything gambling got two galleons to rub together and you know how the idiot tried to pay the goblins back 
 
 how said harry 
 
 he put a bet on you mate said fred put a big bet on you to win the tournament bet against the goblins 
 
 so why he kept trying to help me win said harry well i did win i so he can pay you your gold 
 
 nope said george shaking his head the goblins play as dirty as him they say you drew with diggory and bagman was betting win outright so bagman had to run for it he did run for it right after the third task 
 
 george sighed deeply and started dealing out the cards again 
 
 the rest of the journey passed pleasantly enough harry wished it could have gone on all summer in fact and that he would never arrive at crossbut as he had learned the hard way that year time will not slow down when something unpleasant lies ahead and all too soon the hogwarts express was pulling in at platform nine and the usual confusion and noise filled the corridors as the students began to disembark ron and hermione struggled out past malfoy crabbe and goyle carrying their trunks harry however stayed put 
 
 fred george wait a moment 
 
 the twins turned harry pulled open his trunk and drew out his triwizard winnings 
 
 take it he said and he thrust the sack into hands 
 
 what said fred looking flabbergasted 
 
 take it harry repeated firmly i want it 
 
 mental said george trying to push it back at harry 
 
 no not said harry you take it and get inventing for the joke shop 
 
 he is mental fred said in an almost awed voice 
 
 listen said harry firmly if you take it throwing it down the drain i want it and i need it but i could do with a few laughs we could all do with a few laughs got a feeling going to need them more than usual before long 
 
 harry said george weakly weighing the money bag in his hands got to be a thousand galleons in here 
 
 yeah said harry grinning think how many canary creams that is 
 
 the twins stared at him 
 
 just tell your mum where you got italthough she might not be so keen for you to join the ministry anymore come to think of it 
 
 harry fred began but harry pulled out his wand 
 
 look he said flatly take it or hex you i know some good ones now just do me one favor okay buy ron some different dress robes and say from you 
 
 he left the compartment before they could say another word stepping over malfoy crabbe and goyle who were still lying on the floor covered in hex marks 
 
 uncle vernon was waiting beyond the barrier mrs weasley was close by him she hugged harry very tightly when she saw him and whispered in his ear i think dumbledore will let you come to us later in the summer keep in touch harry 
 
 see you harry said ron clapping him on the back 
 
 bye harry said hermione and she did something she had never done before and kissed him on the cheek 
 
 harry thanks george muttered while fred nodded fervently at his side 
 
 harry winked at them turned to uncle vernon and followed him silently from the station there was no point worrying yet he told himself as he got into the back of the dursleys car 
 
 as hagrid had said what would come would comeand he would have to meet it when it did 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire 
 

lionfish nov chapter the lost prophecycontents prev chapter next chapter 
 feet hit solid ground his knees buckled a little and the golden head fell with a resounding clunk to the floor he looked around and saw that he had arrived in office 
 
 everything seemed to have repaired itself during the headmasters absence the delicate silver instruments stood once more on the tables puffing and whirring serenely the portraits of the headmasters and headmistresses were snoozing in their frames heads lolling back in armchairs or against the edge of the picture harry looked through the window there was a cool line of pale green along the horizon dawn was approaching 
 
 the silence and the stillness broken only by the occasional grunt or snuffle of a sleeping portrait was unbearable to him if his surroundings could have reflected the feelings inside him the pictures would have been screaming in pain he walked around the quiet beautiful office breathing quickly trying not to think but he had to think there was no escape 
 
 it was his fault sirius had died it was all his fault if he harry had not been stupid enough to fall for trick if he had not been so convinced that what he had seen in his dream was real if he had only opened his mind to the possibility that voldemort was as hermione had said banking on love of playing the hero 
 
 it was unbearable he would not think about it he could not stand it there was a terrible hollow inside him he did not want to feel or examine a dark hole where sirius had been where sirius had vanished he did not want to have to be alone with that great silent space he could not stand it 
 
 a picture behind him gave a particularly loud grunting snore and a cool voice said ah harry potter 
 
 phineas nigellus gave a long yawn stretching his arms as he surveyed harry out of shrewd narrow eyes 
 
 and what brings you here in the early hours of the morning said phineas eventually this office is supposed to be barred to all but the rightful headmaster or has dumbledore sent you here oh tell me he gave another shuddering yawn another message for my worthless 
 
 harry could not speak phineas nigellus did not know that sirius was dead but harry could not tell him to say it aloud would be to make it final absolute irretrievable 
 
 a few more of the portraits had stirred now terror of being interrogated made harry stride across the room and seize the doorknob 
 
 it would not turn he was shut in 
 
 i hope this means said the corpulent wizard who hung on the wall behind the headmasters desk that dumbledore will soon be back among us 
 
 harry turned the wizard was surveying him with great interest harry nodded he tugged again on the doorknob behind his back but it remained immovable 
 
 oh good said the wizard it has been very dull without him very dull indeed 
 
 he settled himself on the chair on which he had been painted and smiled benignly upon harry 
 
 dumbledore thinks very highly of you as i am sure you know he said comfortably oh yes holds you in great esteem 
 
 the guilt filling the whole of chest like some monstrous weighty parasite now writhed and squirmed harry could not stand this he could not stand being himself any more he had never felt more trapped inside his own head and body never wished so intensely that he could be somebody anybody else 
 
 the empty fireplace burst into emerald green flame making harry leap away from the door staring at the man spinning inside the grate as tall form unfolded itself from the fire the wizards and witches on the surrounding walls jerked awake many of them giving cries of welcome 
 
 thank you said dumbledore softly 
 
 he did not look at harry at first but walked over to the perch beside the door and withdrew from an inside pocket of his robes the tiny ugly featherless fawkes whom he placed gently on the tray of soft ashes beneath the golden post where the fawkes usually stood 
 
 well harry said dumbledore finally turning away from the baby bird you will be pleased to hear that none of your fellow students are going to suffer lasting damage from the events 
 
 harry tried to say good but no sound came out it seemed to him that dumbledore was reminding him of the amount of damage he had caused and although dumbledore was for once looking at him directly and although his expression was kindly rather than accusatory harry could not bear to meet his eyes 
 
 madam pomfrey is patching everybody up said dumbledore nymphadora tonks may need to spend a little time in st mungos but it seems she will make a full recovery 
 
 harry contented himself with nodding at the carpet which was growing lighter as the sky outside grew paler he was sure all the portraits around the room were listening closely to every word dumbledore spoke wondering where dumbledore and harry had been and why there had been injuries 
 
 i know how feeling harry said dumbledore very quietly 
 
 no you said harry and his voice was suddenly loud and strong anger leapt inside him dumbledore knew nothing about his feelings 
 
 you see dumbledore said phineas nigellus slyly never try to understand the students they hate it they would much rather be tragically misunderstood wallow in stew in their own 
 
 enough phineas said dumbledore 
 
 harry turned his back on dumbledore and stared determinedly out of the window he could see the quidditch stadium in the distance sirius had appeared there once disguised as the shaggy black dog so he could watch harry play he had probably come to see whether harry was as good as james had been harry had never asked him 
 
 there is no shame in what you are feeling harry said voice on the contrary the fact that you can feel pain like this is your greatest strength 
 
 harry felt the anger lick his insides blazing in the terrible emptiness filling him with the desire to hurt dumbledore for his calmness and his empty words 
 
 my greatest strength is it said harry his voice shaking as he stared out at the quidditch stadium no longer seeing it you got a clue you know 
 
 what i know asked dumbledore calmly 
 
 it was too much harry turned around shaking with rage 
 
 i want to talk about how i feel all right 
 
 harry suffering like this proves you are still a man this pain is part of being human 
 
 wanttobehuman harry roared and he seized the delicate silver instrument from the table beside him and flung it across the room it shattered into a hundred tiny pieces against the wall several of the pictures let out yells of anger and fright and the portrait of armando dippet said really 
 
 i care harry yelled at them snatching up a lunascope and throwing it into the fireplace had enough seen enough i want out i want it to end i care any more 
 
 he seized the table on which the silver instrument had stood and threw that too it broke apart on the floor and the legs rolled in different directions 
 
 you do care said dumbledore he had not flinched or made a single move to stop harry demolishing his office his expression was calm almost detached you care so much you feel as though you will bleed to death with the pain of it 
 
 harry screamed so loudly that he felt his throat might tear and for a second he wanted to rush at dumbledore and break him too shatter that calm old face shake him hurt him make him feel some tiny part of the horror inside himself 
 
 oh yes you do said dumbledore still more calmly you have now lost your mother your father and the closest thing to a parent you have ever known of course you care 
 
 you know how i feel harry roared youstanding thereyou 
 
 but words were no longer enough smashing things was no more help he wanted to run he wanted to keep running and never look back he wanted to be somewhere he could not see the clear blue eyes staring at him that hatefully calm old face he turned on his heel and ran to the door seized the doorknob again and wrenched at it 
 
 but the door would not open 
 
 harry turned back to dumbledore 
 
 let me out he said he was shaking from head to foot 
 
 no said dumbledore simply 
 
 for a few seconds they stared at each other 
 
 let me out harry said again 
 
 no dumbledore repeated 
 
 if you if you keep me in hereif you let me 
 
 by all means continue destroying my possessions said dumbledore serenely i daresay i have too many 
 
 he walked around his desk and sat down behind it watching harry 
 
 let me out harry said yet again in a voice that was cold and almost as calm as 
 
 not until i have had my say said dumbledore 
 
 do youdo you think i want todo you think i give ai care what got to say harry roared i want to hear anything got to say 
 
 you will said dumbledore steadily because you are not nearly as angry with me as you ought to be if you are to attack me as i know you are close to doing i would like to have thoroughly earned it 
 
 what are you talking 
 
 it is my fault that sirius died said dumbledore clearly or should i say almost entirely my faulti will not be so arrogant as to claim responsibility for the whole sirius was a brave clever and energetic man and such men are not usually content to sit at home in hiding while they believe others to be in danger nevertheless you should never have believed for an instant that there was any necessity for you to go to the department of mysteries tonight if i had been open with you harry as i should have been you would have known a long time ago that voldemort might try and lure you to the department of mysteries and you would never have been tricked into going there tonight and sirius would not have had to come after you that blame lies with me and with me alone 
 
 harry was still standing with his hand on the doorknob but was unaware of it he was gazing at dumbledore hardly breathing listening yet barely understanding what he was hearing 
 
 please sit down said dumbledore it was not an order it was a request 
 
 harry hesitated then walked slowly across the room now littered with silver cogs and fragments of wood and took the seat facing desk 
 
 am i to understand said phineas nigellus slowly from left that my last of the blacksis dead 
 
 yes phineas said dumbledore 
 
 i believe it said phineas brusquely 
 
 harry turned his head in time to see phineas marching out of his portrait and knew that he had gone to visit his other painting in grimmauld place he would walk perhaps from portrait to portrait calling for sirius through the house 
 
 harry i owe you an explanation said dumbledore an explanation of an old mistakes for i see now that what i have done and not done with regard to you bears all the hallmarks of the failings of age youth cannot know how age thinks and feels but old men are guilty if they forget what it was to be young and i seem to have forgotten lately 
 
 the sun was rising properly now there was a rim of dazzling orange visible over the mountains and the sky above it was colourless and bright the light fell upon dumbledore upon the silver of his eyebrows and beard upon the lines gouged deeply into his lace 
 
 i guessed fifteen years ago said dumbledore when i saw the scar on your forehead what it might mean i guessed that it might be the sign of a connection forged between you and voldemort 
 
 told me this before professor said harry bluntly he did not care about being rude he did not care about anything very much any more 
 
 yes said dumbledore apologetically yes but you seeit is necessary to start with your scar for it became apparent shortly after you rejoined the magical world that i was correct and that your scar was giving you warnings when voldemort was close to you or else feeling powerful emotion 
 
 i know said harry wearily 
 
 and this ability of yoursto detect presence even when he is disguised and to know what he is feeling when his emotions are rousedhas become more and more pronounced since voldemort returned to his own body and his full powers 
 
 harry did not bother to nod he knew all of this already 
 
 more recently said dumbledore i became concerned that voldemort might realise that this connection between you exists sure enough there came a time when you entered so far into his mind and thoughts that he sensed your presence i am speaking of course of the night when you witnessed the attack on mr weasley 
 
 yeah snape told me harry muttered 
 
 professor snape harry dumbledore corrected him quietly but did you not wonder why it was not i who explained this to you why i did not teach you occlumency why i had not so much as looked at you for months 
 
 harry looked up he could see now that dumbledore looked sad and tired 
 
 yeah harry mumbled yeah i wondered 
 
 you see dumbledore continued i believed it could not be long before voldemort attempted to force his way into your mind to manipulate and misdirect your thoughts and i was not eager to give him more incentives to do so i was sure that if he realised that our relationship wasor had ever beencloser than that of headmaster and pupil he would seize his chance to use you as a means to spy on me i feared the uses to which he would put you the possibility that he might try and possess you harry i believe i was right to think that voldemort would have made use of you in such a way on those rare occasions when we had close contact i thought i saw a shadow of him stir behind your eyes 
 
 harry remembered the feeling that a dormant snake had risen in him ready to strike in those moments when he and dumbledore had made 
 
 aim in possessing you as he demonstrated tonight would not have been my destruction it would have been yours he hoped when he possessed you briefly a short while ago that i would sacrifice you in the hope of killing him so you see i have been trying in distancing myself from you to protect you harry an old man s mistake 
 
 he sighed deeply harry was letting the words wash over him he would have been so interested to know all this a few months ago but now it was meaningless compared to the gaping chasm inside him that was the loss of sirius none of it mattered 
 
 sirius told me you felt voldemort awake inside you the very night that you had the vision of arthur attack i knew at once that my worst fears were correct voldemort had realised he could use you in an attempt to arm you against assaults on your mind i arranged occlumency lessons with professor snape 
 
 he paused harry watched the sunlight which was sliding slowly across the polished surface of desk illuminate a silver ink pot and a handsome scarlet quill harry could tell that the portraits all around them were awake and listening raptly to explanation he could hear the occasional rustle of robes the slight clearing of a throat phineas nigellus had still not returned 
 
 professor snape discovered dumbledore resumed that you had been dreaming about the door to the department of mysteries for months voldemort of course had been obsessed with the possibility of hearing the prophecy ever since he regained his body and as he dwelled on the door so did you though you did not know what it meant 
 
 and then you saw rookwood who worked in the department of mysteries before his arrest telling voldemort what we had known all alongthat the prophecies held in the ministry of magic are heavily protected only the people to whom they refer can lift them from the shelves without suffering madness in this case either voldemort himself would have to enter the ministry of magic and risk revealing himself at lastor else you would have to take it for him it became a matter of even greater urgency that you should master occlumency 
 
 but i muttered harry he said it aloud to try and ease the dead weight of guilt inside him a confession must surely relieve some of the terrible pressure squeezing his heart i practise i bother i stopped myself having those dreams hermione kept telling me to do it if i had never have been able to show me where to go andsirius 
 
 something was erupting inside head a need to justify himself to explain 
 
 i tried to check really taken sirius i went to office i spoke to kreacher in the fire and he said sirius there he said gone 
 
 kreacher lied said dumbledore calmly you are not his master he could lie to you without even needing to punish himself kreacher intended you to go to the ministry of magic 
 
 hehe sent me on purpose 
 
 oh yes kreacher i am afraid has been serving more than one master for months 
 
 how said harry blankly he been out of grimmauld place for years 
 
 kreacher seized his opportunity shortly before christmas said dumbledore when sirius apparently shouted at him to get out he took sirius at his word and interpreted this as an order to leave the house he went to the only black family member for whom he had any respect left cousin narcissa sister of bellatrix and wife of lucius malfoy 
 
 how do you know all this harry said his heart was beating very fast he felt sick he remembered worrying about odd absence over christmas remembered him turning up again in the attic 
 
 kreacher told me last night said dumbledore you see when you gave professor snape that cryptic warning he realised that you had had a vision of sirius trapped in the bowels of the department of mysteries he like you attempted to contact sirius at once i should explain that members of the order of the phoenix have more reliable methods of communicating than the fire in dolores office professor snape found that sirius was alive and safe in grimmauld place 
 
 when however you did not return from your trip into the forest with dolores umbridge professor snape grew worried that you still believed sirius to be a captive of lord he alerted certain order members at once 
 
 dumbledore heaved a great sigh and continued alastor moody nymphadora tonks kingsley shacklebolt and remus lupin were at headquarters when he made contact all agreed to go to your aid at once professor snape requested that sirius remain behind as he needed somebody to remain at headquarters to tell me what had happened for i was due there at any moment in the meantime he professor snape intended to search the forest for you 
 
 but sirius did not wish to remain behind while the others went to search for you he delegated to kreacher the task of telling me what had happened and so it was that when i arrived in grimmauld place shortly after they had all left for the ministry it was the elf who told melaughing fit to burstwhere sirius had gone 
 
 he was laughing said harry in a hollow voice 
 
 oh yes said dumbledore you see kreacher was not able to betray us totally he is not secret keeper for the order he could not give the our whereabouts or tell them any of the confidential plans that he had been forbidden to reveal he was bound by the enchantments of his kind which is to say that he could not disobey a direct order from his master sirius but he gave narcissa information of the sort that is very valuable to voldemort yet must have seemed much too trivial for sirius to think of banning him from repeating it 
 
 like what said harry 
 
 like the fact that the person sirius cared most about in the world was you said dumbledore quietly like the fact that you were coming to regard sirius as a mixture of father and brother voldemort knew already of course that sirius was in the order and that you knew where he wasbut information made him realise that the one person for whom you would go to any lengths to rescue was sirius black 
 
 lips were cold and numb 
 
 so when i asked kreacher if sirius was there last night 
 
 the undoubtedly on instructionshad told him he must find a way of keeping sirius out of the way once you had seen the vision of sirius being tortured then if you decided to check whether sirius was at home or not kreacher would be able to pretend he was not kreacher injured buckbeak the hippogriff yesterday and at the moment when you made your appearance in the fire sirius was upstairs tending to him 
 
 there seemed to be very little air in lungs his breathing was quick and shallow 
 
 and kreacher told you all this and laughed he croaked 
 
 he did not wish to tell me said dumbledore but i am a sufficiently accomplished legilimens myself to know when i am being lied to and ipersuaded himto tell me the full story before i left for the department of mysteries 
 
 and whispered harry his hands curled in cold fists on his knees and hermione kept telling us to be nice to him 
 
 she was quite right harry said dumbledore i warned sirius when we adopted twelve grimmauld place as our headquarters that kreacher must be treated with kindness and respect i also told him that kreacher could be dangerous to us i do not think sirius took me very seriously or that he ever saw kreacher as a being with feelings as acute as a 
 
 you blame youtalkabout sirius like breath was constricted he could not get the words out properly but the rage that had subsided briefly flared in him again he would not let dumbledore criticise sirius a lyingfoulhe deserved 
 
 kreacher is what he has been made by wizards harry said dumbledore yes he is to be pitied his existence has been as miserable as your friend he was forced to do bidding because sirius was the last of the family to which he was enslaved but he felt no true loyalty to him and whatever faults it must be admitted that sirius did nothing to make lot easier 
 
 talk about sirius like that harry yelled 
 
 he was on his feet again furious ready to fly at dumbledore who had plainly not understood sirius at all how brave he was how much he had suffered 
 
 what about snape harry spat not talking about him are you when i told him voldemort had sirius he just sneered at me as usual 
 
 harry you know professor snape had no choice but to pretend not to take you seriously in front of dolores umbridge said dumbledore steadily but as i have explained he informed the order as soon as possible about what you had said it was he who deduced where you had gone when you did not return from the forest it was he too who gave professor umbridge fake veritaserum when she was attempting to force you to tell her whereabouts 
 
 harry disregarded this he felt a savage pleasure in blaming snape it seemed to be easing his own sense of dreadful guilt and he wanted to hear dumbledore agree with him 
 
 snapesnape g goaded sirius about staying in the househe made out sirius was a coward 
 
 sirius was much too old and clever to have allowed such feeble taunts to hurt him said dumbledore 
 
 snape stopped giving me occlumency lessons harry snarled he threw me out of his office 
 
 i am aware of it said dumbledore heavily i have already said that it was a mistake for me not to teach you myself though i was sure at the time that nothing could have been more dangerous than to open your mind even further to voldemort while in my presence 
 
 snape made it worse my scar always hurt worse after lessons with him harry remembered thoughts on the subject and plunged on how do you know he trying to soften me up for voldemort make it easier for him to get inside my 
 
 i trust severus snape said dumbledore simply but i forgotanother old mistake that some wounds run too deep for the healing i thought professor snape could overcome his feelings about your fatheri was wrong 
 
 but ok is it yelled harry ignoring the scandalised faces and disapproving mutterings of the portraits on the walls ok for snape to hate my dad but not ok for sirius to hate kreacher 
 
 sirius did not hate kreacher said dumbledore he regarded him as a servant unworthy of much interest or notice indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike the fountain we destroyed tonight told a lie we wizards have mistreated and abused our fellows for too long and we are now reaping our reward 
 
 so sirius deserved what he got did he harry yelled 
 
 i did not say that nor will you ever hear me say it dumbledore replied quietly sirius was not a cruel man he was kind to in general he had no love for kreacher because kreacher was a living reminder of the home sirius had hated 
 
 yeah he did hate it said harry his voice cracking turning his back on dumbledore and walking away the sun was bright inside the room now and the eyes of all the portraits followed him as he walked without realising what he was doing without seeing the office at all you made him stay shut up in that house and he hated it why he wanted to get out last night 
 
 i was trying to keep sirius alive said dumbledore quietly 
 
 people like being locked up harry said furiously rounding on him you did it to me all last summer 
 
 dumbledore closed his eyes and buried his face in his hands harry watched him but this uncharacteristic sign of exhaustion or sadness or whatever it was from dumbledore did not soften him on the contrary he felt even angrier that dumbledore was showing signs of weakness he had no business being weak when harry wanted to rage and storm at him 
 
 dumbledore lowered his hands and surveyed harry through his glasses 
 
 it is time he said for me to tell you what i should have told you five years ago harry please sit down i am going to tell you everything i ask only a little patience you will have your chance to rage at meto do whatever you like when i have finished i will not stop you 
 
 harry glared at him for a moment then flung himself back into the chair opposite dumbledore and waited 
 
 dumbledore stared for a moment at the sunlit grounds outside the window then looked back at harry and said five years ago you arrived at hogwarts harry safe and whole as i had planned and intended wellnot quite whole you had suffered i knew you would when i left you on your aunt and doorstep i knew i was condemning you to ten dark and difficult years 
 
 he paused harry said nothing 
 
 you might ask and with good reasonwhy it had to be so why could some wizarding family not have taken you in many would have done so more than gladly would have been honoured and delighted to raise you as a son 
 
 my answer is that my priority was to keep you alive you were in more danger than perhaps anyone but i realised voldemort had been vanquished hours before but his supportersand many of them are almost as terrible as hewere still at large angry desperate and violent and i had to make my decision too with regard to the years ahead did i believe that voldemort was gone for ever no i knew not whether it would be ten twenty or fifty years before he returned but i was sure he would do so and i was sure too knowing him as i have done that he would not rest until he killed you 
 
 i knew that knowledge of magic is perhaps more extensive than any wizard alive i knew that even my most complex and powerful protective spells and charms were unlikely to be invincible if he ever returned to full power 
 
 but i knew too where voldemort was weak and so i made my decision you would be protected by an ancient magic of which he knows which he despises and which he has always therefore underestimatedto his cost i am speaking of course of the fact that your mother died to save you she gave you a lingering protection he never expected a protection that flows in your veins to this day i put my trust therefore in your blood i delivered you to her sister her only remaining relative 
 
 she love me said harry at once she give a damn 
 
 but she took you dumbledore cut across him she may have taken you grudgingly furiously unwillingly bitterly yet still she took you and in doing so she sealed the charm i placed upon you your sacrifice made the bond of blood the strongest shield i could give you 
 
 i still 
 
 while you can still call home the place where your blood dwells there you cannot be touched or harmed by voldemort he shed her blood but it lives on in you and her sister her blood became your refuge you need return there only once a year but as long as you can still call it home whilst you are there he cannot hurt you your aunt knows this i explained what i had done in the letter i left with you on her doorstep she knows that allowing you houseroom may well have kept you alive for the past fifteen years 
 
 wait said harry wait a moment 
 
 he sat up straighter in his chair staring at dumbledore 
 
 you sent that howler you told her to rememberit was your voice 
 
 i thought said dumbledore inclining his head slightly that she might need reminding of the pact she had sealed by taking you i suspected the dementor attack might have awoken her to the dangers of having you as a surrogate son 
 
 it did said harry quietly wellmy uncle more than her he wanted to chuck me out but after the howler came sheshe said i had to stay 
 
 he stared at the floor for a moment then said but this got to do with 
 
 he could not say name 
 
 five years ago then continued dumbledore as though he had not paused in his story you arrived at hogwarts neither as happy nor as as i would have liked perhaps yet alive and healthy you were not a pampered little prince but as normal a boy as i could have hoped under the circumstances thus far my plan was working well 
 
 and then well you will remember the events of your first year at hogwarts quite as clearly as i do you rose magnificently to the challenge that faced you and soonermuch soonerthan i had anticipated you found yourself face to face with voldemort you survived again you did more you delayed his return to full power and strength you fought a fight i was prouder of you than i can say 
 
 yet there was a flaw in this wonderful plan of mine said dumbledore an obvious flaw that i knew even then might be the undoing of it all and yet knowing how important it was that my plan should succeed i told myself that i would not permit this flaw to ruin it i alone could prevent this so i alone must be strong and here was my first test as you lay in the hospital wing weak from your struggle with voldemort 
 
 i understand what saying said harry 
 
 you remember asking me as you lay in the hospital wing why voldemort had tried to kill you when you were a baby 
 
 harry nodded 
 
 ought i to have told you then 
 
 harry stared into the blue eyes and said nothing but his heart was racing again 
 
 you do not see the flaw in the plan yet no perhaps not well as you know i decided not to answer you eleven i told myself was much too young to know i had never intended to tell you when you were eleven the knowledge would be too much at such a young age 
 
 i should have recognised the danger signs then i should have asked myself why i did not feel more disturbed that you had already asked me the question to which i knew one day i must give a terrible answer i should have recognised that i was too happy to think that i did not have to do it on that particular day you were too young much too young 
 
 and so we entered your second year at hogwarts and once again you met challenges even grown wizards have never faced once again you acquitted yourself beyond my wildest dreams you did not ask me again however why voldemort had left that mark on you we discussed your scar oh yes we came very very close to the subject why did i not tell you everything 
 
 well it seemed to me that twelve was after all hardly better than eleven to receive such information i allowed you to leave my presence bloodstained exhausted but exhilarated and if i felt a twinge of unease that i ought perhaps to have told you then it was swiftly silenced you were still so young you see and i could not find it in myself to spoil that night of triumph 
 
 do you see harry do you see the flaw in my brilliant plan now i had fallen into the trap i had foreseen that i had told myself i could avoid that i must avoid 
 
 i 
 
 i cared about you too much said dumbledore simply i cared more for your happiness than your knowing the truth more for your peace of mind than my plan more for your life than the lives that might be lost if the plan failed in other words i acted exactly as voldemort expects we fools who love to act 
 
 is there a defence i defy anyone who has watched you as i haveand i have watched you more closely than you can have imaginednot to want to save you more pain than you had already suffered what did i care if numbers of nameless and faceless people and creatures were slaughtered in the vague future if in the here and now you were alive and well and happy i never dreamed that i would have such a person on my hands 
 
 we entered your third year i watched from afar as you struggled to repel dementors as you found sirius learned what he was and rescued him was i to tell you then at the moment when you had triumphantly snatched your godfather from the jaws of the ministry but now at the age of thirteen my excuses were running out young you might be but you had proved you were exceptional my conscience was uneasy harry i knew the time must come soon 
 
 but you came out of the maze last year having watched cedric diggory die having escaped death so narrowly yourself and i did not tell you though i knew now voldemort had returned i must do it soon and now tonight i know you have long been ready for the knowledge i have kept from you for so long because you have proved that i should have placed the burden upon you before this my only defence is this i have watched you struggling under more burdens than any student who has ever passed through this school and i could not bring myself to add anotherthe greatest one of all 
 
 harry waited but dumbledore did not speak 
 
 i still understand 
 
 voldemort tried to kill you when you were a child because of a prophecy made shortly before your birth he knew the prophecy had been made though he did not know its full contents he set out to kill you when you were still a baby believing he was fulfilling the terms of the prophecy he discovered to his cost that he was mistaken when the curse intended to kill you backfired and so since his return to his body and particularly since your extraordinary escape from him last year he has been determined to hear that prophecy in its entirety this is the weapon he has been seeking so assiduously since his return the knowledge of how to destroy you 
 
 the sun had risen fully now office was bathed in it the glass case in which the sword of godric gryffindor resided gleamed white and opaque the fragments of the instruments harry had thrown to the floor glistened like raindrops and behind him the baby fawkes made soft chirruping noises in his nest of ashes 
 
 the smashed harry said blankly i was pulling neville up those benches in the the room where the archway was and i ripped his robes and it fell 
 
 the thing that smashed was merely the record of the prophecy kept by the department of mysteries but the prophecy was made to somebody and that person has the means of recalling it perfectly 
 
 who heard it asked harry though he thought he knew the answer already 
 
 i did said dumbledore on a cold wet night sixteen years ago in a room above the bar at the head inn i had gone there to see an applicant for the post of divination teacher though it was against my inclination to allow the subject of divination to continue at all the applicant however was the of a very famous very gifted seer and i thought it common politeness to meet her i was disappointed it seemed to me that she had not a trace of the gift herself i told her courteously i hope that i did not think she would be suitable for the post i turned to leave 
 
 dumbledore got to his feet and walked past harry to the black cabinet that stood beside perch he bent down slid back a catch and took from inside it the shallow stone basin carved with runes around the edges in which harry had seen his father tormenting snape dumbledore walked back to the desk placed the pensieve upon it and raised his wand to his own temple from it he withdrew silvery strands of thought clinging to the wand and deposited them into the basin he sat back down behind his desk and watched his thoughts swirl and drift inside the pensieve for a moment then with a sigh he raised his wand and prodded the silvery substance with its tip 
 
 a figure rose out of it draped in shawls her eyes magnified to enormous size behind her glasses and she revolved slowly her feet in the basin but when sybill trelawney spoke it was not in her usual ethereal mystic voice but in the harsh hoarse tones harry had heard her use once before 
 
 the one with the power to vanquish the dark lord approaches born to those who have thrice defied him born as the seventh month dies and the dark lord will mark him as his equal but he will have power the dark lord knows not and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives the one with the power to vanquish the dark lord will be born as the seventh month dies 
 
 the slowly revolving professor trelawney sank back into the silver mass below and vanished 
 
 the silence within the office was absolute neither dumbledore nor harry nor any of the portraits made a sound even fawkes had fallen silent 
 
 professor dumbledore harry said very quietly for dumbledore still staring at the pensieve seemed completely lost in thought it did that mean what did that mean 
 
 it meant said dumbledore that the person who has the only chance of conquering lord voldemort for good was born at the end of july nearly sixteen years ago this boy would be born to parents who had already defied voldemort three times 
 
 harry felt as though something was closing in on him his breathing seemed difficult again 
 
 it meansme 
 
 dumbledore surveyed him for a moment through his glasses 
 
 the odd thing harry he said softly is that it may not have meant you at all prophecy could have applied to two wizard boys both born at the end of july that year both of whom had parents in the order of the phoenix both sets of parents having narrowly escaped voldemort three times one of course was you the other was neville longbottom 
 
 but then but then why was it my name on the prophecy and not 
 
 the official record was after attack on you as a child said dumbledore it seemed plain to the keeper of the hall of prophecy that voldemort could only have tried to kill you because he knew you to be the one to whom sybill was referring 
 
 thenit might not be me said harry 
 
 i am afraid said dumbledore slowly looking as though every word cost him a great effort that there is no doubt that it is you 
 
 but you said neville was born at the end of july tooand his mum and dad 
 
 you are forgetting the next part of the prophecy the final identifying feature of the boy who could vanquish voldemort voldemort himself would mark him as his so he did harry he chose you not neville he gave you the scar that has proved both blessing and curse 
 
 but he might have chosen wrong said harry he might have marked the wrong person 
 
 he chose the boy he thought most likely to be a danger to him said dumbledore and notice this harry he chose not the which according to his creed is the only kind of wizard worth being or knowing but the like himself he saw himself in you before he had ever seen you and in marking you with that scar he did not kill you as he intended but gave you powers and a future which have fitted you to escape him not once but four times so far something that neither your parents nor parents ever achieved 
 
 why did he do it then said harry who felt numb and cold why did he try and kill me as a baby he should have waited to see whether neville or i looked more dangerous when we were older and tried to kill whoever it was then 
 
 that might indeed have been the more practical course said dumbledore except that information about the prophecy was incomplete the head inn which sybill chose for its cheapness has long attracted shall we say a more interesting clientele than the three broomsticks as you and your friends found out to your cost and i to mine that night it is a place where it is never safe to assume you are not being overheard of course i had not dreamed when i set out to meet sybill trelawney that i would hear anything worth overhearing myourone stroke of good fortune was that the eavesdropper was detected only a short way into the prophecy and thrown from the building 
 
 so he only heard 
 
 he heard only the beginning the part foretelling the birth of a boy in july to parents who had thrice defied voldemort consequently he could not warn his master that to attack you would be to risk transferring power to you and marking you as his equal so voldemort never knew that there might be danger in attacking you that it might be wise to wait to learn more he did not know that you would have power the dark lord knows not 
 
 but i said harry in a strangled voice i any powers he got i fight the way he did tonight i possess people oror kill them 
 
 there is a room in the department of mysteries interrupted dumbledore that is kept locked at all times it contains a force that is at once more wonderful and more terrible than death than human intelligence than the forces of nature it is also perhaps the most mysterious of the many subjects for study that reside there it is the power held within that room that you possess in such quantities and which voldemort has not at all that power took you to save sirius tonight that power also saved you from possession by voldemort because he could not bear to reside in a body so full of the force he detests in the end it mattered not that you could not close your mind it was your heart that saved you 
 
 harry closed his eyes if he had not gone to save sirius sirius would not have died more to stave off the moment when he would have to think of sirius again harry asked without caring much about the answer the end of the prophecy it was something about neither can live 
 
 while the other survives said dumbledore 
 
 so said harry dredging up the words from what felt like a deep well of despair inside him so does that mean that that one of us has got to kill the other one in the end 
 
 yes said dumbledore 
 
 for a long time neither of them spoke somewhere far beyond the office walls harry could hear the sound of voices students heading down to the great hall for an early breakfast perhaps it seemed impossible that there could be people in the world who still desired food who laughed who neither knew nor cared that sirius black was gone for ever sirius seemed a million miles away already even now a part of harry still believed that if he had only pulled back that veil he would have found sirius looking back at him greeting him perhaps with his laugh like a bark 
 
 i feel i owe you another explanation harry said dumbledore hesitantly you may perhaps have wondered why i never chose you as a prefect i must confess that i rather thought you had enough responsibility to be going on with 
 
 harry looked up at him and saw a tear trickling down face into his long silver beard 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the bottle neck 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 close to the corner of a street among other abodes of poverty 
 stood an exceedingly tall narrow house which had been so knocked 
 about by time that it seemed out of joint in every direction this 
 house was inhabited by poor people but the deepest poverty was 
 apparent in the garret lodging in the gable in front of the little 
 window an old bent hung in the sunshine which had not even a proper but instead of it the broken neck of a bottle turned upside down and a cork stuck in to make it hold the water with which it was filled an old maid stood at the window she had hung chickweed over the cage and the little linnet which it contained hopped from perch to perch and sang and twittered merrily 
 
 yes all very well for you to sing said the bottle neck 
 that is he did not really speak the words as we do for the neck of a 
 bottle cannot speak but he thought them to himself in his own mind 
 just as people sometimes talk quietly to themselves 
 
 yes you may sing very well you have all your limbs uninjured 
 you should feel what it is like to lose your body and only have a 
 neck and a mouth left with a cork stuck in it as i have you 
 sing then i know after all it is just as well that there 
 are some who can be happy i have no reason to sing nor could i 
 sing now if i were ever so happy but when i was a whole bottle and 
 they rubbed me with a cork i sing then i used to be called 
 a complete lark i remember when i went out to a picnic with the 
 family on the day his daughter was betrothed it seems 
 as if it only happened yesterday i have gone through a great deal 
 in my time when i come to recollect i have been in the fire and in 
 the water i have been deep in the earth and have mounted higher in 
 the air than most other people and now i am swinging here outside 
 a in the air and the sunshine oh indeed it would be 
 worth while to hear my history but i do not speak it aloud for a 
 good reason because i cannot 
 
 then the bottle neck related his history which was really 
 rather remarkable he in fact related it to himself or at least 
 thought it in his own mind the little bird sang his own song merrily 
 in the street below there was driving and running to and fro every 
 one thought of his own affairs or perhaps of nothing at all but 
 the bottle neck thought deeply he thought of the blazing furnace in 
 the factory where he had been blown into life he remembered how 
 hot it felt when he was placed in the heated oven the home from which he sprang and that he had a strong inclination to leap out again 
 directly but after a while it became cooler and he found himself 
 very comfortable he had been placed in a row with a whole regiment 
 of his brothers and sisters all brought out of the same furnace 
 some of them had certainly been blown into champagne bottles and 
 others into beer bottles which made a little difference between them 
 in the world it often happens that a beer bottle may contain the 
 most precious wine and a champagne bottle be filled with blacking 
 but even in decay it may always be seen whether a man has been well 
 born nobility remains noble as a champagne bottle remains the 
 same even with blacking in its interior when the bottles were packed 
 our bottle was packed amongst them it little expected then to 
 finish its career as a bottle neck or to be used as a 
 to a which is after all a place of honor for it is 
 to be of some use in the world the bottle did not behold the light of 
 day again until it was unpacked with the rest in the wine cellar and for the first time rinsed with water which caused some very curious sensations there it lay empty and without a cork and it had a peculiar feeling as if it wanted something it knew not what at last it was filled with rich and costly wine a cork was placed in it and sealed down then it was labelled first quality as if it had carried off the first prize at an examination besides the wine and the bottle were both good and while we are young is the time for poetry there were sounds of song within the bottle of things it could not understand of green sunny mountains where the vines grow and where the merry laugh sing and are merry ah how beautiful is life all these tones of joy and song in the bottle were like the working of a young brain who often knows not the meaning of the tones which are sounding within him 
 one morning the bottle found a purchaser in the apprentice who was told to bring one of the best bottles of wine it was placed in the provision basket with ham and cheese and sausages the sweetest fresh butter and the finest bread were put into the basket by the daughter herself for she packed it she was young and pretty her brown eyes laughed and a smile lingered round her mouth as sweet as that in her eyes she had delicate hands beautifully white and her neck was whiter still it could easily be seen that she was a very lovely girl and as yet she was not engaged the provision basket lay in the lap of the young girl as the family drove out to the forest and the neck of the bottle peeped out from between the folds of the white napkin there was the red wax on the cork and the bottle looked straight at the young face and also at the face of the young sailor who sat near her he was a young friend the son of a portrait painter he had lately passed his examination with honor as mate and the next morning he was to sail in his ship to a distant coast there had been a great deal of talk on this subject while the basket was being packed and during this conversation the eyes and the mouth of the daughter did not wear a very joyful expression the young people wandered away into the green wood and talked together what did they talk about the bottle could not say for he was in the provision basket it remained there a long time but when at last it was brought forth it appeared as if something pleasant had happened for every one was laughing the daughter laughed too but she said very little and her cheeks were like two roses then her father took the bottle and the into his hands what a strange sensation it was to have the cork drawn for the first time the bottle could never after that forget the performance of that moment indeed there was quite a convulsion within him as the cork flew out and a gurgling sound as the wine was poured forth into the glasses 
 long life to the betrothed cried the papa and every glass 
 was emptied to the dregs while the young sailor kissed his 
 beautiful bride 
 
 happiness and blessing to you both said the old 
 and mother and the young man filled the glasses again 
 
 safe return and a wedding this day next year he cried and 
 when the glasses were empty he took the bottle raised it on high and 
 said thou hast been present here on the happiest day of my life 
 thou shalt never be used by others so saying he hurled it high in 
 the air 
 
 the daughter thought she should never see it again 
 but she was mistaken it fell among the rushes on the borders of a 
 little woodland lake the bottle neck remembered well how long it 
 lay there unseen i gave them wine and they gave me muddy water he had said to himself but i suppose it was all well meant he could no longer see the betrothed couple nor the cheerful old people but for a long time he could hear them rejoicing and singing at length 
 there came by two peasant boys who peeped in among the reeds and 
 spied out the bottle then they took it up and carried it home with 
 them so that once more it was provided for at home in their wooden cottage these boys had an elder brother a sailor who was about to start on a long voyage he had been there the day before to say farewell and his mother was now very busy packing up various things for him to take with him on his voyage in the evening his father 
 was going to carry the parcel to the town to see his son once more 
 and take him a farewell greeting from his mother a small bottle had 
 already been filled with herb tea mixed with brandy and wrapped in a 
 parcel but when the boys came in they brought with them a larger 
 and stronger bottle which they had found this bottle would hold so 
 much more than the little one and they all said the brandy would be 
 so good for complaints of the stomach especially as it was mixed with medical herbs the liquid which they now poured into the bottle was not like the red wine with which it had once been filled these were bitter drops but they are of great use the stomach the new large bottle was to go not the little one so the bottle once more started on its travels it was taken on board for peter jensen was one of the crew the very same ship in which the young mate was to sail but the mate did not see the bottle indeed if he had he would not have known it or supposed it was the one out of which they had drunk to the felicity of the betrothed and to the prospect of a marriage on his own happy return certainly the bottle no longer poured forth wine but it contained something quite as good and so it happened that whenever peter jensen brought it out his messmates gave it the name of the apothecary for it contained the best medicine to cure the stomach and he gave it out quite willingly as long as a drop remained those were happy days and the bottle would sing when rubbed with a cork and it was called a great lark peter lark long days and months rolled by during which the bottle stood empty in a corner when a storm arose whether on the passage out or home it could not tell for it had never been ashore it was a terrible storm great waves arose darkly heaving and tossing the vessel to and fro the main mast was split asunder the ship sprang a leak and the pumps became useless while all around was black as night at the last moment when the ship was sinking the young mate wrote on a piece of paper we are going down will be done 
 
 then he wrote the name of his betrothed his own name and that of the ship then he put the leaf in an empty bottle that happened to be at hand corked it down tightly and threw it into the foaming sea he 
 knew not that it was the very same bottle from which the goblet of joy 
 and hope had once been filled for him and now it was tossing on the 
 waves with his last greeting and a message from the dead the ship 
 sank and the crew sank with her but the bottle flew on like a 
 bird for it bore within it a loving letter from a loving heart and 
 as the sun rose and set the bottle felt as at the time of its first 
 existence when in the heated glowing stove it had a longing to fly 
 away it outlived the storms and the calm it struck against no rocks 
 was not devoured by sharks but drifted on for more than a year 
 sometimes towards the north sometimes towards the south just as 
 the current carried it it was in all other ways its own master but 
 even of that one may get tired the written leaf the last farewell of 
 the bridegroom to his bride would only bring sorrow when once it 
 reached her hands but where were those hands so soft and delicate 
 which had once spread the on the fresh grass in the 
 green wood on the day of her betrothal ah yes where was the 
 daughter and where was the land which might lie nearest 
 to her home 
 
 the bottle knew not it travelled onward and onward and at last 
 all this wandering about became wearisome at all events it was not 
 its usual occupation but it had to travel till at length it 
 reached land a foreign country not a word spoken in this country 
 could the bottle understand it was a language it had never before 
 heard and it is a great loss not to be able to understand a language 
 
 the bottle was fished out of the water and examined on all sides 
 the little letter contained within it was discovered taken out and 
 turned and twisted in every direction but the people could not 
 understand what was written upon it they could be quite sure that the bottle had been thrown overboard from a vessel and that something about it was written on this paper but what was written that was the question so the paper was put back into the bottle and then both were put away in a large cupboard of one of the great houses of the town whenever any strangers arrived the paper was taken out and turned over and over so that the address which was only written in pencil became almost illegible and at last no one could distinguish any letters on it at all for a whole year the bottle 
 remained standing in the cupboard and then it was taken up to the 
 loft where it soon became covered with dust and cobwebs ah how 
 often then it thought of those better days of the times when in the 
 fresh green wood it had poured forth rich wine or while rocked 
 by the swelling waves it had carried in its bosom a secret a letter 
 a last parting sigh for full twenty years it stood in the loft and 
 it might have stayed there longer but that the house was going to be 
 rebuilt the bottle was discovered when the roof was taken off they 
 talked about it but the bottle did not understand what they said a 
 language is not to be learnt by living in a loft even for twenty 
 years if i had been down stairs in the room thought the bottle i 
 might have learnt it it was now washed and rinsed which process was really quite necessary and afterwards it looked clean and 
 transparent and felt young again in its old age but the paper 
 which it had carried so faithfully was destroyed in the washing 
 they filled the bottle with seeds though it scarcely knew what had 
 been placed in it then they corked it down tightly and carefully 
 wrapped it up there not even the light of a torch or lantern could 
 reach it much less the brightness of the sun or moon and yet 
 thought the bottle men go on a journey that they may see as much 
 as possible and i can see nothing however it did something quite 
 as important it travelled to the place of its destination and was 
 unpacked 
 
 what trouble they have taken with that bottle over yonder 
 said one and very likely it is broken after all but the bottle 
 was not broken and better still it understood every word that was 
 said this language it had heard at the furnaces and at the wine 
 in the forest and on the ship it was the only good old 
 language it could understand it had returned home and the language 
 was as a welcome greeting for very joy it felt ready to jump out 
 of hands and scarcely noticed that its cork had been 
 drawn and its contents emptied out till it found itself carried to a 
 cellar to be left there and forgotten no place like home 
 even if a cellar it never occurred to him to think that he 
 might lie there for years he felt so comfortable for many long years 
 he remained in the cellar till at last some people came to carry away 
 the bottles and ours amongst the number 
 
 out in the garden there was a great festival brilliant lamps hung 
 in festoons from tree to tree and paper lanterns through which the 
 light shone till they looked like transparent tulips it was a beautiful evening and the weather mild and clear the stars twinkled 
 and the new moon in the form of a crescent was surrounded by the 
 shadowy disc of the whole moon and looked like a gray globe with a 
 golden rim it was a beautiful sight for those who had good eyes 
 
 the illumination extended even to the most retired of the garden 
 walks at least not so retired that any one need lose himself there 
 in the borders were placed bottles each containing a light and among 
 them the bottle with which we are acquainted and whose fate it was 
 one day to be only a bottle neck and to serve as a to 
 a everything here appeared lovely to our bottle for it 
 was again in the green wood amid joy and feasting again it heard 
 music and song and the noise and murmur of a crowd especially in 
 that part of the garden where the lamps blazed and the paper lanterns 
 displayed their brilliant colors it stood in a distant walk certainly but a place pleasant for contemplation and it carried a light and was at once useful and ornamental in such an hour it is easy to forget that one has spent twenty years in a loft and a good thing it is to be able to do so close before the bottle passed a single pair like the bridal pair the mate and the daughter who had so long ago wandered in the wood it seemed to the bottle as if he were living that time over again not only the guests but other people were walking in the garden who were allowed to witness the splendor and the festivities among the latter came an old maid who seemed to be quite alone in the world she was thinking like the bottle of the green wood and of a young betrothed pair who were closely connected with herself she was thinking of that hour the happiest of her life in which she had taken part when she had herself been one of that betrothed pair such hours are never to be forgotten let a maiden be as old as she may but she did not recognize the bottle neither did the bottle notice the old maid and so we often pass each other in the world when we meet as did these two even while together in the same town 
 the bottle was taken from the garden and again sent to a wine 
 merchant where it was once more filled with wine and sold to an 
 aeronaut who was to make an ascent in his balloon on the following 
 sunday a great crowd assembled to witness the sight military music 
 had been engaged and many other preparations made the bottle saw 
 it all from the basket in which he lay close to a live rabbit the 
 rabbit was quite excited because he knew that he was to be taken up 
 and let down again in a parachute the bottle however knew nothing 
 of the up or the down he saw only that the balloon was 
 swelling larger and larger till it could swell no more and began to 
 rise and be restless then the ropes which held it were cut through 
 and the aerial ship rose in the air with the aeronaut and the basket 
 containing the bottle and the rabbit while the music sounded and 
 all the people shouted hurrah 
 
 this is a wonderful journey up into the air thought the bottle 
 
 it is a new way of sailing and here at least there is no fear of 
 striking against anything 
 
 thousands of people gazed at the balloon and the old maid who was 
 in the garden saw it also for she stood at the open window of the 
 garret by which hung the cage containing the linnet who then had 
 no but was obliged to be contented with an old cup in 
 the stood a myrtle in a pot and this had been pushed a 
 little on one side that it might not fall out for the old maid was 
 leaning out of the window that she might see and she did see 
 distinctly the aeronaut in the balloon and how he let down the rabbit 
 in the parachute and then drank to the health of all the spectators 
 in the wine from the bottle after doing this he hurled it high 
 into the air how little she thought that this was the very same 
 bottle which her friend had thrown aloft in her honor on that happy 
 day of rejoicing in the green wood in her youthful days the 
 bottle had no time to think when raised so suddenly and before it 
 was aware it reached the highest point it had ever attained in its 
 life steeples and roofs lay far far beneath it and the people 
 looked as tiny as possible then it began to descend much more rapidly than the rabbit had done made somersaults in the air and felt itself quite young and unfettered although it was half full of wine but 
 this did not last long what a journey it was all the people could 
 see the bottle for the sun shone upon it the balloon was already far 
 away and very soon the bottle was far away also for it fell upon a 
 roof and broke in pieces but the pieces had got such an impetus in 
 them that they could not stop themselves they went jumping and 
 rolling about till at last they fell into the and were 
 broken into still smaller pieces only the neck of the bottle 
 managed to keep whole and it was broken off as clean as if it had 
 been cut with a diamond 
 
 that would make a capital glass said one of the 
 but none of them had either a bird or a cage and it was 
 not to be expected they would provide one just because they had 
 found a bottle neck that could be used as a glass but the old maid 
 who lived in the garret had a bird and it really might be useful to 
 her so the bottle neck was provided with a cork and taken up to her 
 and as it often happens in life the part that had been uppermost was 
 now turned downwards and it was filled with fresh water then they 
 hung it in the cage of the little bird who sang and twittered more 
 merrily than ever 
 
 ah you have good reason to sing said the bottle neck which 
 was looked upon as something very remarkable because it had been in a balloon nothing further was known of its history as it hung there in the it could hear the noise and murmur of the people in 
 the street below as well as the conversation of the old maid in the 
 room within an old friend had just come to visit her and they 
 talked not about the bottle neck but of the myrtle in the window 
 no you must not spend a dollar for your bridal 
 bouquet said the old maid you shall have a beautiful little 
 bunch for a nosegay full of blossoms do you see how splendidly the tree has grown it has been raised from only a little sprig of 
 myrtle that you gave me on the day after my betrothal and from 
 which i was to make my own bridal bouquet when a year had passed 
 but that day never came the eyes were closed which were to have 
 been my light and joy through life in the depths of the sea my 
 beloved sleeps sweetly the myrtle has become an old tree and i am 
 a still older woman before the sprig you gave me faded i took a 
 spray and planted it in the earth and now as you see it has become 
 a large tree and a bunch of the blossoms shall at last appear at a 
 wedding festival in the bouquet of your daughter 
 
 there were tears in the eyes of the old maid as she spoke of 
 the beloved of her youth and of their betrothal in the wood many 
 thoughts came into her mind but the thought never came that quite 
 close to her in that very window was a remembrance of those olden 
 times the neck of the bottle which had as it were shouted for joy 
 when the cork flew out with a bang on the betrothal day but the 
 bottle neck did not recognize the old maid he had not been 
 listening to what she had related perhaps because he was thinking 
 so much about her

 of nature in men 
 nature is often hidden sometimes overcome seldom extinguished force maketh nature more violent in me return doctrine and discourse maketh nature less importune but custom only doth alter and subdue nature he that seeketh victory over his nature let him not set himself too great nor too small tasks for the first will make him dejected by often failings and the second will make him a small proceeder though by often prevailings 
 and at the first let him practise with helps as swimmers do with bladders or rushes but after a time let him practise with disadvantages as dancers do with thick shoes for it breeds great perfection if the practice be harder then the use where nature is mighty and therefore the victory hard the degrees had need be first to stay and arrest nature in time like to him that would say over the four and twenty letters when he was angry then to go less in quantity as if one should in forbearing wine come from drinking healths to a draught at a meal and lastly to discontinue altogether but if a man have the fortitude and resolution to enfranchise himself at once that is the best optimus ille animi vindex laedentia pectus vmcula qui rupit dedoluitque semel 
 neither is the ancient rule amiss to bend nature as a wand to a contrary extreme 
 whereby to set it right understanding it where the contrary extreme is no vice 
 
 let not a man force a habit upon himself with perpetual continuance but with some intermission for both the pause reinforceth the new onset and if a man that is not perfect be ever in practice he shall as well practise his errors as his abilities 
 and induce one habit of both and there is no means to help this but by seasonable 
 intermissions 
 but let not a man trust his victory over his nature too far for nature 
 will lay buried a great time and yet revive upon the occasion or temptation like 
 as it was with damsel turned from a cat to a woman who sat very demurely at the end till a mouse ran before her therefore let a man either avoid the occasion altogether or put himself often to it that he may be little moved with it a nature is best perceived in privateness for there is no affectation in passion for that puttefh a man out of his precepts and in a new case or experiment for there custom leaveth him 
 they are happy men whose natures sort with their vocations otherwise they may say multum incola fuit aruma mea when they converse in those things they do not affect in studies whatsoever a man commandeth upon himself let him set hours for it but whatsoever is agreeable to his nature let him take no care for any set times for his thoughts will fly to it of themselves so as the spaces of other business or studies will suffice a nature runs either to herbs or weeds therefore let him seasonably water the one and destroy the other

 book confide is sometimes to deliver into a power 
 chapter i 
 
 one mother meets another mother 
 there was at montfermeil near paris during the first quarter of this century a sort of which no longer exists this was kept by some people named thenardier husband and wife 
 it was situated in boulanger lane 
 over the door there was a board nailed flat against the wall 
 upon this board was painted something which resembled a man carrying another man on his back the latter wearing the big gilt epaulettes of a general with large silver stars red spots represented blood the rest of the picture consisted of smoke and probably represented a battle below ran this inscription 
 at the sign of sergeant of waterloo au sargent de waterloo 
 nothing is more common than a cart or a truck at the door of a hostelry 
 nevertheless the vehicle or to speak more accurately the fragment of a vehicle which encumbered the street in front of the of the sergeant of waterloo one evening in the spring of would certainly have attracted by its mass the attention of any painter who had passed that way 
 it was the of one of those trucks which are used in wooded tracts of country and which serve to transport thick planks and the trunks of trees 
 this was composed of a massive iron with a pivot into which was fitted a heavy shaft and which was supported by two huge wheels the whole thing was compact overwhelming and misshapen it seemed like the of an enormous cannon 
 the ruts of the road had bestowed on the wheels the fellies the hub the axle and the shaft a layer of mud a hideous yellowish daubing hue tolerably like that with which people are fond of ornamenting cathedrals the wood was disappearing under mud and the iron beneath rust under the hung like drapery a huge chain worthy of some goliath of a convict 
 this chain suggested not the beams which it was its office to transport but the mastodons and mammoths which it might have served to harness it had the air of the galleys but of cyclopean and superhuman galleys and it seemed to have been detached from some monster 
 homer would have bound polyphemus with it and shakespeare caliban 
 why was that of a truck in that place in the street in the first place to encumber the street next in order that it might finish the process of rusting 
 there is a throng of institutions in the old social order which one comes across in this fashion as one walks about outdoors and which have no other reasons for existence than the above 
 the centre of the chain swung very near the ground in the middle and in the loop as in the rope of a swing there were seated and grouped on that particular evening in exquisite interlacement two little girls one about two years and a half old the other eighteen months the younger in the arms of the other 
 a handkerchief cleverly knotted about them prevented their falling out a mother had caught sight of that frightful chain and had said come a plaything for my children 
 the two children who were dressed prettily and with some elegance were radiant with pleasure one would have said that they were two roses amid old iron their eyes were a triumph their fresh cheeks were full of laughter 
 one had chestnut hair the other brown their innocent faces were two delighted surprises a blossoming shrub which grew near wafted to the perfumes which seemed to emanate from them the child of eighteen months displayed her pretty little bare stomach with the chaste indecency of childhood above and around these two delicate heads all made of happiness and steeped in light the gigantic black with rust almost terrible all entangled in curves and wild angles rose in a vault like the entrance of a cavern 
 a few paces apart crouching down upon the threshold of the hostelry the mother not a very prepossessing woman by the way though touching at that moment was swinging the two children by means of a long cord watching them carefully for fear of accidents with that animal and celestial expression which is peculiar to maternity 
 at every backward and forward swing the hideous links emitted a strident sound which resembled a cry of rage the little girls were in ecstasies the setting sun mingled in this joy and nothing could be more charming than this caprice of chance which had made of a chain of titans the swing of cherubim 
 as she rocked her little ones the mother hummed in a discordant voice a romance then celebrated 
 it must be said a warrior 
 her song and the contemplation of her daughters prevented her hearing and seeing what was going on in the street 
 in the meantime some one had approached her as she was beginning the first couplet of the romance and suddenly she heard a voice saying very near her ear 
 you have two beautiful children there madame 
 to the fair and tender imogene 
 replied the mother continuing her romance then she turned her head 
 a woman stood before her a few paces distant 
 this woman also had a child which she carried in her arms 
 she was carrying in addition a large which seemed very heavy 
 this child was one of the most divine creatures that it is possible to behold 
 lt was a girl two or three years of age she could have entered into competition with the two other little ones so far as the coquetry of her dress was concerned she wore a cap of fine linen ribbons on her bodice and valenciennes lace on her cap the folds of her skirt were raised so as to permit a view of her white firm and dimpled leg 
 she was admirably rosy and healthy the little beauty inspired a desire to take a bite from the apples of her cheeks 
 of her eyes nothing could be known except that they must be very large and that they had magnificent lashes she was asleep 
 she slept with that slumber of absolute confidence peculiar to her age 
 the arms of mothers are made of tenderness in them children sleep profoundly 
 as for the mother her appearance was sad and she was dressed like a who is inclined to turn into a peasant again 
 she was young 
 was she handsome 
 perhaps but in that attire it was not apparent 
 her hair a golden lock of which had escaped seemed very thick but was severely concealed beneath an ugly tight close cap tied under the chin 
 a smile displays beautiful teeth when one has them but she did not smile her eyes did not seem to have been dry for a very long time she was pale she had a very weary and rather sickly appearance she gazed upon her daughter asleep in her arms with the air peculiar to a mother who has nursed her own child 
 a large blue handkerchief such as the invalides use was folded into a fichu and concealed her figure clumsily 
 her hands were sunburnt and all dotted with freckles her forefinger was hardened and lacerated with the needle she wore a cloak of coarse brown woollen stuff a linen gown and coarse shoes it was fantine 
 it was fantine but difficult to recognize 
 nevertheless on scrutinizing her attentively it was evident that she still retained her beauty a melancholy fold which resembled the beginning of irony wrinkled her right cheek 
 as for her toilette that aerial toilette of muslin and ribbons which seemed made of mirth of folly and of music full of bells and perfumed with lilacs had vanished like that beautiful and dazzling which is mistaken for diamonds in the sunlight it melts and leaves the branch quite black 
 ten months had elapsed since the pretty farce 
 what had taken place during those ten months 
 it can be divined 
 after abandonment straightened circumstances 
 fantine had immediately lost sight of favourite zephine and dahlia the bond once broken on the side of the men it was loosed between the women they would have been greatly astonished had any one told them a fortnight later that they had been friends there no longer existed any reason for such a thing 
 fantine had remained alone the father of her child such ruptures are irrevocable she found herself absolutely isolated minus the habit of work and plus the taste for pleasure 
 drawn away by her liaison with tholomyes to disdain the pretty trade which she knew she had neglected to keep her market open it was now closed to her 
 she had no resource fantine barely knew how to read and did not know how to write in her childhood she had only been taught to sign her name she had a public indite an epistle to tholomyes then a second then a third 
 tholomyes replied to none of them fantine heard the gossips say as they looked at her child who takes those children seriously 
 one only shrugs shoulders over such children 
 then she thought of tholomyes who had shrugged his shoulders over his child and who did not take that innocent being seriously and her heart grew gloomy toward that man but what was she to do 
 she no longer knew to whom to apply she had committed a fault but the foundation of her nature as will be remembered was modesty and virtue 
 she was vaguely conscious that she was on the verge of falling into distress and of gliding into a worse state 
 courage was necessary she possessed it and held herself firm 
 the idea of returning to her native town of m sur m occurred to her 
 there some one might possibly know her and give her work yes but it would be necessary to conceal her fault 
 in a confused way she perceived the necessity of a separation which would be more painful than the first one her heart contracted but she took her resolution 
 fantine as we shall see had the fierce bravery of life 
 she had already valiantly renounced finery had dressed herself in linen and had put all her silks all her ornaments all her ribbons and all her laces on her daughter the only vanity which was left to her and a holy one it was 
 she sold all that she had which produced for her two hundred francs her little debts paid she had only about eighty francs left 
 at the age of on a beautiful spring morning she quitted paris bearing her child on her back any one who had seen these two pass would have had pity on them this woman had in all the world nothing but her child and the child had in all the world no one but this woman 
 fantine had nursed her child and this had tired her chest and she coughed a little 
 we shall have no further occasion to speak of m felix tholomyes let us confine ourselves to saying that twenty years later under king louis philippe he was a great provincial lawyer wealthy and influential a wise elector and a very severe juryman he was still a man of pleasure 
 towards the middle of the day after having from time to time for the sake of resting herself travelled for three or four sous a league in what was then known as the petites voitures des environs de paris the little suburban coach service fantine found herself at montfermeil in the alley boulanger 
 as she passed the thenardier hostelry the two little girls blissful in the monster swing had dazzled her in a manner and she had halted in front of that vision of joy 
 charms exist 
 these two little girls were a charm to this mother 
 she gazed at them in much emotion 
 the presence of angels is an announcement of paradise 
 she thought that above this inn she beheld the mysterious here of providence 
 these two little creatures were evidently happy 
 she gazed at them she admired them in such emotion that at the moment when their mother was recovering her breath between two couplets of her song she could not refrain from addressing to her the remark which we have just read 
 you have two pretty children madame 
 the most ferocious creatures are disarmed by caresses bestowed on their young 
 the mother raised her head and thanked her and bade the wayfarer sit down on the bench at the door she herself being seated on the threshold 
 the two women began to chat 
 my name is madame thenardier said the mother of the two little girls we keep this inn 
 then her mind still running on her romance she resumed humming between her teeth 
 it must be so i am a knight 
 and i am off to palestine 
 this madame thenardier was a woman thin and angular the type of the wife in all its unpleasantness and what was odd with a languishing air which she owed to her perusal of romances 
 she was a simpering but masculine creature old romances produce that effect when rubbed against the imagination of woman 
 she was still young she was barely thirty if this crouching woman had stood upright her lofty stature and her frame of a perambulating colossus suitable for fairs might have frightened the traveller at the outset troubled her confidence and disturbed what caused what we have to relate to vanish a person who is seated instead of standing hang upon such a thing as that 
 the traveller told her story with slight modifications 
 that she was a that her husband was dead that her work in paris had failed her and that she was on her way to seek it elsewhere in her own native parts that she had left paris that morning on foot that as she was carrying her child and felt fatigued she had got into the villemomble coach when she met it that from villemomble she had come to montfermeil on foot that the little one had walked a little but not much because she was so young and that she had been obliged to take her up and the jewel had fallen asleep 
 at this word she bestowed on her daughter a passionate kiss which woke her 
 the child opened her eyes great blue eyes like her and looked 
 nothing with that serious and sometimes severe air of little children which is a mystery of their luminous innocence in the presence of our twilight of virtue 
 one would say that they feel themselves to be angels and that they know us to be men 
 then the child began to laugh and although the mother held fast to her she slipped to the ground with the unconquerable energy of a little being which wished to run all at once she caught sight of the two others in the swing stopped short and put out her tongue in sign of admiration 
 mother thenardier released her daughters made them descend from the swing and said 
 now amuse yourselves all three of you 
 children become acquainted quickly at that age and at the expiration of a minute the little thenardiers were playing with the at making holes in the ground which was an immense pleasure 
 the was very gay the goodness of the mother is written in the gayety of the child she had seized a scrap of wood which served her for a shovel and energetically dug a cavity big enough for a fly 
 the business becomes a subject for laughter when performed by a child 
 the two women pursued their chat 
 what is your little name 
 cosette 
 for cosette read euphrasie 
 the name was euphrasie but out of euphrasie the mother had made cosette by that sweet and graceful instinct of mothers and of the populace which changes josepha into pepita and francoise into sillette 
 it is a sort of derivative which disarranges and disconcerts the whole science of etymologists 
 we have known a grandmother who succeeded in turning theodore into gnon 
 how old is she 
 she is going on three 
 that is the age of my eldest 
 in the meantime the three little girls were grouped in an attitude of profound anxiety and blissfulness an event had happened a big worm had emerged from the ground and they were afraid and they were in ecstasies over it 
 their radiant brows touched each other one would have said that there were three heads in one aureole 
 how easily children get acquainted at once exclaimed mother thenardier one would swear that they were three sisters 
 this remark was probably the spark which the other mother had been waiting for 
 she seized the hand looked at her fixedly and said 
 will you keep my child for me 
 the thenardier made one of those movements of surprise which signify neither assent nor refusal 
 mother continued 
 you see i cannot take my daughter to the country 
 my work will not permit it 
 with a child one can find no situation people are ridiculous in the country 
 it was the good god who caused me to pass your inn 
 when i caught sight of your little ones so pretty so clean and so happy it overwhelmed me 
 i said here is a good mother 
 that is just the thing that will make three sisters 
 and then it will not be long before i return will you keep my child for me 
 i must see about it replied the thenardier 
 i will give you six francs a month 
 here a voice called from the depths of the 
 not for less than seven francs 
 and six months paid in advance 
 six times seven makes said the thenardier 
 i will give it said the mother 
 and fifteen francs in addition for preliminary expenses added the voice 
 total francs said madame thenardier 
 and she hummed vaguely with these figures 
 it must be said a warrior 
 i will pay it said the mother 
 i have eighty francs 
 i shall have enough left to reach the country by travelling on foot i shall earn money there and as soon as i have a little i will return for my darling 
 the voice resumed 
 the little one has an outfit 
 that is my husband said the thenardier 
 of course she has an outfit the poor understood perfectly that it was your a beautiful outfit too a senseless outfit everything by the dozen and silk gowns like a lady 
 it is here in my 
 you must hand it over struck in the voice again 
 of course i shall give it to you said the mother 
 it would be very queer if i were to leave my daughter quite naked 
 the face appeared 
 good said he 
 the bargain was concluded 
 the mother passed the night at the inn gave up her money and left her child fastened her once more now reduced in volume by the removal of the outfit and light henceforth and set out on the following morning intending to return soon 
 people arrange such departures tranquilly but they are despairs 
 a neighbor of the thenardiers met this mother as she was setting out and came back with the remark 
 i have just seen a woman crying in the street so that it was enough to rend your heart 
 when mother had taken her departure the man said to the woman 
 that will serve to pay my note for one hundred and ten francs which falls due i lacked fifty francs 
 do you know that i should have had a bailiff and a protest after me you played the nicely with your young ones 
 without suspecting it said the woman

 return of the jedi 
 ix 
 
 the two space armadas like their counterparts of another time and floating ship to ship trading broadsides with each other in pointblankconfrontation 
 heroic sometimes suicidal maneuvers marked the day a rebel cruiser itsback alive with fires and explosions limped into direct contact with an imperial stardestroyer before exploding the star destroyer with it cargoships loaded with charge were set on collision courses with theircrews abandoning ships to fates that were uncertain at best 
 lando wedge blue leader and green wing went in to take out one of thelarger main communications ship it had already beendisabled by direct cannonade from the rebel cruiser it had subsequently its damages were the rebels had to strike while it was still lickingits wounds 
 squadron went in prevented thedestroyer from using its bigger guns it also made the fighters invisible until theywere directly visualized 
 increase power on the front deflector shields lando radioed his going in 
 right with you answered wedge close up formations team 
 they went into a perpendicular to the long axis of theimperial drops were hard to track fifty feet from the surface theypulled out at ninety degrees and raced along the gunmetal hull taking laserfire fromevery port 
 starting attack run on the main power tree lando advised 
 i copy answered green wing moving into position 
 stay clear of their front batteries warned blue leader 
 a heavy fire zone down there 
 in range 
 hurt bad on the left of the tower wedge noted concentrate on thatside 
 right with you 
 green wing was hit losing power 
 get clear going to blow 
 green wing took it down like riding a rocket into the front explosions rumbled the port bow 
 thanks blue leader said quietly to the conflagration 
 that opens it up for us yelled wedge cur over the power reactors arejust inside that cargo bay 
 follow me lando called pulling the falcon into a sharp bank that caught thehorrified reactor personnel by surprise wedge and blue followed suit they alldid their worst 
 direct hit lando shouted 
 there she goes 
 pull up pull up 
 they pulled up hard and fast as the destroyer was enveloped in a series explosions until it looked finally just like one more small star blueleader was caught by the shock wave and thrown horribly against the side of asmaller imperial ship which also exploded lando and wedge escaped 
 on the rebel command ship bridge smoke and shouts filled the air 
 ackbar reached calrissian on the comlink the jamming has stopped wehave a reading on the shield 
 is it still up lando responded with desperate anticipation in his voice 
 afraid so it looks like general unit make it 
 until destroyed our last ship still hope replied lando fail he still had to pick off that annoying death star 
 on the death star luke was nearly unconscious beneath the continuing assaultof the lightning tormented beyond reason betaken of a weakness thatdrained his very essence he hoped for nothing more than to submit to the nothingnesstoward which he was drifting 
 the emperor smiled down at the enfeebled young jedi as vader struggled to hisfeet beside his master 
 young fool palpatine rasped at luke only now at the end do youunderstand your puerile skills are no match for the power of the dark side youhave paid a price for your lack of vision now young skywalker you will pay theprice in full you will die 
 he laughed maniacally and although it would not have seemed possible to outpouring of bolts from the fingers actually increased in sound screamed through the room the murderous brightness of the flashes wasoverwhelming 
 body slowed wilted finally crumpled under the hideous barrage hestopped moving altogether at last he appeared totally lifeless the emperorhissed maliciously 
 at that instant vader sprang up and grabbed the emperor from behind upper arms to his torso weaker than ever been vader had lain stillthese last few minutes focusing his every fiber of being on this one only action possible his last if he failed ignoring pain ignoring his shameand his weaknesses ignoring the noise in his head he focused solelyand sightlessly on his will to defeat the evil embodied in the emperor 
 palpatine struggled in the grip of unfeeling embrace his hands stillshooting bolts of malign energy out in all directions in his wild flailing thelightning ripped across the room tearing into vader the dark lord fell currents crackling down his helmet over his cape into his heart 
 vader stumbled with his load to the middle of the bridge over the black chasmleading to the power core he held the wailing despot high over his head and with afinal spasm of strength hurled him into the abyss 
 body still spewing bolts of light spun out of control into the back and forth off the sides of the shaft as it fell it disappeared at last butthen a few seconds later a distant explosion could be heard far down at the core arush of air billowed out the shaft into the throne room 
 the wind whipped at lord cape as he staggered and collapsed towardthe hole trying to follow his master to the end luke crawled to his and pulled the dark lord away from the edge of the chasm to safety 
 both of them lay on the floor entwined in each other too weak to move toomoved to speak 
 inside the bunker on endor imperial controllers watched the main the ewok battle just outside though the image was clogged with static thefighting seemed to be winding down about time since initially been toldthat the locals on this moon were harmless nonbelligerents 
 the interference seemed to another antenna damaged in suddenly a walker pilot appeared on the screen waving excitedly 
 over commander the rebel have been routed and are fleeing with into the woods we need reinforcements to continue the pursuit 
 the bunker personnel all cheered the shield was safe 
 open the main door ordered the commander send three squads to help 
 the bunker door opened the imperial troops came rushing out only to findthemselves surrounded by rebels and ewoks looking bloody and mean theimperial troops surrendered without a fight 
 han chewie and five others ran into the bunker with the explosive placed the timed devices at eleven strategic points in and around the powergenerator then ran out again as fast as they could 
 leia still in great pain from her wounds lay in the sheltered comfort of somedistant bushes she was shouting orders to the ewoks to gather their prisoners onthe far side of the clearing away from the bunker when han and chewie tore for cover in the next moment the bunker went 
 it was a spectacular display explosion after explosion sending a wall of firehundreds of feet into the air creating a shock wave that knocked every living creatureoff its feet and charred all the greenery that faced the clearing 
 the bunker was destroyed 
 a captain ran up to admiral ackbar his voice tremulous sir the shieldaround the death star has lost its power 
 ackbar looked at the the electronically generated web was moon and the death star now floated in black empty unprotected space 
 they did it ackbar whispered 
 he rushed over to the comlink and shouted into the multifrequency war fighters commence attack on the death main reactor the deflectorshield is down repeat the deflector shield is down 
 voice was the next one heard i see it on our way redgroup gold group blue squad all fighters follow me my man my turn 
 the falcon plunged to the surface of the death star followed by hordes ofrebel fighters followed by a but disorganized array of imperial three rebel star cruisers headed for the huge imperial super stardestroyer flagship which seemed to be having difficulties with its guidancesystem 
 lando and the first wave of headed for the unfinished portion of thedeath star skimming low over the curving surface of the completed side 
 stay low until we get to the unfinished side wedge told his squad nobodyneeded to be told 
 squadron of enemy fighters coming 
 blue wing called lando take your group and draw the tie fighters away 
 do what i can 
 picking up interferencethe death jamming us i think 
 more fighters coming at ten 
 the superstructure lando called watch for the main reactor shaft 
 he turned hard into the unfinished side and began weaving dramatically amongprotruding girders towers mazelike channels temporary floodlights the antiaircraft defenses nearly as well developed been depending completely on the deflector shield for the major sources of worry for the rebels were the physical jeopardiesof the structure itself and the imperial tie fighters on their tails 
 i see system wedge radioed going in 
 i see it too agreed lando here goes nothing 
 this going to be easy 
 over a tower and under a suddenly they were flying at top speedinside a deep shaft that was barely wide enough for three fighters wing to it was pierced along its entire twisting length by myriad feeding shaftsand tunnels alternate forks and caverns and spiked in addition with analarming number of obstacles within the shaft itself heavy machinery structuralelements power cables floating stairways barrier piled debris 
 a score of rebel fighters made the first into the power shaft followedby twice that number of ties two lost its right away careening into aderrick to avoid the first volley of laser fire 
 the chase was on 
 where are we going gold leader wedge called out gaily a laserbolt hitthe shaft above him showering his window with sparks 
 lock onto the strongest power source lando suggested it should be thegenerator 
 red wing stay could run out of space real fast 
 they quickly strung out into single and double file as it started becomingapparent that the shaft was not only pocked with and protruding also narrowing across its width at every turn 
 tie fighters hit another rebel who exploded in flames then another tiefighter hit a piece of machinery with a similar result 
 got a reading on a major shaft obstruction ahead lando announced 
 just picked it up will you make it 
 going to be a tight squeeze 
 it was a tight squeeze it was a occluding three fourths of the a dip in the shaft at the same level to make up a little room lando had to spinthe falcon through degrees while rising falling and accelerating luckily and quite as bulky still two more of them make iton the downside the smaller ties drew closer 
 suddenly coarse white static blanketed all the 
 my gone yelled wedge 
 cut speed cautioned lando some kind of power discharge causinginterference 
 switch to visual scanning 
 useless at these have to fly nearly blind 
 two blind hit the wall as the shaft narrowed again a third was blownapart by the gaining imperial fighters 
 green leader called lando 
 copy gold leader 
 split off and head back to the just called for a fighter andyou might draw some fire off us 
 green leader and his cohort peeled off out of the power shaft back up to thecruiser battle one tie fighter followed firing continuously 
 voice came in over the comlink the death star is tuning away fromthe like repositioning to destroy the endor moon 
 how long before in position lando asked 
 point oh three 
 not enough time running out of time 
 wedge broke in the transmission well running out of shaft too 
 at that instant the falcon scraped through an even smaller opening this timeinjuring her auxiliary thrusters 
 that was too close muttered calrissian 
 gdzhng dzn nodded the copilot 
 ackbar stared out the observation window he was looking downonto the deck of the super star destroyer only miles away fires burst over theentire stern and the imperial warship was listing badly to starboard 
 knocked out their forward shields ackbar said into the comlink fireat the bridge 
 green group swooped in low from bottomside up from the death star 
 glad to help out called green leader 
 firing proton torpedoes green wing advised 
 the bridge was hit with kaleidoscopic results a rapid chain reaction got setoff from power station to power station along the middle third of the huge a dazzling rainbow of explosions that buckled the ship at right angles andstarted it spinning like a pinwheel toward the death star 
 the first bridge explosion took greed leader with it the subsequentuncontrolled joyride snagged ten more fighters two cruisers and an ordnance the time the whole exothermic conglomerate finally crashed into the side of thedeath star the impact was momentous enough to actually jolt the battle off internal explosions and thunderings all through its network of and halls 
 for the first time the death star rocked the collision with the explodingdestroyer was only the beginning leading to various systems breakdowns which ledto reactor meltdowns which led to personnel panic abandonment of posts furthermalfunctions and general chaos 
 smoke was everywhere substantial rumblings came from all directions at were running and shouting electrical fires steam explosions cabindepressurizations disruption of added to this the continuedbombardments by rebel fear in the heightenedthe sense of hysteria that was already pervasive 
 for the emperor was dead the central powerful evil that had been thecohesive force to the empire was gone and when the dark side was this diffused was simply where it led 
 confusion 
 desperation 
 damp fear 
 in the midst of this uproar luke had made it somehow to the main he was trying to carry the hulking deadweight of his weakeningbody toward an imperial shuttle halfway there his strength finally gave and he collapsed under the strain 
 slowly he rose again like an automaton he hoisted his body over hisshoulder and stumbled toward one of the last remaining shuttles 
 luke rested his father on the ground trying to collect strength one last time asexplosions grew louder all around them sparks hissed in the rafters one of thewalls buckled and smoke poured through a gaping fissure the floor shook 
 vader motioned luke closer to him luke help me take this mask off 
 luke shook his head die 
 the dark voice was weary nothing can stop that now just once letme face you without it let me look on you with my own eyes 
 luke was afraid afraid to see his father as he really was afraid to see whatperson could have become so same person fathered luke and to know the anakin skywalker who lived inside darth vader 
 vader too was let his son see him to remove this armored mask thathad been between them so long the black armored mask that had been his onlymeans of existing for over twenty years it had been his voice and his breath andhis shield against all human contact but now he would remove he would see his son before he died 
 together they lifted the heavy helmet from the maskportion a complicated breathing apparatus had to be disentangled a speakingmodulator and detached from the power unit in back but when themask was finally off and set aside luke gazed on his face 
 it was the sad benign face of an old man bald beardless with a mighty scarrunning from the top of his head to the back of the scalp he had unfocused eyes and his skin was pasty white for it had not seen the sun in two old man smiled weakly tears glazed his eyes now for a moment he lookednot too unlike ben 
 it was a face full of meanings that luke would forever recall regret he sawmost plainly and shame memories could be seen flashing across itmemoriesof rich times and horrors and love too 
 it was a face that touched the world in a lifetime in saw the wizened nostrils twitch as they tested a first tentative smell he saw thehead tilt imperceptibly to the first time without electronic auditoryamplification luke felt a pang of remorse that the only sounds now to be heardwere those of explosions the only smells the pungent sting of electrical fires was a touch palpable unfiltered 
 he saw the old eyes focus on him tears burned cheeks fell on lips his father smiled at the taste 
 it was a face that had not seen itself in twenty years 
 vader saw his son crying and knew it must have been at the horror of the facethey boy beheld 
 it intensified momentarily own sense of his crimes added guilt at the imagined repugnance of his appearance but then this broughthim to mind of the way he used to and grand with a wry tilt to hisbrow that hinted of invincibility and took in all of life with a wink yes that washow looked once 
 and this memory brought a wave of other memories with it memories ofbrotherhood and home his dear wife the freedom of deep space his friendand how that friendship had turned turned he knew got injected nonetheless with some uncaring virulence that these were memories he wanted none of not now memories ofmolten lava crawling up his backno 
 this boy had pulled him from that now with this act this boy wasgood 
 the boy was good and the boy had come from there must have beengood in him too he smiled up again at his son and for the first time loved for the first time in many long years loved himself again as well 
 suddenly he smelled his nostrils sniffed once that was what it was just blooming it must be spring 
 and there was cocked his head strained his ears yes springthunder for a spring rain to make the flowers bloom 
 yes therehe felt a raindrop on his lips he licked the delicate dropletbutwait it sweetwater it was salty it wasa teardrop 
 he focused on luke once again and saw his son was crying yes that was it hewas tasting his he looked so horrible because he was sohorrible 
 but he wanted to make it all right for luke he wanted luke to know he ugly like this not deep inside not all together with a little he shook his head at luke explaining away the unsightly beast his son beings are we this crude matter 
 luke shook his head tell his father it was all right to dismiss the shame to tell him nothing mattered now and he 
 vader spoke again even inaudible go my son leaveme 
 at that luke found his voice no coming with me not leaveyou here got to save you 
 you already have luke he whispered he wished briefly met yoda tothank the old jedi for the training given lukebut perhaps be with yodasoon now in the ethereal oneness of the force and with 
 father i leave you luke protested explosions jarred the docking bayin earnest crumbling one entire wall splitting the ceiling a jet of blue flame shotfrom a gas nozzle nearby just beneath it the floor began to melt 
 vader pulled luke very close spoke into his ear luke you were rightandyou were right about metell your sisteryou were right 
 with that he closed his eyes and darth 
 a tremendous explosion filled the back of the bay with fire knocking luke flatto the ground slowly he rose again and like an automaton stumbled toward one ofthe last remaining shuttles 
 the millennium falcon continued its swerving race through the labyrinth ofpower channels inching to the hub of the giant main rebel cruisers were unloading a continuous bombardment on the superstructure of the death star now each hit causing a resonatingshudder in the immense battle station and a new series of catastrophic events within 
 commander jerjerrod sat brooding in the control room of the death all about him crumble half of his crew were dead wounded or they hoped to find sanctuary was unclear if not insane the restwandered ineffectually or railed at the enemy ships or fired all their guns at allsectors or shouted orders or focused desperately on a single task as if that wouldsave them or like jerjerrod simply brooded 
 he fathom what done wrong been patient been been clever been hard he was the commander of the greatest battlestation ever built or at least almost built he hated this rebel alliance a hate untempered loved it had been the small boy hecould bully the enraged baby animal he could torture but the boy had grown upnow it knew how to fight back effectively it had broken its bonds 
 jerjerrod hated it now 
 yet there seemed to be little he could do at this point except of could do that it was a small act a token incineratesomething green and living gratuitously meanly toward no end but that of wantondestruction a small act but deliciously satisfying 
 an aide ran up to him the rebel fleet is closing sir 
 concentrate all fire in that sector he answered distractedly a console on thefar wall burst into flame 
 the fighters in the superstructure are eluding our defense system we 
 flood sectors and that should slow them up he arched hiseyebrows at the aide 
 this made little sense to the aide who had cause to wonder at the of the situation but sir 
 what is the rotation factor to firing range on the endor moon 
 the aide checked the compuscreen point oh two to moon target the fleet 
 accelerate rotation until moon is in range and then fire on my mark 
 yes sir the aide pulled a bank of switches rotation accelerating oh one to moon target sir sixty seconds to firing range sir aide saluted put the firing switch in hand as another explosion shookthe control room and ran out the door 
 jerjerrod smiled calmly at the endor was starting to come out ofthe death eclipse he fondled the detonation switch in his hand point oh ohfive to moon target screams erupted in the next room 
 thirty seconds to firing 
 lando was homing in on the reactor core shaft else only wedge was just ahead of him and gold wing just behind several tie fighters stilltrailed 
 these central twistings were barely two planes wide and turned sharply everyfive or ten seconds at the speeds lando was reaching another imperial jet explodedagainst a wall another shot down gold wing 
 and then there were two 
 kept the remaining tie fighters jumping in the narrowspace until at last the main reactor shaft came into view never seen areactor that awesome 
 too big gold leader yelled wedge my proton torpedoes evendent that 
 go for the power regulator on the north tower lando directed take themain reactor carrying concussion should penetrate once ilet them go we have much time to get out of here though 
 already on my way out wedge exclaimed 
 he fired his torpedoes with a corellian hitting both sides of the northtower and peeled off accelerating 
 the falcon waited three dangerous seconds longer then loosed its concussionmissiles with a powerful roar for another second the flash was too bright to seewhat had happened and then the whole reactor began to go 
 direct hit shouted lando now comes the hard part 
 the shaft was already caving in on top of him creating a tunnel effect thefalcon maneuvered through the twisting outlet through walls of flame and throughmoving shafts always just ahead of the continuing chain of explosions 
 wedge tore out of the superstructure at barely sublight speed whipped aroundthe near side of endor and coasted into deep space slowing slowly in a gentle arc toreturn to the safety of the moon 
 a moment later in a destabilized imperial shuttle luke escaped the maindocking bay just as that section began to blow apart completely his wobbling headed for the green sanctuary in the near distance 
 and finally as if being spit out of the very flames of the conflagration themillennium falcon shot toward endor only moments before the death star flaredinto brilliant oblivion like a fulminant supernova 
 han was binding in a when the death star blew itcaptured attention wherever they happened to stormtrooperprisoners rebel final turbulent flash of incandescent inthe evening sky the rebels cheered 
 leia touched cheek he leaned over and kissed her then sat her eyes focused on the starry sky 
 hey he jostled bet luke got off that thing before it blew 
 she nodded he did i can feel it her living presence touchedher through the force she reached out to answer the touch to reassure luke shewas all right everything was all right 
 han looked at her with deep love special love for she was a special princess not by title but by heart her fortitude astounded him yet she heldherself so lightly once wanted whatever he wanted for himself because hewanted it now he wanted everything for her her everythings and one thing hecould see she wanted dearly was luke 
 you really care for him you 
 she nodded scanning the sky he was alive luke was alive and dark dead 
 well listen han went on i understand when he gets back i stand inyour way 
 she squinted at him suddenly aware they were crossing wires having differentconversations what are you talking about she said then she realized what hewas talking about oh no no she laughed not like that at is mybrother 
 han was successively stunned embarrassed and elated this made everythingfine just fine 
 he took her in his arms embraced her lowered her back down into thefernsand being extra careful of her wounded arm lay down there beside her underthe waning glow of the burning star 
 luke stood in a forest clearing before a great pile of logs and branches and robed atop the mound was the lifeless body of darth vader luke set atorch to the kindling 
 as the flames enveloped the corpse smoke rose from the vents in the like a black spirit finally freed luke stared with a fierce sorrow at theconflagration silently he said his last goodbye he alone had believed in thesmall speck of humanity remaining in his father that redemption rose now withthese flames into the night 
 luke followed the blazing embers as they sailed to the sky they mixed his vision with the fireworks the rebel fighters were setting off in victorycelebration and these in turn mingled with the bonfires that speckled the woodsand the ewoks of elation of comfort and triumph he could hear thedrums beating the music weaving in the firelight the cheers of brave cheer was mute as he gazed into the fires of his own victory and loss 
 a huge bonfire blazed in the center of the ewok village square for thecelebration that night rebels and ewoks rejoiced in the warm firelight of the dancing and laughing in the communal language of teebo and artoo had reconciled and were doing a little jig together as othersclapped in time to the music threepio his regal days in this village over wascontent to sit near the spinning little droid who was his best friend in the thanked the maker that captain solo had been able to fix artoo not to mentionmistress a man without protocol solo did have his moments and hethanked the maker this bloody war was over 
 the prisoners had been sent on shuttles to what was left of the rebel star cruisers were dealing with all that up there death star had burned itself out 
 han leia and chewbacca stood off a short way from the revelers theystayed close to each other not talking periodically glancing at the path that led intothe village half waiting half trying not to wait unable to do anything else 
 until at last their patience was rewarded luke and lando exhausted into thelight the friends rushed to greet them they all embraced cheered jumped over and finally just huddled still wordless content with the comfort of touch 
 in a while the two droids sidled over as well to stand beside their dearestcomrades 
 the fuzzy ewoks continued in wild jubilation far into the night while this smallcompany of gallant adventurers watched on from the sidelines 
 for an evanescent moment looking into the bonfire luke thought he saw ben was it his father he drew away from his companions to tryto see what the faces were saying they were ephemeral and spoke only to theshadows of the flames and then disappeared altogether 
 it gave luke a momentary sadness but then leia took his hand and drew himback close to her and to the others back into their circle of warmth and love 
 the empire was dead 
 long live the alliance

 book two 
 chapter x 
 
 prince andrew stayed at brunn with bilibin a russian acquaintance of his in the diplomatic service 
 ah my dear prince i could not have a more welcome visitor said bilibin as he came out to meet prince andrew franz put the things in my bedroom said he to the servant who was ushering bolkonski in so a messenger of victory eh splendid and i am sitting here ill as you see 
 after washing and dressing prince andrew came into the luxurious study and sat down to the dinner prepared for him bilibin settled down comfortably beside the fire 
 after his journey and the campaign during which he had been deprived of all the comforts of cleanliness and all the refinements of life prince andrew felt a pleasant sense of repose among luxurious surroundings such as he had been accustomed to from childhood besides it was pleasant after his reception by the austrians to speak if not in russian for they were speaking french at least with a russian who would he supposed share the general russian antipathy to the austrians which was then particularly strong 
 bilibin was a man of a bachelor and of the same circle as prince andrew they had known each other previously in petersburg but had become more intimate when prince andrew was in vienna with kutuzov just as prince andrew was a young man who gave promise of rising high in the military profession so to an even greater extent bilibin gave promise of rising in his diplomatic career he still a young man but no longer a young diplomat as he had entered the service at the age of sixteen had been in paris and copenhagen and now held a rather important post in vienna both the foreign minister and our ambassador in vienna knew him and valued him he was not one of those many diplomats who are esteemed because they have certain negative qualities avoid doing certain things and speak french he was one of those who liking work knew how to do it and despite his indolence would sometimes spend a whole night at his writing table he worked well whatever the import of his work it was not the question what for but the question how that interested him what the diplomatic matter might be he did not care but it gave him great pleasure to prepare a circular memorandum or report skillfully pointedly and elegantly services were valued not only for what he wrote but also for his skill in dealing and conversing with those in the highest spheres 
 bilibin liked conversation as he liked work only when it could be made elegantly witty in society he always awaited an opportunity to say something striking and took part in a conversation only when that was possible his conversation was always sprinkled with wittily original finished phrases of general interest these sayings were prepared in the inner laboratory of his mind in a portable form as if intentionally so that insignificant society people might carry them from drawing room to drawing room and in fact witticisms were hawked about in the viennese drawing rooms and often had an influence on matters considered important 
 his thin worn sallow face was covered with deep wrinkles which always looked as clean and well washed as the tips of fingers after a russian bath the movement of these wrinkles formed the principal play of expression on his face now his forehead would pucker into deep folds and his eyebrows were lifted then his eyebrows would descend and deep wrinkles would crease his cheeks his small eyes always twinkled and looked out straight 
 well now tell me about your exploits said he 
 bolkonski very modestly without once mentioning himself described the engagement and his reception by the minister of war 
 they received me and my news as one receives a dog in a game of skittles said he in conclusion 
 bilibin smiled and the wrinkles on his face disappeared 
 cependant mon cher he remarked examining his nails from a distance and puckering the skin above his left eye malgre la haute estime que je professe pour the orthodox russian army que votre victoire pas des plus victorieuses 
 but my dear fellow with all my respect for the orthodox russian army i must say that your victory was not particularly victorious 
 he went on talking in this way in french uttering only those words in russian on which he wished to put a contemptuous emphasis 
 come now you with all your forces fall on the unfortunate mortier and his one division and even then mortier slips through your fingers the victory 
 but seriously said prince andrew we can at any rate say without boasting that it was a little better than at ulm 
 why you capture one just one marshal for us 
 because not everything happens as one expects or with the smoothness of a parade we had expected as i told you to get at their rear by seven in the morning but had not reached it by five in the afternoon 
 and why you do it at seven in the morning you ought to have been there at seven in the morning returned bilibin with a smile you ought to have been there at seven in the morning 
 why did you not succeed in impressing on bonaparte by diplomatic methods that he had better leave genoa alone retorted prince andrew in the same tone 
 i know interrupted bilibin thinking very easy to take marshals sitting on a sofa by the fire that is true but still why you capture him so be surprised if not only the minister of war but also his most august majesty the emperor and king francis is not much delighted by your victory even i a poor secretary of the russian embassy do not feel any need in token of my joy to give my franz a thaler or let him go with his liebchen to the prater true we have no prater here 
 he looked straight at prince andrew and suddenly unwrinkled his forehead 
 it is now my turn to ask you why mon cher said bolkonski i confess i do not understand perhaps there are diplomatic subtleties here beyond my feeble intelligence but i make it out mack loses a whole army the archduke ferdinand and the archduke karl give no signs of life and make blunder after blunder kutuzov alone at last gains a real victory destroying the spell of the invincibility of the french and the minister of war does not even care to hear the details 
 just it my dear fellow you see hurrah for the tsar for russia for the orthodox greek faith all that is beautiful but what do we i mean the austrian court care for your victories bring us nice news of a victory by the archduke karl or ferdinand one as good as another as you know and even if it is only over a fire brigade of that will be another story and fire off some cannon but this sort of thing seems done on purpose to vex us the archduke karl does nothing the archduke ferdinand disgraces himself you abandon vienna give up its defense as much as to say heaven is with us but heaven help you and your capital the one general whom we all loved schmidt you expose to a bullet and then you congratulate us on the victory admit that more irritating news than yours could not have been conceived as if it had been done on purpose on purpose besides suppose you did gain a brilliant victory if even the archduke karl gained a victory what effect would that have on the general course of events too late now when vienna is occupied by the french army 
 what occupied vienna occupied 
 not only occupied but bonaparte is at schonbrunn and the count our dear count vrbna goes to him for orders 
 after the fatigues and impressions of the journey his reception and especially after having dined bolkonski felt that he could not take in the full significance of the words he heard 
 count lichtenfels was here this morning bilibin continued and showed me a letter in which the parade of the french in vienna was fully described prince murat et tout le tremblement you see that your victory is not a matter for great rejoicing and that you be received as a savior 
 really i care about that i care at all said prince andrew beginning to understand that his news of the battle before krems was really of small importance in view of such events as the fall of capital how is it vienna was taken what of the bridge and its celebrated bridgehead and prince auersperg we heard reports that prince auersperg was defending vienna he said 
 prince auersperg is on this on our side of the river and is defending us doing it very badly i think but still he is defending us but vienna is on the other side no the bridge has not yet been taken and i hope it will not be for it is mined and orders have been given to blow it up otherwise we should long ago have been in the mountains of bohemia and you and your army would have spent a bad quarter of an hour between two fires 
 but still this does not mean that the campaign is over said prince andrew 
 well i think it is the bigwigs here think so too but they say so it will be as i said at the beginning of the campaign it be your skirmishing at durrenstein or gunpowder at all that will decide the matter but those who devised it said bilibin quoting one of his own mots releasing the wrinkles on his forehead and pausing the only question is what will come of the meeting between the emperor alexander and the king of prussia in berlin if prussia joins the allies hand will be forced and there will be war if not it is merely a question of settling where the preliminaries of the new campo formio are to be drawn up 
 what an extraordinary genius prince andrew suddenly exclaimed clenching his small hand and striking the table with it and what luck the man has 
 buonaparte said bilibin inquiringly puckering up his forehead to indicate that he was about to say something witty buonaparte he repeated accentuating the u i think however now that he lays down laws for austria at schonbrunn il faut lui faire grace de i shall certainly adopt an innovation and call him simply bonaparte 
 we must let him off the u 
 but joking apart said prince andrew do you really think the campaign is over 
 this is what i think austria has been made a fool of and she is not used to it she will retaliate and she has been fooled in the first place because her provinces have been pillaged they say the holy russian army loots terribly her army is destroyed her capital taken and all this for the beaux yeux of his sardinian majesty and therefore this is between ourselves i instinctively feel that we are being deceived my instinct tells me of negotiations with france and projects for peace a secret peace concluded separately 
 fine eyes 
 impossible cried prince andrew that would be too base 
 if we live we shall see replied bilibin his face again becoming smooth as a sign that the conversation was at an end 
 when prince andrew reached the room prepared for him and lay down in a clean shirt on the feather bed with its warmed and fragrant pillows he felt that the battle of which he had brought tidings was far far away from him the alliance with prussia treachery new triumph levee and parade and the audience with the emperor francis occupied his thoughts 
 he closed his eyes and immediately a sound of cannonading of musketry and the rattling of carriage wheels seemed to fill his ears and now again drawn out in a thin line the musketeers were descending the hill the french were firing and he felt his heart palpitating as he rode forward beside schmidt with the bullets merrily whistling all around and he experienced tenfold the joy of living as he had not done since childhood 
 he woke up 
 yes that all happened he said and smiling happily to himself like a child he fell into a deep youthful slumber

 chapter 
 
 
 in france the young girls have a dull time of it till they are married when vive la liberte becomes their motto in america as everyone knows girls early sign the declaration of independence and enjoy their freedom with republican zest but the young matrons usually abdicate with the first heir to the throne and go into a seclusion almost as close as a french nunnery though by no means as quiet whether they like it or not they are virtually put upon the shelf as soon as the wedding excitement is over and most of them might exclaim as did a very pretty woman the other day as handsome as ever but no one takes any notice of me because married 
 not being a belle or even a fashionable lady meg did not experience this affliction till her babies were a year old for in her little world primitive customs prevailed and she found herself more admired and beloved than ever 
 as she was a womanly little woman the maternal instinct was very strong and she was entirely absorbed in her children to the utter exclusion of everything and everybody else day and night she brooded over them with tireless devotion and anxiety leaving john to the tender mercies of the help for an irish lady now presided over the kitchen department being a domestic man john decidedly missed the wifely attentions he had been accustomed to receive but as he adored his babies he cheerfully relinquished his comfort for a time supposing with masculine ignorance that peace would soon be restored but three months passed and there was no return of repose meg looked worn and nervous the babies absorbed every minute of her time the house was neglected and kitty the cook who took life aisy kept him on short commons when he went out in the morning he was bewildered by small commissions for the captive mamma if he came gaily in at night eager to embrace his family he was quenched by a hush they are just asleep after worrying all day if he proposed a little amusement at home no it would disturb the babies if he hinted at a lecture or a concert he was answered with a reproachful look and a decided leave my children for pleasure never his sleep was broken by infant wails and visions of a phantom figure pacing noiselessly to and fro in the watches of the night his meals were interrupted by the frequent flight of the presiding genius who deserted him if a muffled chirp sounded from the nest above and when he read his paper of an evening colic got into the shipping list and fall affected the price of stocks for mrs brooke was only interested in domestic news 
 the poor man was very uncomfortable for the children had bereft him of his wife home was merely a nursery and the perpetual hushing made him feel like a brutal intruder whenever he entered the sacred precincts of babyland he bore it very patiently for six months and when no signs of amendment appeared he did what other paternal exiles to get a little comfort elsewhere scott had married and gone to housekeeping not far off and john fell into the way of running over for an hour or two of an evening when his own parlor was empty and his own wife singing lullabies that seemed to have no end mrs scott was a lively pretty girl with nothing to do but be agreeable and she performed her mission most successfully the parlor was always bright and attractive the chessboard ready the piano in tune plenty of gay gossip and a nice little supper set forth in tempting style 
 john would have preferred his own fireside if it had not been so lonely but as it was he gratefully took the next best thing and enjoyed his society 
 meg rather approved of the new arrangement at first and found it a relief to know that john was having a good time instead of dozing in the parlor or tramping about the house and waking the children but when the teething worry was over and the idols went to sleep at proper hours leaving mamma time to rest she began to miss john and find her workbasket dull company when he was not sitting opposite in his old dressing gown comfortably scorching his slippers on the fender she would not ask him to stay at home but felt injured because he did not know that she wanted him without being told entirely forgetting the many evenings he had waited for her in vain she was nervous and worn out with watching and worry and in that unreasonable frame of mind which the best of mothers occasionally experience when domestic cares oppress them want of exercise robs them of cheerfulness and too much devotion to that idol of american women the teapot makes them feel as if they were all nerve and no muscle 
 yes she would say looking in the glass getting old and ugly john find me interesting any longer so he leaves his faded wife and goes to see his pretty neighbor who has no incumbrances well the babies love me they care if i am thin and pale and time to crimp my hair they are my comfort and some day john will see what gladly sacrificed for them he my precious 
 to which pathetic appeal daisy would answer with a coo or demi with a crow and meg would put by her lamentations for a maternal revel which soothed her solitude for the time being but the pain increased as politics absorbed john who was always running over to discuss interesting points with scott quite unconscious that meg missed him not a word did she say however till her mother found her in tears one day and insisted on knowing what the matter was for drooping spirits had not escaped her observation 
 i tell anyone except you mother but i really do need advice for if john goes on much longer i might as well be widowed replied mrs brooke drying her tears on bib with an injured air 
 goes on how my dear asked her mother anxiously 
 away all day and at night when i want to see him he is continually going over to the scotts it fair that i should have the hardest work and never any amusement men are very selfish even the best of them 
 so are women blame john till you see where you are wrong yourself 
 but it be right for him to neglect me 
 you neglect him 
 why mother i thought take my part 
 so i do as far as sympathizing goes but i think the fault is yours meg 
 i see how 
 let me show you did john ever neglect you as you call it while you made it a point to give him your society of an evening his only leisure time 
 no but i do it now with two babies to tend 
 i think you could dear and i think you ought may i speak quite freely and will you remember that mother who blames as well as mother who sympathizes 
 indeed i will speak to me as if i were little meg again i often feel as if i needed teaching more than ever since these babies look to me for everything 
 meg drew her low chair beside her and with a little interruption in either lap the two women rocked and talked lovingly together feeling that the tie of motherhood made them more one than ever 
 you have only made the mistake that most young wives your duty to your husband in your love for your children a very natural and forgivable mistake meg but one that had better be remedied before you take to different ways for children should draw you nearer than ever not separate you as if they were all yours and john had nothing to do but support them seen it for some weeks but have not spoken feeling sure it would come right in time 
 afraid it if i ask him to stay think jealous and i insult him by such an idea he see that i want him and i know how to tell him without words 
 make it so pleasant he want to go away my dear longing for his little home but it home without you and you are always in the nursery 
 i to be there 
 not all the time too much confinement makes you nervous and then you are unfitted for everything besides you owe something to john as well as to the babies neglect husband for children shut him out of the nursery but teach him how to help in it his place is there as well as yours and the children need him let him feel that he has a part to do and he will do it gladly and faithfully and it will be better for you all 
 you really think so mother 
 i know it meg for tried it and i seldom give advice unless proved its practicability when you and jo were little i went on just as you are feeling as if i do my duty unless i devoted myself wholly to you poor father took to his books after i had refused all offers of help and left me to try my experiment alone i struggled along as well as i could but jo was too much for me i nearly spoiled her by indulgence you were poorly and i worried about you till i fell sick myself then father came to the rescue quietly managed everything and made himself so helpful that i saw my mistake and never have been able to got on without him since that is the secret of our home happiness he does not let business wean him from the little cares and duties that affect us all and i try not to let domestic worries destroy my interest in his pursuits each do our part alone in many things but at home we work together always 
 it is so mother and my great wish is to be to my husband and children what you have been to yours show me how do anything you say 
 you were always my docile daughter well dear if i were you let john have more to do with the management of demi for the boy needs training and none too soon to begin then do what i have often proposed let hannah come and help you she is a capital nurse and you may trust the precious babies to her while you do more housework you need the exercise hannah would enjoy the rest and john would find his wife again go out more keep cheerful as well as busy for you are the of the family and if you get dismal there is no fair weather then try to take an interest in whatever john with him let him read to you exchange ideas and help each other in that way shut yourself up in a bandbox because you are a woman but understand what is going on and educate yourself to take your part in the work for it all affects you and yours 
 john is so sensible afraid he will think stupid if i ask questions about politics and things 
 i believe he would love covers a multitude of sins and of whom could you ask more freely than of him try it and see if he find your society far more agreeable than mrs suppers 
 i will poor john afraid i have neglected him sadly but i thought i was right and he never said anything 
 he tried not to be selfish but he has felt rather forlorn i fancy this is just the time meg when young married people are apt to grow apart and the very time when they ought to be most together for the first tenderness soon wears off unless care is taken to preserve it and no time is so beautiful and precious to parents as the first years of the little lives given to them to train let john be a stranger to the babies for they will do more to keep him safe and happy in this world of trial and temptation than anything else and through them you will learn to know and love one another as you should now dear think over preachment act upon it if it seems good and god bless you all 
 meg did think it over found it good and acted upon it though the first attempt was not made exactly as she planned to have it of course the children tyrannized over her and ruled the house as soon as they found out that kicking and squalling brought them whatever they wanted mamma was an abject slave to their caprices but papa was not so easily subjugated and occasionally afflicted his tender spouse by an attempt at paternal discipline with his obstreperous son for demi inherited a trifle of his firmness of character we call it obstinacy and when he made up his little to have or to do anything all the horses and all the men could not change that pertinacious little mind mamma thought the dear too young to be taught to conquer his prejudices but papa believed that it never was too soon to learn obedience so master demi early discovered that when he undertook to wrastle with parpar he always got the worst of it yet like the englishman baby respected the man who conquered him and loved the father whose grave no no was more impressive than all love pats a few days after the talk with her mother meg resolved to try a social evening with john so she ordered a nice supper set the parlor in order dressed herself prettily and put the children to bed early that nothing should interfere with her experiment but unfortunately most unconquerable prejudice was against going to bed and that night he decided to go on a rampage so poor meg sang and rocked told stories and tried every wile she could devise but all in vain the big eyes shut and long after daisy had gone to byelow like the chubby little bunch of good nature she was naughty demi lay staring at the light with the most discouragingly expression of countenance 
 will demi lie still like a good boy while mamma runs down and gives poor papa his tea asked meg as the hall door softly closed and the step went into the dining room 
 me has tea said demi preparing to join in the revel 
 no but save you some little cakies for breakfast if go like daisy will you lovey 
 iss and demi shut his eyes tight as if to catch sleep and hurry the desired day 
 taking advantage of the propitious moment meg slipped away and ran down to greet her husband with a smiling face and the little blue bow in her hair which was his especial admiration he saw it at once and said with pleased surprise why little mother how gay we are tonight do you expect company 
 only you dear 
 no tired of being dowdy so i dressed up as a change you always make yourself nice for table no matter how tired you are so why i when i have the time 
 i do it out of respect for you my dear said john 
 ditto ditto mr brooke laughed meg looking young and pretty again as she nodded to him over the teapot 
 well altogether delightful and like old times this tastes right i drink your health dear and john sipped his tea with an air of reposeful rapture which was of very short duration however for as he put down his cup the door handle rattled mysteriously and a little voice was heard saying impatiently 
 opy doy tummin 
 that naughty boy i told him to go to sleep alone and here he is downstairs getting his death pattering over that canvas said meg answering the call 
 mornin now announced demi in joyful tone as he entered with his long nightgown gracefully festooned over his arm and every curl bobbing gayly as he pranced about the table eyeing the cakies with loving glances 
 no it morning yet you must go to bed and not trouble poor mamma then you can have the little cake with sugar on it 
 me loves parpar said the artful one preparing to climb the paternal knee and revel in forbidden joys but john shook his head and said to meg 
 if you told him to stay up there and go to sleep alone make him do it or he will never learn to mind you 
 yes of course come demi and meg led her son away feeling a strong desire to spank the little marplot who hopped beside her laboring under the delusion that the bribe was to be administered as soon as they reached the nursery 
 nor was he disappointed for that shortsighted woman actually gave him a lump of sugar tucked him into his bed and forbade any more promenades till morning 
 iss said demi the perjured blissfully sucking his sugar and regarding his first attempt as eminently successful 
 meg returned to her place and supper was progressing pleasantly when the little ghost walked again and exposed the maternal delinquencies by boldly demanding more sudar marmar 
 now this do said john hardening his heart against the engaging little sinner we shall never know any peace till that child learns togo to bed properly you have made a slave of yourself long enough give him one lesson and then there will be an end of it put him in his bed and leave him meg 
 he stay there he never does unless i sit by him 
 manage him demi go upstairs and get into your bed as mamma bids you 
 replied the young rebel helping himself to the coveted cakie and beginning to eat the same with calm audacity 
 you must never say that to papa i shall carry you if you go yourself 
 go way me love parpar and demi retired to his skirts for protection 
 but even that refuge proved unavailing for he was delivered over to the enemy with a be gentle with him john which struck the culprit with dismay for when mamma deserted him then the judgment day was at hand bereft of his cake defrauded of his frolic and borne away by a strong hand to that detested bed poor demi could not restrain his wrath but openly defied papa and kicked and screamed lustily all the way upstairs the minute he was put into bed on one side he rolled out on the other and made for the door only to be ignominiously caught up by the tail of his little toga and put back again which lively performance was kept up till the young strength gave out when he devoted himself to roaring at the top of his voice this vocal exercise usually conquered meg but john sat as unmoved as the post which is popularly believed to be deaf no coaxing no sugar no lullaby no story even the light was put out and only the red glow of the fire enlivened the big dark which demi regarded with curiosity rather than fear this new order of things disgusted him and he howled dismally for marmar as his angry passions subsided and recollections of his tender bondwoman returned to the captive autocrat the plaintive wail which succeeded the passionate roar went to heart and she ran up to say beseechingly 
 let me stay with him be good now john 
 no my dear told him he must go to sleep as you bid him and he must if i stay here all night 
 but cry himself sick pleaded meg reproaching herself for deserting her boy 
 no he so tired he will soon drop off and then the matter is settled for he will understand that he has got to mind interfere manage him 
 my child and i have his spirit broken by harshness 
 my child and i have his temper spoiled by indulgence go down my dear and leave the boy to me 
 when john spoke in that masterful tone meg always obeyed and never regretted her docility 
 please let me kiss him once john 
 certainly demi say good night to mamma and let her go and rest for she is very tired with taking care of you all day 
 meg always insisted upon it that the kiss won the victory for after it was given demi sobbed more quietly and lay quite still at the bottom of the bed whither he had wriggled in his anguish of mind 
 poor little man worn out with sleep and crying cover him up and then go and set heart at rest thought john creeping to the bedside hoping to find his rebellious heir asleep 
 but he for the moment his father peeped at him eyes opened his little chin began to quiver and he put up his arms saying with a penitent hiccough dood now 
 sitting on the stairs outside meg wondered at the long silence which followed the uproar and after imagining all sorts of impossible accidents she slipped into the room to set her fears at rest demi lay fast asleep not in his usual spreadeagle attitude but in a subdued bunch cuddled close in the circle of his arm and holding his finger as if he felt that justice was tempered with mercy and had gone to sleep a sadder and wiser baby so held john had waited with a womanly patience till the little hand relaxed its hold and while waiting had fallen asleep more tired by that tussle with his son than with his whole work 
 as meg stood watching the two faces on the pillow she smiled to herself and then slipped away again saying in a satisfied tone i never need fear that john will be too harsh with my babies he does know how to manage them and will be a great help for demi is getting too much for me 
 when john came down at last expecting to find a pensive or reproachful wife he was agreeably surprised to find meg placidly trimming a bonnet and to be greeted with the request to read something about the election if he was not too tired john saw in a minute that a revolution of some kind was going on but wisely asked no questions knowing that meg was such a transparent little person she keep a secret to save her life and therefore the clue would soon appear he read a long debate with the most amiable readiness and then explained it in his most lucid manner while meg tried to look deeply interested to ask intelligent questions and keep her thoughts from wandering from the state of the nation to the state of her bonnet in her secret soul however she decided that politics were as bad as mathematics and the the mission of politicians seemed to be calling each other names but she kept these feminine ideas to herself and when john paused shook her head and said with what she thought diplomatic ambiguity well i really see what we are coming to 
 john laughed and watched her for a minute as she poised a pretty little preparation of lace and flowers on her hand and regarded it with the genuine interest which his harangue had failed to waken 
 she is trying to like politics for my sake so try and like millinery for hers only fair thought john the just adding aloud very pretty is it what you call a breakfast cap 
 my dear man a bonnet my very best bonnet 
 i beg your pardon it was so small i naturally mistook it for one of the flyaway things you sometimes wear how do you keep it on 
 these bits of lace are fastened under the chin with a rosebud so and meg illustrated by putting on the bonnet and regarding him with an air of calm satisfaction that was irresistible 
 a love of a bonnet but i prefer the face inside for it looks young and happy again and john kissed the smiling face to the great detriment of the rosebud under the chin 
 glad you like it for i want you to take me to one of the new concerts some night i really need some music to put me in tune will you please 
 of course i will with all my heart or anywhere else you like you have been shut up so long it will do you no end of good and i shall enjoy it of all things what put it into your head little mother 
 well i had a talk with marmee the other day and told her how nervous and cross and out of sorts i felt and she said i needed change and less care so hannah is to help me with the children and to see to things about the house more and now and then have a little fun just to keep me from getting to be a fidgety old woman before my time only an experiment john and i want to try it for your sake as much as for mine because neglected you shamefully lately and going to make home what it used to be if i can you object i hope 
 never mind what john said or what a very narrow escape the little bonnet had from utter ruin all that we have any business to know is that john did not appear to object judging from the changes which gradually took place in the house and its inmates it was not all paradise by any means but everyone was better for the division of labor system the children throve under the paternal rule for accurate stedfast john brought order and obedience into babydom while meg recovered her spirits and composed her nerves by plenty of wholesome exercise a little pleasure and much confidential conversation with her sensible husband home grew homelike again and john had no wish to leave it unless he took meg with him the scotts came to the brookes now and everyone found the little house a cheerful place full of happiness content and family love even sallie moffatt liked to go there it is always so quiet and pleasant here it does me good meg she used to say looking about her with wistful eyes as if trying to discover the charm that she might use it in her great house full of splendid lonliness for there were no riotous babies there and ned lived in a world of lis own where there was no place for her 
 this household happiness did not come all at once but john and meg had found the key to it and each year of married life taught them how to use it unlocking the treasuries of real home love and mutual helpfulness which the poorest may possess and the richest cannot buy this is the sort of shelf on which young wives and mothers may consent to be laid safe from the restless fret and fever of the world finding loyal lovers in the little sons and daughters who cling to them undaunted by sorrow poverty or age walking side by side through fair and stormy weather with a faithful friend who is in the true sense of the good old saxon word the and learning as meg learned that a happiest kingdom is home her highest honor the art of ruling it not as a queen but as a wise wife and mother

lionfish nov chapter the second war beginscontents prev chapter 
 he who must not be named returns 
 in a brief statement on friday night minister for magic cornelius fudge confirmed that has returned to this country and is once more active 
 
 it is with great regret that i must confirm that the wizard styling himself lordwell you know who i meanis alive and among us again said fudge looking tired and flustered as he addressed reporters it is with almost equal regret that we report the mass revolt of the dementors of azkaban who have shown themselves averse to continuing in the employ we believe the dementors are currently taking direction from lord thingy 
 
 we urge the magician population to remain vigilant the ministry is currently publishing guides to elementary home and personal defence which will be delivered free to all wizarding homes within the coming month 
 
 the statement was met with dismay and alarm from the wizarding community which as recently as last wednesday was receiving ministry assurances that there was no truth whatsoever in these persistent rumours that is operating amongst us once more 
 
 details of the events that led to the ministry turnaround are still hazy though it is believed that he who must not be named and a select band of followers known as death eaters gained entry to the ministry of magic itself on thursday evening 
 
 albus dumbledore newly reinstated headmaster of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry reinstated member of the international confederation of wizards and reinstated chief warlock of the wizengamot has so far been unavailable for comment he has insisted over the past year that is not dead as was widely hoped and believed but is recruiting followers once more for afresh attempt to seize power meanwhile the boy who lived 
 
 there you are harry i knew drag you into it somehow said hermione looking over the top of the paper at him 
 
 they were in the hospital wing harry was sitting on the end of bed and they were both listening to hermione read the front page of the sunday whose ankle had been mended in a trice by madam pomfrey was curled up at the foot of bed neville whose nose had likewise been returned to its normal size and shape was in a chair between the two beds and luna who had dropped in to visit clutching the latest edition of the quibbler was reading the magazine and apparently not taking in a word hermione was saying 
 
 the boy who lived again now though he said ron darkly not such a deluded any more eh 
 
 he helped himself to a handful of chocolate frogs from the immense pile on his bedside cabinet threw a few to harry ginny and neville and ripped off the wrapper of his own with his teeth there were still deep welts on his forearms where the tentacles had wrapped around him according to madam pomfrey thoughts could leave deeper scarring than almost anything else though since she had started applying copious amounts of dr oblivious unction there seemed to have been some improvement 
 
 yes very complimentary about you now harry said hermione scanning down the article a lone voice of truth perceived as unbalanced yet never wavered in his story forced to bear ridicule and slander hmmm she said frowning i notice they mention the fact that it was them doing all the ridiculing and slandering in the prophet 
 
 she winced slightly and put a hand to her ribs the curse dolohov had used on her though less effective than it would have been had he been able to say the incantation aloud had nevertheless caused in madam words quite enough damage to be going on with hermione was having to take ten different types of potion every day was improving greatly and was already bored with the hospital wing 
 
 last attempt to take over pages two to jour what the ministry should have told us page five why nobody listened to albus dumbledore pages six to eight exclusive interview with harry potter page nine well said hermione folding up the newspaper and throwing it aside certainly given them lots to write about and that interview with harry exclusive the one that was in the quibbler months ago 
 
 daddy sold it to them said luna vaguely turning a page of the got a very good price for it too so going to go on an expedition to sweden this summer to see if we can catch a snorkack 
 
 hermione seemed to struggle with herself for a moment then said that sounds lovely 
 
 ginny caught eye and looked away quickly grinning 
 
 so anyway said hermione sitting up a little straighter and wincing again going on in school 
 
 well got rid of fred and swamp said ginny he did it in about three seconds but he left a tiny patch under the window and roped it off 
 
 why said hermione looking startled 
 
 oh he just says it was a really good bit of magic said ginny shrugging 
 
 i think he left it as a monument to fred and george said ron through a mouthful of chocolate they sent me all these you know he told harry pointing at the small mountain of frogs beside him must be doing all right out of that joke shop eh 
 
 hermione looked rather disapproving and asked so has all the trouble stopped now back 
 
 yes said neville settled right back to normal 
 
 i filch is happy is he asked ron propping a chocolate frog card featuring dumbledore against his water jug 
 
 not at all said ginny really really miserable actually she lowered her voice to a whisper he keeps saying umbridge was the best thing that ever happened to hogwarts 
 
 all six of them looked around professor umbridge was lying in a bed opposite them gazing up at the ceiling dumbledore had strode alone into the forest to rescue her from the centaurs how he had done ithow he had emerged from the trees supporting professor umbridge without so much as a scratch on himnobody knew and umbridge was certainly not telling since she had returned to the castle she had not as far as any of them knew uttered a single word nobody really knew what was wrong with her either her usually neat mousy hair was very untidy and there were still bits of twigs and leaves in it but otherwise she seemed to be quite unscathed 
 
 madam pomfrey says just in shock whispered hermione 
 
 sulking more like said ginny 
 
 yeah she shows signs of life if you do this said ron and with his tongue he made soft noises umbridge sat bolt upright looking around wildly 
 
 anything wrong professor called madam pomfrey poking her head around her office door 
 
 no no said umbridge sinking back into her pillows no i must have been dreaming 
 
 hermione and ginny muffled their laughter in the bedclothes 
 
 speaking of centaurs said hermione when she had recovered a little divination teacher now is firenze staying 
 
 got to said harry the other centaurs take him back will they 
 
 it looks like he and trelawney are both going to teach said ginny 
 
 bet dumbledore wishes he got rid of trelawney for good said ron now munching on his fourteenth frog mind you the whole useless if you ask me firenze a lot better 
 
 how can you say that hermione demanded after just found out that there are real prophecies 
 
 heart began to race he had not told ron hermione or anyone else what the prophecy had contained neville had told them it had smashed while harry was pulling him up the steps in the death room and harry had not yet corrected this impression he was not ready to see their expressions when he told them that he must be either murderer or victim there was no other way 
 
 it is a pity it broke said hermione quietly shaking her head 
 
 yeah it is said ron still at least never found out what was in it either where are you going he added looking both surprised and disappointed as harry stood up 
 
 said harry you know he just got back and i promised go down and see him and tell him how you two are 
 
 oh all right then said ron grumpily looking out of the dormitory window at the patch of bright blue sky beyond wish we could come 
 
 say hello to him for us called hermione as harry proceeded down the ward and ask him happening about about his little friend 
 
 harry gave a wave of his hand to show he had heard and understood as he left the dormitory 
 
 the castle seemed very quiet even for a sunday everybody was clearly out in the sunny grounds enjoying the end of their exams and the prospect of a last few days of term unhampered by revision or homework harry walked slowly along the deserted corridor peering out of windows as he went he could see people messing around in the air over the quidditch pitch and a couple of students swimming in the lake accompanied by the giant squid 
 
 he was finding it hard to decide whether he wanted to be with people or not whenever he was in company he wanted to get away and whenever he was alone he wanted company he thought he might really go and visit hagrid though as he had not talked to him properly since returned 
 
 harry had just descended the last marble step into the entrance hall when malfoy crabbe and goyle emerged from a door on the right that harry knew led down to the slytherin common room harry stopped dead so did malfoy and the others the only sounds were the shouts laughter and splashes drifting into the hall from the grounds through the open front doors 
 
 malfoy glanced aroundharry knew he was checking for signs of teachersthen he looked back at harry and said in a low voice dead potter 
 
 harry raised his eyebrows 
 
 funny he said think have stopped walking around 
 
 malfoy looked angrier than harry had ever seen him he felt a kind of detached satisfaction at the sight of his pale pointed face contorted with rage 
 
 going to pay said malfoy in a voice barely louder than a whisper going to make you pay for what done to my father 
 
 well terrified now said harry sarcastically i lord just a act compared to you the matter he added for malfoy crabbe and goyle had all looked stricken at the sound of the name a mate of your dad he not scared of him are you 
 
 you think such a big man potter said malfoy advancing now crabbe and goyle flanking him you wait have you you land my father in prison 
 
 i thought i just had said harry 
 
 the dementors have left azkaban said malfoy quietly dad and the be out in no time 
 
 yeah i expect they will said harry still at least everyone knows what scumbags they are now 
 
 hand flew towards his wand but harry was too quick for him he had drawn his own wand before fingers had even entered the pocket of his robes 
 
 potter 
 
 the voice rang across the entrance hall snape had emerged from the staircase leading down to his office and at the sight of him harry felt a great rush of hatred beyond anything he felt towards malfoy whatever dumbledore said he would never forgive snape never 
 
 what are you doing potter said snape as coldly as ever as he strode over to the four of them 
 
 trying to decide what curse to use on malfoy sir said harry fiercely 
 
 snape stared at him 
 
 put that wand away at once he said curtly ten points from gryff 
 
 snape looked towards the giant on the walls and gave a sneering smile 
 
 ah i see there are no longer any points left in the gryffindor to take away in that case potter we will simply have to 
 
 add some more 
 
 professor mcgonagall had just stumped up the stone steps into the castle she was carrying a tartan carpetbag in one hand and leaning heavily on a walking stick with her other but otherwise looked quite well 
 
 professor mcgonagall said snape striding forwards out of st i see 
 
 yes professor snape said professor mcgonagall shrugging off her travelling cloak quite as good as new you twocrabbegoyle 
 
 she beckoned them forwards imperiously and they came shuffling their large feet and looking awkward 
 
 here said professor mcgonagall thrusting her carpetbag into chest and her cloak into take these up to my office for me 
 
 they turned and stumped away up the marble staircase 
 
 right then said professor mcgonagall looking up at the hourglasses on the wall well i think potter and his friends ought to have fifty points apiece for alerting the world to the return of what say you professor snape 
 
 what snapped snape though harry knew he had heard perfectly well ohwelli suppose 
 
 so fifty each for potter the two weasleys longbottom and miss granger said professor mcgonagall and a shower of rubies fell down into the bottom bulb of gryffindor s as she spoke ohand fifty for miss lovegood i suppose she added and a number of sapphires fell into glass now you wanted to take ten from mr potter i think professor snapeso there we are 
 
 a few rubies retreated into the upper bulb leaving a respectable amount below nevertheless 
 
 well potter malfoy i think you ought to be outside on a glorious day like this professor mcgonagall continued briskly 
 
 harry did not need telling twice he thrust his wand back inside his robes and headed straight for the front doors without another glance at snape and malfoy 
 
 the hot sun hit him with a blast as he walked across the lawns towards cabin students lying around on the grass sunbathing talking reading the sunday prophet and eating sweets looked up at him as he passed some called out to him or else waved clearly eager to show that they like the prophet had decided he was something of a hero harry said nothing to any of them he had no idea how much they knew of what had happened three days ago but he had so far avoided being questioned and preferred to keep it that way 
 
 he thought at first when he knocked on cabin door that he was out but then fang came charging around the corner and almost bowled him over with the enthusiasm of his welcome hagrid it transpired was picking runner beans in his back garden 
 
 all righ harry he said beaming when harry approached the fence come in come in have a cup o dandelion juice 
 
 things hagrid asked him as they settled down at his wooden table with a glass apiece of iced juice yeherfeelin all righ are yeh 
 
 harry knew from the look of concern on face that he was not referring to physical 
 
 fine harry said quickly because he could not bear to discuss the thing that he knew was in mind so you been 
 
 bin hidin out in the mountains said hagrid up in a cave like sirius did when he 
 
 hagrid broke off cleared his throat gruffly looked at harry and took a long draught of juice 
 
 anyway back now he said feebly 
 
 youyou look better said harry who was determined to keep the conversation moving away from sirius 
 
 wha said hagrid raising a massive hand and feeling his face ohoh yeah well loads better behaved now loads seemed right pleased ter see me when i got back ter tell yeh the truth a good lad really ive bin thinkin abou tryin ter find him a lady friend actually 
 
 harry would normally have tried to persuade hagrid out of this idea at once the prospect of a second giant taking up residence in the forest possibly even wilder and more brutal than grawp was positively alarming but somehow harry could not muster the energy necessary to argue the point he was starting to wish he was alone again and with the idea of hastening his departure he took several large gulps of his dandelion juice his glass 
 
 knows bin tellin the truth now harry said hagrid softly and unexpectedly he was watching harry closely gotta be better hasn it 
 
 harry shrugged 
 
 look hagrid leaned towards him across the table i knew sirius longer n yeh did he died in battle an the way wanted ter go 
 
 he want to go at all said harry angrily 
 
 hagrid bowed his great shaggy head 
 
 nah i don reckon he did he said quietly but still harry he was never one ter sit aroun at home an let other people do the fightin he lived with himself if he hadn gone ter help 
 
 harry leapt up 
 
 got to go and visit ron and hermione in the hospital wing he said mechanically 
 
 oh said hagrid looking rather upset oh all righ then harry take care o yerself then an drop back in if got a mo 
 
 yeah right 
 
 harry crossed to the door as fast as he could and pulled it open he was out in the sunshine again before hagrid had finished saying goodbye and walking away across the lawn once again people called out to him as he passed he closed his eyes for a few moments wishing they would all vanish that he could open his eyes and find himself alone in the grounds 
 
 a few days ago before his exams had finished and he had seen the vision voldemort had planted in his mind he would have given almost anything for the wizarding world to know he had been telling the truth for them to believe that voldemort was back and to know that he was neither a liar nor mad now however 
 
 he walked a short way around the lake sat down on its bank sheltered from the gaze of behind a tangle of shrubs and stared out over the gleaming water thinking 
 
 perhaps the reason he wanted to be alone was because he had felt isolated from everybody since his talk with dumbledore an invisible barrier separated him from the rest of the world he washe had always beena marked man it was just that he had never really understood what that meant 
 
 and yet sitting here on the edge of the lake with the terrible weight of grief dragging at him with the loss of sirius so raw and fresh inside he could not muster any great sense of fear it was sunny and the grounds around him were full of laughing people and even though he felt as distant from them as though he belonged to a different race it was still very hard to believe as he sat here that his life must include or end in murder 
 
 he sat there for a long time gazing out at the water trying not to think about his godfather or to remember that it was directly across from here on the opposite bank that sirius had once collapsed trying to fend off a hundred dementors 
 
 the sun had set before he realised he was cold he got up and returned to the castle wiping his face on his sleeve as he went 
 
 ron and hermione left the hospital wing completely cured three days before the end of term hermione kept showing signs of wanting to talk about sirius but ron tended to make hushing noises every time she mentioned his name harry was still not sure whether or not he wanted to talk about his godfather yet his wishes varied with his mood he knew one thing though unhappy as he felt at the moment he would greatly miss hogwarts in a few days time when he was back at number four privet drive even though he now understood exactly why he had to return there every summer he did not feel any better about it indeed he had never dreaded his return more 
 
 professor umbridge left hogwarts the day before the end of term it seemed she had crept out of the hospital wing during dinnertime evidently hoping to depart undetected but unfortunately for her she met peeves on the way who seized his last chance to do as fred had instructed and chased her gleefully from the premises whacking her alternately with a walking stick and a sock full of chalk many students ran out into the entrance hall to watch her running away down the path and the heads of houses tried only to restrain them indeed professor mcgonagall sank back into her chair at the staff table after a few feeble remonstrances and was clearly heard to express a regret that she could not run cheering after umbridge herself because peeves had borrowed her walking stick 
 
 their last evening at school arrived most people had finished packing and were already heading down to the leaving feast but harry had not even started 
 
 just do it tomorrow said ron who was waiting by the door of their dormitory come on starving 
 
 i be long look you go ahead 
 
 but when the dormitory door closed behind ron harry made no effort to speed up his packing the very last thing he wanted to do was to attend the leaving feast he was worried that dumbledore would make some reference to him in his speech he was sure to mention return he had talked to them about it last year after all 
 
 harry pulled some crumpled robes out of the very bottom of his trunk to make way for folded ones and as he did so noticed a badly wrapped package lying in a corner of it he could not think what it was doing there he bent down pulled it out from underneath his trainers and examined it 
 
 he realised what it was within seconds sirius had given it to him just inside the front door of number twelve grimmauld place use it if you need me all right 
 
 harry sank down on to his bed and unwrapped the package out fell a small square mirror it looked old it was certainly dirty harry held it up to his face and saw his own reflection looking back at him 
 
 he turned the mirror over there on the reverse side was a scribbled note from sirius 
 
 this is a mirror got the other one of the pair if you need to speak to me just say my name into it appear in my mirror and be able to talk in yours james and i used to use them when we were in separate detentions 
 
 heart began to race he remembered seeing his dead parents in the mirror of erised four years ago he was going to be able to talk to sirius again right now he knew it 
 
 he looked around to make sure there was nobody else there the dormitory was quite empty he looked back at the mirror raised it in front of his face with trembling hands and said loudly and clearly sirius 
 
 his breath misted the surface of the glass he held the mirror even closer excitement flooding through him but the eyes blinking back at him through the fog were definitely his own 
 
 he wiped the mirror clear again and said so that every syllable rang clearly through the room 
 
 sirius black 
 
 nothing happened the frustrated face looking back out of the mirror was still definitely his own 
 
 sirius have his mirror on him when he went through the archway said a small voice in head why not working 
 
 harry remained quite still for a moment then hurled the mirror back into the trunk where it shattered he had been convinced for a whole shining minute that he was going to see sirius talk to him again 
 
 disappointment was burning in his throat he got up and began throwing his things into the trunk on top of the broken mirror 
 
 but then an idea struck him a better idea than a mirror a much bigger more important idea how had he never thought of it beforewhy had he never asked 
 
 he was sprinting out of the dormitory and down the spiral staircase hitting the walls as he ran and barely noticing he hurtled across the empty common room through the portrait hole and off along the corridor ignoring the fat lady who called after him the feast is about to start you know cutting it very fine 
 
 but harry had no intention of going to the feast 
 
 how could it be that the place was full of ghosts whenever you need one yet now 
 
 he ran down staircases and along corridors and met nobody either alive or dead they were all clearly in the great hall outside his charms classroom he came to a halt panting and thinking disconsolately that he would have to wait until later until after the end of the feast 
 
 but just as he had given up hope he saw ita translucent somebody drifting across the end of the corridor 
 
 heyhey nick nick 
 
 the ghost stuck its head back out of the wall revealing the extravagantly plumed hat and dangerously wobbling head of sir nicholas de 
 
 good evening he said withdrawing the rest of his body from the solid stone and smiling at harry i am not the only one who is late then though he sighed in a rather different sense of course 
 
 nick can i ask you something 
 
 a most peculiar expression stole over nearly headless face as he inserted a finger in the stiff ruff at his neck and tugged it a little straighter apparently to give himself thinking time he desisted only when his partially severed neck seemed about to give way completely 
 
 ernow harry said nick looking discomfited it wait until after the feast 
 
 nonick please said harry i really need to talk to you can we go in here 
 
 harry opened the door of the nearest classroom and nearly headless nick sighed 
 
 oh very well he said looking resigned i pretend i been expecting it 
 
 harry was holding the door open for him but he drifted through the wall instead 
 
 expecting what harry asked as he closed the door 
 
 you to come and find me said nick now gliding over to the window and looking out at the darkening grounds it happens sometimes when somebody has suffered a loss 
 
 well said harry refusing to be deflected you were right come to find you 
 
 nick said nothing 
 
 said harry who was finding this more awkward than he had anticipated just dead but still here you 
 
 nick sighed and continued to gaze out at the grounds 
 
 right it harry urged him you died but talking to you you can walk around hogwarts and everything you 
 
 yes said nearly headless nick quietly i walk and talk yes 
 
 so you came back you said harry urgently people can come back right as ghosts they have to disappear completely well he added impatiently when nick continued to say nothing 
 
 nearly headless nick hesitated then said not everyone can come back as a ghost 
 
 what mean said harry quickly 
 
 only only wizards 
 
 oh said harry and he almost laughed with relief well ok then the person asking about is a wizard so he can come back right 
 
 nick turned away from the window and looked mournfully at harry 
 
 he come back 
 
 who 
 
 sirius black said nick 
 
 but you did said harry angrily you came dead and you disappear 
 
 wizards can leave an imprint of themselves upon the earth to walk palely where their living selves once trod said nick miserably but very few wizards choose that path 
 
 why not said harry anywayit mattersirius care if unusual come back i know he will 
 
 and so strong was his belief harry actually turned his head to check the door sure for a split second that he was going to see sirius and transparent but beaming walking through it towards him 
 
 he will not come back repeated nick he will have gone on 
 
 what mean gone on said harry quickly gone on where listenwhat happens when you die anyway where do you go why everyone come back why this place full of ghosts why 
 
 i cannot answer said nick 
 
 dead you said harry exasperatedly who can answer better than you 
 
 i was afraid of death said nick softly i chose to remain behind i sometimes wonder whether i to have well that is neither here nor there in fact i am neither here nor there he gave a small sad chuckle i know nothing of the secrets of death harry for i chose my feeble imitation of life instead i believe learned wizards study the matter in the department of mysteries 
 
 talk to me about that place said harry fiercely 
 
 i am sorry not to have been more help said nick gently well well do excuse me the feast you know 
 
 and he left the room leaving harry there alone gazing blankly at the wall through which nick had disappeared 
 
 harry felt almost as though he had lost his godfather all over again in losing the hope that he might be able to see or speak to him once more he walked slowly and miserably back up through the empty castle wondering whether he would ever feel cheerful again 
 
 he had turned the corner towards the fat corridor when he saw somebody up ahead fastening a note to a board on the wall a second glance showed him it was luna there were no good hiding places nearby she was bound to have heard his footsteps and in any case harry could hardly muster the energy to avoid anyone at the moment 
 
 hello said luna vaguely glancing around at him as she stepped back from the notice 
 
 how come not at the feast harry asked 
 
 well lost most of my possessions said luna serenely people take them and hide them you know but as the last night i really do need them back so been putting up signs 
 
 she gestured towards the noticeboard upon which sure enough she had pinned a list of all her missing books and clothes with a plea for their return 
 
 an odd feeling rose in harry an emotion quite different from the anger and grief that had filled him since death it was a few moments before he realised that he was feeling sorry for luna 
 
 how come people hide your stuff he asked her frowning 
 
 oh well she shrugged i think they think a bit odd you know some people call me loony lovegood actually 
 
 harry looked at her and the new feeling of pity intensified rather painfully 
 
 no reason for them to take your things he said flatly want help finding them 
 
 oh no she said smiling at him come back they always do in the end it was just that i wanted to pack tonight anyway why you at the feast 
 
 harry shrugged just feel like it 
 
 no said luna observing him with those oddly misty protuberant eyes i suppose you do that man the death eaters killed was your godfather he ginny told me 
 
 harry nodded curtly but found that for some reason he did not mind luna talking about sirius he had just remembered that she too could see thestrals 
 
 have you he began i mean who has anyone you known ever died 
 
 yes said luna simply my mother she was a quite extraordinary witch you know but she did like to experiment and one of her spells went rather badly wrong one day i was nine 
 
 sorry harry mumbled 
 
 yes it was rather horrible said luna conversationally i still feel very sad about it sometimes but still got dad and anyway not as though never see mum again is it 
 
 it said harry uncertainly 
 
 she shook her head in disbelief 
 
 oh come on you heard them just behind the veil you 
 
 you mean 
 
 in that room with the archway they were just lurking out of sight all you heard them 
 
 they looked at each other luna was smiling slightly harry did not know what to say or to think luna believed so many extraordinary things yet he had been sure he had heard voices behind the veil too 
 
 are you sure you want me to help you look for your stuff he said 
 
 oh no said luna no i think just go down and have some pudding and wait for it all to turn up it always does in the end well have a nice holiday harry 
 
 yeah yeah you too 
 
 she walked away from him and as he watched her go he found that the terrible weight in his stomach seemed to have lessened slightly 
 
 the journey home on the hogwarts express next day was eventful in several ways firstly malfoy crabbe and goyle who had clearly been waiting all week for the opportunity to strike without teacher witnesses attempted to ambush harry halfway down the train as he made his way back from the toilet the attack might have succeeded had it not been for the fact that they unwittingly chose to stage the attack right outside a compartment full of da members who saw what was happening through the glass and rose as one to rush to aid by the time ernie macmillan hannah abbott susan bones justin anthony goldstein and terry boot had finished using a wide variety of the hexes and jinxes harry had taught them malfoy crabbe and goyle resembled nothing so much as three gigantic slugs squeezed into hogwarts uniform as harry ernie and justin hoisted them into the luggage rack and left them there to ooze 
 
 i must say looking forward to seeing face when he gets off the train said ernie with some satisfaction as he watched malfoy squirm above him ernie had never quite got over the indignity of malfoy docking points from hufflepuff during his brief spell as a member of the inquisitorial squad 
 
 be really pleased though said ron who had come to investigate the source of the commotion loads now anyway harry the food just stopped if you want anything 
 
 harry thanked the others and accompanied ron back to their compartment where he bought a large pile of cauldron cakes and pumpkin pasties hermione was reading the daily prophet again ginny was doing a quiz in the quibbler and neville was stroking his mimbulus mimbletonia which had grown a great deal over the year and now made odd crooning noises when touched 
 
 harry and ron whiled away most of the journey playing wizard chess while hermione read out snippets from the was now full of articles about how to repel dementors attempts by the ministry to track down death eaters and hysterical letters claiming that the writer had seen lord voldemort walking past their house that very morning 
 
 it really started yet sighed hermione gloomily folding up the newspaper again but it be long now 
 
 hey harry said ron softly nodding towards the glass window on to the corridor 
 
 harry looked around cho was passing accompanied by marietta edgecombe who was wearing a balaclava his and eyes met for a moment cho blushed and kept walking harry looked back down at the chessboard just in time to see one of his pawns chased off its square by knight 
 
 going on with you and her anyway ron asked quietly 
 
 nothing said harry truthfully 
 
 ierheard going out with someone else now said hermione tentatively 
 
 harry was surprised to find that this information did not hurt at all wanting to impress cho seemed to belong to a past that was no longer quite connected with him so much of what he had wanted before death felt that way these days the week that had elapsed since he had last seen sirius seemed to have lasted much much longer it stretched across two universes the one with sirius in it and the one without 
 
 well out of it mate said ron forcefully i mean quite and all that but you want someone a bit more cheerful 
 
 probably cheerful enough with someone else said harry shrugging 
 
 she with now anyway ron asked hermione but it was ginny who answered 
 
 michael corner she said 
 
 michaelbut said ron craning around in his seat to state at her but you were going out with him 
 
 not any more said ginny resolutely he like gryffindor beating ravenclaw at quidditch and got really sulky so i ditched him and he ran off to comfort cho instead she scratched her nose absently with the end of her quill turned the quibbler and began marking her answers ron looked highly delighted 
 
 well i always thought he was a bit of an idiot he said prodding his queen forwards towards quivering castle good for you just choose someonebetternext time 
 
 he cast harry an oddly furtive look as he said it 
 
 well chosen dean thomas would you say better asked ginny vaguely 
 
 what shouted ron upending the chessboard crookshanks went plunging after the pieces and hedwig and pigwidgeon twittered and hooted angrily from overhead 
 
 as the train slowed down in the approach to cross harry thought he had never wanted to leave it less he even wondered fleetingly what would happen if he simply refused to get off but remained stubbornly sitting there until the first of september when it would take him back to hogwarts when it finally puffed to a standstill however he lifted down cage and prepared to drag his trunk from the train as usual 
 
 when the ticket inspector signalled to harry ron and hermione that it was safe to walk through the magical barrier between platforms nine and ten however he found a surprise awaiting him on the other side a group of people standing there to greet him who he had not expected at all 
 
 there was moody looking quite as sinister with his bowler hat pulled low over his magical eye as he would have done without it his gnarled hands clutching a long staff his body wrapped in a voluminous travelling cloak tonks stood just behind him her bright hair gleaming in the sunlight filtering through the dirty glass of the station ceiling wearing heavily patched jeans and a bright purple bearing the legend the weird to tonks was lupin his face pale his hair greying a long and threadbare overcoat covering a shabby jumper and trousers at the front of the group stood mr and mrs weasley dressed in their muggle best and fred and george who were both wearing jackets in some lurid green scaly material 
 
 ron ginny called mrs weasley hurrying forwards and hugging her children tightly oh and harry dearhow are you 
 
 fine lied harry as she pulled him into a tight embrace over her shoulder he saw ron goggling at the twins new clothes 
 
 what are they supposed to be he asked pointing at the jackets 
 
 finest dragonskin little bro said fred giving his zip a little tweak business is booming and we thought treat ourselves 
 
 hello harry said lupin as mrs weasley let go of harry and turned to greet hermione 
 
 hi said harry i expect what are you all doing here 
 
 well said lupin with a slight smile we thought we might have a little chat with your aunt and uncle before letting them take you home 
 
 i dunno if a good idea said harry at once 
 
 oh i think it is growled moody who had limped a little closer be them will it potter 
 
 he pointed with his thumb over his shoulder his magical eye was evidently peering through the back of his head and his bowler hat harry leaned an inch or so to the left to see where was pointing and there sure enough were the three dursleys who looked positively appalled to see reception committee 
 
 ah harry said mr weasley turning from parents who he had just greeted enthusiastically and who were now taking it in turns to hug hermione well shall we do it then 
 
 yeah i reckon so arthur said moody 
 
 he and mr weasley took the lead across the station towards the dursleys who were apparently rooted to the floor hermione disengaged herself gently from her mother to join the group 
 
 good afternoon said mr weasley pleasantly to uncle vernon as he came to a halt right in front of him you might remember me my arthur weasley 
 
 as mr weasley had demolished most of the dursleys living room two years previously harry would have been very surprised if uncle vernon had forgotten him sure enough uncle vernon turned a deeper shade of puce and glared at mr weasley but chose not to say anything partly perhaps because the dursleys were outnumbered two to one aunt petunia looked both frightened and embarrassed she kept glancing around as though terrified somebody she knew would see her in such company dudley meanwhile seemed to be trying to look small and insignificant a feat at which he was failing extravagantly 
 
 we thought just have a few words with you about harry said mr weasley still smiling 
 
 yeah growled moody about how treated when at your place 
 
 uncle moustache seemed to bristle with indignation possibly because the bowler hat gave him the entirely mistaken impression that he was dealing with a kindred spirit he addressed himself to moody 
 
 i am not aware that it is any of your business what goes on in my house 
 
 i expect what not aware of would fill several books dursley growled moody 
 
 anyway not the point interjected tonks whose pink hair seemed to offend aunt petunia more than all the rest put together for she closed her eyes rather than look at her the point is if we find out been horrible to harry 
 
 and make no mistake hear about it added lupin pleasantly 
 
 yes said mr weasley even if you let harry use the 
 
 telephone whispered hermione 
 
 yeah if we get any hint that been mistreated in any way have us to answer to said moody 
 
 uncle vernon swelled ominously his sense of outrage seemed to outweigh even his fear of this bunch of oddballs 
 
 are you threatening me sir he said so loudly that actually turned to stare 
 
 yes i am said who seemed rather pleased that uncle vernon had grasped this fact so quickly 
 
 and do i look like the kind of man who can be intimidated barked uncle vernon 
 
 well said moody pushing back his bowler hat to reveal his sinisterly revolving magical eye uncle vernon leapt backwards in horror and collided painfully with a luggage trolley yes have to say you do dursley 
 
 he turned away from uncle vernon to survey harry 
 
 so potter give us a shout if you need us if we hear from you for three days in a row send someone along 
 
 aunt petunia whimpered piteously it could not have been plainer that she was thinking of what the neighbours would say if they caught sight of these people marching up the garden path 
 
 bye then potter said moody grasping shoulder for a moment with a gnarled hand 
 
 take care harry said lupin quietly keep in touch 
 
 harry have you away from there as soon as we can mrs weasley whispered hugging him again 
 
 see you soon mate said ron anxiously shaking hand 
 
 really soon harry said hermione earnestly we promise 
 
 harry nodded he somehow could not find words to tell them what it meant to him to see them all ranged there on his side instead he smiled raised a hand in farewell turned around and led the way out of the station towards the sunlit street with uncle vernon aunt petunia and dudley hurrying along in his wake 
 
 rowling

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the brave tin soldier 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 there were once tin soldiers who were all 
 brothers for they had been made out of the same old tin spoon they 
 shouldered arms and looked straight before them and wore a splendid uniform red and blue the first thing in the world they ever heard were the words tin soldiers uttered by a little boy who clapped his hands with delight when the lid of the box in which they lay was taken off they were given him for a birthday present and he stood at the table to set them up the soldiers were all exactly alike 
 excepting one who had only one leg he had been left to the last and 
 then there was not enough of the melted tin to finish him so they 
 made him to stand firmly on one leg and this caused him to be very 
 remarkable 
 
 the table on which the tin soldiers stood was covered with 
 other playthings but the most attractive to the eye was a pretty 
 little paper castle through the small windows the rooms could be 
 seen in front of the castle a number of little trees surrounded a 
 piece of which was intended to represent a 
 transparent lake swans made of wax swam on the lake and were 
 reflected in it all this was very pretty but the prettiest of all 
 was a tiny little lady who stood at the open door of the castle she 
 also was made of paper and she wore a dress of clear muslin with 
 a narrow blue ribbon over her shoulders just like a scarf in front of 
 these was fixed a glittering tinsel rose as large as her whole 
 face the little lady was a dancer and she stretched out both her 
 arms and raised one of her legs so high that the tin soldier could 
 not see it at all and he thought that she like himself had only one 
 leg that is the wife for me he thought but she is too grand and 
 lives in a castle while i have only a box to live in 
 of us altogether that is no place for her still i must try and 
 make her acquaintance then he laid himself at full length on the 
 table behind a that stood upon it so that he could peep 
 at the little delicate lady who continued to stand on one leg without 
 losing her balance when evening came the other tin soldiers were all 
 placed in the box and the people of the house went to bed then the 
 playthings began to have their own games together to pay visits to 
 have sham fights and to give balls the tin soldiers rattled in their 
 box they wanted to get out and join the amusements but they could 
 not open the lid the played at and the pencil 
 jumped about the table there was such a noise that the canary woke up and began to talk and in poetry too only the tin soldier and the 
 dancer remained in their places she stood on tiptoe with her legs 
 stretched out as firmly as he did on his one leg he never took his 
 eyes from her for even a moment the clock struck twelve and with 
 a bounce up sprang the lid of the but instead of snuff 
 there jumped up a little black goblin for the was a toy 
 puzzle 
 
 tin soldier said the goblin wish for what does not 
 belong to you 
 
 but the tin soldier pretended not to hear 
 
 very well wait till then said the goblin 
 when the children came in the next morning they placed the tin 
 soldier in the window now whether it was the goblin who did it or 
 the draught is not known but the window flew open and out fell 
 the tin soldier heels over head from the third story into the 
 street beneath it was a terrible fall for he came head downwards 
 his helmet and his bayonet stuck in between the flagstones and his 
 one leg up in the air the servant maid and the little boy went down 
 stairs directly to look for him but he was nowhere to be seen 
 although once they nearly trod upon him if he had called out here i 
 am it would have been all right but he was too proud to cry out for 
 help while he wore a uniform 
 
 presently it began to rain and the drops fell faster and 
 faster till there was a heavy shower when it was over two boys 
 happened to pass by and one of them said look there is a tin 
 soldier he ought to have a boat to sail in 
 
 so they made a boat out of a newspaper and placed the tin soldier 
 in it and sent him sailing down the gutter while the two boys ran by 
 the side of it and clapped their hands good gracious what large 
 waves arose in that gutter and how fast the stream rolled on for the 
 rain had been very heavy the paper boat rocked up and down and 
 turned itself round sometimes so quickly that the tin soldier 
 trembled yet he remained firm his countenance did not change he 
 looked straight before him and shouldered his musket suddenly the 
 boat shot under a bridge which formed a part of a drain and then it 
 was as dark as the tin box 
 
 where am i going now thought he this is the black 
 fault i am sure ah well if the little lady were only here with 
 me in the boat i should not care for any darkness 
 
 suddenly there appeared a great who lived in the drain 
 have you a passport asked the rat give it to me at once but 
 the tin soldier remained silent and held his musket tighter than ever 
 the boat sailed on and the rat followed it how he did gnash his teeth 
 and cry out to the bits of wood and straw stop him stop him he has not paid toll and has not shown his pass but the stream rushed on stronger and stronger the tin soldier could already see daylight 
 shining where the arch ended then he heard a roaring sound quite 
 terrible enough to frighten the bravest man at the end of the 
 tunnel the drain fell into a large canal over a steep place which 
 made it as dangerous for him as a waterfall would be to us he was too close to it to stop so the boat rushed on and the poor tin soldier 
 could only hold himself as stiffly as possible without moving an 
 eyelid to show that he was not afraid the boat whirled round three 
 or four times and then filled with water to the very edge nothing 
 could save it from sinking he now stood up to his neck in water 
 while deeper and deeper sank the boat and the paper became soft and loose with the wet till at last the water closed over the 
 head he thought of the elegant little dancer whom he should never see again and the words of the song sounded in his ears 
 farewell warrior ever brave 
 drifting onward to thy grave 
 then the paper boat fell to pieces and the soldier sank into 
 the water and immediately afterwards was swallowed up by a great fish 
 
 oh how dark it was inside the fish a great deal darker than in the 
 tunnel and narrower too but the tin soldier continued firm and 
 lay at full length shouldering his musket the fish swam to and fro 
 making the most wonderful movements but at last he became quite 
 still after a while a flash of lightning seemed to pass through him 
 and then the daylight approached and a voice cried out i declare 
 here is the tin soldier the fish had been caught taken to the 
 market and sold to the cook who took him into the kitchen and cut him open with a large knife she picked up the soldier and held him by the waist between her finger and thumb and carried him into the room 
 
 they were all anxious to see this wonderful soldier who had 
 travelled about inside a fish but he was not at all proud they 
 placed him on the table and how many curious things do happen in the world there he was in the very same room from the window of which he had fallen there were the same children the same playthings standing on the table and the pretty castle with the elegant little dancer at the door she still balanced herself on one leg and held up the other so she was as firm as himself it touched the tin soldier 
 so much to see her that he almost wept tin tears but he kept them 
 back he only looked at her and they both remained silent presently 
 one of the little boys took up the tin soldier and threw him into the 
 stove he had no reason for doing so therefore it must have been 
 the fault of the black goblin who lived in the the flames 
 lighted up the tin soldier as he stood the heat was very terrible 
 but whether it proceeded from the real fire or from the fire of love 
 he could not tell then he could see that the bright colors were faded 
 from his uniform but whether they had been washed off during his 
 journey or from the effects of his sorrow no one could say he looked at the little lady and she looked at him he felt himself melting 
 away but he still remained firm with his gun on his shoulder 
 suddenly the door of the room flew open and the draught of air 
 caught up the little dancer she fluttered like a sylph right into the 
 stove by the side of the tin soldier and was instantly in flames 
 and was gone the tin soldier melted down into a lump and the next 
 morning when the maid servant took the ashes out of the stove she 
 found him in the shape of a little tin heart but of the little dancer 
 nothing remained but the tinsel rose which was burnt black as a 
 cinder

 of custom education 
 thoughts are much according to their inclination their discourse and speeches according to their learning and infused opinions but their deeds are after as they have been accustomed and therefore as machiavelli well noteth though in an evil favoured instance there is no trusting to the force of nature nor to the bravery of words except it be corroborate by custom his instance is that for the achieving of a desperate conspiracy a man should not rest upon the fierceness of any nature or his resolute undertakings but take such an one as hath had his hands formerly in blood but machiavelli knew not of a friar clement nor a ravillac nor a jaureguy nor a baltazar gerard yet his rule holdeth still that nature nor the engagement of words are not so forcible as custom only superstition is now so well advanced that men of the first blood are as firm as butchers by occupation and votary resolution is made equipollent to custom even in matter of blood in other things the predominancy of custom is everywhere visible in so much as a man would wonder to hear men profess protest engage give great words and then do just as they have done before as if they were dead images and engines moved only by the wheels of custom 
 we see also the reign or tyranny of custom what it is the indians i mean 
 the sect of their wise men lay themselves quietly upon a stack of wood and so 
 sacrifice themselves by fire nay the wives strive to be burned with the corpses 
 of their husbands the lads of sparta of ancient time were wont to be scourged upon the altar of diana without so much as queening i remember in the beginning of queen time of england an irish rebel condemned put up a petition to the deputy that he might be hanged in a with and not in an halter because it had been so used with former rebels 
 there on be monks in russia for penance that will sit a whole night in a vessel of water till they be engaged with hard ice many examples may be put of the force of custom both upon mind and body therefore since custom is the principal magistrate of life let men by all means endeavour to obtain good 
 customs 
 certainly custom is most perfect when it beginneth in young years this 
 we call education which is in effect but an early custom so we see in languages the tongue is more pliant to all expressions and sounds the joints are more supple to all fears of activity and motions in youth than afterwards for it is true that late learners cannot so well take the ply except it be in some minds that have not suffered themselves to fix but have kept themselves open and prepared to receive continual amendment which is exceeding rare 
 
 but if the force of custom simple and separate be great the force of custom copulate and conjoined and collegiate is far greater for there example teacheth 
 company comforteth emulation quickeneth glory raiseth so as in such places the 
 force of custom is in his exaltation certainly the great multiplication of virtues 
 upon human nature resteth upon societies well ordained and disciplined for 
 commonwealths and good governments do nourish virtue grown but do not much mend the seeds but the misery is that the most effectual means are now applied to the ends least to be desired

 book confide is sometimes to deliver into a power 
 chapter ii 
 
 first sketch of two unprepossessing figures 
 the mouse which had been caught was a pitiful specimen but the cat rejoices even over a lean mouse 
 who were these thenardiers 
 let us say a word or two of them now 
 we will complete the sketch later on 
 these beings belonged to that bastard class composed of coarse people who have been successful and of intelligent people who have descended in the scale which is between the class called middle and the class denominated as inferior and which combines some of the defects of the second with nearly all the vices of the first without possessing the generous impulse of the workingman nor the honest order of the bourgeois 
 they were of those dwarfed natures which if a dull fire chances to warm them up easily become monstrous 
 there was in the woman a substratum of the brute and in the man the material for a blackguard both were susceptible in the highest degree of the sort of hideous progress which is accomplished in the direction of evil 
 there exist souls which are continually retreating towards the darkness retrograding in life rather than advancing employing experience to augment their deformity growing incessantly worse and becoming more and more impregnated with an blackness this man and woman possessed such souls 
 thenardier in particular was troublesome for a physiognomist one can only look at some men to distrust them for one feels that they are dark in both directions 
 they are uneasy in the rear and threatening in front 
 there is something of the unknown about them one can no more answer for what they have done than for what they will do 
 the shadow which they bear in their glance denounces them from merely hearing them utter a word or seeing them make a gesture one obtains a glimpse of sombre secrets in their past and of sombre mysteries in their future 
 this thenardier if he himself was to be believed had been a soldier a sergeant he said 
 he had probably been through the campaign of and had even conducted himself with tolerable valor it would seem we shall see later on how much truth there was in this 
 the sign of his hostelry was in allusion to one of his feats of arms he had painted it himself for he knew how to do a little of everything and badly 
 it was at the epoch when the ancient classical romance which after having been clelie was no longer anything but lodoiska still noble but ever more and more vulgar having fallen from mademoiselle de scuderi to madame and from madame de lafayette to madame was setting the loving hearts of the portresses of paris aflame and even ravaging the suburbs to some extent madame thenardier was just intelligent enough to read this sort of books she lived on them 
 in them she drowned what brains she possessed this had given her when very young and even a little later a sort of pensive attitude towards her husband a scamp of a certain depth a ruffian lettered to the extent of the grammar coarse and fine at one and the same time but so far as sentimentalism was concerned given to the perusal of and in what concerns the sex as he said in his downright unmitigated lout 
 his wife was twelve or fifteen years younger than he was 
 later on when her hair arranged in a romantically drooping fashion began to grow gray when the magaera began to be developed from the pamela the female thenardier was nothing but a coarse vicious woman who had dabbled in stupid romances 
 now one cannot read nonsense with impunity the result was that her eldest daughter was named eponine as for the younger the poor little thing came near being called gulnare i know not to what diversion effected by a romance of she owed the fact that she merely bore the name of azelma 
 however we will remark by the way everything was not ridiculous and superficial in that curious epoch to which we are alluding and which may be designated as the anarchy of baptismal names by the side of this romantic element which we have just indicated there is the social symptom 
 it is not rare for the boy nowadays to bear the name of arthur alfred or alphonse and for the there are still any be called thomas pierre or jacques 
 this displacement which places the elegant name on the plebeian and the rustic name on the aristocrat is nothing else than an eddy of equality 
 the irresistible penetration of the new inspiration is there as everywhere else beneath this apparent discord there is a great and a profound thing the french revolution

 book two 
 chapter xi 
 
 next day he woke late recalling his recent impressions the first thought that came into his mind was that today he had to be presented to the emperor francis he remembered the minister of war the polite austrian adjutant bilibin and last conversation having dressed for his attendance at court in full parade uniform which he had not worn for a long time he went into study fresh animated and handsome with his hand bandaged in the study were four gentlemen of the diplomatic corps with prince hippolyte kuragin who was a secretary to the embassy bolkonski was already acquainted bilibin introduced him to the others 
 the gentlemen assembled at were young wealthy gay society men who here as in vienna formed a special set which bilibin their leader called les notres this set consisting almost exclusively of diplomats evidently had its own interests which had nothing to do with war or politics but related to high society to certain women and to the official side of the service these gentlemen received prince andrew as one of themselves an honor they did not extend to many from politeness and to start conversation they asked him a few questions about the army and the battle and then the talk went off into merry jests and gossip 
 ours 
 but the best of it was said one telling of the misfortune of a fellow diplomat that the chancellor told him flatly that his appointment to london was a promotion and that he was so to regard it can you fancy the figure he cut 
 but the worst of it gentlemen i am giving kuragin away to you is that that man suffers and this don juan wicked fellow is taking advantage of it 
 prince hippolyte was lolling in a lounge chair with his legs over its arm he began to laugh 
 tell me about that he said 
 oh you don juan you serpent cried several voices 
 you bolkonski know said bilibin turning to prince andrew that all the atrocities of the french army i nearly said of the russian army are nothing compared to what this man has been doing among the women 
 la femme est la compagne de announced prince hippolyte and began looking through a lorgnette at his elevated legs 
 woman is companion 
 bilibin and the rest of ours burst out laughing in face and prince andrew saw that hippolyte of whom he had to admit he had almost been jealous on his account was the butt of this set 
 oh i must give you a treat bilibin whispered to bolkonski kuragin is exquisite when he discusses politics you should see his gravity 
 he sat down beside hippolyte and wrinkling his forehead began talking to him about politics prince andrew and the others gathered round these two 
 the berlin cabinet cannot express a feeling of alliance began hippolyte gazing round with importance at the others without expressing as in its last note you understand besides unless his majesty the emperor derogates from the principle of our alliance 
 wait i have not finished he said to prince andrew seizing him by the arm i believe that intervention will be stronger than nonintervention and he paused finally one cannot impute the nonreceipt of our dispatch of november that is how it will end and he released arm to indicate that he had now quite finished 
 demosthenes i know thee by the pebble thou secretest in thy golden mouth said bilibin and the mop of hair on his head moved with satisfaction 
 everybody laughed and hippolyte louder than anyone he was evidently distressed and breathed painfully but could not restrain the wild laughter that convulsed his usually impassive features 
 well now gentlemen said bilibin bolkonski is my guest in this house and in brunn itself i want to entertain him as far as i can with all the pleasures of life here if we were in vienna it would be easy but here in this wretched moravian hole it is more difficult and i beg you all to help me attractions must be shown him you can undertake the theater i society and you hippolyte of course the women 
 we must let him see amelie exquisite said one of ours kissing his finger tips 
 in general we must turn this bloodthirsty soldier to more humane interests said bilibin 
 i shall scarcely be able to avail myself of your hospitality gentlemen it is already time for me to go replied prince andrew looking at his watch 
 where to 
 to the emperor 
 oh oh oh well au revoir bolkonski au revoir prince come back early to dinner cried several voices take you in hand 
 when speaking to the emperor try as far as you can to praise the way that provisions are supplied and the routes indicated said bilibin accompanying him to the hall 
 i should like to speak well of them but as far as i the facts i replied bolkonski smiling 
 well talk as much as you can anyway he has a passion for giving audiences but he does not like talking himself and do it as you will see

 chapter 
 
 
 laurie went to nice intending to stay a week and remained a month he was tired of wandering about alone and familiar presence seemed to give a homelike charm to the foreign scenes in which she bore a part he rather missed the petting he used to receive and enjoyed a taste of it again for no attentions however flattering from strangers were half so pleasant as the sisterly adoration of the girls at home amy never would pet him like the others but she was very glad to see him now and quite clung to him feeling that he was the representative of the dear family for whom she longed more than she would confess they naturally took comfort in each society and were much together riding walking dancing or dawdling for at nice no one can be very industrious during the gay season but while apparently amusing themselves in the most careless fashion they were making discoveries and forming opinions about each other amy rose daily in the estimation of her friend but he sank in hers and each felt the truth before a word was spoken amy tried to please and succeeded for she was grateful for the many pleasures he gave her and repaid him with the little services to which womanly women know how to lend an indescribable charm laurie made no effort of any kind but just let himself drift along as comfortably as possible trying to forget and feeling that all women owed him a kind word because one had been cold to him it cost him no effort to be generous and he would have given amy all the trinkets in nice if she would have taken them but at the same time he felt that he could not change the opinion she was forming of him and he rather dreaded the keen blue eyes that seemed to watch him with such surprise 
 all the rest have gone to monaco for the day i preferred to stay at home and write letters they are done now and i am going to valrosa to sketch will you come said amy as she joined laurie one lovely day when he lounged in as usual about noon 
 well yes but it rather warm for such a long walk he answered slowly for the shaded salon looked inviting after the glare without 
 going to have the little carriage and baptiste can drive so have nothing to do but hold your umbrella and keep your gloves nice returned amy with a sarcastic glance at the immaculate kids which were a weak point with laurie 
 then go with pleasure and he put out his hand for her sketchbook but she tucked it under her arm with a sharp 
 trouble yourself no exertion to me but you look equal to it 
 laurie lifted his eyebrows and followed at a leisurely pace as she ran downstairs but when they got into the carriage he took the reins himself and left little baptiste nothing to do but fold his arms and fall asleep on his perch 
 the two never quarreled amy was too and just now laurie was too lazy so in a minute he peeped under her hatbrim with an inquiring air she answered him with a smile and they went on together in the most amicable manner 
 it was a lovely drive along winding roads rich in the picturesque scenes that delight eyes here an ancient monastery whence the solemn chanting of the monks came down to them there a shepherd in wooden shoes pointed hat and rough jacket over one shoulder sat piping on a stone while his goats skipped among the rocks or lay at his feet meek donkeys laden with panniers of freshly cut grass passed by with a pretty girl in a capaline sitting between the green piles or an old woman spinning with a distaff as she went brown children ran out from the quaint stone hovels to offer nosegays or bunches of oranges still on the bough gnarled olive trees covered the hills with their dusky foliage fruit hung golden in the orchard and great scarlet anemones fringed the roadside while beyond green slopes and craggy heights the maritime alps rose sharp and white against the blue italian sky 
 valrosa well deserved its name for in that climate of perpetual summer roses blossomed everywhere they overhung the archway thrust themselves between the bars of the great gate with a sweet welcome to and lined the avenue winding through lemon trees and feathery palms up to the villa on the hill every shadowy nook where seats invited one to stop and rest was a mass of bloom every cool grotto had its marble nymph smiling from a veil of flowers and every fountain reflected crimson white or pale pink roses leaning down to smile at their own beauty roses covered the walls of the house draped the cornices climbed the pillars and ran riot over the balustrade of the wide one looked down on the sunny mediterranean and the city on its shore 
 this is a regular honeymoon paradise it did you ever see such roses asked amy pausing on the terrace to enjoy the view and a luxurious whiff of perfume that came wandering by 
 no nor felt such thorns returned laurie with his thumb in his mouth after a vain attempt to capture a solitary scarlet flower that grew just beyond his reach 
 try lower down and pick those that have no thorns said amy gathering three of the tiny ones that starred the wall behind her she put them in his buttonhole as a peace offering and he stood a minute looking down at them with a curious expression for in the italian part of his nature there was a touch of superstition and he was just then in that state of melancholy when imaginative young men find significance in trifles and food for romance everywhere he had thought of jo in reaching after the thorny red rose for vivid flowers became her and she had often worn ones like that from the greenhouse at home the pale roses amy gave him were the sort that the italians lay in dead hands never in bridal wreaths and for a moment he wondered if the omen was for jo or for himself but the next instant his american common sense got the better of sentimentality and he laughed a heartier laugh than amy had heard since he came 
 good advice better take it and save your fingers she said thinking her speech amused him 
 thank you i will he answered in jest and a few months later he did it in earnest 
 laurie when are you going to your grandfather she asked presently as she settled herself on a rustic seat 
 very soon 
 you have said that a dozen times within the last three weeks 
 i dare say short answers save trouble 
 he expects you and you really ought to go 
 hospitable creature i know it 
 then why you do it 
 natural depravity i suppose 
 natural indolence you mean really dreadful 
 and amy looked severe 
 not so bad as it seems for i should only plague him if i went so i might as well stay and plague you a little longer you can bear it better in fact i think it agrees with you excellently and laurie composed himself for a lounge on the broad ledge of the balustrade 
 amy shook her head and opened her sketchbook with an air of resignation but she had made up her mind to lecture that boy and in a minute she began again 
 what are you doing just now 
 watching lizards 
 no no i mean what do you intend and wish to do 
 smoke a cigarette if allow me 
 how provoking you are i approve of cigars and i will only allow it on condition that you let me put you into my sketch i need a figure 
 with all the pleasure in life how will you have me full length or on my head or my heels i should respectfully suggest a recumbent posture then put yourself in also and call it dolce far niente 
 stay as you are and go to sleep if you like i intend to work hard said amy in her most energetic tone 
 what delightful enthusiasm and he leaned against a tall urn with an ir of entire satisfaction 
 what would jo say if she saw you now asked amy impatiently hoping to stir him up by the mention of her still more energetic name 
 as usual go away teddy busy he laughed as he spoke but the laugh was not natural and a shade passed over his face for the utterance of the familiar name touched the wound that was not healed yet both tone and shadow struck amy for she had seen and heard them before and now she looked up in time to catch a new expression on hard bitter look full of pain dissatisfaction and regret it was gone before she could study it and the listless expression back again she watched him for a moment with artistic pleasure thinking how like an italian he looked as he lay basking in the sun with uncovered head and eyes full of southern dreaminess for he seemed to have forgotten her and fallen into a reverie 
 you look like the effigy of a young knight asleep on his tomb she said carefully tracing the profile defined against the dark stone 
 wish i was 
 a foolish wish unless you have spoiled your life you are so changed i sometimes think there amy stopped with a look more significant than her unfinished speech 
 laurie saw and understood the affectionate anxiety which she hesitated to express and looking straight into her eyes said just as he used to say it to her mother all right 
 that satisfied her and set at rest the doubts that had begun to worry her lately it also touched her and she showed that it did by the cordial tone in which she said 
 glad of that i think been a very bad boy but i fancied you might have wasted money at that wicked lost your heart to some charming frenchwoman with a husband or got into some of the scrapes that young men seem to consider a necessary part of a foreign tour stay out there in the sun come and lie on the grass here and let us be friendly as jo used to say when we got in the sofa corner and told secrets 
 laurie obediently threw himself down on the turf and began to amuse himself by sticking daisies into the ribbons of hat that lay there 
 all ready for the secrets and he glanced up with a decided expression of interest in his eyes 
 none to tell you may begin 
 one to bless myself with i thought perhaps had some news from home 
 you have heard all that has come lately you hear often i fancied jo would send you volumes 
 very busy roving about so impossible to be regular you know when do you begin your great work of art raphaella he asked changing the subject abruptly after another pause in which he had been wondering if amy knew his secret and wanted to talk about it 
 never she answered with a despondent but decided air rome took all the vanity out of me for after seeing the wonders there i felt too insignificant to live and gave up all my foolish hopes in despair 
 why should you with so much energy and talent 
 just why because talent genius and no amount of energy can make it so i want to be great or nothing i be a dauber so i intend to try any more 
 and what are you going to do with yourself now if i may ask 
 polish up my other talents and be an ornament to society if i get the chance 
 it was a characteristic speech and sounded daring but audacity becomes young people and ambition had a good foundation laurie smiled but he liked the spirit with which she took up a new purpose when a one died and spent no time lamenting 
 good and here is where fred vaughn comes in i fancy 
 amy preserved a discreet silence but there was a conscious look in her downcast face that made laurie sit up and say gravely now going to play brother and ask questions may i 
 i promise to answer 
 your face will if your tongue you woman of the world enough yet to hide your feelings my dear i heard rumors about fred and you last year and my private opinion that if he had not been called home so suddenly and detained so long something would have come of it hey 
 not for me to say was grim reply but her lips would smile and there was a traitorous sparkle of the eye which betrayed that she knew her power and enjoyed the knowledge 
 you are not engaged i hope and laurie looked very and grave all of a sudden 
 no 
 but you will be if he comes back and goes properly down on his knees you 
 very likely 
 then you are fond of old fred 
 i could be if i tried 
 but you intend to try till the proper moment bless my soul what unearthly prudence a good fellow amy but not the man i fancied like 
 he is rich a gentleman and has delightful manners began amy trying to be quite cool and dignified but feeling a little ashamed of herself in spite of the sincerity of her intentions 
 i understand queens of society get on without money so you mean to make a good match and start in that way quite right and proper as the world goes but it sounds odd from the lips of one of your girls 
 true nevertheless 
 a short speech but the quiet decision with which it was uttered contrasted curiously with the young speaker laurie felt this instinctively and laid himself down again with a sense of disappointment which he could not explain his look and silence as well as a certain inward ruffled amy and made her resolve to deliver her lecture without delay 
 i wish do me the favor to rouse yourself a little she said sharply 
 do it for me a dear girl 
 i could if i tried and she looked as if she would like doing it in the most summary style 
 try then i give you leave returned laurie who enjoyed having someone to tease after his long abstinence from his favorite pastime 
 be angry in five minutes 
 never angry with you it takes two flints to make a fire you are as cool and soft as snow 
 you know what i can do snow produces a glow and a tingle if applied rightly your indifference is half affectation and a good stirring up would prove it 
 stir away it hurt me and it may amuse you as the big man said when his little wife beat him regard me in the light of a husband or a carpet and beat till you are tired if that sort of exercise agrees with you 
 being decidedly nettled herself and longing to see him shake off the apathy that so altered him amy sharpened both tongue and pencil and began 
 flo and i have got a new name for you lazy laurence how do you like it 
 she thought it would annoy him but he only folded his arms under his head with an imperturbable not bad thank you ladies 
 do you want to know what i honestly think of you 
 pining to be told 
 well i despise you if she had even said i hate you in a petulant or coquettish tone he would have laughed and rather liked it but the grave almost sad accent in her voice made him open his eyes and ask quickly 
 why if you please 
 because with every chance for being good useful and happy you are faulty lazy and miserable 
 strong language mademoiselle 
 if you like it go on 
 pray do quite interesting 
 i thought find it so selfish people always like to talk about themselves 
 am i selfish the question slipped out involuntarily and in a tone of surprise for the one virtue on which he prided himself was generosity 
 yes very selfish continued amy in a calm cool voice twice as effective just then as an angry one show you how for studied you while we were frolicking and not at all satisfied with you here you have been abroad nearly six months and done nothing but waste time and money and disappoint your friends 
 a fellow to have any pleasure after a grind 
 you look as if had much at any rate you are none the better for it as far as i can see i said when we first met that you had improved now i take it all back for i think you half so nice as when i left you at home you have grown abominably lazy you like gossip and waste time on frivolous things you are contented to be petted and admired by silly people instead of being loved and respected by wise ones with money talent position health and beauty ah you like that old vanity but the truth so i help saying it with all these splendid things to use and enjoy you can find nothing to do but dawdle and instead of being the man you ought to be you are only there she stopped with a look that had both pain and pity in it 
 saint laurence on a gridiron added laurie blandly finishing the sentence but the lecture began to take effect for there was a sparkle in his eyes now and a expression replaced the former indifference 
 i supposed take it so you men tell us we are angels and say we can make you what we will but the instant we honestly try to do you good you laugh at us and listen which proves how much your flattery is worth amy spoke bitterly and turned her back on the exasperating martyr at her feet 
 
 in a minute a hand came down over the page so that she could not draw and voice said with a droll imitation of a penitent child i will be good oh i will be good 
 but amy did not laugh for she was in earnest and tapping on the outspread hand with her pencil said soberly you ashamed of a hand like that as soft and white as a and looks as if it never did anything but wear best gloves and pick flowers for ladies you are not a dandy thank heaven so glad to see there are no diamonds or big seal rings on it only the little old one jo gave you so long ago dear soul i wish she was here to help me 
 so do i 
 the hand vanished as suddenly as it came and there was energy enough in the echo of her wish to suit even amy she glanced down at him with a new thought in her mind but he was lying with his hat half over his face as if for shade and his mustache hid his mouth she only saw his chest rise and fall with a long breath that might have been a sigh and the hand that wore the ring nestled down into the grass as if to hide something too precious or too tender to be spoken of all in a minute various hints and trifles assumed shape and significance in mind and told her what her sister never had confided to her she remembered that laurie never spoke voluntarily of jo she recalled the shadow on his face just now the change in his character and the wearing of the little old ring which was no ornament to a handsome hand girls are quick to read such signs and feel their eloquence amy had fancied that perhaps a love trouble was at the bottom of the alteration and now she was sure of it her keen eyes filled and when she spoke again it was in a voice that could be beautifully soft and kind when she chose to make it so 
 i know i have no right to talk so to you laurie and if you the fellow in the world be very angry with me but we are all so fond and proud of you i bear to think they should be disappointed in you at home as i have been though perhaps they would understand the change better than i do 
 i think they would came from under the hat in a grim tone quite as touching as a broken one 
 they ought to have told me and not let me go blundering and scolding when i should have been more kind and patient than ever i never did like that miss randal and now i hate her said artful amy wishing to be sure of her facts this time 
 hang miss randal and laurie knocked the hat off his face with a look that left no doubt of his sentiments toward that young lady 
 i beg pardon i thought and there she paused diplomatically 
 no you you knew perfectly well i never cared for anyone but jo laurie said that in his old impetuous tone and turned his face away as he spoke 
 i did think so but as they never said anything about it and you came away i supposed i was mistaken and jo be kind to you why i was sure she loved you dearly 
 she was kind but not in the right way and lucky for her she love me if the fellow you think me her fault though and you may tell her so 
 the hard bitter look came back again as he said that and it troubled amy for she did not know what balm to apply 
 i was wrong i know very sorry i was so cross but i help wishing bear it better teddy dear 
 her name for me and laurie put up his hand with a quick gesture to stop the words spoken in tone wait till tried it yourself he added in a low voice as he pulled up the grass by the handful 
 take it manfully and be respected if i be loved said amy with the decision of one who knew nothing about it 
 now laurie flattered himself that he had borne it remarkably well making no moan asking no sympathy and taking his trouble away to live it down alone lecture put the matter in a new light and for the first time it did look weak and selfish to lose heart at the first failure and shut himself up in moody indifference he felt as if suddenly shaken out of a pensive dream and found it impossible to go to sleep again presently he sat up and asked slowly do you think jo would despise me as you do 
 yes if she saw you now she hates lazy people why you do something splendid and make her love you 
 i did my best but it was no use 
 graduating well you mean that was no more than you ought to have done for your sake it would have been shameful to fail after spending so much time and money when everyone knew that you could do well 
 i did fail say what you will for jo love me 
 began laurie leaning his head on his hand in a despondent attitude 
 no you and say so in the end for it did you good and proved that you could do something if you tried if only set about another task of some sort soon be your hearty happy self again and forget your trouble 
 impossible 
 try it and see you shrug your shoulders and think much she knows about such things i pretend to be wise but i am observing and i see a great deal more than imagine interested in other experiences and inconsistencies and though i explain i remember and use them for my own benefit love jo all your days if you choose but let it spoil you for wicked to throw away so many good gifts because you have the one you want there i lecture any more for i know wake up and be a man in spite of that hardhearted girl 
 neither spoke for several minutes laurie sat turning the little ring on his finger and amy put the last touches to the hasty sketch she had been working at while she talked presently she put it on his knee merely saying how do you like that 
 he looked and then he smiled as he could not well help doing for it was capitally done the long lazy figure on the grass with listless face eyes and one hand holding a cigar from which came the little wreath of smoke that encircled the head 
 how well you draw he said with a genuine surprise and pleasure at her skill adding with a yes me 
 as you are this is as you were and amy laid another sketch beside the one he held 
 it was not nearly so well done but there was a life and spirit in it which atoned for many faults and it recalled the past so vividly that a sudden change swept over the young face as he looked only a rough sketch of laurie taming a horse hat and coat were off and every line of the active figure resolute face and commanding attitude was full of energy and meaning the handsome brute just subdued stood arching his neck under the tightly drawn rein with one foot impatiently pawing the ground and ears pricked up as if listening for the voice that had mastered him in the ruffled mane the breezy hair and erect attitude there was a suggestion of suddenly arrested motion of strength courage and youthful buoyancy that contrasted sharply with the supine grace of the dolce far niente sketch laurie said nothing but as his eye went from one to the other amy say him flush up and fold his lips together as if he read and accepted the little lesson she had given him that satisfied her and without waiting for him to speak she said in her sprightly way 
 you remember the day you played rarey with puck and we all looked on meg and beth were frightened but jo clapped and pranced and i sat on the fence and drew you i found that sketch in my portfolio the other day touched it up and kept it to show you 
 much obliged improved immensely since then and i congratulate you may i venture to suggest in a honeymoon paradise that five is the dinner hour at your hotel 
 laurie rose as he spoke returned the pictures with a smile and a bow and looked at his watch as if to remind her that even moral lectures should have an end he tried to resume his former easy indifferent air but it was an affectation now for the rousing had been more effacious than he would confess amy felt the shade of coldness in his manner and said to herself 
 now offended him well if it does him good glad if it makes him hate me sorry but true and i take back a word of it 
 they laughed and chatted all the way home and little baptist up behind thought that monsieur and madamoiselle were in charming spirits but both felt ill at ease the friendly frankness was disturbed the sunshine had a shadow over it and despite their apparent gaiety there was a secret discontent in the heart of each 
 shall we see you this evening mon frere asked amy as they parted at her door 
 unfortunately i have an engagement au revoir madamoiselle and laurie bent as if to kiss her hand in the foreign fashion which became him better than many men something in his face made amy say quickly and warmly 
 no be yourself with me laurie and part in the good old way rather have a hearty english handshake than all the sentimental salutations in france 
 goodbye dear and with these words uttered in the tone she liked laurie left her after a handshake almost painful in its heartiness 
 next morning instead of the usual call amy received a note which made her smile at the beginning and sigh at the end 
 
 
 my dear mentor 
 please make my adieux to your aunt and exult within yourself for lazy laurence has gone to his grandpa like the best of boys a pleasant winter to you and may the gods grant you a blissful honeymoon at valrosa i think fred would be benefited by a rouser tell him so with my congratulations 
 
 yours gratefully 
 telemachus 
 
 good boy glad gone said amy with an approving smile the next minute her face fell as she glanced about the empty room adding with an involuntary sigh yes i am glad but how i shall miss him

lionfish nov chapter the flaw in the plancontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 he was flying facedown on the ground again the smell of the forest filled his nostrils he could feel the cold hard ground beneath his cheek and the hinge of his glasses which have been knocked sideways by the fall cutting into his temple every inch of him ached and the place where killing curse had hit him felt like the bruise of an punch he did not stir but he remained exactly where he had fallen with his left arm bent out at an awkward angle and his mouth gaping 
 
 he had expected to hear cheer of triumph and jubilation at his death but instead hurried footsteps whispers and solicitous murmurs filled the air 
 
 my lord my lord 
 
 it was bellatrixs voice and she spoke as if to a lover harry did not dare open his eyes but allowed his other senses to explore his predicament he knew that his wand was still stowed beneath his robes because he could feel it pressed between his chest and the ground a slight cushioning effect in the area of his stomach told him that the invisibility cloak was also there stuffed out of sight 
 
 my lord 
 
 that will do said voldemorts voice 
 
 more footsteps several people were backing away from the same spot desperate to see what was happening and why harry opened his eyes by a millimeter 
 
 voldemort seemed to be getting to his feet various death eaters were hurrying away from him returning to the crowd lining the clearing bellatrix alone remained behind kneeling beside voldemort 
 
 harry closed his eyes again and considered what he had seen the death eaters have been buddled around voldemort who seem to have fallen to the ground something had happened when he had hit harry with the killing curse had voldemort too collapsed it seemed like it and both of them had briefly fallen unconscious and both of them had now returned 
 
 my lord let me c 
 
 i do not require assistance said voldemort coldly and though he could not see it harry pictured bellatrix withdrawing a helpful hand the boy is he dead 
 
 there was a complete silence in the clearing nobody approached harry but he felt their concentrated gaze it seemed to press him harder into the ground and he was terrified a finger or an eyelid might twitch 
 
 you said voldemort and there was a bang and a small shriek of pain examine him tell me whether he is dead 
 
 harry did not know who had been sent to verify he could only lie there with his heart thumping traitorously and wait to be examined but at the same time nothing small comfort through it was that voldemort was wary of approaching him that voldemort suspected that all had not gone to plan 
 
 hands softer than he had been expecting touched harrys face and felt his heart he could hear the womans fast breathing her pounding of life against his ribs 
 
 is draco alive is he in the castle 
 
 the whisper was barely audible her lips were an inch from his ear her head bent so low that her long hair shielded his face from the onlookers 
 
 yes he breathed back 
 
 he felt the hand on his chest contract her nails pierced him then it was withdrawn she had sat up 
 
 he is dead narcissa malfoy called to the watchers 
 
 and now they shouted now they yelled in triumph and stamped their feet and through his eyelids harry saw bursts of red and silver light shoot into the air in celebration 
 
 still feigning death on the ground he understood narcissa knew that the only way she would be permitted to enter hogwarts and find her son was as part of the conquering army she no longer cared whether voldemort won 
 
 you see screeched voldemort over the tumult harry potter is dead by my hand and no man alive can threaten me now watch crucio 
 
 harry had been expecting it knew his body would not be allowed to remain unsullied upon the forest floor it must be subjected to humiliation to prove voldemorts victory he was lifted into the air and it took all his determination to remain limp yet the pain he expected did not come he was thrown once twice three times into the air his glasses flew off and he felt his wand slide a little beneath his robes but he kept himself floppy and lifeless and when he fell to ground for the last time the clearing echoed with jeers and shrieks of laughter 
 
 now said voldemort we go to the castle and show them what has become of their hero who shall drag the body no c wait c 
 
 there was a fresh outbreak of laughter and after a few moments harry felt the ground trembling beneath him 
 
 you carry him voldemort said he will be nice and visible in your arms will he not pick up your little friend hagrid and the glasses c put on the glasses c he must be recognizable c 
 
 someone slammed harrys glasses back onto his face with deliberate force but the enormous hands that lifted him into the air were exceedingly gentle harry could feel hagrids arms trembling with the force of his heaving sobs great tears splashed down upon him as hagrid cradled harry in his arms and harry did not dare by movement or word to intimate to hagrid that all was not yet lost 
 
 move said voldemort and hagrid stumbled forward forcing his way through the trees back through the forest 
 
 branches caught at harrys hair and robes but he lay quiescent his mouth lolling open his eyes shut and in the darkness while the death eaters coed all around them and while hagrid sobbed blindly nobody looked to see whether a pulse beat in the exposed neck of harry potter 
 
 the two giants crashed along behind the death eaters harry could hear trees creaking and falling as they passed they made so much din that birds toes shrieking into the sky and even the jeers of the death eaters were drowned the victorious procession marched on toward the open ground and after a while harry could tell by the lightening of the darkness through his closed eyelids that the trees were beginning to thin 
 
 bane 
 
 hagrids unexpected bellow nearly forced harrys eyes open happy now are yeh that yeh didnt fight yeh cowardly bunch o nags are yeh happy harry potters c 
 
 hagrid could not continue but broke down in fresh tears harry wondered how many centaurs were watching their procession pass he dared not open his eyes to look some of the death eaters called insults at the centaurs as they left them behind a little later harry sensed by a freshening of the air that they had reached the edge of the forest 
 
 stop 
 
 harry thought that hagrid must have been forced to obey voldemorts command because he lurched a little and now a chill settled over them where they stood and harry heard the rasping breath of the dementors that patrolled the other trees they would not affect him now 
 
 the fact of his own survival burned inside him a talisman against them as though his fathers stag kept guardian in his heart 
 
 someone passed close by harry and he knew that it was voldemort himself because he spoke a moment later his voice magically magnified so that it swelled through the ground crashing upon harrys eardrums 
 
 harry potter is dead he was killed as he ran away trying to save himself while you lay down your lives for him we bring you his body as proof that your hero is gone 
 
 the battle is won you have lost half of your fighters my death eaters outnumber you and the boy who lived is finished there must be no more war anyone who continues to resist man woman or child will be slaughtered as will every member of their family come out of the castle now kneel before me and you shall be spared your parents and children your brothers and sisters will live and be forgiven and you will join me in the new world we shall build together 
 
 there was silence in the grounds and from the castle voldemort was so close to him that harry did not dare open his eyes again 
 
 come said voldemort and harry heard him move ahead and hagrid was forced to follow now harry opened his eyes a fraction and saw voldemort striding in front them wearing the great snake nagini around his shoulders now free of her enchanted cage but harry had no possibility of extracting the wand concealed under his robes without being noticed by the death eaters who marched on the either side of them through the slowly lightening darkness 
 
 harry sobbed hagrid oh harry harry 
 
 harry shut his eyes tight again he knew that they were approaching the castle and strained his ears to distinguish above the gleeful voices of the death eaters and their tramping footsteps signs of life from those within 
 
 stop 
 
 the death eaters came to a halt harry heard them spreading out in a line facing the open front doors of the school he could see even though his closed lids the reddish glow that meant light streamed upon him from the entrance hall he waited any moment the people for whom he had tried to die would see him lying apparently dead in hagrids arms 
 
 no 
 
 the scream was the more terrible because he had never expected or dreamed that professor mcgonagall could make such a sound he heard another women laughing nearby and knew that bellatrix gloried in mcgonagalls despair he squinted again for a single second and saw the open doorway filling with people as the survivors of the battle came out onto the front steps to face their vanquishers and see the truth of harrys death for themselves he saw voldemort standing a little in front of him stroking naginis head with a single white finger he closed his eyes again 
 
 no 
 
 no 
 
 harry harry 
 
 rons hermiones and ginnys voices were worse than mcgonagalls harry wanted nothing more than to call back yet he made himself lie silent and their cries acted like a trigger the crowd of survivors took up the cause screaming and yelling abuse at the death eathers until silence cried voldemort and there was a bang and a flash of bright light and silence was forced upon them all it is over set him down hagrid at my feet where he belongs 
 
 harry felt himself lowered onto the grass 
 
 you see said voldemort and harry felt him striding backward and forward right beside the place where he lay harry potter is dead do you understand now deluded ones he was nothing ever but a boy who relied on others to sacrifice themselves for him 
 
 he beat you yelled ron and the charm broke and the defenders of hogwarts were shouting and screaming again until a second more powerful bang extinguished their voices once more 
 
 he was killed while trying to sneak out of the castle grounds said voldemort and there was a relish in his voice for the lie killed while trying to save himself c 
 
 but voldemort broke off harry heard a scuffle and a shout then another bang a flash of light and grunt of pain he opened his eyes an infinitesimal amount someone had broken free of the crowd and charged at voldemort harry saw the figure hit the ground disarmed voldemort throwing the challengers wand aside and laughing 
 
 and who is this he said in his soft snakes hiss who has volunteered to demonstrate what happens to those who continue to fight when the battle is lost 
 
 bellatrix gave a delighted laugh 
 
 it is neville longbottom my lord the boy who has been giving the carrows so much trouble the son of the aurors remember 
 
 ah yes i remember said voldemort looking down at neville who was struggling back to his feet unarmed and unprotected standing in the between the survivors and the death eaters but you are a pureblood arent you my brave boy voldemort asked neville who stood facing him his empty hands curled in fists 
 
 so what if i am said neville loudly 
 
 you show spirit and bravery and you come of noble stock you will make a very valuable death eater we need your kind neville longbottom 
 
 ill join you when hell freezes over said neville dumbledores army he shouted and there was an answering cheer from the crowd whom voldemorts silencing charms seemed unable to hold 
 
 very well said voldemort and harry heard more danger in the silkiness of his voice than in the most powerful curse if that is your choice longbottom we revert to the original plan on your head he said quietly be it 
 
 still watching through his lashes harry saw voldemort wave his wand seconds later out of one of the castles shattered windows something that looked like a misshapen bird flew through the half light and landed in voldemorts hand he shook the mildewed object by its pointed end and it dangled empty and ragged the sorting hat 
 
 there will be no more sorting at hogwarts school said voldemort there will be no more houses the emblem shield and colors of my noble ancestor salazar slythering will suffice everyone wont they neville longbottom 
 
 he pointed his wand at neville who grew rigid and still then forced the hat onto nevilles head so that it slipped down below his eyes there were movements from the watching crowd in front of the castle and as one the death eaters raised their wands holding the fighters of hogwarts at bay 
 
 neville here is now going to demonstrate what happens to anyone foolish enough to continue to oppose me said voldemort and with a flick of his wand he caused the sorting hat to burst into flames 
 
 screams split the dawn and neville was a flame rooted to the spot unable to move and harry could not bear it he must act and then many things happened at the same moment 
 
 they heard uproar from the distant boundary of the school as what sounded like hundreds of people came swarming over the walls and pelted toward the castle uttering loud war cries at the same time grawp came lumbering around the side of the castle and yelled hagger his cry was answered by roars from voldemorts giants they ran at grawp like bull elephants making the earth quake then came hooves and the twangs of bows and arrows were suddenly falling amongst the death eaters who broke ranks shouting their surprise harry pulled the invisibility cloak from inside his robes swung it over himself and sprang to his feet as neville moved too 
 
 in one swift fluid motion neville broke free of the curse upon him the flaming hat fell off him and he drew from its depths something silver with a glittering rubied handle the slash of the silver blade could not be heard over the roar of the oncoming crowd or the sounds of the clashing giants or of the stampeding centaurs and yet it seemed to draw every eye with a single stroke neville sliced off the great snakes head which spun high into the air gleaming in the light flooding from the entrance hall and voldemorts mouth was open in a scream of fury that nobody could hear and the snakes body thudded to the ground at his feet c 
 
 hidden beneath the invisibility cloak harry cast a shield charm between neville and voldemort before the latter could raise his stamps of the battling giants hagrids yell came loudest of all 
 
 harry hagrid shouted harry c wheres harry chaos reigned the charging centaurs were scattering the death eaters everyone was feeling the giants stamping feet and nearer and nearer thundered the reinforcements that had come from who knew where harry saw great winged creatures soaring the heads of voldemorts giants thestrals and buckbeak the hippogriff scratching at their eyes while grawp punched and pummeled them and now the wizards defenders of hogwarts and death eaters alike were being forced back into the castle harry was shooting jinxes and curses at any death eater he could see and they crumpled not knowing what or who had hit them and their bodies were trampled by the retreating crowd still hidden beneath the invisibility cloak harry was buffered into the entrance hall he was searching for voldemort and saw him across the room firing spells from his wand as he backed into the great hall still screaming instructions to his followers as he sent curses flying left and right harry cast more shield charms and voldemorts victims seamus finnigan and hannah abbott darted past him into the great hall where they joined the fight already flourishing inside it 
 
 and now there were more even more people storming up the front steps and harry saw charlie weasley overtaking horace slughorn who was still wearing his emerald pajamas they seemed to have returned at the head of what looked like the families and friends of every hogwarts student who had remained to fight along with the shopkeeps and homeowners of hogsmeade the centaurs bane ronan and magorian burst into the hall with a great clatter of hooves as behind harry the door that led to the kitchens was blasted off its hinges 
 
 the of hogwarts swarmed into the entrance hall screaming and waving carving knives and cleaver and at their head the locker of regulus black bouncing on his chest was kreacher his bullfrogs voice audible even above this din fight fight fight for my master defender of fight the dark lord in the name of brave regulus fight 
 
 they were hacking and stabbing at the ankles and shim of death eaters their tiny faces alive with malice and everywhere harry looked death eaters were folding under sheer weight of numbers overcome by spells dragging arrows from wounds stabbed in the leg by elves or else simply attempting to escape but swallowed by the oncoming horde 
 
 but it was not over yet harry sped between duelers past a struggling prisoners and into he great hall 
 
 voldemort was in the center of the battle and he was striking and smiting al within reach harry could not get a clear shot but fought his way nearer still invisible and the great hall became more and more crowded as everyone who could walk forced their way inside 
 
 harry saw yaxley slammed to the floor by george and lee jordan saw dolohov fall with a scream at flitwicks hands saw walden macnair thrown across the room by hagrid hit the stone wall opposite and slide unconscious to the ground he saw ron and neville bringing down fenrir greyback aberforth stunning rookwood arthur and percy flooting thicknesse and lucius and narcissa malfoy running through the crowd not even attempting to fight screaming for their son 
 
 voldemort was now dueling mcgonagall slughorn kingsley all at once and there was a cold hatred in his face as they wove and ducked around him unable to finish him bellatrix was still fighting too fifty yards away from voldemort and like her master she dueled three at once hermione ginny and luna all battling their hardest but bellatrix was equal to them and harrys attention was diverted as a killing curse shot so close to ginny that she missed death by an inch 
 
 he changed course running at bellatrix rather than voldemort but before he had gone a few steps he was knocked sideways 
 
 not my daughter you bitch 
 
 mrs weasley threw off her cloak as she ran freeing her arms bellatrix spun on the spot roaring with laughter at the sight of the new challenger 
 
 out of my way shouted mrs weasley to the three girls and with a simple swipe of her wand she began to duel harry watched with terror and elation as molly weasleys wand slashed and twisted and bellatrix lestranges smile faltered and became a snarl jets of light flew from both wands the floor around the witches feet became hot and cracked both woman were fighting to kill 
 
 no mrs weasley cried as a few students ran forward trying to come to her aid get back get back she is mine 
 
 hundreds of people now lined the walls watching the two fights voldemort and his three opponents bellatrix and molly and harry stood invisible torn between both wanting to attack and yet to protect unable to be sure that he would not hit the innocent 
 
 what will happen to your children when ive killed you taunted bellatrix as mad as her master capering as mollys curses danced around her when mummys gone the same way as freddie 
 
 you c will c never c touch c our c children c again screamed mrs weasley 
 
 bellatrix laughed the same exhilarated laugh her cousin sirius had given as he toppled backward through the veil and suddenly harry knew what was going to happen before it did 
 
 mollys curse soared beneath bellatrixs constricted arm and hit her squarely in the chest directly over her heart 
 
 bellatrixs gloating smile froze her eyes seemed to bulge for the tiniest space of time she knew what had happened and then she toppled and the watching crowd roared and voldemord screamed 
 
 harry felt as though he turned into slow motion he saw mcgonagall kingsley and slughorn blasted backward flailing and writhing through the air as voldemorts fury at the fall of his last best lieutenant exploded with the force of a bomb voldemort raised his wand and directed it at molly weasley 
 
 protego roared harry and the shield charm expanded in the middle of the hall and voldemort stared around for the source as harry pulled off the invisibility cloak at last 
 
 the yell of shock the cheers the screams on every side of harry 
 
 hes alive were stifled at once the crowd was afraid and silence fell abruptly and completely as voldemort and harry looked at each other and began at the same moment to circle each other 
 
 i dont want anyone else to help harry said loudly and in the total silence his voice carried like a trumpet call its got to be like this its got to be me 
 
 voldemort hissed 
 
 potter doesnt mean that he said his red eyes wide this isnt how he works is it who are you going to use as a shield today potter 
 
 nobody said harry simply there are no more horcruxes its just you and me neither can live while the other survives and one of us is about to leave for good 
 
 one of us jeered voldemort and his whole body was taut and his red eyes stared a snake that was about to strike you think it will be you do you the boy who has survived by accident and because dumbledore was pulling the strings 
 
 accident was it when my mother died to save me asked harry they were still moving sideways both of them in that perfect circle maintaining the same distance from each other and for harry no face existed but voldemorts accident when i decided to fight in that graveyard accident that i didnt defend myself tonight and still survived and returned to fight again 
 
 accidents screamed voldemort but still he did not strike and the watching crowd was frozen as if petrified and of the hundreds in the hall nobody seemed to breathe but they two accident and chance and the fact that you crouched and sniveled behind the skirts of greater men and women and permitted me to kill them for you 
 
 you wont be killing anyone else tonight said harry as they circled and stared into each others eyes green into red you wont be able to kill any of them ever again dont you get it i was ready to die to stop you from hurting these people c 
 
 but you did not 
 
 c i meant to and thats what did it ive done what my mother did theyre protected from you havent you noticed how none of the spells you put on them are binding you cant torture them you cant touch them you dont learn from your mistakes riddle do you 
 
 you dare c 
 
 yes i dare said harry i know things you dont know tom riddle i know lots of important things that you dont want to hear some before you make another big mistake 
 
 voldemort did not speak but prowled in a circle and harry knew that he kept him temporarily mesmerized at bay held back by the faintest possibility that harry might indeed know a final secret 
 
 is it love again said voldemort his snakes face jeering dumbledore favorite solution love which he claimed conquered death though love did not stop him falling from the tower and breaking like and old waxwork love which did not prevent me stamping out your muddblood mother like a cockroach potter c and nobody seems to love you enough to run forward this time and take my curse so what will stop you dying now when i strike 
 
 just one thing said harry and still they circled each other wrapped in each other held apart by nothing but the last secret 
 
 if it is not love that will save you this time said voldemort you must believe that you have magic that i do not or else a weapon more powerful than mine 
 
 i believe both said harry and he saw shock flit across the snakelike face though it was instantly dispelled voldemort began to laugh and the sound was more frightening than his screams humorless and insane it echoed around the silent hall 
 
 you think you know more magic than i do he said than i than lord voldemort who has performed magic that dumbledore himself never dreamed of 
 
 oh he dreamed of it said harry but he knew more than you knew enough not to do what youve done 
 
 you mean he was weak screamed voldemort too weak to dare too weak to take what might have been his what will be mine 
 
 no he was cleverer than you said harry a better wizard a better man 
 
 i brought about the death of albus dumbledore 
 
 you thought you did said harry but you were wrong 
 
 for the first time the watching crowd stirred as the hundreds of people around the walls drew breath as one 
 
 dumbledore is dead voldemort hurled the words at harry as in the marble tomb in the grounds of this castle i have seen it potter and he will not return 
 
 yes dumbledore is dead said harry calmly but you didnt have him killed he chose his own manner of dying chose it months before he died arranged the whole thing with the man you thought was your servant 
 
 what childish dream is this said voldemort but still he did not strike and his red eyes did not waver from harrys 
 
 severus snape wasnt yours said harry snape was dumbledores dumbledores from the moment you starting hunting down my mother and you never realized it because of the thing you cant understand you never saw snape cast a patronus did you riddle 
 
 voldemort did not answer they continued to circle each other like wolves about to tear each other apart 
 
 snapes patronus was a doe said harry the same as my mothers because he loved her for nearly all of his life from the time when they were children you should have realized he said as he saw voldemorts nostrils flare he asked you to spare her life didnt he 
 
 he desired her that was all sneered voldemort but when she had gone he agreed that there were other women and of purer blood worthier of him c 
 
 of course he told you that said harry but he was dumbledores spy from the moment you threatened her and hes been working against you ever since dumbledore was already dying when snape finished him 
 
 it matters not shrieked voldemort who had followed every word with rapt attention but now let out a cackle of mad laughter it matters not whether snape was mine or dumbledores or what petty obstacles they tried to put in my path i crushed them as i crushed your mother snapes supposed great love oh but it all makes sense potter and in ways that you do not understand 
 
 dumbledore was trying to keep the elder wand from me he intended that snape should be the true master of the wand but i got there ahead of you little boy c i reached the wand before you could get your hands on it i understood the truth before you caught up i killed severus snape three hours ago and the elder wand the deathstick the wand of destiny is truly mine dumbledores last plan went wrong harry potter 
 
 yeah it did said harry youre right but before you try to kill me id advise you think what youve done think and try for some remorse riddle 
 
 what is this 
 
 of all the things that harry had said to him beyond any revelation or taunt nothing had socked voldemort like this harry saw is pupils contract to thin slits saw the skin around his eyes whiten 
 
 its your one last chance said harry its all youve got left ive seen what youll be otherwise be a man try 
 
 try for some remorse 
 
 you dare c said voldemort again 
 
 yes i dare said harry because dumbledores last plan hasnt backfired on me at all its backfired on you riddle 
 
 voldemorts hand was trembling on the elder wand and harry gripped dracos very tightly the moment he knew was seconds away 
 
 that wand still isnt working properly for you because you murdered the wrong person severus snape was never the true master of the elder wand he never defeated dumbledore 
 
 he killed c 
 
 arent you listening snape never beat dumbledore dumbledores death was planned between them dumbledore intended to die undefeated the wands last true master if all had gone as planned the wands power would have died with him because it had never been won from him 
 
 but then potter dumbledore as good as gave me the wand voldemorts voice shook with malicious pleasure i stole the wand from its last masters tomb i removed it against the last masters wishes its power is mine 
 
 you still dont get it riddle do you possessing the wand isnt enough holding it using it doesnt make it really yours didnt you listen to ollivander the wand chooses the wizard the elder wand recognized a new master before dumbledore died someone who never even laid a hand on it the new master removed the wand from dumbledore against his will never realizing exactly what he had done or that the worlds most dangerous wand had given him its allegiance 
 
 voldemorts chest rose and fell rapidly and harry could feel the curse coming feel it building inside the wand pointed at his face 
 
 the true master of the elder wand was draco malfoy 
 
 blank shock showed in voldemorts face for a moment but then it was gone 
 
 but what does it matter he said softly even if you are right potter it makes no difference to you and me you no longer have the phoenix wand we duel on skill alone and after i have killed you i can attend to draco malfoy 
 
 but youre too late said harry youve missed your chance i got there first i overpowered draco weeks ago i took his wand from him 
 
 harry twitched the hawthorn wand and he felt the eyes of everyone in the hall upon it 
 
 so it all comes down to this doesnt it whispered harry does the wand in your hand know its last master was disarmed because if it does i am the true master of the elder wand 
 
 a burst suddenly across the enchanted sky above them as an edge of dazzling sun appeared over the sill of the nearest window the light hit both of their faces at the same time so that voldemorts was suddenly a flaming blur harry heard the high voice shriek as he too yelled his best hope to the heavens pointing dracos wand 
 
 avada kedavra 
 
 expelliarmus 
 
 the bang was like a cannon blast and the golden flames that erupted between them at the dead center of the circle they had been treading marked the point where the spells collided harry saw voldemorts green jet meet his own spell saw the elder wand fly high dark against the sunrise spinning across the enchanted ceiling like the head of nagini spinning through the air toward the master it would not kill who had come to take full possession of it at last and harry with the unerring skill of the seeker caught the wand in his free hand as voldemort fell backward arms splayed the slit pupils of the scarlet eyes rolling upward tom riddle hit the floor with a mundane finality his body feeble and shrunken the white hands empty the snakelike face vacant and unknowing voldemort was dead killed by his own rebounding curse and harry stood with two wands in his hand staring down at his enemys shell 
 
 one shivering second of silence the shock of the moment suspended and then the tumult broke around harry as the screams and the cheers and the roars of the watchers rent the air the fierce new sun dazzled the windows as they thundered toward him and the first to reach him were ron and hermione and it was their arms that were wrapped around him their incomprehensible shouts that deafened him then ginny neville and luna were there and then all the weasleys and hagrid and kingsley and mcgonagall and flitwick and sprout and harry could not hear a word that anyone was shouting not tell whose hands were seizing him pulling him trying to hug some part of him hundreds of them pressing in all of them determined to touch the boy who lived the reason it was over at last c the sun rose steadily over hogwarts and the great hall blazed with life and light harry was an indispensable part of the mingled outpourings of jubilation and mourning of grief and celebration they wanted him there with them their leader and symbol their savior and their guide and that he had not slept that he craved the company of only a few of them seemed to occur to no one he must speak to the bereaved clasp their hands witness their tears receive their thanks hear the news now creeping in from every quarter as the morning drew on that the imperiused up and down the country had come back to themselves that death eaters were fleeing or else being captured that the innocent of azkaban were being released at that very moment and that kingsley shacklebolt had been named temporary minister of magic 
 
 they moved voldemorts body and laid it in a chamber off the hall away form the bodies of fred tonks lupin colin creevey and fifty others who had died fighting him mcgonagall had replaced the house tables but nobody was sitting according to house anymore all were jumbled together teachers and pupils ghosts and parents centaurs and and firenze lay recovering in the corner and grawp peered in through a smashed window and people were throwing food into his laughing mouth after a while exhausted and drained harry found himself sitting on a bench beside luna 
 
 id want some peace and quiet if it were me she said 
 
 id love some he replied 
 
 ill distract them all she said use your cloak 
 
 and before he could say a word she had cried oooh look a blibbering humdinger and pointed out the window everyone who heard looked around and harry slid the cloak up over himself and got to his feet 
 
 now he could move through the hall without interference he spotted ginny two tables away she was sitting with her head on her mothers shoulder there would be time to talk later hours and days and maybe years in which to talk he saw neville the sword of gryffindor lying beside his plate as he ate surrounded by a knot of fervent admirers along the aisle between the tables he walked and he spotted the three malfoys huddled together as though unsure whether or not they were supposed to be there but nobody was paying them any attention everywhere he looked he saw families reunited and finally he saw the two whose company he craved most 
 
 its me he muttered crouching down between them will you come with me 
 
 they stood up at once and together he ron and hermione left the great hall great chunks were missing from the marble staircase part of the balustrade gone and rubble and bloodstains occurred ever few steps as their climbed 
 
 somewhere in the distance they could hear peeves zooming through the corridors singing a victory song of his own composition 
 
 
 
 
 we did it we bashed them wee potters the one 
 
 and voldys gone moldy so now lets have fun 
 
 
 
 
 really gives a feeling for the scope and tragedy of the thing doesnt it said ron pushing open a door to let harry and hermione through 
 
 happiness would come harry though but at the moment it was muffled by exhaustion and the pain of losing fred and lupin and tonks pierced him like a physical wound every few steps most of all he felt the most stupendous relief and a longing to sleep but first he owed an explanation to ron and hermione who had stuck with him for so long and who deserved the truth 
 
 painstakingly he recounted what he had seem in the pensieve and what had happened in the forest and they had not even begun to express all their shock and amazement when at last they arrived at the place to which they had been walking though none of them had mentioned their destination 
 
 since he had last seen it the gargoyle guarding the entrance to the headmasters study had been knocked aside it stood lopsided looking a little and harry wondered whether it would be able to distinguish passwords anymore 
 
 can we go up he asked the gargoyle 
 
 feel free groaned the statue 
 
 they clambered over him and onto the spiral stone staircase that moved slowly upward like an escalator harry pushed open the door at the top 
 
 he had one brief glimpse of the stone pensieve on the desk where he had left it and then an earsplitting noise made him cry out thinking of curses and returning death eaters and the rebirth of voldemort c 
 
 but it was applause all around the walls the headmasters and headmistresses of hogwarts were giving him a standing ovation they waved their hats and in some cases their wigs they reached through their frames to grip each others hands they danced up and down on their chairs in which they have been painted dilys derwent sobbed unashamedly dexter fortescue was waving his and phineas niggelus called in his high reedy voice and let it be noted that slytherin house played its part let our contribution not be forgotten 
 
 but harry had eyes only for the man who stood in the largest portrait directly behind the headmasters chair tears were sliding down from behind the spectacles into the long silver beard and the pride and the gratitude emanating from him filled harry with the same balm as phoenix song 
 
 at last harry held up his hands and the portraits fell respectfully silent beaming and mopping their eyes and waiting eagerly for him to speak he directed his words at dumbledore however and chose them with enormous care exhausted and though he was he must make one last effort seeking one last piece of advice 
 
 the thing that was hidden in the snitch he began i dropped it in the forest i dont know exactly where but im not going to go looking for it again do you agree 
 
 my dear boy i do said dumbledore while his fellow pictures looked confused and curious a wise and courageous decision but no less than i would have expected of you does anyone know else know where it fell 
 
 no one said harry and dumbledore nodded his satisfaction 
 
 im going to keep ignotuss present though said harry and dumbledore beamed 
 
 but of course harry it is yours forever until you pass it on 
 
 and then theres this 
 
 harry held up the elder wand and ron and hermione looked at it with a reverence that even in his befuddled and state harry did not like to see 
 
 i dont want it said harry 
 
 what said ron loudly are you mental 
 
 i know its powerful said harry wearily but i was happier with mine so 
 
 he rummaged in the pouch hung around his neck and pulled out the two halves of holly still just connected by the finest threat of phoenix feather hermione had said that they could not be repaired that the damage was too severe all he knew was that if this did not work nothing would 
 
 he laid the broken wand upon the headmasters desk touched it with the very tip of the elder wand and said reparo 
 
 as his wand resealed red sparks flew out of its end harry knew that he had succeeded he picked up the holly and phoenix wand and felt a sudden warmth in his fingers as though wand and hand were rejoicing at their reunion 
 
 im putting the elder wand he told dumbledore who was watching him with enormous affection and admiration back where it came from it can stay there if i die a natural death like ignotus its power will be broken wont it the previous master will never have been defeated thatll be the end of it 
 
 dumbledore nodded they smiled at each other 
 
 are you sure said ron there was the faintest trace of longing in his voice as he looked at the elder wand 
 
 i think harrys right said hermione quietly 
 
 that wands more trouble than its worth said harry and quite honestly he turned away from the painted portraits thinking now only of the bed lying waiting for him in gryffindor tower and wondering whether kreacher might bring him a sandwich there ive had enough trouble for a lifetime

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the buckwheat 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 very often after a violent a field of buckwheat 
 appears blackened and singed as if a flame of fire had passed over 
 it the country people say that this appearance is caused by 
 lightning but i will tell you what the sparrow says and the 
 sparrow heard it from an old which grew near a field of 
 buckwheat and is there still it is a large venerable tree though 
 a little crippled by age the trunk has been split and out of the 
 crevice grass and brambles grow the tree bends slightly and the branches hang quite down to the ground just like green hair 
 corn grows in the surrounding fields not only rye and barley but 
 oats that when ripe look like a number of little golden 
 sitting on a bough the corn has a smiling look and the 
 heaviest and richest ears bend their heads low as if in pious 
 humility once there was also a field of buckwheat and this field was 
 exactly opposite to old the buckwheat did not bend like 
 the other grain but erected its head proudly and stiffly on the stem 
 i am as valuable as any other corn said he and i am much 
 handsomer my flowers are as beautiful as the bloom of the apple 
 blossom and it is a pleasure to look at us do you know of anything 
 prettier than we are you old 
 
 and the nodded his head as if he would say indeed i 
 do 
 
 but the buckwheat spread itself out with pride and said 
 stupid tree he is so old that grass grows out of his body 
 there arose a very terrible storm all the folded 
 their leaves together or bowed their little heads while the storm 
 passed over them but the buckwheat stood erect in its pride bend 
 your head as we do said the flowers 
 
 i have no occasion to do so replied the buckwheat 
 
 bend your head as we do cried the ears of corn the angel of 
 the storm is coming his wings spread from the sky above to the 
 earth beneath he will strike you down before you can cry for mercy 
 
 but i will not bend my head said the buckwheat 
 
 close your flowers and bend your leaves said the old 
 do not look at the lightning when the cloud bursts even 
 men cannot do that in a flash of lightning heaven opens and we can 
 look in but the sight will strike even human beings blind what 
 then must happen to us who only grow out of the earth and are so 
 inferior to them if we venture to do so 
 
 inferior indeed said the buckwheat now i intend to have a 
 peep into heaven proudly and boldly he looked up while the 
 lightning flashed across the sky as if the whole world were in flames 
 
 when the dreadful storm had passed the flowers and the corn 
 raised their drooping heads in the pure still air refreshed by the 
 rain but the buckwheat lay like a weed in the field burnt to 
 blackness by the lightning the branches of the old 
 rustled in the wind and large fell from his green leaves 
 as if the old willow were weeping then the sparrows asked why he was weeping when all around him seemed so cheerful see they said how the sun shines and the clouds float in the blue sky do you not smell the sweet perfume from flower and bush wherefore do you weep old then the willow told them of the haughty pride of the buckwheat and of the punishment which followed in consequence 
 
 this is the story told me by the sparrows one evening when i 
 begged them to relate some tale to me

the ballot or the bullet 
 malcolm x 
 delivered april in cleveland oh 
 mr moderator brother lomax brothers and sisters friends and enemies i just believe everyone in here is a friend and i want to leave anybody out the question tonight as i understand it is the negro revolt and where do we go from here or what next in my little humble way of understanding it it points toward either the ballot or the bullet 
 before we try and explain what is meant by the ballot or the bullet i would like to clarify something concerning myself still a muslim my religion is still islam my personal belief just as adam clayton powell is a christian minister who heads the abyssinian baptist church in new york but at the same time takes part in the political struggles to try and bring about rights to the black people in this country and dr martin luther king is a christian minister down in atlanta georgia who heads another organization fighting for the civil rights of black people in this country and reverend galamison i guess heard of him is another christian minister in new york who has been deeply involved in the school boycotts to eliminate segregated education well i myself am a minister not a christian minister but a muslim minister and i believe in action on all fronts by whatever means necessary 
 although still a muslim not here tonight to discuss my religion not here to try and change your religion not here to argue or discuss anything that we differ about because time for us to submerge our differences and realize that it is best for us to first see that we have the same problem a common problem a problem that will make you catch hell whether a baptist or a methodist or a muslim or a nationalist whether educated or illiterate whether you live on the boulevard or in the alley going to catch hell just like i am all in the same boat and we all are going to catch the same hell from the same man he just happens to be a white man all of us have suffered here in this country political oppression at the hands of the white man economic exploitation at the hands of the white man and social degradation at the hands of the white man 
 now in speaking like this it mean that but it does mean and if the white man want us to be let him stop oppressing and exploiting and degrading us whether we are christians or muslims or nationalists or agnostics or atheists we must first learn to forget our differences if we have differences let us differ in the closet when we come out in front let us not have anything to argue about until we get finished arguing with the man if the late president kennedy could get together with khrushchev and exchange some wheat we certainly have more in common with each other than kennedy and khrushchev had with each other 
 if we do something real soon i think have to agree that going to be forced either to use the ballot or the bullet one or the other in it that time is running out time has run out 
 threatens to be the most explosive year america has ever witnessed the most explosive year why also a political year the year when all of the white politicians will be back in the negro community jiving you and me for some votes the year when all of the white political crooks will be right back in your and my community with their false promises building up our hopes for a letdown with their trickery and their treachery with their false promises which they intend to keep as they nourish these dissatisfactions it can only lead to one thing an explosion and now we have the type of black man on the scene in america today sorry brother lomax who just intend to turn the other cheek any longer 
 let anybody tell you anything about the odds are against you if they draft you they send you to korea and make you face million chinese if you can be brave over there you can be brave right here these odds as great as those odds and if you fight here you will at least know what fighting for 
 not a politician not even a student of politics in fact not a student of much of anything not a democrat not a republican and i even consider myself an american if you and i were americans be no problem those honkies that just got off the boat already americans polacks are already americans the italian refugees are already americans everything that came out of europe every thing is already an american and as long as you and i have been over here we americans yet 
 well i am one who believe in deluding myself not going to sit at your table and watch you eat with nothing on my plate and call myself a diner sitting at the table make you a diner unless you eat some of on that plate being here in america make you an american being born here in america make you an american why if birth made you american you need any legislation you need any amendments to the constitution you be faced with filibustering in washington right now they have to pass legislation to make a polack an american 
 no not an american one of the million black people who are the victims of americanism one of the million black people who are the victims of democracy nothing but disguised hypocrisy so not standing here speaking to you as an american or a patriot or a or a no not i speaking as a victim of this american system and i see america through the eyes of the victim i see any american dream i see an american nightmare 
 these million victims are waking up their eyes are coming open beginning to see what they used to only look at becoming politically mature they are realizing that there are new political trends from coast to coast as they see these new political trends possible for them to see that every time an election the races are so close that they have to have a recount they had to recount in massachusetts to see who was going to be governor it was so close it was the same way in rhode island in minnesota and in many other parts of the country and the same with kennedy and nixon when they ran for president it was so close they had to count all over again well what does this mean it means that when white people are evenly divided and black people have a bloc of votes of their own it is left up to them to determine going to sit in the white house and going to be in the dog house 
 lt was the black vote that put the present administration in washington your vote your dumb vote your ignorant vote your wasted vote put in an administration in washington that has seen fit to pass every kind of legislation imaginable saving you until last then filibustering on top of that and your and my leaders have the audacity to run around clapping their hands and talk about how much progress making and what a good president we have if he good in texas he sure be good in washington because texas is a lynch state it is in the same breath as mississippi no different only they lynch you in texas with a texas accent and lynch you in mississippi with a mississippi accent and these negro leaders have the audacity to go and have some coffee in the white house with a texan a southern cracker all he is and then come out and tell you and me that going to be better for us because since from the south he knows how to deal with the southerners what kind of logic is that let eastland be president from the south too he should be better able to deal with them than johnson 
 in this present administration they have in the house of representatives democrats to only republicans they control of the house vote why they pass something that will help you and me in the senate there are senators who are of the democratic party only of them are republicans why the democrats have got the government sewed up and the one who sewed it up for them and what have they given you for it four years in office and just now getting around to some legislation just now after everything else is gone out of the way going to sit down now and play with you all summer long the same old giant con game that they call filibuster all those are in cahoots together you ever think not in cahoots together for the man that is heading the filibuster is a man from georgia named richard russell when johnson became president the first man he asked for when he got back to washington was dicky how tight they are his boy his pal his buddy but playing that old con game one of them makes believe for you and got it fixed where the other one is so tight against you he never has to keep his promise 
 so time in to wake up and when you see them coming up with that kind of conspiracy let them know your eyes are open and let them know you something else wide open too got to be the ballot or the bullet the ballot or the bullet if afraid to use an expression like that you should get on out of the country you should get back in the cotton patch you should get back in the alley they get all the negro vote and after they get it the negro gets nothing in return all they did when they got to washington was give a few big negroes big jobs those big negroes need big jobs they already had jobs camouflage trickery treachery not trying to knock out the democrats for the republicans get to them in a minute but it is true you put the democrats first and the democrats put you last 
 look at it the way it is what alibis do they use since they control congress and the senate what alibi do they use when you and i ask well when are you going to keep your promise they blame the dixiecrats what is a dixiecrat a democrat a dixiecrat is nothing but a democrat in disguise the titular head of the democrats is also the head of the dixiecrats because the dixiecrats are a part of the democratic party the democrats have never kicked the dixiecrats out of the party the dixiecrats bolted themselves once but the democrats put them out imagine these lowdown southern segregationists put the northern democrats down but the northern democrats have never put the dixiecrats down no look at that thing the way it is they have got a con game going on a political con game and you and i are in the middle time for you and me to wake up and start looking at it like it is and trying to understand it like it is and then we can deal with it like it is 
 the dixiecrats in washington control the key committees that run the government the only reason the dixiecrats control these committees is because they have seniority the only reason they have seniority is because they come from states where negroes vote this is not even a government based on democracy lt is not a government that is made up of representatives of the people half of the people in the south even vote eastland is not even supposed to be in washington half of the senators and congressmen who occupy these key positions in washington are there illegally are there unconstitutionally 
 i was in washington a week ago thursday when they were debating whether or not they should let the bill come onto the floor and in the back of the room where the senate meets a huge map of the united states and on that map it shows the location of negroes throughout the country and it shows that the southern section of the country the states that are most heavily concentrated with negroes are the ones that have senators and congressmen standing up filibustering and doing all other kinds of trickery to keep the negro from being able to vote this is pitiful but not pitiful for us any longer actually pitiful for the white man because soon now as the negro awakens a little more and sees the vise that in sees the bag that in sees the real game that in then the going to develop a new tactic 
 these senators and congressmen actually violate the constitutional amendments that guarantee the people of that particular state or county the right to vote and the constitution itself has within it the machinery to expel any representative from a state where the voting rights of the people are violated you even need new legislation any person in congress right now who is there from a state or a district where the voting rights of the people are violated that particular person should be expelled from congress and when you expel him removed one of the obstacles in the path of any real meaningful legislation in this country in fact when you expel them you need new legislation because they will be replaced by black representatives from counties and districts where the black man is in the majority not in the minority 
 if the black man in these southern states had his full voting rights the key dixiecrats in washington d c which means the key democrats in washington would lose their seats the democratic party itself would lose its power it would cease to be powerful as a party when you see the amount of power that would be lost by the democratic party if it were to lose the dixiecrat wing or branch or element you can see where against the interests of the democrats to give voting rights to negroes in states where the democrats have been in complete power and authority ever since the civil war you just belong to that party without analyzing it 
 i say again not not not just questioning their sincerity and some of the strategy that been using on our people by promising them promises that they intend to keep when you keep the democrats in power keeping the dixiecrats in power i doubt that my good brother lomax will deny that a vote for a democrat is a vote for a dixiecrat why in time now for you and me to become more politically mature and realize what the ballot is for what supposed to get when we cast a ballot and that if we cast a ballot going to end up in a situation where going to have to cast a bullet either a ballot or a bullet 
 in the north they do it a different way they have a system known as gerrymandering whatever that means it means when negroes become too heavily concentrated in a certain area and begin to gain too much political power the white man comes along and changes the district lines you may say why do you keep saying white man because the white man who does it i ever seen any negro changing any lines they let him get near the line the white man who does this and usually the white man who grins at you the most and pats you on the back and is supposed to be your friend he may be friendly but not your friend 
 so what trying to impress upon you in essence is this you and i in america are faced not with a segregationist conspiracy faced with a government conspiracy everyone filibustering is a senator the government everyone finagling in washington is a congressman the government you have anybody putting blocks in your path but people who are a part of the government the same government that you go abroad to fight for and die for is the government that is in a conspiracy to deprive you of your voting rights deprive you of your economic opportunities deprive you of decent housing deprive you of decent education you need to go to the employer alone it is the government itself the government of america that is responsible for the oppression and exploitation and degradation of black people in this country and you should drop it in their lap this government has failed the negro this democracy has failed the negro and all these white liberals have definitely failed the negro 
 so where do we go from here first we need some friends we need some new allies the entire struggle needs a new interpretation a broader interpretation we need to look at this thing from another angle from the inside as well as from the outside to those of us whose philosophy is black nationalism the only way you can get involved in the struggle is give it a new interpretation that old interpretation excluded us it kept us out so giving a new interpretation to the struggle an interpretation that will enable us to come into it take part in it and these who have been dillydallying and pussy footing and compromising we intend to let them pussyfoot and dillydally and compromise any longer 
 how can you thank a man for giving you already yours how then can you thank him for giving you only part of already yours you even made progress if being given to you you should have had already not progress and i love my brother lomax the way he pointed out right back where we were in not even as far up as we were in behind where we were in more segregation now than there was in more racial animosity more racial hatred more racial violence today in than there was in where is the progress 
 and now facing a situation where the young coming up they want to hear that turn stuff no in jacksonville those were teenagers they were throwing molotov cocktails negroes have never done that before but it shows you a new deal coming in new thinking coming in new strategy coming in be molotov cocktails this month hand grenades next month and something else next month be ballots or be bullets be liberty or it will be death the only difference about this kind of death be reciprocal you know what is meant by reciprocal one of brother words i stole it from him i usually deal with those big words because i usually deal with big people i deal with small people i find you can get a whole lot of small people and whip hell out of a whole lot of big people they got anything to lose and got every thing to gain and let you know in a minute it takes two to tango when i go you go 
 the black nationalists those whose philosophy is black nationalism in bringing about this new interpretation of the entire meaning of civil rights look upon it as meaning as brother lomax has pointed out equality of opportunity well justified in seeking civil rights if it means equality of opportunity because all doing there is trying to collect for our investment our mothers and fathers invested sweat and blood three hundred and ten years we worked in this country without a dime in return i mean without a dime in return you let the white man walk around here talking about how rich this country is but you never stop to think how it got rich so quick it got rich because you made it rich 
 you take the people who are in this audience right now poor all poor as individuals our weekly salary individually amounts to hardly anything but if you take the salary of everyone in here collectively fill up a whole lot of baskets a lot of wealth if you can collect the wages of just these people right here for a year be rich richer than rich when you look at it like that think how rich uncle sam had to become not with this handful but millions of black people your and my mother and father who work an shift but worked from see in the morning until see at night and worked for nothing making the white man rich making uncle sam rich this is our investment this is our contribution our blood 
 not only did we give of our free labor we gave of our blood every time he had a call to arms we were the first ones in uniform we died on every battlefield the white man had we have made a greater sacrifice than anybody standing up in america today we have made a greater contribution and have collected less civil rights for those of us whose philosophy is black nationalism means give it to us now wait for next year give it to us yesterday and not fast enough 
 i might stop right here to point out one thing whenever going after something that belongs to you anyone depriving you of the right to have it is a criminal understand that whenever you are going after something that is yours you are within your legal rights to lay claim to it and anyone who puts forth any effort to deprive you of that which is yours is breaking the law is a criminal and this was pointed out by the supreme court decision it outlawed segregation 
 which means segregation is against the law which means a segregationist is breaking the law a segregationist is a criminal you label him as anything other than that and when you demonstrate against segregation the law is on your side the supreme court is on your side 
 now who is it that opposes you in carrying out the law the police department itself with police dogs and clubs whenever you demonstrate against segregation whether it is segregated education segregated housing or anything else the law is on your side and anyone who stands in the way is not the law any longer they are breaking the law they are not representatives of the law any time you demonstrate against segregation and a man has the audacity to put a police dog on you kill that dog kill him telling you kill that dog i say it if they put me in jail tomorrow kill that dog then put a stop to it now if these white people in here want to see that kind of action get down and tell the mayor to tell the police department to pull the dogs in all you have to do if you do it someone else will 
 if you take this kind of stand your little children will grow up and look at you and think shame if you take an uncompromising stand i mean go out and get violent but at the same time you should never be nonviolent unless you run into some nonviolence nonviolent with those who are nonviolent with me but when you drop that violence on me then made me go insane and not responsible for what i do and the way every negro should get any time you know within the law within your legal rights within your moral rights in accord with justice then die for what you believe in but die alone let your dying be reciprocal this is what is meant by equality good for the goose is good for the gander 
 when we begin to get in this area we need new friends we need new allies we need to expand the struggle to a higher level to the level of human rights whenever you are in a struggle whether you know it or not you are confining yourself to the jurisdiction of uncle sam no one from the outside world can speak out in your behalf as long as your struggle is a struggle civil rights comes within the domestic affairs of this country all of our african brothers and our asian brothers and our brothers cannot open their mouths and interfere in the domestic affairs of the united states and as long as civil rights this comes under the jurisdiction of uncle sam 
 but the united nations has known as the charter of human rights it has a committee that deals in human rights you may wonder why all of the atrocities that have been committed in africa and in hungary and in asia and in latin america are brought before the un and the negro problem is never brought before the un this is part of the conspiracy this old tricky blue eyed liberal who is supposed to be your and my friend supposed to be in our corner supposed to be subsidizing our struggle and supposed to be acting in the capacity of an adviser never tells you anything about human rights they keep you wrapped up in civil rights and you spend so much time barking up the tree you even know a tree on the same floor 
 when you expand the struggle to the level of human rights you can then take the case of the black man in this country before the nations in the un you can take it before the general assembly you can take uncle sam before a world court but the only level you can do it on is the level of human rights civil rights keeps you under his restrictions under his jurisdiction civil rights keeps you in his pocket civil rights means asking uncle sam to treat you right human rights are something you were born with human rights are your rights human rights are the rights that are recognized by all nations of this earth and any time any one violates your human rights you can take them to the world court 
 uncle hands are dripping with blood dripping with the blood of the black man in this country the hypocrite he has the audacity yes he has imagine him posing as the leader of the free world the free world and you over here singing we shall overcome expand the struggle to the level of human rights take it into the united nations where our african brothers can throw their weight on our side where our asian brothers can throw their weight on our side where our brothers can throw their weight on our side and where million chinamen are sitting there waiting to throw their weight on our side 
 let the world know how bloody his hands are let the world know the hypocrisy practiced over here let it be the ballot or the bullet let him know that it must be the ballot or the bullet 
 when you take your case to washington taking it to the criminal responsible like running from the wolf to the fox all in cahoots together they all work political chicanery and make you look like a chump before the eyes of the world here you are walking around in america getting ready to be drafted and sent abroad like a tin soldier and when you get over there people ask you what are you fighting for and you have to stick your tongue in your cheek no take uncle sam to court take him before the world 
 by ballot i only mean freedom you know i disagree with lomax on this issue that the ballot is more important than the dollar can i prove it yes look in the un there are poor nations in the un yet those poor nations can get together with their voting power and keep the rich nations from making a move they have one nation one vote everyone has an equal vote and when those brothers from asia and africa and the darker parts of this earth get together their voting power is sufficient to hold sam in check or russia in check or some other section of the earth in check so the ballot is most important 
 right now in this country if you and i million what we are africans who are in america nothing but africans nothing but africans in fact get farther calling yourself african instead of negro africans catch hell the only one catching hell they have to pass bills for africans an african can go anywhere he wants right now all got to do is tie your head up right go anywhere you want just stop being a negro change your name to hoogagagooba show you how silly the white man is dealing with a silly man a friend of mine very dark put a turban on his head and went into a restaurant in atlanta before they called themselves desegregated he went into a white restaurant he sat down they served him and he said what would happen if a negro came in here and there sitting black as night but because he had his head wrapped up the waitress looked back at him and says why there no nigger dare come in here 
 so dealing with a man whose bias and prejudice are making him lose his mind his intelligence every day frightened he looks around and sees taking place on this earth and he sees that the pendulum of time is swinging in your direction the dark people are waking up losing their fear of the white man no place where fighting right now is he winning everywhere fighting fighting someone your and my complexion and beating him he win any more won his last battle he failed to win the korean war he win it he had to sign a truce a loss 
 any time uncle sam with all his machinery for warfare is held to a draw by some rice eaters lost the battle he had to sign a truce not supposed to sign a truce supposed to be bad but not bad any more bad as long as she can use her hydrogen bomb but she use hers for fear russia might use hers russia use hers for fear that sam might use his so both of them are they use the weapon because weapon nullifies the so the only place where action can take place is on the ground and the white man win another war fighting on the ground those days are over the black man knows it the brown man knows it the red man knows it and the yellow man knows it so they engage him in guerrilla warfare not his style got to have heart to be a guerrilla warrior and he got any heart telling you now 
 i just want to give you a little briefing on guerrilla warfare because before you know it before you know it it takes heart to be a guerrilla warrior because on your own in conventional warfare you have tanks and a whole lot of other people with you to back you up planes over your head and all that kind of stuff but a guerrilla is on his own all you have is a rifle some sneakers and a bowl of rice and all you need and a lot of heart the japanese on some of those islands in the pacific when the american soldiers landed one japanese sometimes could hold the whole army off just wait until the sun went down and when the sun went down they were all equal he would take his little blade and slip from bush to bush and from american to american the white soldiers cope with that whenever you see a white soldier that fought in the pacific he has the shakes he has a nervous condition because they scared him to death 
 the same thing happened to the french up in french indochina people who just a few years previously were rice farmers got together and ran the french army out of indochina you need it modern warfare today work this is the day of the guerrilla they did the same thing in algeria algerians who were nothing but bedouins took a rine and sneaked off to the hills and de gaulle and all of his highfalutin war machinery defeat those guerrillas nowhere on this earth does the white man win in a guerrilla warfare not his speed just as guerrilla warfare is prevailing in asia and in parts of africa and in parts of latin america got to be mighty naive or got to play the black man cheap if you think some day going to wake up and find that got to be the ballot or the bullet 
 l would like to say in closing a few things concerning the muslim mosque inc which we established recently in new york city true muslims and our religion is islam but we mix our religion with our politics and our economics and our social and civil activities not any more we keep our religion in our mosque after our religious services are over then as muslims we become involved in political action economic action and social and civic action we become involved with anybody any where any time and in any manner designed to eliminate the evils the political economic and social evils that are afflicting the people of our community 
 the political philosophy of black nationalism means that the black man should control the politics and the politicians in his own community no more the black man in the black community has to be into the science of politics so he will know what politics is supposed to bring him in return be throwing out any ballots a ballot is like a bullet you throw your ballots until you see a target and if that target is not within your reach keep your ballot in your pocket 
 the political philosophy of black nationalism is being taught in the christian church being taught in the naacp being taught in core meetings being taught in sncc student nonviolent coordinating committee meetings being taught in muslim meetings being taught where nothing but atheists and agnostics come together being taught everywhere black people are fed up with the dillydallying pussyfooting compromising approach that been using toward getting our freedom we want freedom now but not going to get it saying we shall overcome got to fight until we overcome 
 the economic philosophy of black nationalism is pure and simple it only means that we should control the economy of our community why should white people be running all the stores in our community why should white people be running the banks of our community why should the economy of our community be in the hands of the white man why if a black man move his store into a white community you tell me why a white man should move his store into a black community the philosophy of black nationalism involves a program in the black community in regards to economics our people have to be made to see that any time you take your dollar out of your community and spend it in a community where you live the community where you live will get poorer and poorer and the community where you spend your money will get richer and richer 
 then you wonder why where you live is always a ghetto or a slum area and where you and i are concerned not only do we lose it when we spend it out of the community but the white man has got all our stores in the community tied up so that though we spend it in the community at sundown the man who runs the store takes it over across town somewhere got us in a vise 
 so the economic philosophy of black nationalism means in every church in every civic organization in every fraternal order time now for our people to be come conscious of the importance of controlling the economy of our community if we own the stores if we operate the businesses if we try and establish some industry in our own community then developing to the position where we are creating employment for our own kind once you gain control of the economy of your own community then you have to picket and boycott and beg some cracker downtown for a job in his business 
 the social philosophy of black nationalism only means that we have to get together and remove the evils the vices alcoholism drug addiction and other evils that are destroying the moral fiber of our community we our selves have to lift the level of our community the standard of our community to a higher level make our own society beautiful so that we will be satisfied in our own social circles and be running around here trying to knock our way into a social circle where not wanted so i say in spreading a gospel such as black nationalism it is not designed to make the black man the white man you know him already but to make the black man himself change the white mind you change his mind and that whole thing about appealing to the moral conscience of america conscience is bankrupt she lost all conscience a long time ago uncle sam has no conscience 
 they know what morals are they try and eliminate an evil because evil or because illegal or because immoral they eliminate it only when it threatens their existence so wasting your time appealing to the moral conscience of a bankrupt man like uncle sam if he had a conscience straighten this thing out with no more pressure being put upon him so it is not necessary to change the white mind we have to change our own mind you change his mind about us got to change our own minds about each other we have to see each other with new eyes we have to see each other as brothers and sisters we have to come together with warmth so we can develop unity and harmony necessary to get this problem solved ourselves how can we do this how can we avoid jealousy how can we avoid the suspicion and the divisions that exist in the community tell you how 
 i have watched how billy graham comes into a city spreading what he calls the gospel of christ which is only white nationalism what he is billy graham is a white nationalist a black nationalist but since the natural tendency for leaders to be jealous and look upon a powerful figure like graham with suspicion and envy how is it possible for him to come into a city and get all the cooperation of the church leaders think because church leaders that they have weaknesses that make them envious and jealous no got it not an accident that when they want to choose a cardinal as pope i over there in rome they get in a closet so you hear them cussing and fighting and carrying on 
 billy graham comes in preaching the gospel of christ he evangelizes the gospel he stirs everybody up but he never tries to start a church if he came in trying to start a church all the churches would be against him so he just comes in talking about christ and tells everybody who gets christ to go to any church where christ is and in this way the church cooperates with him so going to take a page from his book 
 our gospel is black nationalism not trying to threaten the existence of any organization but spreading the gospel of black nationalism anywhere a church that is also preaching and practicing the gospel of black nationalism join that church if the naacp is preaching and practicing the gospel of black nationalism join the naacp if core is spreading and practicing the gospel of black nationalism join core join any organization that has a gospel for the uplift of the black man and when you get into it and see them pussyfooting or compromising pull out of it because not black nationalism find another one 
 and in this manner the organizations will increase in number and in quantity and in quality and by august it is then our intention to have a black nationalist convention which will consist of delegates from all over the country who are interested in the political economic and social philosophy of black nationalism after these delegates convene we will hold a seminar we will hold discussions we will listen to everyone we want to hear new ideas and new solutions and new answers and at that time if we see fit then to form a black nationalist party form a black nationalist party if necessary to form a black nationalist army form a black nationalist army be the ballot or the bullet be liberty or be death 
 time for you and me to stop sitting in this country letting some cracker senators northern crackers and southern crackers sit there in washington and come to a conclusion in their mind that you and i are supposed to have civil rights no white man going to tell me anything about my rights brothers and sisters always remember if it take senators and congressmen and presidential proclamations to give freedom to the white man it is not necessary for legislation or proclamation or supreme court decisions to give freedom to the black man you let that white man know if this is a country of freedom let it be a country of freedom and if not a country of freedom change it 
 we will work with anybody anywhere at any time who is genuinely interested in tackling the problem nonviolently as long as the enemy is nonviolent but violent when the enemy gets violent work with you on the drive work with you on rent strikes work with you on school boycotts i believe in any kind of integration not even worried about it because i know not going to get it anyway not going to get it because afraid to die got to be ready to die if you try and force yourself on the white man because get just as violent as those crackers in mississippi right here in cleveland but we will still work with you on the school boycotts be cause against a segregated school system a segregated school system produces children who when they graduate graduate with crippled minds but this does not mean that a school is segregated because all black a segregated school means a school that is controlled by people who have no real interest in it whatsoever 
 let me explain what i mean a segregated district or community is a community in which people live but outsiders control the politics and the economy of that community they never refer to the white section as a segregated community the section a segregated community why the white man controls his own school his own bank his own economy his own politics his own everything his own community but he also controls yours when under someone control segregated always give you the lowest or the worst that there is to offer but it mean segregated just because you have your own got to control your own just like the white man has control of his you need to control yours 
 you know the best way to get rid of segregation the white man is more afraid of separation than he is of integration segregation means that he puts you away from him but not far enough for you to be out of his jurisdiction separation means gone and the white man will integrate faster than let you separate so we will work with you against the segregated school system because criminal because it is absolutely destructive in every way imaginable to the minds of the children who have to be exposed to that type of crippling education 
 last but not least i must say this concerning the great controversy over rifles and shotguns the only thing that ever said is that in areas where the government has proven itself either unwilling or unable to defend the lives and the property of negroes time for negroes to defend themselves article number two of the constitutional amendments provides you and me the right to own a rifle or a shotgun it is constitutionally legal to own a shotgun or a rifle this mean going to get a rifle and form battalions and go out looking for white folks although be within your rights i mean be justified but that would be illegal and we do anything illegal if the white man want the black man buying rifles and shotguns then let the government do its job 
 all and let the white man come to you and ask you what you think about what malcolm says why you old uncle tom he would never ask you if he thought you were going to say amen no he is making a tom out of you so this mean forming rifle clubs and going out looking for people but it is time in if you are a man to let that man know 
 if not going to do his job in running the government and providing you and me with the protection that our taxes are supposed to be for since he spends all those billions for his defense budget he certainly begrudge you and me spending or for a or i hope you understand go out shooting people but any time brothers and sisters and especially the men in this audience some of you wearing congressional medals of honor with shoulders this wide chests this big muscles that big any time you and i sit around and read where they bomb a church and murder in cold blood not some grownups but four little girls while they were praying to the same god the white man taught them to pray to and you and i see the government go down and find who did it 
 why this man he can find eichmann hiding down in argentina somewhere let two or three american soldiers who are minding somebody business way over in south vietnam get killed and send battleships sticking his nose in their business he wanted to send troops down to cuba and make them have what he calls free elections this old cracker who have free elections in his own country 
 no if you never see me another time in your life if i die in the morning die saying one thing the ballot or the bullet the ballot or the bullet 
 if a negro in has to sit around and wait for some cracker senator to filibuster when it comes to the rights of black people why you and i should hang our heads in shame you talk about a march on washington in you seen anything some more going down in 
 and this time not going like they went last year not going singing we shall overcome not going with white friends not going with placards already painted for them not going with tickets going with one way tickets and if they want that army going down there tell them to bring the filibuster to a halt 
 the black nationalists going to wait lyndon b johnson is the head of the democratic party if for civil rights let him go into the senate next week and declare himself let him go in there right now and declare himself let him go in there and denounce the southern branch of his party let him go in there right now and take a moral stand right now not later tell him wait until election time if he waits too long brothers and sisters he will be responsible for letting a condition develop in this country which will create a climate that will bring seeds up out of the ground with vegetation on the end of them looking like something these people never dreamed of in the ballot or the bullet 
 thank you

 the karenins husband and wife continued living in the same house met every day but were complete strangers to one another alexei alexandrovich made it a rule to see his wife every day so that the servants might have no grounds for suppositions but avoided dining at home vronsky was never at alexei house but anna saw him away from home and her husband was aware of it 
 the position was one of torture for all three and not one of them would have been equal to enduring this position for a single day had it not been for the expectation that it would change that it was merely a temporary painful difficulty which would pass over alexei alexandrovich hoped that this passion would pass as everything does pass that everyone would forget about it and his name would remain unsullied anna on whom the position depended and for whom it was more poignant than for any other endured it because she not merely hoped but firmly believed that it would all very soon be settled and come right she had not the least idea what would settle the situation but she firmly believed that something would now very soon turn up vronsky unaccountably followed her lead hoping too that something independent of him would be sure to clear up all difficulties 
 in the middle of the winter vronsky spent a very tiresome week a foreign prince who had come on a visit to peterburg was put under his charge and he had to show him the sights worth seeing vronsky was of distinguished appearance he possessed moreover the art of behaving with respectful dignity and was used to having to do with such grand personages that was how he came to be put in charge of the prince but he felt his duties to be very irksome the prince was anxious to miss nothing about which he would be asked at home had he seen this and that in russia and on his own account he was anxious to enjoy to the utmost all russian forms of amusement vronsky was obliged to be his guide in satisfying both these inclinations the mornings they spent driving to look at places of interest the evenings they passed enjoying the national amusements the prince enjoyed a health exceptional even among princes by gymnastics and careful attention to his person he had brought himself to such a point that in spite of his excesses in pleasure he looked as fresh as a big glossy green dutch cucumber the prince had traveled a great deal and considered one of the chief advantages of modern facilities of communication the accessibility of the pleasures of all nations he had been in spain and there had indulged in serenades and had made friends with a spanish girl who played the mandolin in switzerland he had killed chamois in england he had galloped in a red coat over hedges and killed two hundred pheasants on a bet in turkey he had got into a harem in india he had traveled on an elephant and now in russia he wished to taste all the peculiarly russian forms of pleasure 
 vronsky who was as it were chief master of the ceremonies to him was at great pains to distribute all the russian amusements suggested by various persons to the prince they had race horses and russian pancakes and bear hunts and troikas and gypsy choruses and drinking orgies with the russian accompaniment of broken crockery and the prince with surprising ease fell in with the russian spirit he smashed trays full of crockery sat with a gypsy girl on his knee and seemed to be asking what more or does the whole russian spirit consist in just this 
 in reality of all the russian entertainments the prince liked best french actresses a ballet dancer and champagne vronsky was used to princes but either because he had himself changed of late or that he was in too close proximity to the prince that week seemed fearfully wearisome to him the whole of that week he experienced unceasingly a sensation such as a man might have who has been put in charge of a dangerous madman who is afraid of the madman and at the same time from being with him fears for his own reason vronsky was continually conscious of the necessity of never for a second relaxing the tone of stern official respectfulness so that he might not himself be insulted the manner of treating the very people who to surprise were ready to descend to any depths to provide him with russian amusements was contemptuous his criticisms of russian women whom he wished to study more than once made vronsky crimson with indignation the chief reason why the prince was so particularly disagreeable to vronsky was that he could not help seeing himself in him and what he saw in this mirror did not gratify his he was a very stupid and a very and a very healthy and a very man and nothing else he was a gentleman it was true and vronsky could not deny it he was equable and not cringing with his superiors was free and ingratiating in his behavior with his equals and was contemptuously indulgent with his inferiors vronsky was himself the same and regarded it as a great merit to be so but to this prince he was an inferior and his contemptuous and indulgent attitude to him revolted him 
 brainless beef can i be like that he reflected 
 be that as it might when on the seventh day he parted from the prince who was starting for moscow and received his thanks he was happy to be rid of his uncomfortable position and the unpleasant reflection of himself he said to him at the station on their return from a bear hunt at which they had had a display of russian kept up all night

 vronsky had that winter got his promotion was now a colonel had left the regiment and was living alone after having some lunch he lay down on the sofa immediately and in five minutes memories of the hideous scenes he had witnessed during the last few days were jumbled and joined to a mental image of anna and of the peasant one of the encompassing people who had played an important part in the bear hunt and vronsky fell asleep he waked up in the dark trembling with horror and made haste to light a candle what was it what what was the dreadful thing i dreamed yes yes the peasant bear hunter i think a little dirty man with a disheveled beard was stooping down doing something and all of a sudden he began saying some strange words in french yes there was nothing else in the dream he said to himself but why was it so awful he vividly recalled the peasant again and those incomprehensible french words the peasant had uttered and a chill of horror ran down his spine 
 what nonsense thought vronsky and glanced at his watch 
 it was eight already he rang up his servant dressed in haste and went out on the steps completely forgetting the dream and only worried at being late as he drove up to the karenins entrance he looked at his watch and saw it was ten minutes to nine a high narrow carriage with a pair of grays was standing at the entrance he recognized carriage she is coming to me thought vronsky and better she should i like going into that house but no matter i hide myself he thought and with that manner peculiar to him from childhood as of a man who has nothing to be ashamed of vronsky got out of his sleigh and went to the door the door opened and the hall porter with a rug on his arm called the carriage vronsky though he did not usually notice details noticed at this moment the amazed expression with which the porter glanced at him in the very doorway vronsky almost ran up against alexei alexandrovich the gas jet threw its full light on the bloodless sunken face under the black hat and on the white cravat brilliant against the beaver of the coat fixed dull eyes were fastened upon face vronsky bowed and alexei alexandrovich chewing his lips lifted his hand to his hat and went on vronsky saw him get into the carriage without looking back receive the rug and the opera glasses through the window and disappear vronsky went into the hall his brows were scowling and his eyes gleamed with a proud and angry light in them 
 what a situation he thought if he would fight would stand up for his honor i could act could express my feelings but this weakness or baseness he puts me in the position of playing false which i never meant and never mean to do 
 ideas had changed since the day of his conversation with anna in the vrede garden unconsciously yielding to the weakness of anna who had surrendered herself up to him utterly and simply looked to him to decide her fate ready to submit to anything he had long ceased to think that their liaison might end as he had thought then his ambitious plans had retreated into the background again and feeling that he had got out of that circle of activity in which everything was definite he had given himself up entirely to his passion and that passion was binding him more and more closely to her 
 he was still in the hall when he caught the sound of her retreating footsteps he realized she had been expecting him had listened for him and was now going back to the drawing room 
 no she cried on seeing him and at the first sound of her voice the tears came into her eyes no if things are to go on like this the end will come much much too soon

 you met him she asked when they had sat down at the table in the lamplight punished you see for being late 
 yes but how was it he to be at the council 
 he had been and come back and was going out somewhere again but that matter talk about it where have you been with the prince still 
 she knew every detail of his existence he was going to say that he had been up all night and had dropped asleep but looking at her thrilled and rapturous face he was ashamed and he said he had had to report on the departure 
 but over now he is gone 
 thank god over you believe how insufferable been for me 
 why so it the life all of you all young men always lead she said knitting her brows and taking up the crochet work that was lying on the table she began drawing the hook out of it without looking at vronsky 
 i gave that life up long ago said he wondering at the change in her face and trying to divine its meaning and i confess he said with a smile showing his thick white teeth this week been as it were looking at myself in a glass seeing that life and i like it 
 she held the work in her hands but did not crochet and looked at him with strange shining and hostile eyes 
 this morning liza came to see me not afraid to call on me in spite of the countess lidia ivanovna she put in and she told me about your athenian evening how loathsome 
 i was just going to say 
 she interrupted him 
 it was that thrse you used to know 
 i was just saying 
 how disgusting you are you men how is it you understand that a woman can never forget that she said getting more and more angry and so letting him see the cause of her irritation especially a woman who cannot know your life what do i know what have i ever known she said only what you tell me and how do i know whether you tell me the truth 
 anna you hurt me you trust me i told you that i a thought i lay bare to you 
 yes yes she said evidently trying to suppress her jealous thoughts but if only you knew how wretched i am i believe you i believe you what were you saying 
 but he could not at once recall what he had been going to say these fits of jealousy which of late had been more and more frequent with her horrified him and however much he tried to disguise the fact made him feel cold to her although he knew the cause of her jealousy was her love for him how often he had told himself that her love was happiness and now she loved him as a woman can love when love has outweighed for her all the good things of life and he was much further from happiness than when he had followed her from moscow then he had thought himself unhappy but happiness was before him now he felt that the best happiness was already left behind she was utterly unlike what she had been when he first saw her both morally and physically she had changed for the worse she had broadened out all over and in her face at the time when she was speaking of the actress there was an evil expression of hatred that distorted it he looked at her as a man looks at a faded flower he has gathered with difficulty recognizing in it the beauty for which he picked and ruined it and in spite of this he felt that then when his love was stronger he could if he had greatly wished it have torn that love out of his heart but now when as at this moment it seemed to him he felt no love for her he knew that his bond with her could not be broken 
 well well what was it you were going to say about the prince i have driven away the fiend i have she added the fiend was the name they had given her jealousy what did you begin to tell me about the prince why did you find it so tiresome 
 oh it was intolerable he said trying to pick up the thread of his interrupted thought he does not improve on closer acquaintance if you want him defined here he is a prime animal such as takes medals at the cattle shows and nothing more he said with a tone of vexation that interested her 
 no how so she replied seen a great deal anyway cultured 
 an utterly different culture their culture cultivated one sees simply to be able to despise culture as they despise everything but animal pleasures 
 but you all care for these animal pleasures she said and again he noticed a dark look in her eyes that avoided him 
 how is it defending him he said smiling 
 not defending him nothing to me but i imagine if you had not cared for those pleasures yourself you might have got out of them but it affords you satisfaction to gaze at thrse in the attire of eve 
 again again the devil vronsky said taking the hand she had laid on the table and kissing it 
 yes but i help it you know what i have suffered waiting for you i believe not jealous not jealous i believe you when here near me but when away somewhere leading your life alone so incomprehensible to me 
 she turned away from him pulled the hook at last out of the crochet work and rapidly with the help of her forefinger began working loop after loop of the wool that was dazzlingly white in the lamplight while the slender wrist moved swiftly nervously in its embroidered cuff 
 how was it then where did you meet alexei alexandrovich her voice sounded in an unnatural and jarring tone 
 we ran against each other in the doorway 
 and he bowed to you like this 
 she drew a long face and her eyes quickly transformed her expression folded her hands and vronsky suddenly saw in her beautiful face the very expression with which alexei alexandrovich had bowed to him he smiled while she laughed gaily with that sweet deep laugh which was one of her greatest charms 
 i understand him in the least said vronsky if after your avowal to him at your summer villa he had broken with you if he had challenged me but this i understand how can he put up with such a position he feels it evident 
 he she said sneeringly perfectly satisfied 
 what are we all miserable for when everything might be so well 
 except for him i know him the falsity in which utterly steeped could one with any feeling live as he is living with me he understands nothing and feels nothing could a man of any feeling live in the same house with his unfaithful wife could he talk to her call her my dear 
 and again she could not help mimicking him anna ma chre anna dear 
 not a man not a human being a mannikin no one knows him but i know him oh if been in his place long ago have killed have torn to pieces a wife like me i have said anna ma chre not a man a ministerial machine he understand that your wife that outside that superfluous talk of him 
 unfair very unfair dearest said vronsky trying to soothe her but never mind talk of him tell me what been doing what is the matter why are you unwell and what did the doctor say 
 she looked at him with mocking amusement evidently she had hit on other absurd and grotesque aspects in her husband and was awaiting the moment to give expression to them 
 but he went on 
 i imagine that not illness but your condition when will it be 
 the ironical light died away in her eyes but a different smile a consciousness of something he did not know what and of quiet melancholy came over her face 
 soon soon you say that our position is miserable that we must put an end to it if you knew how terrible it is to me what i would give to be able to love you freely and unafraid i should not torture myself and torture you with my jealousy and it will come soon but not as we expect 
 and at the thought of how it would come she seemed so pitiable to herself that tears came into her eyes and she could not go on she laid on his sleeve her hand shining with its whiteness and its rings in the lamplight 
 it come as we suppose i mean to say this to you but made me soon soon all will be over and we shall all all be at peace and suffer no more 
 i understand he said understanding her 
 you asked when soon and i live through it interrupt me and she made haste to speak i know it i know for certain i shall die and very glad i shall die and release myself and you 
 tears dropped from her eyes he bent down over her hand and began kissing it trying to hide his emotion which he knew had no sort of grounds though he could not control it 
 yes better so she said tightly gripping his hand the only way the only way left us 
 he had recovered himself and lifted his head 
 how absurd what absurd nonsense you are talking 
 no the truth 
 what the truth 
 that i shall die i have had a dream 
 a dream repeated vronsky and instantly he recalled the peasant of his dream 
 yes a dream she said a long while since i dreamed it i dreamed that i ran into my bedroom that i had to get something there to find out something you know how it is in dreams she said her eyes wide with horror and in the bedroom in the corner stood something 
 oh what nonsense how can you believe 
 but she would not let him interrupt her what she was saying was too important to her 
 and the something turned round and i saw it was a peasant with a disheveled beard a little man and dreadful i wanted to run away but he bent down over a sack and was fumbling there with his hands 
 she showed how he had moved his hands there was terror in her face and vronsky remembering his dream felt the same terror filling his soul 
 he was fumbling and kept talking quickly quickly in french and you know he burred il faut le battre le fer le broyer le ptrir and in my horror i tried to wake up and woke up but woke up in the dream and i began asking myself what it meant and kornei said to me in childbirth die die and i woke up 
 what nonsense what nonsense said vronsky but he felt himself that there was no conviction in his voice 
 but talk of it ring the bell have tea and stay a little now not long i shall 
 but all at once she stopped the expression of her face instantaneously changed horror and excitement were suddenly replaced by a look of soft solemn blissful attention he could not comprehend the meaning of the change she was listening to the stirring of the new life within her

 you met him she asked when they had sat down at the table in the lamplight punished you see for being late 
 yes but how was it he to be at the council 
 he had been and come back and was going out somewhere again but that matter talk about it where have you been with the prince still 
 she knew every detail of his existence he was going to say that he had been up all night and had dropped asleep but looking at her thrilled and rapturous face he was ashamed and he said he had had to report on the departure 
 but over now he is gone 
 thank god over you believe how insufferable been for me 
 why so it the life all of you all young men always lead she said knitting her brows and taking up the crochet work that was lying on the table she began drawing the hook out of it without looking at vronsky 
 i gave that life up long ago said he wondering at the change in her face and trying to divine its meaning and i confess he said with a smile showing his thick white teeth this week been as it were looking at myself in a glass seeing that life and i like it 
 she held the work in her hands but did not crochet and looked at him with strange shining and hostile eyes 
 this morning liza came to see me not afraid to call on me in spite of the countess lidia ivanovna she put in and she told me about your athenian evening how loathsome 
 i was just going to say 
 she interrupted him 
 it was that thrse you used to know 
 i was just saying 
 how disgusting you are you men how is it you understand that a woman can never forget that she said getting more and more angry and so letting him see the cause of her irritation especially a woman who cannot know your life what do i know what have i ever known she said only what you tell me and how do i know whether you tell me the truth 
 anna you hurt me you trust me i told you that i a thought i lay bare to you 
 yes yes she said evidently trying to suppress her jealous thoughts but if only you knew how wretched i am i believe you i believe you what were you saying 
 but he could not at once recall what he had been going to say these fits of jealousy which of late had been more and more frequent with her horrified him and however much he tried to disguise the fact made him feel cold to her although he knew the cause of her jealousy was her love for him how often he had told himself that her love was happiness and now she loved him as a woman can love when love has outweighed for her all the good things of life and he was much further from happiness than when he had followed her from moscow then he had thought himself unhappy but happiness was before him now he felt that the best happiness was already left behind she was utterly unlike what she had been when he first saw her both morally and physically she had changed for the worse she had broadened out all over and in her face at the time when she was speaking of the actress there was an evil expression of hatred that distorted it he looked at her as a man looks at a faded flower he has gathered with difficulty recognizing in it the beauty for which he picked and ruined it and in spite of this he felt that then when his love was stronger he could if he had greatly wished it have torn that love out of his heart but now when as at this moment it seemed to him he felt no love for her he knew that his bond with her could not be broken 
 well well what was it you were going to say about the prince i have driven away the fiend i have she added the fiend was the name they had given her jealousy what did you begin to tell me about the prince why did you find it so tiresome 
 oh it was intolerable he said trying to pick up the thread of his interrupted thought he does not improve on closer acquaintance if you want him defined here he is a prime animal such as takes medals at the cattle shows and nothing more he said with a tone of vexation that interested her 
 no how so she replied seen a great deal anyway cultured 
 an utterly different culture their culture cultivated one sees simply to be able to despise culture as they despise everything but animal pleasures 
 but you all care for these animal pleasures she said and again he noticed a dark look in her eyes that avoided him

 alexei alexandrovich after meeting vronsky on his own steps drove as he had intended to the italian opera he sat through two acts there and saw everyone he wanted to see on returning home he carefully scrutinized the hatstand and noticing that there was not a military overcoat there he went as usual to his own room but contrary to his usual habit he did not go to bed he walked up and down his study till three in the morning the feeling of furious anger with his wife who would not observe the proprieties and keep to the one stipulation he had laid on her not to receive her lover in her own house gave him no peace she had not complied with his request and he was bound to punish her and carry out his threat obtain a divorce and take away his son he knew all the difficulties connected with this course but he had said he would do it and now he must carry out his threat countess lidia ivanovna had hinted that this was the best way out of his position and of late the obtaining of divorces had been brought to such a pitch of perfection that alexei alexandrovich saw a possibility of overcoming the formal difficulties misfortunes never come singly and the affairs of the reorganization of the native tribes and of the irrigation of the lands of the zaraisky province had brought such official worries upon alexei alexandrovich that he had been of late in a continual state of extreme irritability 
 he did not sleep the whole night and his fury growing in a sort of vast arithmetical progression reached its highest limits in the morning he dressed in haste and as though carrying his cup full of wrath and fearing to spill any over fearing to lose with his wrath the energy necessary for the interview with his wife he went into her room directly he heard she was up 
 anna who had thought she knew her husband so well was amazed at his appearance when he went in to her his brow was lowering and his eyes stared darkly before him avoiding her eyes his mouth was tightly and contemptuously shut in his walk in his gestures in the sound of his voice there was a determination and firmness such as his wife had never seen in him he went into her room and without greeting her walked straight up to her writing table and taking her keys opened a drawer 
 what do you want she cried 
 your letters he said 
 not here she said shutting the drawer but from that action he saw he had guessed right and roughly pushing away her hand he quickly snatched a portfolio in which he knew she used to put her most important papers she tried to pull the portfolio away but he pushed her back 
 sit down i have to speak to you he said putting the portfolio under his arm and squeezing it so tightly with his elbow that his shoulder stood up 
 amazed and intimidated she gazed at him in silence 
 i told you that i would not allow you to receive your lover in this house 
 i had to see him to 
 she stopped not finding a reason 
 i do not enter into the details of why a woman wants to see her lover 
 i meant i only she said flushing hotly this coarseness of his angered her and gave her courage surely you must feel how easy it is for you to insult me she said 
 an honest man and an honest woman may be insulted but to tell a thief a thief is simply la constatation fait 
 this cruelty is something new i did not know in you 
 you call it cruelty for a husband to give his wife liberty giving her the honorable protection of his name simply on the condition of observing the proprieties is that cruelty 
 worse that cruel base if you want to know anna cried in a rush of hatred and getting up she was about to leave the room 
 no he shrieked in his shrill voice which pitched a note even higher than usual and his big hands clutching her by the arm so violently that red marks were left from the bracelet he was squeezing he forcibly made her sit down in her place base if you care to use that word what is base is to forsake husband and child for a lover while you eat your bread 
 she bowed her head she did not say what she had said the evening before to her lover that he was her husband and her husband was superfluous she did not even think of that she felt all the justice of his words and only said softly 
 you cannot describe my position as worse than i feel it to be myself but what are you saying all this for 
 what am i saying it for what for he went on as angrily so that you may know that since you have not carried out my wishes in regard to observing outward decorum i will take measures to put an end to this state of things 
 soon very soon it will end anyway she said and again at the thought of death near at hand and now desired tears came into her eyes 
 it will end sooner than you and your lover have planned if you must have the satisfaction of animal passion 
 alexei alexandrovich i say not generous but not like a gentleman to strike anyone down 
 yes you only think of yourself but the sufferings of a man who was your husband have no interest for you you care that his whole life is ruined that he is seff seff 
 alexei alexandrovich was speaking so quickly that he began to stammer and was utterly unable to articulate the word suffering in the end he pronounced it saffering she wanted to laugh and was immediately ashamed that anything could amuse her at such a moment and for the first time for an instant she felt for him put herself in his place and was sorry for him but what could she say or do her head sank and she sat silent he too was silent for some time and then began speaking in a frigid less shrill voice emphasizing random words that had no special significance 
 i came to tell you he said 
 she glanced at him no it was my fancy she thought recalling the expression of his face when he stumbled over the word suffering no can a man with those dull eyes with that complacency feel anything 
 i cannot change anything she whispered 
 i have come to tell you that i am going tomorrow to moscow and shall not return again to this house and you will receive notice of what i decide through the lawyer into whose hands i shall entrust the task of getting a divorce my son is going to my said alexei alexandrovich with an effort recalling what he had meant to say about his son 
 you take seriozha to hurt me she said looking at him from under her brows you do not love him leave me seriozha 
 yes i have lost even my affection for my son because he is associated with the repulsion i feel for you but still i shall take him 
 and he was going away but now she detained him 
 alexei alexandrovich leave me seriozha she whispered once more i have nothing else to say leave seriozha till my i shall soon be confined leave him 
 alexei alexandrovich flared up and snatching his hand from her he went out of the room without a word

 chapter 
 
 the waiting room of the celebrated peterburg lawyer was full when alexei alexandrovich entered it three ladies an old lady a young lady and a wife and three gentlemen one a german banker with a ring on his finger the second a merchant with a beard and the third a government clerk in official uniform with a cross on his neck had obviously been waiting a long while already two clerks were writing at tables with scratching pens the appurtenances of the writing tables about which alexei alexandrovich was himself very fastidious were exceptionally good he could not help observing this one of the clerks without getting up turned fretfully to alexei alexandrovich his eyes 
 what is it you wish 
 my business has to do with the lawyer 
 he is engaged the clerk responded severely and he pointed with his pen at the persons waiting and went on writing 
 he spare time to see me said alexei alexandrovich 
 he has no time free he is always busy kindly wait your turn 
 then i must trouble you to give him my card alexei alexandrovich said with dignity seeing the impossibility of preserving his incognito 
 the clerk took the card and obviously not approving of what he read on it went to the door 
 alexei alexandrovich was in principle in favor of the publicity of legal proceedings though for some higher official considerations he disliked the application of the principle in russia and disapproved of it as far as he could disapprove of anything instituted by authority of the emperor his whole life had been spent in administrative work and consequently when he did not approve of anything his disapproval was softened by the recognition of the inevitability of mistakes and the possibility of reform in every department in the new public law courts he disliked the restrictions laid on the lawyers conducting cases but till then he had had nothing to do with the law courts and so had disapproved of their publicity simply in theory now his disapprobation was strengthened by the unpleasant impression made on him in the waiting room 
 he will be out right away said the clerk and two minutes later there did actually appear in the doorway the large figure of an old student of jurisprudence who had been consulting with the lawyer and the lawyer himself 
 the lawyer was a little squat bald man with a dark reddish beard long eyebrows and beetling brow he was attired as though for a wedding from his cravat to his double watch chain and shoes his face was clever and rustic but his dress was dandified and in bad taste 
 pray walk in said the lawyer addressing alexei alexandrovich and gloomily ushering karenin in before him he closed the door you sit down he indicated an armchair at a writing table covered with papers he sat down himself and rubbing his little hands with short fingers covered with white hairs he bent his head on one side but as soon as he was settled in this position a moth flew over the table the lawyer with a swiftness that could never have been expected of him opened his hands caught the moth and resumed his former attitude 
 before beginning to speak of my business said alexei alexandrovich following the movements with wondering eyes i ought to observe that the matter about which i have to speak to you is to be a secret 
 the drooping reddish mustaches were stirred by a scarcely perceptible smile 
 i should not be a lawyer if i could not keep the secrets confided to me but if you would like proof 
 alexei alexandrovich glanced at his face and saw that the shrewd gray eyes were laughing and seemed to know all about it already 
 you know my name alexei alexandrovich resumed 
 i know you and the good again he caught a moth work you are doing like every russian said the lawyer bowing 
 alexei alexandrovich sighed plucking up his courage but having once made up his mind he went on in his shrill voice without timidity or hesitation accentuating a word here and there 
 i have the misfortune alexei alexandrovich began to be a deceived husband and i desire to break off all relations with my wife by legal means that is to be divorced but do this so that my son may not remain with his mother 
 the gray eyes tried not to laugh but they were dancing with irrepressible glee and alexei alexandrovich saw that it was not simply the delight of a man who has just got a profitable job there was triumph and joy there was a gleam like the malignant gleam he had seen in his eyes 
 you desire my assistance in securing a divorce 
 yes precisely but i ought to warn you that i may be wasting your time and attention i have come simply to consult you as a preliminary step i want a divorce but the form which it may take is of great consequence to me it is very possible that if that form does not correspond with my requirements i may give up a legal action 
 oh always the case said the lawyer and always for you to decide 
 he let his eyes rest on alexei feet feeling that he might offend his client by the sight of his irrepressible amusement he looked at a moth that flew before his nose and moved his hand but did not catch it from regard for alexei situation 
 though in their general features our laws on this subject are known to me pursued alexei alexandrovich i should be glad to have an idea of the forms in which such things are done in practice 
 you would be glad the lawyer without lifting his eyes responded adopting with a certain satisfaction the tone of his remarks for me to lay before you all the methods by which you could secure what you desire 
 and on receiving an assenting nod from alexei alexandrovich he went on stealing a glance now and then at alexei face which was growing red in patches 
 divorce by our laws he said with a slight shade of disapprobation of our laws is possible as you are aware in the following cases to wait he called to a clerk who put his head in at the door but he got up all the same said a few words to him and sat down again in the following cases physical defect in the married parties desertion without communication for five years he said crooking a short finger covered with hair adultery this word he pronounced with obvious satisfaction subdivided as follows he continued to crook his fat fingers though the cases and their subdivisions could obviously not be classified together physical defect of the husband or of the wife adultery of the husband or of the wife as by now all his fingers were used up he straightened them and went on this is the theoretical view but i imagine you have done me the honor to apply to me in order to learn its application in practice and therefore guided by precedents i must inform you that in practice cases of divorce may all be reduced to the following no physical defect i may assume nor desertion 
 alexei alexandrovich bowed his head in assent 
 they may be reduced to the following adultery of one of the married parties and the detection in the fact of the guilty party by mutual agreement and failing such agreement accidental detection it must be admitted that the latter case is rarely met with in practice said the lawyer and stealing a glance at alexei alexandrovich he paused as a man selling pistols after enlarging on the advantages of each weapon might await his choice but alexei alexandrovich said nothing and therefore the lawyer went on the most usual and simple the sensible course i consider is adultery by mutual consent i should not permit myself to express it so speaking with a man of no education he said but i imagine that to you this is comprehensible 
 alexei alexandrovich was however so perturbed that he did not immediately comprehend all the reasonableness of adultery by mutual consent and his eyes expressed this uncertainty but the lawyer promptly came to his assistance 
 people cannot go on living together here you have a fact and if both are agreed about it the details and formalities become a matter of no importance and at the same time this is the simplest and most certain method 
 alexei alexandrovich understood fully now but he had religious scruples which hindered the execution of such a plan 
 that is out of the question in the present case he said only one alternative is possible involuntary detection supported by letters which i have 
 at the mention of letters the lawyer pursed up his lips and gave utterance to a thin little compassionate and contemptuous sound 
 kindly consider he began cases of that kind are as you are aware under ecclesiastical jurisdiction the reverend fathers are fond of going into the minutest details in cases of that kind he said with a smile which betrayed his sympathy with the taste of the reverend fathers letters may of course be a partial confirmation but detection in the act there must be of the most direct kind that is by eyewitnesses in fact if you do me the honor to trust me with your confidence you will do well to leave me the choice of the measures to be employed if one wants the result one must allow the means 
 if it is so alexei alexandrovich began suddenly turning white but at that moment the lawyer rose and again went to the door to speak to the intruding clerk 
 tell her we haggle over fees he said and returned to alexei alexandrovich 
 on his way back he caught unobserved another moth nice state my rep curtains will be in by the summer he thought frowning 
 and so you were saying he said 
 i will communicate my decision to you by letter said alexei alexandrovich getting up and he clutched at the table after standing a moment in silence he said from your words i may consequently conclude that a divorce may be obtained i would ask you to let me know what your terms are 
 it may be obtained if you give me complete liberty of action said the lawyer without answering his question when can i count on receiving word from you he asked moving toward the door his eyes and his shoes shining 
 in a time you will be kind enough to communicate to me your answer as to whether you will undertake to conduct the case and on what terms 
 very good sir 
 the lawyer bowed respectfully let his client out of the door and left alone gave himself up to his sense of amusement he felt so mirthful that contrary to his rule he made a reduction in his terms to the haggling lady and gave up catching moths finally deciding that next winter he must have the furniture covered with velvet like

 the waiting room of the celebrated peterburg lawyer was full when alexei alexandrovich entered it three ladies an old lady a young lady and a wife and three gentlemen one a german banker with a ring on his finger the second a merchant with a beard and the third a government clerk in official uniform with a cross on his neck had obviously been waiting a long while already two clerks were writing at tables with scratching pens the appurtenances of the writing tables about which alexei alexandrovich was himself very fastidious were exceptionally good he could not help observing this one of the clerks without getting up turned fretfully to alexei alexandrovich his eyes 
 what is it you wish 
 my business has to do with the lawyer 
 he is engaged the clerk responded severely and he pointed with his pen at the persons waiting and went on writing 
 he spare time to see me said alexei alexandrovich 
 he has no time free he is always busy kindly wait your turn 
 then i must trouble you to give him my card alexei alexandrovich said with dignity seeing the impossibility of preserving his incognito 
 the clerk took the card and obviously not approving of what he read on it went to the door 
 alexei alexandrovich was in principle in favor of the publicity of legal proceedings though for some higher official considerations he disliked the application of the principle in russia and disapproved of it as far as he could disapprove of anything instituted by authority of the emperor his whole life had been spent in administrative work and consequently when he did not approve of anything his disapproval was softened by the recognition of the inevitability of mistakes and the possibility of reform in every department in the new public law courts he disliked the restrictions laid on the lawyers conducting cases but till then he had had nothing to do with the law courts and so had disapproved of their publicity simply in theory now his disapprobation was strengthened by the unpleasant impression made on him in the waiting room 
 he will be out right away said the clerk and two minutes later there did actually appear in the doorway the large figure of an old student of jurisprudence who had been consulting with the lawyer and the lawyer himself 
 the lawyer was a little squat bald man with a dark reddish beard long eyebrows and beetling brow he was attired as though for a wedding from his cravat to his double watch chain and shoes his face was clever and rustic but his dress was dandified and in bad taste 
 pray walk in said the lawyer addressing alexei alexandrovich and gloomily ushering karenin in before him he closed the door you sit down he indicated an armchair at a writing table covered with papers he sat down himself and rubbing his little hands with short fingers covered with white hairs he bent his head on one side but as soon as he was settled in this position a moth flew over the table the lawyer with a swiftness that could never have been expected of him opened his hands caught the moth and resumed his former attitude 
 before beginning to speak of my business said alexei alexandrovich following the movements with wondering eyes i ought to observe that the matter about which i have to speak to you is to be a secret 
 the drooping reddish mustaches were stirred by a scarcely perceptible smile 
 i should not be a lawyer if i could not keep the secrets confided to me but if you would like proof 
 alexei alexandrovich glanced at his face and saw that the shrewd gray eyes were laughing and seemed to know all about it already 
 you know my name alexei alexandrovich resumed 
 i know you and the good again he caught a moth work you are doing like every russian said the lawyer bowing 
 alexei alexandrovich sighed plucking up his courage but having once made up his mind he went on in his shrill voice without timidity or hesitation accentuating a word here and there 
 i have the misfortune alexei alexandrovich began to be a deceived husband and i desire to break off all relations with my wife by legal means that is to be divorced but do this so that my son may not remain with his mother 
 the gray eyes tried not to laugh but they were dancing with irrepressible glee and alexei alexandrovich saw that it was not simply the delight of a man who has just got a profitable job there was triumph and joy there was a gleam like the malignant gleam he had seen in his eyes 
 you desire my assistance in securing a divorce 
 yes precisely but i ought to warn you that i may be wasting your time and attention i have come simply to consult you as a preliminary step i want a divorce but the form which it may take is of great consequence to me it is very possible that if that form does not correspond with my requirements i may give up a legal action 
 oh always the case said the lawyer and always for you to decide 
 he let his eyes rest on alexei feet feeling that he might offend his client by the sight of his irrepressible amusement he looked at a moth that flew before his nose and moved his hand but did not catch it from regard for alexei situation 
 though in their general features our laws on this subject are known to me pursued alexei alexandrovich i should be glad to have an idea of the forms in which such things are done in practice 
 you would be glad the lawyer without lifting his eyes responded adopting with a certain satisfaction the tone of his remarks for me to lay before you all the methods by which you could secure what you desire 
 and on receiving an assenting nod from alexei alexandrovich he went on stealing a glance now and then at alexei face which was growing red in patches 
 divorce by our laws he said with a slight shade of disapprobation of our laws is possible as you are aware in the following cases to wait he called to a clerk who put his head in at the door but he got up all the same said a few words to him and sat down again in the following cases physical defect in the married parties desertion without communication for five years he said crooking a short finger covered with hair adultery this word he pronounced with obvious satisfaction subdivided as follows he continued to crook his fat fingers though the cases and their subdivisions could obviously not be classified together physical defect of the husband or of the wife adultery of the husband or of the wife as by now all his fingers were used up he straightened them and went on this is the theoretical view but i imagine you have done me the honor to apply to me in order to learn its application in practice and therefore guided by precedents i must inform you that in practice cases of divorce may all be reduced to the following no physical defect i may assume nor desertion

 alexei alexandrovich had gained a brilliant victory at the sitting of the commission of the th of august but in the sequel this victory cut the ground from under his feet the new commission for the inquiry into the condition of the native tribes on every aspect had been formed and despatched to its destination with an unusual speed and energy inspired by alexei alexandrovich within three months a report was presented the condition of the native tribes was investigated in its political administrative economic ethnographic material and religious aspects to all these questions there were answers admirably stated and answers admitting no shade of doubt since they were not a product of human thought always liable to error but were all the product of official activity the answers were all based on official data furnished by governors and bishops and founded on the reports of district magistrates and ecclesiastical superintendents founded in their turn on the reports of local authorities and parish priests and so all of these answers were unhesitating and certain all such questions as for instance the cause of crop failures why certain tribes adhered to their ancient beliefs and so on questions which but for the convenient intervention of the official machine are not and cannot be solved for ages received full unhesitating solution and this solution was in favor of alexei contention but stremov who had felt stung to the quick at the last sitting had on the reception of the report resorted to tactics which alexei alexandrovich had not anticipated stremov carrying with him several other members went over to alexei side and not contenting himself with warmly defending the measure proposed by karenin proposed other measures still more extreme in the same direction these measures still stronger than alexei fundamental idea were passed by the commission and then the aim of tactics became apparent carried to an extreme the measures seemed at once to be so absurd that the highest authorities and public opinion and intellectual ladies and the newspapers all at the same time fell foul of them expressing their indignation both with the measures and their nominal father alexei alexandrovich stremov drew back affecting to have blindly followed karenin and to be astounded and distressed at what had been done this meant the defeat of alexei alexandrovich but in spite of failing health in spite of his domestic griefs he did not give in there was a split in the commission some members with stremov at their head justified their mistake on the ground that they had put faith in the commission of revision instituted by alexei alexandrovich and maintained that the report of the commission was rubbish and simply so much wastepaper alexei alexandrovich with a following of those who saw the danger of so revolutionary an attitude to official documents persisted in upholding the statements obtained by the revising commission in consequence of this in the higher spheres and even in society all was chaos and although everyone was interested no one could tell whether the native tribes really were becoming impoverished and ruined or whether they were in a flourishing condition the position of alexei alexandrovich owing to this and partly owing to the contempt lavished on him for his infidelity became very precarious and in this position he took an important resolution to the astonishment of the commission he announced that he should ask permission to go himself to investigate the question on the spot and having obtained permission alexei alexandrovich prepared to set off to these remote provinces 
 alexei departure created a great stir the more so as just before he started he officially returned the posting fares allowed him for twelve horses to drive to his destination 
 i think it very noble betsy said about this to the princess miaghkaia why take money for posting horses when everyone knows that there are railways everywhere now 
 but princess miaghkaia did not agree and the princess opinion annoyed her indeed 
 all very well for you to talk said she when you have i know how many millions but i am very glad when my husband goes on a revising tour in the summer very good for him and pleasant traveling about and a settled arrangement for me to keep a carriage and hired coach on the money 
 on his way to the remote provinces alexei alexandrovich stopped for three days at moscow 
 the day after his arrival he went to call on the governor general at the crossroads by gazetny lane where there are always crowds of carriages and hired sleighs alexei alexandrovich suddenly heard his name called out in such a loud and cheerful voice that he could not help looking round at the corner of the pavement in a short stylish overcoat and a fashionable hat jauntily askew with a smile that showed a gleam of white teeth and red lips stood stepan arkadyevich radiant young and beaming he called him vigorously and urgently and insisted on his stopping he had one arm on the window of a carriage that was stopping at the corner and out of the window were thrust the heads of a lady in a velvet hat and two children stepan arkadyevich was smiling and beckoning to his the lady smiled a kindly smile too and she too waved her hand to alexei alexandrovich it was dolly with her children 
 alexei alexandrovich did not want to see anyone in moscow and least of all his brother he raised his hat and would have driven on but stepan arkadyevich told his coachman to stop and ran across the snow to him 
 well what a shame not to have let us know been here long i was at yesterday and saw karenin on the visitors list but it never entered my head that it was you said stepan arkadyevich sticking his head in at the window of the carriage or i should have looked you up i am glad to see you he said knocking one foot against the other to shake the snow off what a shame you did not let us know he repeated 
 i had no time i am very busy alexei alexandrovich responded dryly 
 come to my wife she does so want to see you 
 alexei alexandrovich unfolded the rug in which his frozen feet were wrapped and getting out of his carriage made his way over the snow to darya alexandrovna 
 why alexei alexandrovich what are you cutting us like this for said dolly smiling 
 i was very busy delighted to see you he said in a tone clearly indicating that he was annoyed by it how are you

 alexei alexandrovich got into his carriage and buried himself in it so as neither to see nor to be seen

 the next day was sunday stepan arkadyevich went to the grand theater to a rehearsal of the ballet and gave masha chibisova a pretty dancing girl who had been engaged through his protection the coral necklace he had promised her the evening before and behind the scenes in the dim daylight of the theater managed to kiss her pretty little face radiant over the present besides the gift of the necklace he wanted to arrange a meeting with her after the ballet after explaining that he could not come at the beginning of the ballet he promised he would come for the last act and take her to supper from the theater stepan arkadyevich drove to okhotny riad selected himself the fish and asparagus for dinner and by twelve was at where he had to see three people luckily all staying at the same hotel levin who had recently come back from abroad and was staying there the new head of his board who had just been promoted to that position and had come on a tour of revision to moscow and his karenin whom he must see so as to be sure of bringing him to dinner 
 stepan arkadyevich liked dining but still better he liked to give a dinner small but very choice both as regards the food and drink and as regards the selection of guests he particularly liked the program of that dinner there would be fresh perch asparagus and la pice de rsistance but quite plain roast beef and wines to suit so much for the eating and drinking kitty and levin would be of the party and so that this might not be obtrusively evident there would be a girl cousin too and young shcherbatsky and la piece de resistance among the guests sergei koznishev and alexei alexandrovich sergei ivanovich was a moscow man and a philosopher alexei alexandrovich a peterburg man and a practical politician he was asking too the eccentric enthusiast pestsov a liberal a great talker a musician a historian and the most delightfully youthful person of fifty who would be a sauce or garnish for koznishev and karenin he would provoke them and set them off against one another 
 the second installment for the forest had been received from the merchant and was not yet exhausted dolly had been very amiable and of late and the idea of the dinner pleased stepan arkadyevich from every point of view he was in the most lighthearted mood there were two circumstances a little unpleasant but these two circumstances were drowned in the sea of gaiety which flooded the soul of stepan arkadyevich these two circumstances were first that on meeting alexei alexandrovich the day before in the street stiva had noticed that the latter was cold and reserved with him and putting together the expression of alexei face and the fact that he had not come to see them or let them know of his arrival with the rumors he had heard about anna and vronsky stepan arkadyevich guessed that something was wrong between the husband and wife 
 that was one disagreeable thing the other slightly disagreeable fact was that the new head of his board like all new heads already had the reputation of a terrible person who got up at six in the morning worked like a horse and insisted on his subordinates working in the same way moreover this new head had the further reputation of being a bear in his manners and was according to all reports a man of a class in all respects the opposite of that to which his predecessor had belonged and to which stepan arkadyevich had hitherto belonged himself on the previous day stepan arkadyevich had appeared at the office in a uniform and the new chief had been very affable and had talked to him as to an acquaintance consequently stepan arkadyevich deemed it his duty to call upon him in his nonofficial dress the thought that the new chief might not give him a warm reception was the other unpleasant thing but stepan arkadyevich instinctively felt that everything would come round all right all human all men like us poor sinners why be nasty and quarrelsome he thought as he went into the hotel 
 good day vassilii he said walking into the corridor with his hat cocked on one side and addressing a footman he knew why let your whiskers grow levin number seven eh take me up please and find out whether count anychkin this was the new head is receiving 
 yes sir vassilii responded smiling not been to see us for a long while 
 i was here yesterday but at the other entrance is this number seven 
 levin was standing with a peasant from tver in the middle of the room measuring a fresh bearskin when stepan arkadyevich came in 
 what you killed him cried stepan arkadyevich well done a how are you arkhip 
 he shook hands with the peasant and sat down on a chair without taking off his coat and hat 
 come take off your coat and stay a little said levin taking his hat 
 no i time only looked in for just a second answered stepan arkadyevich he threw open his fur coat but afterward did take it off and sat on for a whole hour talking to levin about hunting and the most intimate subjects come tell me please what you did abroad where have you been said stepan arkadyevich when the peasant had gone 
 oh i stayed in germany in prussia in france and in england not in the capitals but in the manufacturing towns and saw a great deal that was new to me and glad i went 
 yes i knew your idea of the solution of the labor question 
 not a bit in russia there can be no labor question in russia the question is that of the relation of the working people to the land though the question exists there too but there a matter of repairing been ruined while with us 
 stepan arkadyevich listened attentively to levin 
 yes yes he said very possible right but glad in good spirits and are hunting bears and working and interested shcherbatsky told me another story he met you that you were in such a depressed state talking of nothing but death 
 well what of it not given up thinking of death said levin true that high time i was dead and that all this is nonsense the truth telling you i do value my idea and my work awfully but really do consider this all this world of ours is nothing but a speck of mildew which has grown up on a tiny planet and yet we think that something great is possible to us ideas work grains of sand all they are 
 but all as old as the hills my boy 
 it is old but do you know when you grasp this fully then somehow everything becomes of no consequence when you understand that you will die tomorrow if not today and nothing will be left then everything is so unimportant and i consider my idea very important but it turns out really to be just as unimportant even if it were carried out as outwitting that so one goes on living amusing oneself with hunting with work anything so as not to think of death 
 stepan arkadyevich smiled a subtle and affectionate smile as he listened to levin 
 well of course here come round to my point do you remember you attacked me for seeking enjoyment in life 
 be o moralist severe 
 no all the same fine in life is levin hesitated oh i know all i know is that we shall soon be dead 
 why so soon 
 and i know less charm in life when one thinks of death but more peace 
 on the contrary the finish is always the best but i must be going said stepan arkadyevich getting up for the tenth time 
 oh no stay a bit said levin detaining him now when shall we see each other again going tomorrow 
 a fine fellow why just what i came for you simply must come to dinner with us today your coming and karenin my 
 you mean to say here said levin and he wanted to inquire about kitty he had heard at the beginning of the winter that she was at peterburg with her sister the wife of the diplomat and he did not know whether she had come back or not but he changed his mind and did not ask whether coming or not i care he said to himself 
 so come

 the next day was sunday stepan arkadyevich went to the grand theater to a rehearsal of the ballet and gave masha chibisova a pretty dancing girl who had been engaged through his protection the coral necklace he had promised her the evening before and behind the scenes in the dim daylight of the theater managed to kiss her pretty little face radiant over the present besides the gift of the necklace he wanted to arrange a meeting with her after the ballet after explaining that he could not come at the beginning of the ballet he promised he would come for the last act and take her to supper from the theater stepan arkadyevich drove to okhotny riad selected himself the fish and asparagus for dinner and by twelve was at where he had to see three people luckily all staying at the same hotel levin who had recently come back from abroad and was staying there the new head of his board who had just been promoted to that position and had come on a tour of revision to moscow and his karenin whom he must see so as to be sure of bringing him to dinner 
 stepan arkadyevich liked dining but still better he liked to give a dinner small but very choice both as regards the food and drink and as regards the selection of guests he particularly liked the program of that dinner there would be fresh perch asparagus and la pice de rsistance but quite plain roast beef and wines to suit so much for the eating and drinking kitty and levin would be of the party and so that this might not be obtrusively evident there would be a girl cousin too and young shcherbatsky and la piece de resistance among the guests sergei koznishev and alexei alexandrovich sergei ivanovich was a moscow man and a philosopher alexei alexandrovich a peterburg man and a practical politician he was asking too the eccentric enthusiast pestsov a liberal a great talker a musician a historian and the most delightfully youthful person of fifty who would be a sauce or garnish for koznishev and karenin he would provoke them and set them off against one another 
 the second installment for the forest had been received from the merchant and was not yet exhausted dolly had been very amiable and of late and the idea of the dinner pleased stepan arkadyevich from every point of view he was in the most lighthearted mood there were two circumstances a little unpleasant but these two circumstances were drowned in the sea of gaiety which flooded the soul of stepan arkadyevich these two circumstances were first that on meeting alexei alexandrovich the day before in the street stiva had noticed that the latter was cold and reserved with him and putting together the expression of alexei face and the fact that he had not come to see them or let them know of his arrival with the rumors he had heard about anna and vronsky stepan arkadyevich guessed that something was wrong between the husband and wife 
 that was one disagreeable thing the other slightly disagreeable fact was that the new head of his board like all new heads already had the reputation of a terrible person who got up at six in the morning worked like a horse and insisted on his subordinates working in the same way moreover this new head had the further reputation of being a bear in his manners and was according to all reports a man of a class in all respects the opposite of that to which his predecessor had belonged and to which stepan arkadyevich had hitherto belonged himself on the previous day stepan arkadyevich had appeared at the office in a uniform and the new chief had been very affable and had talked to him as to an acquaintance consequently stepan arkadyevich deemed it his duty to call upon him in his nonofficial dress the thought that the new chief might not give him a warm reception was the other unpleasant thing but stepan arkadyevich instinctively felt that everything would come round all right all human all men like us poor sinners why be nasty and quarrelsome he thought as he went into the hotel 
 good day vassilii he said walking into the corridor with his hat cocked on one side and addressing a footman he knew why let your whiskers grow levin number seven eh take me up please and find out whether count anychkin this was the new head is receiving 
 yes sir vassilii responded smiling not been to see us for a long while 
 i was here yesterday but at the other entrance is this number seven 
 levin was standing with a peasant from tver in the middle of the room measuring a fresh bearskin when stepan arkadyevich came in 
 what you killed him cried stepan arkadyevich well done a how are you arkhip 
 he shook hands with the peasant and sat down on a chair without taking off his coat and hat 
 come take off your coat and stay a little said levin taking his hat 
 no i time only looked in for just a second answered stepan arkadyevich he threw open his fur coat but afterward did take it off and sat on for a whole hour talking to levin about hunting and the most intimate subjects come tell me please what you did abroad where have you been said stepan arkadyevich when the peasant had gone 
 oh i stayed in germany in prussia in france and in england not in the capitals but in the manufacturing towns and saw a great deal that was new to me and glad i went 
 yes i knew your idea of the solution of the labor question 
 not a bit in russia there can be no labor question in russia the question is that of the relation of the working people to the land though the question exists there too but there a matter of repairing been ruined while with us 
 stepan arkadyevich listened attentively to levin 
 yes yes he said very possible right but glad in good spirits and are hunting bears and working and interested shcherbatsky told me another story he met you that you were in such a depressed state talking of nothing but death 
 well what of it not given up thinking of death said levin true that high time i was dead and that all this is nonsense the truth telling you i do value my idea and my work awfully but really do consider this all this world of ours is nothing but a speck of mildew which has grown up on a tiny planet and yet we think that something great is possible to us ideas work grains of sand all they are 
 but all as old as the hills my boy 
 it is old but do you know when you grasp this fully then somehow everything becomes of no consequence when you understand that you will die tomorrow if not today and nothing will be left then everything is so unimportant and i consider my idea very important but it turns out really to be just as unimportant even if it were carried out as outwitting that so one goes on living amusing oneself with hunting with work anything so as not to think of death 
 stepan arkadyevich smiled a subtle and affectionate smile as he listened to levin 
 well of course here come round to my point do you remember you attacked me for seeking enjoyment in life 
 be o moralist severe 
 no all the same fine in life is levin hesitated oh i know all i know is that we shall soon be dead 
 why so soon 
 and i know less charm in life when one thinks of death but more peace 
 on the contrary the finish is always the best but i must be going said stepan arkadyevich getting up for the tenth time 
 oh no stay a bit said levin detaining him now when shall we see each other again going tomorrow 
 a fine fellow why just what i came for you simply must come to dinner with us today your coming and karenin my 
 you mean to say here said levin and he wanted to inquire about kitty he had heard at the beginning of the winter that she was at peterburg with her sister the wife of the diplomat and he did not know whether she had come back or not but he changed his mind and did not ask whether coming or not i care he said to himself 
 so come 
 of course 
 at five then and wear a frock coat 
 and stepan arkadyevich got up and went down below to the new head of his department instinct had not misled stepan arkadyevich the terrible new head turned out to be an extremely amenable person and stepan arkadyevich lunched with him and stayed on so that it was past three before he got to alexei alexandrovich

 alexei alexandrovich on coming back from church service had spent the whole morning indoors he had two pieces of business before him that morning first to receive and send on a deputation from the native tribes which was on its way to peterburg and which was now at moscow secondly to write the promised letter to the lawyer the deputation though it had been summoned at alexei instigation was not without its discomforting and even dangerous aspect and he was glad he had found it in moscow the members of this deputation had not the slightest conception of their duty and the part they were to play they naively believed that it was their business to lay before the commission their needs and the actual condition of things and to ask assistance of the government and utterly failed to grasp that some of their statements and requests supported the contention of the side and so spoiled the whole business alexei alexandrovich was busily engaged with them for a long while drew up a program for them from which they were not to depart and on dismissing them wrote a letter to peterburg for the guidance of the deputation he had his chief support in this affair in the countess lidia ivanovna she was a specialist in the matter of deputations and no one knew better than she how to puff and put them in the way they should go having completed this task alexei alexandrovich wrote the letter to the lawyer without the slightest hesitation he gave him permission to act as he might judge best in the letter he enclosed three of notes to anna which were in the portfolio he had taken away 
 since alexei alexandrovich had left home with the intention of not returning to his family again and since he had been at the and had spoken though only to one man of his intention since moreover he had translated the matter from the world of real life to the world of ink and paper he had grown more and more used to his own intention and by now distinctly perceived the feasibility of its execution 
 he was sealing the envelope to the lawyer when he heard the loud tones of stepan voice stepan arkadyevich was disputing with alexei servant and insisting on being announced 
 no matter thought alexei alexandrovich so much the better i will inform him at once of my position in regard to his sister and explain why it is i dine with him 
 come in he said aloud collecting his papers and putting them under the blotting pad 
 there you see talking nonsense and he is at home responded stepan voice addressing the servant who had refused to let him in and taking off his coat as he went oblonsky walked into the room well awfully glad found you so i hope stepan arkadyevich began cheerfully 
 i cannot come alexei alexandrovich said coldly standing and not asking his visitor to sit down 
 alexei alexandrovich had thought to pass at once into those frigid relations in which he ought to stand with the brother of a wife against whom he was beginning a suit for divorce but he had not taken into account the ocean of kindliness brimming over in the heart of stepan arkadyevich 
 stepan arkadyevich opened wide his clear shining eyes 
 why you what do you mean he asked in perplexity speaking in french oh but a promise and all counting on you 
 i want to tell you that i dine at your house because the terms of relationship which have existed between us must cease 
 how how do you mean for what reason said stepan arkadyevich with a smile 
 because i am beginning an action for divorce against your sister my wife i ought to have 
 but before alexei alexandrovich had time to finish his sentence stepan arkadyevich was behaving not at all as he had expected stepan arkadyevich groaned and sank into an armchair 
 no alexei alexandrovich what are you saying cried oblonsky and his suffering was apparent in his face 
 it is so 
 excuse me i i believe it 
 alexei alexandrovich sat down feeling that his words had not had the effect he anticipated and that it would be unavoidable for him to explain his position and that whatever explanations he might make his relations with his would remain unchanged 
 yes i am brought to the painful necessity of seeking a divorce he said 
 i will say one thing alexei alexandrovich i know you for an excellent upright man i know anna excuse me i change my opinion of her for a good an excellent woman and so you must excuse me if i cannot believe it there is some misunderstanding said he 
 oh if it were merely a misunderstanding 
 pardon i understand interposed stepan arkadyevich but of course one thing you must not act in haste you must not you must not act in haste 
 i am not acting in haste alexei alexandrovich said coldly but one cannot ask advice of anyone in such a matter i have quite made up my mind 
 this is awful said stepan arkadyevich i would do one thing alexei alexandrovich i beseech you do it he said no action has yet been taken if i understand rightly before you take advice see my wife talk to her she loves anna like a sister she loves you and a wonderful woman for sake talk to her do me that favor i beseech you 
 alexei alexandrovich pondered and stepan arkadyevich looked at him sympathetically without interrupting his silence 
 you will go to see her 
 i know that was just why i have not been to see you i imagine our relations must change 
 why so i see that allow me to believe that apart from our connection you have for me at least in part the same friendly feeling i have always had for you and sincere esteem said stepan arkadyevich pressing his hand even if your worst suppositions were correct i and never would take on myself to judge either side and i see no reason why our relations should be affected but now do this come and see my wife 
 well we look at the matter differently said alexei alexandrovich coldly however we discuss it 
 no why you come today to dine anyway my expecting you please do come and above all talk it over with her a wonderful woman for sake on my knees i implore you 
 if you so much wish it i will come said alexei alexandrovich sighing 
 and anxious to change the conversation he inquired about what interested them both the new head of stepan board a man not yet old who had suddenly been promoted to so high a position 
 alexei alexandrovich had previously felt no liking for count anychkin and had always differed from him in his opinions but now from a feeling readily comprehensible to officials that hatred felt by one who has suffered a defeat in the service for one who has received a promotion he could not endure him 
 well have you seen him said alexei alexandrovich with a malignant smile 
 of course he was at our sitting yesterday he seems to know his work capitally and to be very energetic 
 yes but what is his energy directed to said alexei alexandrovich is he aiming at doing anything or simply doing again been done the great misfortune of our government this paper administration of which a worthy representative 
 really i know what fault one could find with him his policy i know but one thing is certain a very fine fellow answered stepan arkadyevich just been seeing him and really a fine fellow we lunched together and i taught him how to make you know that drink wine and oranges so cooling and a wonder he know it he liked it awfully no really a fine fellow 
 stepan arkadyevich glanced at his watch 
 why good heavens four already and still to go to so please come round to dinner you imagine how you will grieve my wife and me if you 
 the way in which alexei alexandrovich saw his out was very different from the manner in which he had met him 
 promised and come he answered wearily 
 believe me i appreciate it and i hope you regret it answered stepan arkadyevich smiling 
 and putting on his coat as he went he patted the footman on the head with his coat sleeve chuckled and went out 
 at five and wear your frock coat please he shouted once more returning at the door

 chapter 
 
 it was past five and several guests had already arrived before the host himself got home he went in together with sergei ivanovich koznishev and with pestsov both of whom had reached the street door at the same moment these were the two leading representatives of the moscow intellectuals as oblonsky had called them both were men respected for their character and their intelligence they respected each other but were in complete and hopeless disagreement upon almost every subject not because they belonged to opposite parties but precisely because they were of the same party their enemies refused to see any distinction between their views but in that party each had his own special shade of opinion and since no difference is less easily overcome than the difference of opinion about semiabstract questions they never agreed on any opinion and indeed had long been accustomed to jeer without anger at each incorrigible aberrations 
 they were just going in at the door talking of the weather when stepan arkadyevich overtook them in the drawing room there were already sitting prince alexander dmitrievich shcherbatsky young shcherbatsky turovtsin kitty and karenin 
 stepan arkadyevich saw immediately that things were not going well in the drawing room without him darya alexandrovna in her best gray silk gown obviously worried about the children who were to have their dinner by themselves in the nursery and by her absence was not equal to the task of making the party mix without him all were sitting like so many priests daughters on a visit so the old prince expressed it obviously wondering why they were there and pumping up remarks simply to avoid being silent turovtsin goodhearted man felt unmistakably like a fish out of water and the smile with which his thick lips greeted stepan arkadyevich said as plainly as words well old boy you have popped me down in a learned set a drinking party and the chateau des fleurs would be more in my line the old prince sat in silence his bright little eyes watching karenin with a sidelong look and stepan arkadyevich saw that he had already formed a sharp remark to sum up that politician of whom guests had been invited to partake as though he were a sturgeon kitty was looking at the door calling up all her energies to keep her from blushing at the entrance of konstantin levin young shcherbatsky who had not been introduced to karenin was trying to look as though he were not in the least embarrassed by it karenin himself had followed the peterburg etiquette for a dinner with ladies present and was wearing evening dress and a white tie stepan arkadyevich saw by his face that he had come simply to keep his promise and was performing a disagreeable duty in being present at this gathering he was indeed the person chiefly responsible for the chill benumbing all the guests before stepan arkadyevich came in 
 on entering the drawing room stepan arkadyevich apologized explaining that he had been detained by that prince who was always the scapegoat for all his absences and unpunctualities and in one moment he had made all the guests acquainted with each other and bringing together alexei alexandrovich and sergei koznishev had started them on a discussion of the russification of poland into which they immediately plunged with pestsov slapping turovtsin on the shoulder he whispered something comic in his ear and set him down by his wife and the old prince then he told kitty she was looking very pretty that evening and presented shcherbatsky to karenin in a moment he had so kneaded together the social dough that the drawing room became very lively and there was a merry buzz of voices konstantin levin was the only person who had not arrived but this was so much the better as going into the dining room stepan arkadyevich found to his horror that the port and sherry had been procured from depre and not from leve and directing that the coachman should be sent off as speedily as possible to he started back to the drawing room 
 in the dining room he was met by konstantin levin 
 not late 
 you can never help being late said stepan arkadyevich taking his arm 
 have you a lot of people here asked levin unable to help blushing as he knocked the snow off his cap with his glove 
 all our own set here come along introduce you to karenin 
 stepan arkadyevich for all his liberal views was well aware that to meet karenin was sure to be felt a flattering distinction and so treated his best friends to this honor but at that instant konstantin levin was not in a condition to feel all the gratification of making such an acquaintance he had not seen kitty since that memorable evening when he met vronsky not counting that is the moment when he had had a glimpse of her on the highroad he had known at the bottom of his heart that he would see her here today but to keep his thoughts free he had tried to persuade himself that he did not know it now when he heard that she was here he was suddenly conscious of such delight and at the same time of such dread that his breath failed him and he could not utter what he wanted to say 
 what is she like what is she like as she used to be or as she was in the carriage what if darya alexandrovna told the truth why it be the truth he thought 
 oh please introduce me to karenin he brought out with an effort and with a desperately determined step he walked into the drawing room and beheld her 
 she was not the same as she used to be nor was she as she had been in the carriage she was quite different 
 she was scared shy shamefaced and because of all this still more charming she saw him the very instant he walked into the room she had been expecting him she was delighted and so confused at her own delight that there was a moment the moment when he went up to her sister and glanced again at her when she and he and dolly who saw it all thought she would break down and begin to cry she crimsoned turned white crimsoned again and grew faint waiting with quivering lips for him to come to her he went up to her bowed and held out his hand without speaking except for the slight quiver of her lips and the moisture in her eyes making them brighter her smile was almost calm as she said 
 how long it is since seen each other and with desperate determination with her cold hand squeezed his 
 not seen me but seen you said levin with a radiant smile of happiness i saw you when you were driving from the railway station to ergushovo 
 when she asked wondering 
 you were driving to ergushovo said levin feeling as if he would sob with the rapture that was flooding his heart and how dared i associate a thought of anything not innocent with this touching creature and yes i do believe what darya alexandrovna told me is true he thought 
 stepan arkadyevich took him by the arm and led him away to karenin 
 let me introduce you he mentioned their names 
 very glad to meet you again said alexei alexandrovich coldly shaking hands with levin 
 you are acquainted stepan arkadyevich asked in surprise 
 we spent three hours together in the train said levin smiling but got out just as in a masquerade quite mystified at least i was 
 oh so it come along please said stepan arkadyevich pointing in the direction of the dining room 
 the men went into the dining room and went up to the table for hors laid with six sorts of vodka and as many kinds of cheese some with little silver spades and some without caviar herrings preserves of various kinds and plates with slices of french bread 
 the men stood round the spirits and salt delicacies and the discussion of the russification of poland between koznishev karenin and pestsov died down in anticipation of dinner 
 sergei ivanovich was unequaled in his skill in winding up the most heated and serious argument by some unexpected pinch of attic salt that changed the disposition of his opponent he did this now 
 alexei alexandrovich had been maintaining that the russification of poland could only be accomplished as a result of greater principles which ought to be introduced by the russian government 
 pestsov insisted that one country can absorb another only when it is the more densely populated 
 koznishev admitted both points but with limitations as they were going out of the drawing room to conclude the argument koznishev said smiling 
 so then for the russification of our foreign populations there is but one method to bring up as many children as one can my brother and i are terribly at fault i see you married men especially you stepan arkadyevich are the real patriots what number have you reached he said smiling genially at their host and holding out a tiny wineglass to him 
 everyone laughed and stepan arkadyevich with particular good humor 
 oh yes the best method he said munching cheese and filling the wineglass with a special sort of vodka the conversation dropped at the jest 
 this cheese is not bad shall i give you some said the master of the house why have you been going in for gymnastics again he asked levin pinching his muscle with his left hand levin smiled bent his arm and under stepan fingers the muscles swelled up like a sound cheese hard as a knob of iron through the fine cloth of the coat 
 what biceps a perfect samson 
 i imagine great strength is needed for hunting bears observed alexei alexandrovich who had the mistiest notions about the chase he cut off and spread with cheese a wafer of bread fine as a spiderweb 
 levin smiled 
 not at all quite the contrary a child can kill a bear he said with a slight bow moving aside for the ladies who were approaching the hors table 
 you have killed a bear been told said kitty trying assiduously to catch with her fork a perverse mushroom that would slip away and shaking the lace over her white arm are there bears on your place she added turning her charming little head to him and smiling 
 there was apparently nothing extraordinary in what she said but what unutterable meaning there was for him in every sound in every turn of her lips her eyes her hand as she said it there was entreaty for forgiveness and trust in him and tenderness soft timid tenderness and promise and hope and love for him which he could not but believe in and which suffocated him with happiness 
 no been hunting in the tver province it was coming back from there that i met your in the train or your he said with a smile it was an amusing meeting 
 and he began telling with droll good humor how after not sleeping all night he had wearing a coat got into alexei compartment 
 the conductor forgetting the proverb would have chucked me out on account of my attire but thereupon i began expressing my feelings in elevated language and you too he said addressing karenin and forgetting his name at first would have ejected me on the ground of my coat but afterward you took my part for which i am extremely grateful 
 the rights of passengers generally to choose their seats are too said alexei alexandrovich rubbing the tips of his fingers on his handkerchief 
 i saw you were in uncertainty about me said levin smiling but i made haste to plunge into intellectual conversation to smooth over the defects of my attire 
 sergei ivanovich while he kept a conversation with their hostess had one ear for his brother and he glanced askance at him what is the matter with him today why such a conquering hero he thought he did not know that levin was feeling as though he had grown wings levin knew she was listening to his words and that she was glad to listen to him and this was the only thing that interested him not in that room only but in the whole world there existed for him only himself with enormously increased importance and dignity in his own eyes and she he felt himself on a pinnacle that made him giddy and far away down below were all those kind excellent karenins oblonskys and all the world

 it was past five and several guests had already arrived before the host himself got home he went in together with sergei ivanovich koznishev and with pestsov both of whom had reached the street door at the same moment these were the two leading representatives of the moscow intellectuals as oblonsky had called them both were men respected for their character and their intelligence they respected each other but were in complete and hopeless disagreement upon almost every subject not because they belonged to opposite parties but precisely because they were of the same party their enemies refused to see any distinction between their views but in that party each had his own special shade of opinion and since no difference is less easily overcome than the difference of opinion about semiabstract questions they never agreed on any opinion and indeed had long been accustomed to jeer without anger at each incorrigible aberrations 
 they were just going in at the door talking of the weather when stepan arkadyevich overtook them in the drawing room there were already sitting prince alexander dmitrievich shcherbatsky young shcherbatsky turovtsin kitty and karenin 
 stepan arkadyevich saw immediately that things were not going well in the drawing room without him darya alexandrovna in her best gray silk gown obviously worried about the children who were to have their dinner by themselves in the nursery and by her absence was not equal to the task of making the party mix without him all were sitting like so many priests daughters on a visit so the old prince expressed it obviously wondering why they were there and pumping up remarks simply to avoid being silent turovtsin goodhearted man felt unmistakably like a fish out of water and the smile with which his thick lips greeted stepan arkadyevich said as plainly as words well old boy you have popped me down in a learned set a drinking party and the chateau des fleurs would be more in my line the old prince sat in silence his bright little eyes watching karenin with a sidelong look and stepan arkadyevich saw that he had already formed a sharp remark to sum up that politician of whom guests had been invited to partake as though he were a sturgeon kitty was looking at the door calling up all her energies to keep her from blushing at the entrance of konstantin levin young shcherbatsky who had not been introduced to karenin was trying to look as though he were not in the least embarrassed by it karenin himself had followed the peterburg etiquette for a dinner with ladies present and was wearing evening dress and a white tie stepan arkadyevich saw by his face that he had come simply to keep his promise and was performing a disagreeable duty in being present at this gathering he was indeed the person chiefly responsible for the chill benumbing all the guests before stepan arkadyevich came in 
 on entering the drawing room stepan arkadyevich apologized explaining that he had been detained by that prince who was always the scapegoat for all his absences and unpunctualities and in one moment he had made all the guests acquainted with each other and bringing together alexei alexandrovich and sergei koznishev had started them on a discussion of the russification of poland into which they immediately plunged with pestsov slapping turovtsin on the shoulder he whispered something comic in his ear and set him down by his wife and the old prince then he told kitty she was looking very pretty that evening and presented shcherbatsky to karenin in a moment he had so kneaded together the social dough that the drawing room became very lively and there was a merry buzz of voices konstantin levin was the only person who had not arrived but this was so much the better as going into the dining room stepan arkadyevich found to his horror that the port and sherry had been procured from depre and not from leve and directing that the coachman should be sent off as speedily as possible to he started back to the drawing room 
 in the dining room he was met by konstantin levin 
 not late 
 you can never help being late said stepan arkadyevich taking his arm 
 have you a lot of people here asked levin unable to help blushing as he knocked the snow off his cap with his glove 
 all our own set here come along introduce you to karenin 
 stepan arkadyevich for all his liberal views was well aware that to meet karenin was sure to be felt a flattering distinction and so treated his best friends to this honor but at that instant konstantin levin was not in a condition to feel all the gratification of making such an acquaintance he had not seen kitty since that memorable evening when he met vronsky not counting that is the moment when he had had a glimpse of her on the highroad he had known at the bottom of his heart that he would see her here today but to keep his thoughts free he had tried to persuade himself that he did not know it now when he heard that she was here he was suddenly conscious of such delight and at the same time of such dread that his breath failed him and he could not utter what he wanted to say 
 what is she like what is she like as she used to be or as she was in the carriage what if darya alexandrovna told the truth why it be the truth he thought 
 oh please introduce me to karenin he brought out with an effort and with a desperately determined step he walked into the drawing room and beheld her 
 she was not the same as she used to be nor was she as she had been in the carriage she was quite different 
 she was scared shy shamefaced and because of all this still more charming she saw him the very instant he walked into the room she had been expecting him she was delighted and so confused at her own delight that there was a moment the moment when he went up to her sister and glanced again at her when she and he and dolly who saw it all thought she would break down and begin to cry she crimsoned turned white crimsoned again and grew faint waiting with quivering lips for him to come to her he went up to her bowed and held out his hand without speaking except for the slight quiver of her lips and the moisture in her eyes making them brighter her smile was almost calm as she said 
 how long it is since seen each other and with desperate determination with her cold hand squeezed his 
 not seen me but seen you said levin with a radiant smile of happiness i saw you when you were driving from the railway station to ergushovo 
 when she asked wondering 
 you were driving to ergushovo said levin feeling as if he would sob with the rapture that was flooding his heart and how dared i associate a thought of anything not innocent with this touching creature and yes i do believe what darya alexandrovna told me is true he thought 
 stepan arkadyevich took him by the arm and led him away to karenin 
 let me introduce you he mentioned their names 
 very glad to meet you again said alexei alexandrovich coldly shaking hands with levin 
 you are acquainted stepan arkadyevich asked in surprise 
 we spent three hours together in the train said levin smiling but got out just as in a masquerade quite mystified at least i was 
 oh so it come along please said stepan arkadyevich pointing in the direction of the dining room 
 the men went into the dining room and went up to the table for hors laid with six sorts of vodka and as many kinds of cheese some with little silver spades and some without caviar herrings preserves of various kinds and plates with slices of french bread 
 the men stood round the spirits and salt delicacies and the discussion of the russification of poland between koznishev karenin and pestsov died down in anticipation of dinner 
 sergei ivanovich was unequaled in his skill in winding up the most heated and serious argument by some unexpected pinch of attic salt that changed the disposition of his opponent he did this now 
 alexei alexandrovich had been maintaining that the russification of poland could only be accomplished as a result of greater principles which ought to be introduced by the russian government 
 pestsov insisted that one country can absorb another only when it is the more densely populated 
 koznishev admitted both points but with limitations as they were going out of the drawing room to conclude the argument koznishev said smiling 
 so then for the russification of our foreign populations there is but one method to bring up as many children as one can my brother and i are terribly at fault i see you married men especially you stepan arkadyevich are the real patriots what number have you reached he said smiling genially at their host and holding out a tiny wineglass to him 
 everyone laughed and stepan arkadyevich with particular good humor 
 oh yes the best method he said munching cheese and filling the wineglass with a special sort of vodka the conversation dropped at the jest 
 this cheese is not bad shall i give you some said the master of the house why have you been going in for gymnastics again he asked levin pinching his muscle with his left hand levin smiled bent his arm and under stepan fingers the muscles swelled up like a sound cheese hard as a knob of iron through the fine cloth of the coat 
 what biceps a perfect samson 
 i imagine great strength is needed for hunting bears observed alexei alexandrovich who had the mistiest notions about the chase he cut off and spread with cheese a wafer of bread fine as a spiderweb 
 levin smiled 
 not at all quite the contrary a child can kill a bear he said with a slight bow moving aside for the ladies who were approaching the hors table 
 you have killed a bear been told said kitty trying assiduously to catch with her fork a perverse mushroom that would slip away and shaking the lace over her white arm are there bears on your place she added turning her charming little head to him and smiling 
 there was apparently nothing extraordinary in what she said but what unutterable meaning there was for him in every sound in every turn of her lips her eyes her hand as she said it there was entreaty for forgiveness and trust in him and tenderness soft timid tenderness and promise and hope and love for him which he could not but believe in and which suffocated him with happiness 
 no been hunting in the tver province it was coming back from there that i met your in the train or your he said with a smile it was an amusing meeting 
 and he began telling with droll good humor how after not sleeping all night he had wearing a coat got into alexei compartment 
 the conductor forgetting the proverb would have chucked me out on account of my attire but thereupon i began expressing my feelings in elevated language and you too he said addressing karenin and forgetting his name at first would have ejected me on the ground of my coat but afterward you took my part for which i am extremely grateful 
 the rights of passengers generally to choose their seats are too said alexei alexandrovich rubbing the tips of his fingers on his handkerchief 
 i saw you were in uncertainty about me said levin smiling but i made haste to plunge into intellectual conversation to smooth over the defects of my attire 
 sergei ivanovich while he kept a conversation with their hostess had one ear for his brother and he glanced askance at him what is the matter with him today why such a conquering hero he thought he did not know that levin was feeling as though he had grown wings levin knew she was listening to his words and that she was glad to listen to him and this was the only thing that interested him not in that room only but in the whole world there existed for him only himself with enormously increased importance and dignity in his own eyes and she he felt himself on a pinnacle that made him giddy and far away down below were all those kind excellent karenins oblonskys and all the world 
 quite without attracting notice without glancing at them as though there were no other places left stepan arkadyevich put levin and kitty side by side 
 oh you may as well sit there he said to levin 
 the dinner was as choice as the china of which stepan arkadyevich was a connoisseur the soupe was a splendid success the tiny patties eaten with it melted in the mouth and were irreproachable the two footmen and matvei in white cravats did their duty with the dishes and wines unobtrusively quietly and dexterously on the material side the dinner was a success it was no less so on the immaterial the conversation at times general and at times between individuals never paused and toward the end the company was so lively that the men rose from the table without stopping speaking and even alexei alexandrovich became lively

 pestsov liked threshing an argument out to the end and was not satisfied with sergei words especially as he felt the injustice of his view 
 i did not mean he said over the soup addressing alexei alexandrovich mere density of population alone but in conjunction with fundamental ideas and not by means of principles 
 it seems to me alexei alexandrovich said languidly and with no haste that the same thing in my opinion influence over another people is only possible to the people which has the higher development which 
 but just the question pestsov broke in in his bass he was always in a hurry to speak and seemed always to put his whole soul into whatever he was saying of what are we to make higher development consist the english the french the germans which is at the highest stage of development which of them will nationalize the other we see the rhine provinces have been turned french yet the germans are not at a lower stage he shouted there is another law at work there 
 i fancy that the greater influence is always on the side of true civilization said alexei alexandrovich slightly lifting his eyebrows 
 but what are we to lay down as the outward signs of true civilization said pestsov 
 i imagine such signs are generally very well known said alexei alexandrovich 
 but are they fully known sergei ivanovich put in with a subtle smile it is the accepted view now that real culture must be purely classical but we see most intense disputes on each side of the question and there is no denying that the opposite camp has strong points in its favor 
 you are for the classics sergei ivanovich will you take red wine said stepan arkadyevich 
 i am not expressing my own opinion of either form of culture sergei ivanovich said holding out his glass with a smile of condescension as to a child i only say that both sides have strong arguments to support them he went on addressing alexei alexandrovich my sympathies are classical from education but in this discussion i am personally unable to arrive at a conclusion i see no distinct grounds for classical studies being given a over scientific studies 
 the natural sciences have just as great an educational value put in pestsov take astronomy take botany or zoology with its system of general principles 
 i cannot quite agree with that responded alexei alexandrovich it seems to me that one must admit that the very process of studying the forms of language has a peculiarly favorable influence on intellectual development moreover it cannot be denied that the influence of the classical authors is in the highest degree moral while unfortunately with the study of the natural sciences are associated the false and noxious doctrines which are the curse of our day 
 sergei ivanovich would have said something but pestsov interrupted him in his rich bass he began warmly contesting the justice of this view sergei ivanovich waited serenely to speak obviously with a convincing reply ready 
 but said sergei ivanovich smiling subtly and addressing karenin one must allow that to weigh all the advantages and disadvantages of classical and scientific studies is a difficult task and the question which form of education was to be preferred would not have been so quickly and conclusively decided if there had not been in favor of classical education as you expressed it just now its moral disons le mot antinihilist influence 
 undoubtedly 
 if it had not been for the distinctive property of antinihilistic influence on the side of classical studies we should have considered the subject more have weighed the arguments on both sides said sergei ivanovich with a subtle smile we should have given elbowroom to both tendencies but now we know that these little pills of classical learning possess the medicinal property of antinihilism and we boldly prescribe them to our patients but what if they had no such medicinal property he added his pinch of attic salt 
 at sergei little pills everyone laughed turovtsin in especial roared loudly and jovially glad at last to have found something to laugh at all he ever looked for in listening to conversation 
 stepan arkadyevich had not made a mistake in inviting pestsov with pestsov intellectual conversation never flagged for an instant directly sergei ivanovich had concluded the conversation with his jest pestsov promptly started a new one 
 i agree even said he that the government had that aim the government obviously is guided by abstract considerations and remains indifferent to the influence its measures may exercise the education of women for instance would naturally be regarded as likely to be harmful but the government opens schools and universities for women 
 and the conversation at once passed to the new subject of the education of women 
 alexei alexandrovich expressed the idea that the education of women is apt to be confounded with the emancipation of women and that it is only so that it can be considered dangerous 
 i consider on the contrary that the two questions are inseparably connected together said pestsov it is a vicious circle woman is deprived of rights from lack of education and the lack of education results from the absence of rights we must not forget that the subjection of women is so complete and dates from such distant ages that we are often unwilling to recognize the gulf that separates them from us said he 
 you mentioned rights said sergei ivanovich waiting till pestsov had finished meaning the right of sitting on juries of voting of presiding at councils the right of entering the civil service of sitting in parliament 
 undoubtedly 
 but if women as a rare exception can occupy such positions it seems to me you are wrong in using the expression rights it would be more correct to say duties every man will agree that in doing the duty of a juryman a witness a telegraph clerk we feel we are performing duties and therefore it would be correct to say that women are seeking duties and quite legitimately and one can but sympathize with this desire to assist in the general labor of man 
 quite so alexei alexandrovich assented the question i imagine is simply whether they are fitted for such duties 
 they will most likely be perfectly fitted said stepan arkadyevich when education has become general among them we see this 
 how about the proverb said the prince who had a long while been intent on the conversation his mocking little eyes twinkling i can say it before my daughters her hair is long but her wit is short 
 just what they thought of the negroes before their emancipation said pestsov angrily 
 what seems strange to me is that women should seek fresh duties said sergei ivanovich while we see unhappily that men usually try to avoid them 
 duties are bound up with rights power money honor those are what women are seeking said pestsov 
 just as though i should seek the right to be a wet nurse and feel injured because women are paid for the work while no one will take me said the old prince 
 turovtsin exploded in a loud roar of laughter and sergei ivanovich regretted that he had not made this comparison even alexei alexandrovich smiled 
 yes but a man nurse a baby said pestsov while a woman 
 no there was an englishman who did suckle his baby on board ship said the old prince feeling this freedom in conversation permissible before his own daughters 
 there are as many such englishmen as there would be women officials said sergei ivanovich 
 yes but what is a girl to do who has no family put in stepan arkadyevich thinking of masha chibisova whom he had had in his mind all along in sympathizing with pestsov and supporting him 
 if the story of such a girl were thoroughly sifted you would find she had abandoned a family her own or a where she might have found a duties darya alexandrovna broke in unexpectedly in a tone of exasperation probably suspecting what sort of girl stepan arkadyevich had in mind 
 but we take our stand on principle on the ideal replied pestsov in his sonorous bass woman desires to have the right to be independent educated she is oppressed humiliated by the consciousness of her disabilities 
 and oppressed and humiliated that they engage me at the foundling asylum the old prince said again to the huge delight of turovtsin who in his mirth dropped his asparagus with the thick end in the sauce

 everyone took part in the conversation except kitty and levin at first when they were talking of the influence that one people has on another there rose to mind what he had to say on the subject but these ideas once of such importance in his eyes seemed to come into his brain as in a dream and had now not the slightest interest for him it even struck him as strange that they should be so eager to talk of what was of no use to anyone kitty too one would have supposed should have been interested in what they were saying of the rights and education of women how often she had mused on the subject thinking of her friend abroad varenka of her painful state of dependence how often she had wondered about herself as to what would become of her if she did not marry and how often she had argued with her sister about it but now it did not interest her at all she and levin had a conversation of their own yet not a conversation but a sort of mysterious communication which brought them every moment nearer and stirred in both a sense of glad terror before the unknown into which they were entering 
 at first levin in answer to question how he could have seen her last year in the carriage told her that he had been coming home from the mowing along the highroad and had met her 
 it was very very early in the morning you were probably only just awake your maman was asleep in her corner it was an exquisite morning i was walking along wondering who it could be in the it was a splendid set of four horses with bells and in a second you flashed by and i saw you at the window you were sitting like this holding the strings of your cap in both hands and in awfully deep thought about something he said smiling how i should like to know what you were thinking about then something important 
 i dreadfully untidy she wondered but seeing the smile of ecstasy these reminiscences called up she felt that the impression she had made had been very good she blushed and laughed with delight 
 really i remember 
 how nicely turovtsin laughs said levin admiring his humid eyes and heaving chest 
 have you known him long asked kitty 
 oh everyone knows him 
 and i see you think a horrid man 
 not horrid but nothing in him 
 oh wrong and you must give up thinking so directly said kitty i used to have a very poor opinion of him too but an awfully fine and wonderfully goodhearted man he has a heart of gold 
 how could you find out what sort of heart he has 
 we are great friends i know him very well last winter soon after you came to see us she said with a guilty and at the same time a confiding smile all children had scarlatina and he happened to come to see her and only fancy she said in a whisper he felt so sorry for her that he stayed and began to help her look after the children yes and for three weeks he stopped with them and looked after the children like a nurse 
 i am telling konstantin dmitrievich about turovtsin and the scarlatina she said bending over to her sister 
 yes it was wonderful noble said dolly glancing toward turovtsin who had become aware they were talking of him and smiling gently to him levin glanced once more at turovtsin and wondered how it was he had not realized all this goodness before 
 sorry sorry and never think ill of people again he said gaily genuinely expressing what he felt at the moment

 connected with the conversation that had sprung up on the rights of women there were certain questions as to the inequality of rights in marriage improper to discuss before the ladies pestsov had several times during dinner touched upon these questions but sergei ivanovich and stepan arkadyevich carefully drew him off them 
 when they rose from the table and the ladies had gone out pestsov did not follow them but addressing alexei alexandrovich began to expound the chief ground of inequality the inequality in marriage in his opinion lay in the fact that the infidelity of the wife and infidelity of the husband are punished unequally both by the law and by public opinion 
 stepan arkadyevich went hurriedly up to alexei alexandrovich and offered him a cigar 
 no i smoke alexei alexandrovich answered calmly and as though purposely wishing to show that he was not afraid of the subject he turned to pestsov with a chilly smile 
 i imagine that such a view has a foundation in the very nature of things he said and would have gone on to the drawing room but at this point turovtsin broke suddenly and unexpectedly into the conversation addressing alexei alexandrovich 
 you heard perhaps about priachnikov said turovtsin warmed up by the champagne he had drunk and long waiting for an opportunity to break the silence that had weighed on him vassia priachnikov he said with a smile on his moist red lips addressing himself principally to the most important guest alexei alexandrovich they told me today he fought a duel with kvitsky at tver and has killed him 
 just as it always seems that one bruises oneself on a sore place so stepan arkadyevich felt now that the conversation would by ill luck fall at any moment on alexei sore spot he would again have got his away but alexei alexandrovich himself inquired with curiosity 
 what did priachnikov fight about 
 his wife acted like a man he did called him out and shot him 
 ah said alexei alexandrovich indifferently and lifting his eyebrows he went into the drawing room 
 how glad i am you have come dolly said with a frightened smile meeting him in the outer drawing room i must talk to you sit here 
 alexei alexandrovich with the same expression of indifference due to his lifted eyebrows sat down beside darya alexandrovna and smiled affectedly 
 fortunate said he especially as i meant to ask you to excuse me and to be taking leave i have to start tomorrow 
 darya alexandrovna was firmly convinced of innocence and she felt herself growing pale and her lips quivering with anger at this frigid unfeeling man who was so calmly intending to ruin her innocent friend 
 alexei alexandrovich she said with desperate resolution looking him in the face i asked you about anna you made me no answer how is she 
 she is i believe quite well darya alexandrovna replied alexei alexandrovich without looking at her 
 alexei alexandrovich forgive me i have no right but i love anna as a sister and esteem her i beg i beseech you to tell me what is wrong between you what fault do you find with her 
 alexei alexandrovich frowned and almost closing his eyes dropped his head 
 i presume that your husband has told you the grounds on which i consider it necessary to change my attitude to anna arkadyevna he said without looking her in the face but eying with displeasure shcherbatsky who was walking across the drawing room 
 
 i believe it i believe it i believe it dolly said clasping her bony hands before her with a vigorous gesture she rose quickly and laid her hand on alexei sleeve we shall be disturbed here come this way please 
 agitation had an effect on alexei alexandrovich he got up and submissively followed her to the schoolroom they sat down at a table covered with an oilcloth cut in slits by penknives 
 i i believe it dolly said trying to catch his glance still avoiding her 
 one cannot disbelieve facts darya alexandrovna said he with an emphasis on the word facts 
 but what has she done said darya alexandrovna what precisely has she done 
 she has forsaken her duty and deceived her husband what she has done said he 
 no no it be no for sake you are mistaken said dolly putting her hands to her temples and closing her eyes 
 alexei alexandrovich smiled coldly with his lips alone meaning to signify to her and himself the firmness of his conviction but this warm defense though it could not shake him reopened his wound he began to speak with greater heat 
 it is extremely difficult to be mistaken when a wife herself informs her husband of the fact informs him that eight years of her life and a son are all a mistake and that she wants to begin life anew he said angrily with a snort 
 anna and sin i cannot connect them i cannot believe it 
 darya alexandrovna he said now looking straight into kindly troubled face and feeling that his tongue was being loosened in spite of himself i would give a great deal for doubt to be still possible when i doubted i was miserable but it was better than now when i doubted i had hope but now there is no hope and still i doubt everything i am in such doubt of everything that i even hate my son and sometimes do not believe he is my son i am very unhappy 
 he had no need to say that darya alexandrovna had seen that as soon as he glanced into her face and she felt sorry for him and her faith in the innocence of her friend began to waver 
 oh this is awful awful but can it be true that you are resolved on a divorce 
 i am resolved on extreme measures there is nothing else for me to do 
 nothing else to do nothing else to do she replied with tears in her eyes oh no say nothing else to do she said 
 what is horrible in a misfortune of this kind is that one cannot as in any other in loss in death bear trouble in peace but that one must act said he as though guessing her thought one must get out of the humiliating position in which one is placed one live a trois 
 i understand i quite understand that said dolly and her head sank she was silent for a little thinking of herself of her own grief in her family and all at once with an impulsive movement she raised her head and clasped her hands with an imploring gesture but wait a little you are a christian think of her what will become of her if you cast her off 
 i have thought darya alexandrovna i have thought a great deal said alexei alexandrovich his face turned red in patches and his dim eyes looked straight before him darya alexandrovna at that moment pitied him with all her heart that indeed was what i did when she herself made known to me my humiliation i left everything as of old i gave her a chance to reform i tried to save her and with what result she would not regard the least request that she should observe decorum he said getting heated one may save anyone who does not want to be ruined but if the whole nature is so corrupt so depraved that ruin itself seems to her salvation to be done 
 anything only not divorce answered darya alexandrovna 
 but what is anything 
 no it is awful she will be no wife she will be lost 
 what can i do said alexei alexandrovich raising his shoulders and his eyebrows the recollection of his last act had so incensed him that he had become frigid as at the beginning of the conversation i am very grateful for your sympathy but i must be going he said getting up 
 no wait a minute you must not ruin her wait a little i will tell you about myself i was married and my husband deceived me in anger and jealousy i would have thrown up everything i would myself but i came to myself again and who did it anna saved me and here i am living on the children are growing up my husband has come back to his family and feels his fault is growing purer better and i live on i have forgiven it and you ought to forgive 
 alexei alexandrovich heard her but her words had no effect on him now all the hatred of that day when he had resolved on a divorce had sprung up again in his soul he shook himself and said in a shrill loud voice 
 forgive i cannot and do not wish to and i regard it as wrong i have done everything for this woman and she has trodden it all in the mud to which she is kin i am not a spiteful man i have never hated anyone but i hate her with my whole soul and i cannot even forgive her because i hate her too much for all the wrong she has done me he said with tears of hatred in his voice 
 love those that hate you darya alexandrovna whispered timorously 
 alexei alexandrovich smiled contemptuously that he knew long ago but it could not be applied to his case 
 love those that hate you but to love those one hates is impossible forgive me for having troubled you everyone has enough to bear in his own grief and regaining his alexei alexandrovich quietly took leave and went away

 connected with the conversation that had sprung up on the rights of women there were certain questions as to the inequality of rights in marriage improper to discuss before the ladies pestsov had several times during dinner touched upon these questions but sergei ivanovich and stepan arkadyevich carefully drew him off them 
 when they rose from the table and the ladies had gone out pestsov did not follow them but addressing alexei alexandrovich began to expound the chief ground of inequality the inequality in marriage in his opinion lay in the fact that the infidelity of the wife and infidelity of the husband are punished unequally both by the law and by public opinion

 when they rose from the table levin would have liked to follow kitty into the drawing room but he was afraid she might dislike this as too obviously paying her attention he remained in the little ring of men taking part in the general conversation and without looking at kitty he was aware of her movements her looks and the place where she was in the drawing room 
 he did at once and without the smallest effort keep the promise he had made her always to think well of all men and to like everyone always the conversation fell on the village commune in which pestsov saw a sort of special principle called by him the choral principle levin did not agree with pestsov nor with his brother who had a special attitude of his own both admitting yet not admitting the significance of the russian commune but he talked to them simply trying to reconcile and soften their differences he was not in the least interested in what he said himself and even less so in what they said all he wanted was that they and everyone should be happy and contented he knew now the one thing of importance and that one thing was at first there in the drawing room and then began moving across and came to a standstill at the door without turning round he felt her eyes fixed on him and her smile and he could not help turning round she was standing in the doorway with shcherbatsky looking at levin 
 i thought you were going toward the piano said he going up to her something i miss in the country music 
 no we only came to fetch you and i thank you she said rewarding him with a smile that was like a gift for coming what do they want to argue for no one ever convinces anyone you know 
 yes true said levin it generally happens that one argues warmly simply because one make out what opponent wants to prove 
 levin had often noticed in discussions between the most intelligent people that after enormous efforts and an enormous expenditure of logical subtleties and words the disputants finally arrived at the realization that what they had so long been struggling to prove to one another had long ago from the beginning of the argument been known to both but that they liked different things and would not define what they liked for fear of its being attacked he had often had the experience of suddenly grasping in a discussion what it was his opponent liked and at once liking it too and immediately he found himself agreeing and then all arguments fell away as useless sometimes too he had experienced the opposite expressing at last what he liked himself which he was devising arguments to defend and chancing to express it well and genuinely he had found his opponent at once agreeing and ceasing to dispute his position he tried to say this 
 she knit her brow trying to understand but directly he began to illustrate his meaning she understood at once 
 i know one must find out what he is arguing for what is precious to him then one can 
 she had completely guessed and expressed his badly expressed idea levin smiled joyfully he was struck by this transition from the confused verbose discussion with pestsov and his brother to this laconic clear almost wordless communication of the most complex ideas 
 shcherbatsky moved away from them and kitty going up to a card table sat down and taking up the chalk began drawing diverging circles over the new green cloth 
 they began again on the subject that had been started at dinner the liberty and occupations of women levin was of the opinion of darya alexandrovna that a girl who did not marry should find a duties in a family he supported this view by the fact that no family can get on without women to help that in every family poor or rich there are and must be nurses either relations or hired 
 no said kitty blushing but looking at him all the more bravely with her truthful eyes a girl may be so circumstanced that she cannot live in the family without humiliation while she herself 
 at the hint he understood her 
 oh yes he said yes yes yes right right 
 and he saw all that pestsov had been maintaining at dinner about the liberty of woman simply from getting a glimpse of the terror of an old existence and its humiliation in heart and loving her he felt that terror and humiliation and at once gave up his arguments 
 a silence followed she was still drawing with the chalk on the table her eyes were shining with a soft light under the influence of her mood he felt in all his being a continually growing tension of happiness 
 ah scribbled all over the table she said and laying down the chalk she made a movement as though to get up 
 what shall i be left alone without her he thought with horror and he took the chalk wait a minute he said sitting down to the table long wanted to ask you one thing 
 he looked straight into her caressing though frightened eyes 
 please ask it 
 here he said and he wrote the initial letters w y t m i c n b d t m n o t these letters meant when you told me it could never be did that mean never or then there seemed no likelihood that she could make out this complicated sentence but he looked at her as though his life depended on her understanding the words 
 she glanced at him seriously then leaned her puckered brow on her hands and began to read once or twice she stole a look at him as though asking him is it what i think it is 
 i understand she said flushing 
 what is this word he said pointing to the n that stood for never 
 it means never she said but not true 
 he quickly rubbed out what he had written gave her the chalk and stood up she wrote t i c n a d 
 dolly was completely comforted in the depression caused by her conversation with alexei alexandrovich when she caught sight of the two figures kitty with the chalk in her hand with a shy and happy smile looking upward at levin and his handsome figure bending over the table with glowing eyes fastened one minute on the table and the next on her he was suddenly radiant he had understood it meant then i could not answer differently 
 he glanced at her questioningly timidly 
 only then 
 yes her smile answered 
 and n and now he asked 
 well read this tell you what i should like should like so much she wrote the initial letters i y c f a f w h this meant if you could forget and forgive what happened 
 he snatched the chalk with nervous trembling fingers and breaking it wrote the initial letters of the following phrase i have nothing to forget and to forgive i have never ceased to love you 
 she glanced at him with a smile that did not waver 
 i understand she said in a whisper 
 he sat down and wrote a long phrase she understood it all and without asking him is it this took the chalk and at once answered 
 for a long while he could not understand what she had written and often looked into her eyes he was stupefied with happiness he could not supply the words she had meant but in her charming eyes beaming with happiness he saw all he needed to know and he wrote three letters but he had hardly finished writing when she read them over her arm and herself finished and wrote the answer yes 
 playing secretaire said the old prince but we must really be getting along if you want to be in time at the theater 
 levin got up and escorted kitty to the door 
 in their conversation everything had been said it had been said that she loved him and that she would tell her father and mother that he would come tomorrow morning

 chapter 
 
 when kitty had gone and levin was left alone he felt such uneasiness without her and such an impatient longing to get as quickly as possible to tomorrow morning when he would see her again and be plighted to her forever that he felt afraid as though of death of those fourteen hours that he had to get through without her it was essential for him to be with someone to talk to so as not to be left alone to deceive time stepan arkadyevich would have been the companion most congenial to him but he was going out he said to a soiree in reality to the ballet levin only had time to tell him he was happy and that he loved him and would never never forget what he had done for him the eyes and the smile of stepan arkadyevich showed levin that he comprehended that feeling fittingly 
 oh so not time to die yet said stepan arkadyevich pressing hand with emotion 
 said levin 
 darya alexandrovna too as she said to him gave him a sort of congratulation saying how glad i am you have met kitty again one must value old friends levin did not like these words of darya she could not understand how lofty and beyond her it all was and she ought not to have dared to allude to it levin said to them but not to be left alone he attached himself to his brother 
 where are you going 
 going to a meeting 
 well come with you may i 
 what for yes come along said sergei ivanovich smiling what is the matter with you today 
 with me happiness is the matter with me said levin letting down the window of the carriage they were driving in you mind so stifling happiness is all the matter with me why is it you have never married 
 sergei ivanovich smiled 
 i am very glad she seems a lovely gi sergei ivanovich was beginning 
 say it say it shouted levin clutching at the collar of his fur coat with both hands and muffling him up in it a lovely girl were such simple humble words so out of harmony with his feeling 
 sergei ivanovich laughed outright a merry laugh which was rare with him 
 well anyway i may say that very glad of it 
 that you may do tomorrow tomorrow and say no more nothing nothing silence said levin and muffling him once more in his fur coat he added i do like you so well is it possible for me to be present at the meeting 
 of course it is 
 what is your discussion about today asked levin never ceasing smiling 
 they arrived at the meeting levin heard the secretary hesitatingly read the minutes which he obviously did not himself understand but levin saw from this face what a good fine kindhearted person he was this was evident from his confusion and embarrassment in reading the minutes then the discussion began they were disputing about the reckoning off of certain sums and the laying of certain pipes and sergei ivanovich was very cutting to two members and said something at great length with an air of triumph and another member scribbling something on a bit of paper began timidly at first but afterward answered him very viciously and delightfully and then sviiazhsky he was there also said something too very handsomely and nobly levin listened to them and saw clearly that this reckoning off of sums and these pipes were not anything real and that they were not at all angry but were all the finest kindest people and everything was as happy and charming as possible among them they did no harm to anyone and were all enjoying it what struck levin was that he could see through them all today and from little almost imperceptible signs knew the soul of each and saw distinctly that they were all good at heart and they were all extremely fond of levin in particular that day this was evident from the way they spoke to him from the friendly affectionate way even those whom he did not know looked at him 
 well are you contented with it sergei ivanovich asked him 
 very much i never supposed it was so interesting nice capital

 when kitty had gone and levin was left alone he felt such uneasiness without her and such an impatient longing to get as quickly as possible to tomorrow morning when he would see her again and be plighted to her forever that he felt afraid as though of death of those fourteen hours that he had to get through without her it was essential for him to be with someone to talk to so as not to be left alone to deceive time stepan arkadyevich would have been the companion most congenial to him but he was going out he said to a soiree in reality to the ballet levin only had time to tell him he was happy and that he loved him and would never never forget what he had done for him the eyes and the smile of stepan arkadyevich showed levin that he comprehended that feeling fittingly 
 oh so not time to die yet said stepan arkadyevich pressing hand with emotion 
 said levin 
 darya alexandrovna too as she said to him gave him a sort of congratulation saying how glad i am you have met kitty again one must value old friends levin did not like these words of darya she could not understand how lofty and beyond her it all was and she ought not to have dared to allude to it levin said to them but not to be left alone he attached himself to his brother 
 where are you going 
 going to a meeting 
 well come with you may i 
 what for yes come along said sergei ivanovich smiling what is the matter with you today 
 with me happiness is the matter with me said levin letting down the window of the carriage they were driving in you mind so stifling happiness is all the matter with me why is it you have never married 
 sergei ivanovich smiled 
 i am very glad she seems a lovely gi sergei ivanovich was beginning 
 say it say it shouted levin clutching at the collar of his fur coat with both hands and muffling him up in it a lovely girl were such simple humble words so out of harmony with his feeling 
 sergei ivanovich laughed outright a merry laugh which was rare with him 
 well anyway i may say that very glad of it 
 that you may do tomorrow tomorrow and say no more nothing nothing silence said levin and muffling him once more in his fur coat he added i do like you so well is it possible for me to be present at the meeting 
 of course it is 
 what is your discussion about today asked levin never ceasing smiling 
 they arrived at the meeting levin heard the secretary hesitatingly read the minutes which he obviously did not himself understand but levin saw from this face what a good fine kindhearted person he was this was evident from his confusion and embarrassment in reading the minutes then the discussion began they were disputing about the reckoning off of certain sums and the laying of certain pipes and sergei ivanovich was very cutting to two members and said something at great length with an air of triumph and another member scribbling something on a bit of paper began timidly at first but afterward answered him very viciously and delightfully and then sviiazhsky he was there also said something too very handsomely and nobly levin listened to them and saw clearly that this reckoning off of sums and these pipes were not anything real and that they were not at all angry but were all the finest kindest people and everything was as happy and charming as possible among them they did no harm to anyone and were all enjoying it what struck levin was that he could see through them all today and from little almost imperceptible signs knew the soul of each and saw distinctly that they were all good at heart and they were all extremely fond of levin in particular that day this was evident from the way they spoke to him from the friendly affectionate way even those whom he did not know looked at him 
 well are you contented with it sergei ivanovich asked him 
 very much i never supposed it was so interesting nice capital 
 sviiazhsky went up to levin and invited him to come round to tea with him levin was utterly at a loss to comprehend or recall what it was he had disliked in sviiazhsky what he had failed to find in him he was a clever and wonderfully goodhearted man

 the streets were still empty levin went to the house of the shcherbatskys the visitors doors were closed and everything was asleep he walked back went into his room again and asked for coffee the day servant not iegor this time brought it to him levin would have entered into conversation with him but a bell rang for the servant and he went out levin tried to drink coffee and take a bite of a roll but his mouth was quite at a loss what to do with the roll levin rejecting the roll put on his coat and went out again for a walk it was nine when he reached the shcherbatskys steps the second time in the house they were only just up and the cook came out to go marketing he had to get through at least two hours more 
 all that night and morning levin lived perfectly unconsciously and felt perfectly lifted out of the conditions of material life he had eaten nothing for a whole day he had not slept for two nights had spent several hours undressed in the frozen air and felt not only fresher and stronger than ever but felt utterly independent of his body he moved without muscular effort and felt as if he could do anything he was convinced he could fly upward or lift the corner of the house if need be he spent the remainder of the time in the street incessantly looking at his watch and gazing about him 
 and what he saw then he never saw again after especially the children going to school the doves fluttering down from the roofs to the pavement and the little loaves covered with flour set out by an unseen hand touched him those loaves those doves and those two boys were not of this earth it all happened at the same time a boy ran toward a dove and glanced smiling at levin the dove with a whir of her wings darted away flashing in the sun amid grains of snow that quivered in the air while from a little window there came a smell of bread and the loaves were set out all of this together was so extraordinarily resplendent that levin laughed and cried with delight going a long way round by gazetny lane and kislovka he went back again to the hotel and putting his watch before him sat down to wait for twelve in the next room they were talking about some sort of machines and swindling and coughing their morning coughs they did not realize that the hand was near twelve the hand reached it levin went out on the steps the sleigh drivers clearly knew all about it they crowded round levin with happy faces quarreling among themselves and offering their services trying not to offend the other sleigh drivers and promising to drive with them too levin took one and told him to drive to the shcherbatskys the sleigh driver was splendid in a white shirt collar sticking out over his overcoat and into his strong red neck the sleigh was high and comfortable and altogether such a one as levin never drove in after and the horse was a good one and tried to gallop yet seem to move the driver knew the shcherbatskys house and drew up at the entrance squaring his arms and saying a whoa especially indicative of respect for his fare the shcherbatskys hall porter certainly knew all about it this was evident from the smile in his eyes and the way he said 
 well a long while since been to see us konstantin dmitrievich 
 not only did he know all about it but he was unmistakably delighted and making efforts to conceal his joy looking into his kindly old eyes levin realized even something new in his happiness 
 are they up 
 pray walk in leave it here said he smiling as levin would have come back to take his hat that meant something 
 to whom shall i announce your honor asked the footman 
 the footman though a young man and one of the new school of footmen a dandy was a very kindhearted good fellow and he too knew all about it 
 the princess the prince the young princess said levin 
 the first person he saw was mademoiselle linon she walked across the room and her ringlets and her face were beaming he had barely spoken to her when suddenly he heard the rustle of a skirt at the door and mademoiselle linon vanished from eyes and a joyful terror came over him at the nearness of his happiness mademoiselle linon was in great haste and leaving him went out at the other door directly she had gone out swift swift light steps sounded on the parquet and his bliss his life his own self what was best in himself what he had so long sought and longed for was quickly so quickly approaching him she did not walk but seemed by some unseen force to float toward him 
 he saw nothing but her clear truthful eyes frightened by the same bliss of love that flooded his heart those eyes were shining nearer and nearer blinding him with their light of love she stopped close to him touching him her hands rose and dropped on his shoulders 
 she had done all she could she had run up to him and given herself up entirely shy and happy he put his arms round her and pressed his lips to her mouth which sought his kiss 
 she too had not slept all night and had been expecting him all the morning 
 her mother and father had consented without demur and were happy in her happiness she had been waiting for him she wanted to be the first to tell him her happiness and his she had got ready to see him alone and had been delighted at the idea and had been shy and ashamed and did not know herself what she was to do she had heard his steps and voice and had waited at the door for mademoiselle linon to go mademoiselle linon had gone away without thinking without asking herself how and what she had gone up to him and did as she was doing 
 let us go to mamma she said taking him by the hand for a long while he could say nothing not so much because he was afraid of desecrating the loftiness of his emotion by a word as that every time he tried to say something instead of words he felt that tears of happiness were welling up he took her hand and kissed it 
 can it be true he said at last in a choked voice i believe you love me dear 
 she smiled at that dear and at the timidity with which he glanced at her 
 yes she said significantly deliberately i am so happy 
 without letting go his hand she went into the drawing room the princess seeing them breathed quickly and immediately began to cry and then immediately began to laugh and with a vigorous step levin had not expected ran up to him and hugging his head kissed him wetting his cheeks with her tears 
 so it is all settled i am glad love her i am glad kitty 
 not been long settling things said the old prince trying to seem unmoved but levin noticed that his eyes were wet when he turned to him long always wished for this said the prince taking levin by the arm and drawing him toward himself even when this little featherhead fancied 
 papa shrieked kitty and shut his mouth with her hands 
 well i he said very very plea oh what a fool i am 
 he embraced kitty kissed her face her hand her face again and made the sign of the cross over her 
 and there came over levin a new feeling of love for this man the old prince till then so little known to him when he saw how slowly and tenderly kitty kissed his muscular hand

 the princess was sitting in her armchair silent and smiling the prince sat down beside her kitty stood by her chair still holding his hand all were silent 
 the princess was the first to put everything into words and to translate all thoughts and feelings into practical questions and all felt equally strange and painful for the first minute 
 when is it to be we must have the benediction and announcement and the wedding to be what do you think alexandre 
 here he is said the old prince pointing to levin the principal person in the matter 
 when said levin blushing tomorrow if you ask me i should say the benediction today and the wedding tomorrow 
 come mon cher nonsense 
 well in a week 
 quite mad 
 no why so 
 well upon my word said the mother smiling delighted at this haste how about the trousseau 
 will there really be a trousseau and all that levin thought with horror but can the trousseau and the benediction and all that can it spoil my happiness nothing can spoil it he glanced at kitty and noticed that she was not in the least not in the very least disturbed by the idea of the trousseau then it must be all right he thought 
 oh i know nothing about it i only said what i should like he said apologetically 
 talk it over then the benediction and announcement can take place now very well 
 the princess went up to her husband kissed him and would have gone away but he held her back embraced her and tenderly as a young lover kissed her several times smiling the old people were obviously muddled for a moment and did not quite know whether it was they who were in love again or their daughter when the prince and the princess had gone levin went up to his betrothed and took her hand he was now and could speak and he had a great deal he wanted to tell her but he did not say at all what he had to say 
 how i knew it would be so i never hoped for it and yet in my heart i was always sure he said i believe that it was ordained 
 and i she said even when she stopped and went on again looking at him resolutely with her truthful eyes even when i thrust my happiness from me i always loved you only but i was carried away i ought to tell you can you forgive it 
 perhaps it was for the best you will have to forgive me so much i ought to tell you 
 this was one of the things he had meant to speak about he had resolved from the first to tell her two things that he was not chaste as she was and that he was not a believer it was agonizing but he considered he ought to tell her both these facts 
 
 no not now later he said 
 very well later but you must certainly tell me not afraid of anything i want to know everything now it is settled 
 he added 
 settled that take me whatever i may be you give me up yes 
 yes yes 
 their conversation was interrupted by mademoiselle linon who with an affected but tender smile came to congratulate her favorite pupil before she had gone the servants came in with their congratulations then relations arrived and there began that state of blissful absurdity from which levin did not emerge till the day after his wedding levin was in a continual state of awkwardness and discomfort but the intensity of his happiness went on increasing all the while he felt continually that a great deal was being expected of him what he did not know and he did everything he was told and it all gave him happiness he had thought his engagement would have nothing about it like others that the ordinary conditions of engaged couples would spoil his special happiness but it ended in his doing exactly as other people did and his happiness being only increased thereby and becoming more and more special more and more unlike anything that had ever happened 
 now we shall have sweetmeats to eat said mademoiselle linon and levin drove off to buy sweetmeats 
 well very glad said sviiazhsky i advise you to get the bouquets from 
 oh are they wanted and he drove to 
 his brother recommended lending money to him as he would have so many expenses presents to give 
 oh are presents wanted and he galloped to 
 and at the and at and at he saw that he was expected that they were pleased to see him and prided themselves on his happiness just as everyone did whom he had to do with during those days what was extraordinary was that everyone not only liked him but even people previously unsympathetic cold and callous were enthusiastic over him gave way to him in everything treated his feelings with tenderness and delicacy and shared his conviction that he was the happiest man in the world because his betrothed was beyond perfection kitty too felt the same thing when countess nordstone ventured to hint that she had hoped for something better kitty was so angry and proved so conclusively that nothing in the world could be better than levin that countess nordstone had to admit it and in presence never met levin without a smile of ecstatic admiration 
 the confession he had promised was the one painful incident of this time he consulted the old prince and with his sanction gave kitty his diary in which there was written the confession that tortured him he had written this diary at the time with a view to his future wife two things caused him anguish his lack of purity and his lack of faith his confession of unbelief passed unnoticed she was religious had never doubted the truths of religion but his external unbelief did not affect her in the least through love she knew all his soul and in his soul she saw what she wanted and that such a state of soul should be called unbelieving was to her a matter of no account the other confession set her weeping bitterly 
 levin not without an inner struggle handed her his diary he knew that between him and her there could not be and should not be any secrets and so he had decided that so it must be but he had not realized what an effect it would have on her he had not put himself in her place it was only when the same evening he came to their house before the theater went into her room and saw her tearstained pitiful sweet face miserable with the suffering he had caused and nothing could undo that he felt the abyss that separated his shameful past from her dovelike purity and was appalled at what he had done 
 take them take these dreadful books she said pushing away the notebooks lying before her on the table why did you give them me no it was better anyway she added touched by his despairing face but awful awful 
 his head sank and he was silent he could say nothing 
 you forgive me he whispered 
 yes i forgive you but horrible 
 but his happiness was so immense that this confession did not shatter it it only added another shade to it she forgave him but from that time more than ever he considered himself unworthy of her morally bowed down lower than ever before her and prized more highly than ever his undeserved happiness

 their conversation was interrupted by mademoiselle linon who with an affected but tender smile came to congratulate her favorite pupil before she had gone the servants came in with their congratulations then relations arrived and there began that state of blissful absurdity from which levin did not emerge till the day after his wedding levin was in a continual state of awkwardness and discomfort but the intensity of his happiness went on increasing all the while he felt continually that a great deal was being expected of him what he did not know and he did everything he was told and it all gave him happiness he had thought his engagement would have nothing about it like others that the ordinary conditions of engaged couples would spoil his special happiness but it ended in his doing exactly as other people did and his happiness being only increased thereby and becoming more and more special more and more unlike anything that had ever happened 
 now we shall have sweetmeats to eat said mademoiselle linon and levin drove off to buy sweetmeats 
 well very glad said sviiazhsky i advise you to get the bouquets from 
 oh are they wanted and he drove to 
 his brother recommended lending money to him as he would have so many expenses presents to give 
 oh are presents wanted and he galloped to 
 and at the and at and at he saw that he was expected that they were pleased to see him and prided themselves on his happiness just as everyone did whom he had to do with during those days what was extraordinary was that everyone not only liked him but even people previously unsympathetic cold and callous were enthusiastic over him gave way to him in everything treated his feelings with tenderness and delicacy and shared his conviction that he was the happiest man in the world because his betrothed was beyond perfection kitty too felt the same thing when countess nordstone ventured to hint that she had hoped for something better kitty was so angry and proved so conclusively that nothing in the world could be better than levin that countess nordstone had to admit it and in presence never met levin without a smile of ecstatic admiration 
 the confession he had promised was the one painful incident of this time he consulted the old prince and with his sanction gave kitty his diary in which there was written the confession that tortured him he had written this diary at the time with a view to his future wife two things caused him anguish his lack of purity and his lack of faith his confession of unbelief passed unnoticed she was religious had never doubted the truths of religion but his external unbelief did not affect her in the least through love she knew all his soul and in his soul she saw what she wanted and that such a state of soul should be called unbelieving was to her a matter of no account the other confession set her weeping bitterly 
 levin not without an inner struggle handed her his diary he knew that between him and her there could not be and should not be any secrets and so he had decided that so it must be but he had not realized what an effect it would have on her he had not put himself in her place it was only when the same evening he came to their house before the theater went into her room and saw her tearstained pitiful sweet face miserable with the suffering he had caused and nothing could undo that he felt the abyss that separated his shameful past from her dovelike purity and was appalled at what he had done 
 take them take these dreadful books she said pushing away the notebooks lying before her on the table why did you give them me no it was better anyway she added touched by his despairing face but awful awful 
 his head sank and he was silent he could say nothing 
 you forgive me he whispered 
 yes i forgive you but horrible 
 but his happiness was so immense that this confession did not shatter it it only added another shade to it she forgave him but from that time more than ever he considered himself unworthy of her morally bowed down lower than ever before her and prized more highly than ever his undeserved happiness

 chapter 
 
 unconsciously going over in his memory the conversations that had taken place during and after dinner alexei alexandrovich returned to his solitary room darya words about forgiveness had aroused in him nothing but annoyance the applicability or nonapplicability of the christian precept to his own case was too difficult a question to be discussed lightly and this question had long ago been answered by alexei alexandrovich in the negative of all that had been said what stuck most in his memory was the phrase of stupid turovtsin acted like a man he did called him out and shot him everyone had apparently shared this feeling though from politeness they had not expressed it 
 but the matter is settled useless thinking about it alexei alexandrovich told himself and thinking of nothing but the journey before him and the revision work he had to do he went into his room and asked the porter who escorted him where his man was the porter said that the man had just gone out alexei alexandrovich ordered tea to be sent him sat down to the table and taking the schedule began considering the route of his journey 
 two telegrams said his valet coming into the room i beg your pardon your excellency just stepped out this very minute 
 alexei alexandrovich took the telegrams and opened them the first telegram was the announcement of appointment to the very post karenin had coveted alexei alexandrovich flung the telegram down and flushing got up and began to pace up and down the room quos vult perdere dementat he said meaning by quos the persons responsible for this appointment he was not so much annoyed at not receiving the post as at having been so conspicuously passed over but it was incomprehensible amazing to him that they did not see that the wordy phrasemonger stremov was the last man fit for it how could they fail to see they were ruining themselves lowering their prestige by this appointment 
 something else in the same line he said to himself bitterly opening the second telegram the telegram was from his wife her name written in blue pencil anna was the first thing that caught his eye i am dying i beg i implore you to come i shall die easier with your forgiveness he read he smiled contemptuously and flung down the telegram that this was a trick and a fraud of that he thought for the first minute there could be no doubt 
 there is no deceit she would stick at she was near her confinement perhaps it is the confinement but what can be their aim to legitimize the child to compromise me and prevent a divorce he thought but something was said in it i am dying he read the telegram again and suddenly the plain meaning of what was said in it struck him and if it is true he said to himself if it is true that in the moment of agony and nearness to death she is genuinely penitent and i taking it for a trick refuse to go that would not only be cruel and everyone would blame me but it would be stupid on my part 
 piotr call a coach i am going to peterburg he said to his servant 
 alexei alexandrovich decided that he would go to peterburg and see his wife if her illness was a trick he would say nothing and go away again if she were really in danger and wished to see him before her death he would forgive her if he found her alive and pay her the last duties if he came too late 
 all the way he thought no more of what he ought to do 
 with a sense of weariness and uncleanness from the night spent in the train in the early fog of peterburg alexei alexandrovich drove through the deserted nevsky prospect and stared straight before him without thinking of what was awaiting him he could not think about it because in picturing what would happen he could not drive away the reflection that her death would at once remove all the difficulty of his position bakers closed shops night cabmen street sweepers sweeping the pavements flashed past his eyes and he watched it all trying to smother the thought of what was awaiting him and what he dared not hope for and yet was hoping for he drove up to the steps a hackney sleigh and a coach with its coachman asleep stood at the entrance as he went into the entry alexei alexandrovich seemed to get out his resolution from the remotest corner of his brain and mastered it thoroughly its meaning ran if a trick then calm contempt and departure if truth do what is seemly 
 the porter opened the door before alexei alexandrovich rang the porter kapitonich looked queer in an old coat without a tie and in slippers 
 how is your mistress 
 she was confined yesterday successfully 
 alexei alexandrovich stopped short and turned white he felt distinctly now how intensely he had longed for her death 
 and how is she 
 kornei in his morning apron ran downstairs 
 very ill he answered there was a consultation yesterday and the here now 
 take my things said alexei alexandrovich and feeling some relief at the news that there was still hope of her death he went into the hall 
 on the hatstand there was a military overcoat alexei alexandrovich noticed it and asked 
 who is here 
 the doctor the midwife and count vronsky 
 alexei alexandrovich went into the inner rooms 
 in the drawing room there was no one at the sound of his steps the midwife came out of boudoir in a cap with lilac ribbons 
 she went up to alexei alexandrovich and with the familiarity given by the approach of death took him by the arm and drew him toward the bedroom 
 thank god come she keeps on talking about you and nothing but you she said 
 make haste with the ice the peremptory voice came from the bedroom 
 alexei alexandrovich went into the boudoir at her table sitting sideways in a low chair was vronsky his face hidden in his hands weeping he jumped up at the voice took his hands from his face and saw alexei alexandrovich seeing the husband he was so overwhelmed that he sat down again drawing his head into his shoulders as if he wanted to disappear but he made an effort over himself got up and said 
 she is dying the doctors say there is no hope i am entirely in your power only let me be here though i am at your disposal i 
 alexei alexandrovich seeing tears felt a rush of that nervous emotion always produced in him by the sight of other sufferings and turning away his face he moved hurriedly to the door without hearing the rest of the words from the bedroom came the sound of voice saying something her voice was lively animated with exceedingly distinct intonations alexei alexandrovich went into the bedroom and walked up to the bed she was lying with her face turned toward him her cheeks were flushed crimson her eyes glittered her little white hands thrust out from the cuffs of her dressing gown were playing with the quilt twisting it about it seemed as though she were not only well and blooming but in the happiest frame of mind she was talking rapidly musically and with exceptionally correct articulation and expressive intonation 
 because alexei i am speaking of alexei alexandrovich what a strange and awful thing that both are alexeis it alexei would not refuse me i should forget he would forgive but why he come so good he know himself how good he is ah my god what pangs give me some water quick oh that will be bad for her my little girl oh very well then give her to a nurse yes i agree better in fact be coming it will hurt him to see her give her to the nurse 
 anna arkadyevna he has come here he is said the midwife trying to attract her attention to alexei alexandrovich 
 oh what nonsense anna went on not seeing her husband no give her to me give me my little one he has not come yet you say he forgive me because you know him no one knows him the only one and it was hard for me even i ought to know his eyes seriozha has just such eyes and i bear to see them because of it has seriozha had his dinner i know everyone will forget to do it he would not forget seriozha must be moved into the corner room and mariette must be asked to sleep with him 
 all of a sudden she shrank back and was silent and in terror as though expecting a blow as though to defend herself she raised her hands to her face she had seen her husband 
 no no she began i am not afraid of him i am afraid of death alexei come here i am in a hurry because no time i long left to live the fever will begin directly and i shall understand nothing more now i understand i understand it all i see it all 
 alexei wrinkled face wore an expression of suffering he took her by the hand and tried to say something but he could not utter it his lower lip quivered but he still went on struggling with his emotion and only now and then glanced at her and each time he glanced at her he saw her eyes gazing at him with such passionate and exultant tenderness as he had never yet seen in them 
 wait a minute you know stay a little stay she stopped as though collecting her ideas yes she began yes yes yes this is what i wanted to say be surprised at me still the same but there is another woman in me afraid of her she loved that man and i tried to hate you and could not forget about her that used to be that woman myself now my real self dying now i know i shall die ask him even now i feel see here the weights on my feet on my hands on my fingers my fingers see how huge they are but this will soon be all over only one thing i want forgive me forgive me quite terrible but my nurse would tell me the holy martyr what was her name she was worse and go to rome a wilderness and there i shall be no trouble to anyone only take seriozha and the little one no you forgive me i know it be forgiven no no go away too good she held his hand in one burning hand while she pushed him away with the other 
 the nervous agitation of alexei alexandrovich kept increasing and had by now reached such a point that he ceased to struggle with it he suddenly felt that what he had regarded as nervous agitation was on the contrary a blissful spiritual condition that gave him all at once a new happiness he had never known he did not think that the christian law which he had been all his life trying to follow enjoined on him to forgive and love his enemies but a joyous feeling of love and forgiveness for his enemies filled his heart he knelt down and laying his head in the curve of her arm which burned him as with fire through the sleeve he sobbed like a little child she put her arm around his head which was beginning to grow bald moved toward him and with defiant pride lifted up her eyes 
 that is he i knew him now everyone come again why they go away oh take these fur coats off me 
 the doctor unloosed her hands carefully laying her on the pillow and covered her up to the shoulders she lay back submissively and looked before her with beaming eyes 
 remember one thing that i needed nothing but forgiveness and i want nothing more why he come she said turning to the door toward vronsky do come do come give him your hand 
 vronsky came to the side of the bed and seeing anna again hid his face in his hands 
 uncover your face look at him a saint she said oh uncover your face do uncover it she said angrily alexei alexandrovich do uncover his face i want to see him 
 alexei alexandrovich took hands and drew them away from his face which was awful with the expression of agony and shame upon it 
 give him your hand forgive him 
 alexei alexandrovich gave him his hand not attempting to restrain the tears that streamed from his eyes 
 thank god thank god she said now everything is ready only to stretch my legs a little there capital how badly these flowers are done not a bit like a violet she said pointing to the hangings my god my god when will it end give me some morphine doctor give me some morphine oh my god my god 
 and she tossed about on the bed 
 the doctors said that it was puerperal fever and that chances in a hundred it would end in death the whole day long there was fever delirium and unconsciousness at midnight the patient lay without consciousness and almost without pulse 
 the end was expected every minute 
 vronsky had gone home but in the morning he came to inquire and alexei alexandrovich meeting him in the hall said better stay she might ask for you and himself led him to his boudoir toward morning there was a return again of excitement rapid thought and talk and again it ended in unconsciousness on the third day it was the same thing and the doctors said there was hope that day alexei alexandrovich went into the boudoir where vronsky was sitting and closing the door sat down opposite him 
 alexei alexandrovich said vronsky feeling that a statement of the situation was coming i speak i understand spare me however hard it is for you believe me it is more terrible for me 
 he would have risen but alexei alexandrovich took him by the hand and said 
 i beg you to hear me out it is necessary i must explain my feelings the feelings that have guided me and will guide me so that you may not be in error regarding me you know i had resolved on a divorce and had even begun to take proceedings i conceal from you that in beginning this i was in uncertainty i was in misery i will confess that i was pursued by a desire to revenge myself on you and on her when i got the telegram i came here with the same feelings i will say more i longed for her death but he paused pondering whether to disclose or not to disclose his feelings but i saw her and forgave her and the happiness of forgiveness has revealed to me my duty i forgive completely i would offer the other cheek i would give my cloak if my coat be taken i pray to god only not to take from me the bliss of forgiveness 
 tears stood in his eyes and the luminous serene look in them impressed vronsky 
 this is my position you can trample me in the mud make me the laughingstock of the world i will not abandon her and i will never utter a word of reproach to you alexei alexandrovich went on my duty is clearly marked for me i ought to be with her and i will be if she wishes to see you i will let you know but now i suppose it would be better for you to go away 
 he got up and sobs cut short his words vronsky too was getting up and in a stooping not yet erect posture looked up at him from under his brows he did not understand alexei feeling but he felt that it was something higher and even unattainable for him with his view of life

 part four 
 chapter 
 
 after the conversation with alexei alexandrovich vronsky went out on the steps of the karenins house and stood still with difficulty remembering where he was and where he ought to walk or drive he felt disgraced humiliated guilty and deprived of all possibility of washing away his humiliation he felt thrust out of the beaten track along which he had so proudly and lightly walked till then all the habits and rules of his life that had seemed so firm had turned out suddenly false and inapplicable the betrayed husband who had figured till that time as a pitiful creature an incidental and somewhat ludicrous obstacle to his happiness had suddenly been summoned by her herself elevated to an pinnacle and on the pinnacle that husband had shown himself not malignant not false not ludicrous but kind and straightforward and grand vronsky could not but feel this and the roles were suddenly reversed vronsky felt the elevation and his own abasement the truth and his own falsehood he felt that the husband was magnanimous even in his sorrow while he had been base and petty in his deceit but this sense of his own humiliation before the man he had unjustly despised made up only a small part of his misery he felt unutterably wretched now for his passion for anna which had seemed to him of late to be growing cooler now that he knew he had lost her forever was stronger than ever it had been he had seen all of her in her illness had come to know her very soul and it seemed to him that he had never loved her till then and now when he had learned to know her to love her as she should be loved he had been humiliated before her and had lost her forever leaving with her nothing of himself but a shameful memory most terrible of all had been his ludicrous shameful position when alexei alexandrovich had pulled his hands away from his humiliated face he stood on the steps of the karenins house like one distraught and did not know what to do 
 a hack sir asked the porter 
 yes a hack 
 on getting home after three sleepless nights vronsky without undressing lay prone on the sofa clasping his hands and laying his head on them his head was heavy images memories and ideas of the strangest description followed one another with extraordinary rapidity and vividness first it was the medicine he had poured out for the patient and spilled out of the spoon then the white hands then the queer posture of alexei alexandrovich on the floor beside the bed 
 to sleep to forget he said to himself with the serene confidence of a healthy man that if he is tired and sleepy he will go to sleep at once and the same instant his head did begin to feel drowsy and he began to drop off into forgetfulness the waves of the sea of unconsciousness had begun to meet over his head when all at once it seemed as though a violent shock of electricity had passed over him he started so that he leaped up on the springs of the sofa and leaning on his arms got on his knees in a fright his eyes were wide open as though he had never been asleep the heaviness in his head and the flabbiness in his limbs that he had felt a minute before had suddenly gone 
 you may trample me in the mud he heard alexei words and saw him standing before him and saw face with its burning flush and glittering eyes gazing with love and tenderness not at him but at alexei alexandrovich he saw his own as he fancied foolish and ludicrous figure when alexei alexandrovich had taken his hands away from his face he stretched out his legs again and flung himself on the sofa in the same position and shut his eyes 
 to sleep to sleep he repeated to himself but with his eyes shut he saw more distinctly than ever face as it had been on the memorable evening before the races

 after the conversation with alexei alexandrovich vronsky went out on the steps of the karenins house and stood still with difficulty remembering where he was and where he ought to walk or drive he felt disgraced humiliated guilty and deprived of all possibility of washing away his humiliation he felt thrust out of the beaten track along which he had so proudly and lightly walked till then all the habits and rules of his life that had seemed so firm had turned out suddenly false and inapplicable the betrayed husband who had figured till that time as a pitiful creature an incidental and somewhat ludicrous obstacle to his happiness had suddenly been summoned by her herself elevated to an pinnacle and on the pinnacle that husband had shown himself not malignant not false not ludicrous but kind and straightforward and grand vronsky could not but feel this and the roles were suddenly reversed vronsky felt the elevation and his own abasement the truth and his own falsehood he felt that the husband was magnanimous even in his sorrow while he had been base and petty in his deceit but this sense of his own humiliation before the man he had unjustly despised made up only a small part of his misery he felt unutterably wretched now for his passion for anna which had seemed to him of late to be growing cooler now that he knew he had lost her forever was stronger than ever it had been he had seen all of her in her illness had come to know her very soul and it seemed to him that he had never loved her till then and now when he had learned to know her to love her as she should be loved he had been humiliated before her and had lost her forever leaving with her nothing of himself but a shameful memory most terrible of all had been his ludicrous shameful position when alexei alexandrovich had pulled his hands away from his humiliated face he stood on the steps of the karenins house like one distraught and did not know what to do 
 a hack sir asked the porter 
 yes a hack 
 on getting home after three sleepless nights vronsky without undressing lay prone on the sofa clasping his hands and laying his head on them his head was heavy images memories and ideas of the strangest description followed one another with extraordinary rapidity and vividness first it was the medicine he had poured out for the patient and spilled out of the spoon then the white hands then the queer posture of alexei alexandrovich on the floor beside the bed 
 to sleep to forget he said to himself with the serene confidence of a healthy man that if he is tired and sleepy he will go to sleep at once and the same instant his head did begin to feel drowsy and he began to drop off into forgetfulness the waves of the sea of unconsciousness had begun to meet over his head when all at once it seemed as though a violent shock of electricity had passed over him he started so that he leaped up on the springs of the sofa and leaning on his arms got on his knees in a fright his eyes were wide open as though he had never been asleep the heaviness in his head and the flabbiness in his limbs that he had felt a minute before had suddenly gone 
 you may trample me in the mud he heard alexei words and saw him standing before him and saw face with its burning flush and glittering eyes gazing with love and tenderness not at him but at alexei alexandrovich he saw his own as he fancied foolish and ludicrous figure when alexei alexandrovich had taken his hands away from his face he stretched out his legs again and flung himself on the sofa in the same position and shut his eyes 
 to sleep to sleep he repeated to himself but with his eyes shut he saw more distinctly than ever face as it had been on the memorable evening before the races 
 this cannot and will not be and she wants to wipe it out of her memory but i cannot live without it how can we be reconciled how can we be reconciled he said aloud and unconsciously began to repeat these words this repetition of words checked the rising of fresh images and memories which he felt were thronging in his brain but repeating words did not check his imagination for long again in extraordinarily rapid succession his best moments rose before his mind and then his recent humiliation take away his hands voice was saying he takes away his hands and feels the and idiotic expression of his face 
 he was still lying down trying to sleep though he felt there was not the smallest hope of it and kept repeating stray words from some chain of thought trying by this to check the rising flood of fresh images he listened and heard words repeated in a strange mad whisper you did not appreciate it did not make enough of it you did not appreciate it did not make enough of it

 chapter 
 
 the mistake made by alexei alexandrovich when preparing to see his wife in having overlooked the possibility that her repentance might be sincere and that he might forgive her and she might not die this mistake was two months after his return from moscow brought home to him in all its significance but the mistake made by him had arisen not simply from his having overlooked that contingency but also from the fact that until the day of his interview with his dying wife he had not known his own heart at his sick bedside he had for the first time in his life given way to that feeling of sympathetic suffering always roused in him by the sufferings of others and hitherto looked on by him with shame as a harmful weakness and pity for her and remorse for having desired her death and most of all the joy of forgiveness made him at once conscious not simply of the relief of his own sufferings but of a spiritual peace he had never experienced before he suddenly felt that the very thing that was the source of his sufferings had become the source of his spiritual joy that what had seemed insolvable while he was judging blaming and hating had become clear and simple when he forgave and loved 
 he forgave his wife and pitied her for her sufferings and her remorse he forgave vronsky and pitied him especially after reports reached him of his despairing action he felt more for his son than before and he blamed himself now for having taken too little interest in him but for the little newborn baby he felt a quite peculiar sentiment not of pity only but of tenderness at first from a feeling of compassion alone he had been interested in the delicate little creature who was not his child and who was neglected during her illness and would certainly have died if he had not troubled about her and he did not himself observe how fond he became of her he would go into the nursery several times a day and sit there for a long while so that the nurse and wet nurses who were at first afraid of him got quite used to his presence sometimes for half an hour at a stretch he would sit silently gazing at the downy wrinkled face of the sleeping baby watching the movements of the frowning brows and the plump little hands with clenched fingers that rubbed the little eyes and bridge of the nose with the back of their palms at such moments particularly alexei alexandrovich had a sense of perfect peace and inward harmony and saw nothing extraordinary in his position nothing that ought to be changed 
 but as time went on he saw more and more distinctly that however natural the position now seemed to him he would not long be allowed to remain in it he felt that besides the blessed spiritual force controlling his soul there was another a brutal force as powerful or more powerful which controlled his life and that this force would not allow him that humble peace he longed for he felt that everyone was looking at him with inquiring wonder that he was not understood and that something was expected of him above all he felt the instability and unnaturalness of his relations with his wife 
 when the softening effect of the near approach of death had passed away alexei alexandrovich began to notice that anna was afraid of him ill at ease with him and could not look him straight in the face she seemed to be wanting yet not daring to tell him something and as though foreseeing that their present relations could not continue she seemed to be expecting something from him 
 toward the end of february baby daughter who had also been named anna happened to fall ill alexei alexandrovich was in the nursery in the morning and leaving orders for the doctor to be sent for he went to his office on finishing his work he returned home at four going into the hall he saw a handsome footman in a gallooned livery and a cape holding a white fur cloak 
 who is here asked alexei alexandrovich 
 princess elizaveta fiodorovna tverskaia the footman answered and it seemed to alexei alexandrovich that the fellow grinned 
 during all this difficult time alexei alexandrovich had noticed that his worldly acquaintances especially women took a peculiar interest in him and his wife he observed all these acquaintances with difficulty concealing their mirth at something the same mirth that he had perceived in the eyes and just now in the eyes of this footman everyone seemed somehow hugely delighted as though just come from a wedding when they met him they inquired with enjoyment after his health 
 the presence of princess tverskaia was unpleasant to alexei alexandrovich from the memories associated with her and also because he disliked her and he went straight to the nursery in the day nursery seriozha leaning on the table with his legs on a chair was drawing and chatting away merrily the english governess who had during illness replaced the french one was sitting near the boy knitting mignardise she hurriedly got up curtsied and pulled seriozha 
 alexei alexandrovich stroked his hair answered the inquiries about his wife and asked what the doctor had said of the baby 
 the doctor said it was nothing serious and he ordered a bath sir 
 but she is still in pain said alexei alexandrovich listening to the screaming in the next room 
 i think the wet nurse sir the englishwoman said firmly 
 what makes you think so he asked stopping short 
 just as it was at countess sir they gave the baby medicine and it turned out that the baby was simply hungry the wet nurse had no milk sir 
 alexei alexandrovich pondered and after standing still a few seconds he went in at the other door the baby was lying with its head thrown back stiffening itself in the arms and would not take the plump breast offered it and it never ceased screaming in spite of the double hushing of the wet nurse and the other nurse who was bending over her 
 still no better said alexei alexandrovich 
 very restless answered the nurse in a whisper 
 miss edwards says that perhaps the wet nurse has no milk he said 
 i think so too alexei alexandrovich 
 then why you say so 
 one to say it to anna arkadyevna is still ill said the nurse discontentedly 
 the nurse was an old servant of the family and in her simple words there seemed to alexei alexandrovich an allusion to his position 
 the baby screamed louder than ever struggling and choking the nurse with a gesture of despair went to it took it from the wet arms and began walking up and down rocking it 
 you must ask the doctor to examine the wet nurse said alexei alexandrovich 
 the smartly dressed and nurse frightened at the idea of losing her place muttered something to herself and covering her bosom smiled contemptuously at the idea of doubts being cast on her abundance of milk in that smile too alexei alexandrovich saw a sneer at his position 
 luckless child said the nurse hushing the baby and still walking up and down with it 
 alexei alexandrovich sat down and with a despondent and suffering face watched the nurse walking to and fro 
 when the child at last was still and had been put in a deep bed and the nurse after smoothing the little pillow had left her alexei alexandrovich got up and walking awkwardly on tiptoe approached the baby for a minute he was still and with the same despondent face gazed at the baby but all at once a smile that moved his hair and the skin of his forehead came out on his face and he went as softly out of the room 
 in the dining room he rang the bell and told the servant who came in to send again for the doctor he felt vexed with his wife for not being anxious about this charming baby and in this vexed humor he had no wish to go to her he had no wish either to see princess betsy but his wife might wonder why he did not go to her as usual and so overcoming his disinclination he went toward her bedroom as he walked over the soft rug toward the door he could not help overhearing a conversation he did not want to hear 
 if he been going away i could have understood your refusal and his too but your husband ought to be above that betsy was saying 
 not for my husband for myself i wish it say that answered excited voice 
 yes but you must care to say to a man who has shot himself on your account 
 just why i want to 
 with a dismayed and guilty expression alexei alexandrovich stopped and would have gone back unobserved but reflecting that this would be undignified he turned back again and clearing his throat he approached the bedroom the voices were silent and he went in 
 anna in a gray dressing gown with a crop of short clustering black curls on her round head was sitting on a settee the animation died out of her face as it always did at the sight of her husband she dropped her head and looked round uneasily at betsy betsy dressed in the height of the latest fashion in a hat that towered over her head like a shade on a lamp in a dress with crude oblique stripes slanting one way on the bodice and the other way on the skirt was sitting beside anna her tall flat figure held erect bowing her head she greeted alexei alexandrovich with an ironical smile 
 ah she said as though surprised very glad at home you never put in an appearance anywhere and i seen you ever since anna has been ill i have heard all about it your anxiety yes a wonderful husband she said with a significant and affable air as though she were bestowing an order of magnanimity on him for his conduct toward his wife 
 alexei alexandrovich bowed frigidly and kissing his hand asked how she was 
 better i think she said avoiding his eyes 
 but rather a feverish complexion he said laying stress on the word feverish 
 been talking too much said betsy i feel selfishness on my part and i am going away 
 she got up but anna suddenly flushing quickly caught at her hand 
 no wait a minute please i must tell you no i mean you she turned to alexei alexandrovich and her neck and brow were suffused with crimson i and keep anything secret from you she said 
 alexei alexandrovich cracked his fingers and bowed his head 
 been telling me that count vronsky wants to come here to say before his departure for tashkend she did not look at her husband and was evidently in haste to have everything out however hard it might be for her i told her i could not receive him 
 you said my dear that it would depend on alexei alexandrovich betsy corrected her 
 oh no i receive him and what object would there be in she stopped suddenly and glanced inquiringly at her husband he did not look at her in short i wish it 
 alexei alexandrovich advanced and would have taken her hand 
 her first impulse was to jerk back her hand from the damp hand with big swollen veins that sought hers but with an obvious effort to control herself she pressed his hand 
 i am very grateful to you for your confidence but he said feeling with confusion and annoyance that what he could decide easily and clearly by himself he could not discuss before princess tverskaia who to him stood for the incarnation of that brute force which would inevitably control him in the life he led in the eyes of the world and hinder him from giving way to his feeling of love and forgiveness he stopped short looking at princess tverskaia 
 well my darling said betsy getting up she kissed anna and went out alexei alexandrovich escorted her out 
 alexei alexandrovich i know you are a truly magnanimous man said betsy stopping in the little drawing room and with special warmth shaking hands with him once more i am an outsider but i love her so and respect you that i venture to advise receive him alexei vronsky is the soul of honor and he is going away to tashkend 
 thank you princess for your sympathy and advice but the question of whether my wife can or cannot see anyone she must decide herself 
 he said this from habit lifting his brows with dignity and reflected immediately that whatever his words might be there could be no dignity in his position and he saw this by the suppressed malicious and ironical smile with which betsy glanced at him after this phrase

 alexei alexandrovich took leave of betsy in the drawing room and went to his wife she was lying down but hearing his steps she sat up hastily in her former attitude and looked in a scared way at him he saw she had been crying 
 i am very grateful for your confidence in me he repeated gently in russian the phrase he had said in presence in french and sat down beside her when he spoke to her in russian using the russian thou of intimacy and affection it was insufferably irritating to anna and i am very grateful for your decision i too imagine that since he is going away there is no sort of necessity for count vronsky to come here however if 
 but said so already so why repeat it anna suddenly interrupted him with an irritation she could not succeed in repressing no sort of necessity she thought for a man to come and say to the woman he loves for whom he was ready to ruin himself and has ruined himself and who cannot live without him no sort of necessity she compressed her lips and dropped her burning eyes to his hands with their swollen veins they were slowly rubbing each other let us never speak of it she added more calmly 
 i have left this question to you to decide and i am very glad to see alexei alexandrovich was beginning 
 that my wish coincides with your own she finished quickly exasperated at his talking so slowly while she knew beforehand all he would say 
 yes he assented and princess interference in the most difficult private affairs is utterly uncalled for she especially 
 i believe a word of said about her said anna quickly i know she really cares for me 
 alexei alexandrovich sighed and said nothing she played nervously with the tassel of her dressing gown glancing at him with that torturing sensation of physical repulsion for which she blamed herself though she could not control it her only desire now was to be rid of his repelling presence 
 i have just sent for the doctor said alexei alexandrovich 
 i am very well what do i want the doctor for 
 no the little one cries and they say the wet nurse enough milk 
 why you let me nurse her when i begged to anyway alexei alexandrovich knew what was meant by that anyway a baby and killing her she rang the bell and ordered the baby to be brought her i begged to nurse her i allowed to and now blamed for it 
 i blame 
 yes you do blame me my god why i die and she broke into sobs forgive me nervous unjust she said controlling herself but do go away 
 no it go on like this alexei alexandrovich said to himself resolutely as he left his room 
 never had the impossibility of his position in the eyes and his hatred of him and above all the might of that mysterious brutal force that guided his life against his spiritual inclinations and exacted conformity with its decrees and a change in his present attitude to his wife never had it been presented to him with such distinctness as on that day he saw clearly that all the world and anna expected something of him but what exactly he could not make out he felt that this was rousing in his soul a feeling of anger destructive of his peace of mind and of all the good of his achievement he believed that for anna herself it would be better to break off all relations with vronsky but if they all thought this out of the question he was even ready to allow these relations to be renewed so long as the children were not disgraced and he was not deprived of them nor forced to change his position bad as this might be it was at any rate better than a rupture which would put her in a hopeless and shameful position and deprive him of everything he cared for but he felt helpless he knew beforehand that everyone was against him and that he would not be allowed to do what seemed to him now so natural and right but would be forced to do what was wrong though to them it seemed the proper thing

 alexei alexandrovich took leave of betsy in the drawing room and went to his wife she was lying down but hearing his steps she sat up hastily in her former attitude and looked in a scared way at him he saw she had been crying 
 i am very grateful for your confidence in me he repeated gently in russian the phrase he had said in presence in french and sat down beside her when he spoke to her in russian using the russian thou of intimacy and affection it was insufferably irritating to anna and i am very grateful for your decision i too imagine that since he is going away there is no sort of necessity for count vronsky to come here however if 
 but said so already so why repeat it anna suddenly interrupted him with an irritation she could not succeed in repressing no sort of necessity she thought for a man to come and say to the woman he loves for whom he was ready to ruin himself and has ruined himself and who cannot live without him no sort of necessity she compressed her lips and dropped her burning eyes to his hands with their swollen veins they were slowly rubbing each other let us never speak of it she added more calmly 
 i have left this question to you to decide and i am very glad to see alexei alexandrovich was beginning 
 that my wish coincides with your own she finished quickly exasperated at his talking so slowly while she knew beforehand all he would say 
 yes he assented and princess interference in the most difficult private affairs is utterly uncalled for she especially 
 i believe a word of said about her said anna quickly i know she really cares for me 
 alexei alexandrovich sighed and said nothing she played nervously with the tassel of her dressing gown glancing at him with that torturing sensation of physical repulsion for which she blamed herself though she could not control it her only desire now was to be rid of his repelling presence

 before betsy had time to walk out of the drawing room she was met in the doorway by stepan arkadyevich who had just come from where a consignment of fresh oysters had been received 
 ah princess what a delightful meeting he began been to see you 
 a meeting for one minute for going said betsy smiling and putting on her glove 
 put on your glove yet princess let me kiss your hand nothing so thankful to the revival of the old fashions for as kissing the hand he kissed hand when shall we see each other 
 you deserve it answered betsy smiling 
 oh yes i deserve a great deal for become a most serious person i not only manage my own domestic affairs but other too he said with a significant expression 
 oh so glad answered betsy at once understanding that he was speaking of anna and going back into the drawing room they stood in a corner killing her said betsy in a whisper full of meaning impossible impossible 
 so glad you think so said stepan arkadyevich shaking his head with a serious and sympathetically distressed expression what come to peterburg for 
 the whole talking of it she said an impossible situation she pines and pines away he understand that one of those women who trifle with their feelings one of two things either let him take her away act with energy or give her a divorce this is stifling her 
 yes yes just so oblonsky said sighing 
 what come for at least not solely for that been made a kammerherr of course one has to give thanks but the chief thing was having to settle this 
 well god help you said betsy 
 after accompanying betsy to the outside hall once more kissing her hand above the glove at the point where the pulse beats and murmuring to her such unseemly nonsense that she did not know whether to laugh or to be angry stepan arkadyevich went to his sister he found her in tears 
 although he happened to be bubbling over with good spirits stepan arkadyevich immediately and quite naturally fell into the sympathetic poetically emotional tone which harmonized with her mood he asked her how she was and how she had spent the morning 
 very very miserably today and this morning and all past days and all the days to come she said 
 i think giving way to pessimism you must rouse yourself you must look life in the face i know hard but 
 i have heard it said that women love men even for their vices anna began suddenly but i hate him for his virtues i live with him do you understand the sight of him has a physical effect in me i am beside myself from it i i live with him what am i to do i have been unhappy and used to think one be unhappier but the awful state of things i am going through now i could never have conceived would you believe it that knowing a good man a splendid man that not worth his little finger i still hate him i hate him for his generosity and nothing left for me but 
 she would have said death but stepan arkadyevich would not let her finish 
 you are ill and overwrought he said believe me exaggerating dreadfully nothing so terrible in it 
 and stepan arkadyevich smiled no one else in stepan place having to do with such despair would have ventured to smile the smile would have seemed brutal but in his smile there was so much of sweetness and almost feminine tenderness that his smile did not wound but softened and soothed his gentle soothing words and smiles were as soothing and softening as almond oil and anna soon felt this 
 no stiva she said lost lost worse than lost i say yet that all is over on the contrary i feel that not over an overstrained cord that must snap but not ended yet and it will have a fearful end 
 no matter we must let the cord be loosened little by little no position from which there is no way of escape 
 i have thought and thought only one 
 again he knew from her terrified eyes that this one way of escape in her thought was death and he would not let her say it 
 not at all he said listen to me you see your own position as i can let me tell you candidly my opinion again he smiled discreetly his smile begin from the beginning you married a man twenty years older than yourself you married him without love and not knowing what love was it was a mistake admit 
 a fearful mistake said anna 
 but i repeat an accomplished fact then you had let us say the misfortune to love a man not your husband that was a misfortune but that too is an accomplished fact and your husband knew it and forgave it he stopped at each sentence waiting for her to object but she made no answer that now the question is can you go on living with your husband do you wish it does he wish it 
 i know nothing nothing 
 but you said yourself that you endure him 
 no i say so i deny it i know anything i understand anything 
 yes but let 
 you understand i feel lying head downward in a sort of pit but i ought not to save myself and i 
 never mind slip something under you and pull you out i understand you i understand that you take it on yourself to express your wishes your feelings 
 nothing nothing i wish except for it to be all over 
 but he sees this and knows it and do you suppose it weighs on him any less than on you wretched wretched and what good can come of it while divorce would solve the whole difficulty with some effort stepan arkadyevich brought out his central idea and looked significantly at her 
 she said nothing and shook her cropped head in dissent but from the look in her face that suddenly brightened into its former beauty he saw that if she did not desire this it was simply because it seemed to her an unattainable happiness 
 awfully sorry for you both and how happy i should be if i could arrange things said stepan arkadyevich smiling more boldly speak say a word god grant only that i may speak as i feel going to him 
 anna looked at him with dreamy shining eyes and said nothing

 stepan arkadyevich with the same somewhat solemn expression with which he used to take his presidential chair at his board walked into alexei room alexei alexandrovich was walking about his room with his hands behind his back thinking of just what stepan arkadyevich had been discussing with his wife 
 not interrupting you said stepan arkadyevich on the sight of his becoming suddenly aware of a sense of embarrassment unusual with him to conceal this embarrassment he took out a newly purchased cigarette case that opened in a new way and sniffing the leather took a cigarette out of it 
 no do you want anything alexei alexandrovich said reluctantly 
 yes i wished i wanted yes i wanted to talk to you said stepan arkadyevich with surprise aware of an unaccustomed timidity 
 this feeling was so unexpected and so strange that he did not believe it was the voice of conscience telling him that what he meant to do was wrong stepan arkadyevich made an effort and struggled with the timidity that had come over him 
 i hope you believe in my love for my sister and my sincere affection and respect for you he said reddening 
 alexei alexandrovich stood still and said nothing but his face struck stepan arkadyevich by its expression of an unresisting sacrifice 
 i intended i wanted to have a little talk with you about my sister and your mutual position he said still struggling with an unaccustomed constraint 
 alexei alexandrovich smiled mournfully looked at his and without answering went up to the table took from it an unfinished letter and handed it to his 
 i think unceasingly of the same thing and here is what i had begun writing thinking i could say it better by letter and that my presence irritates her he said as he gave him the letter 
 stepan arkadyevich took the letter looked with incredulous surprise at the lusterless eyes fixed so immovably on him and began to read 
 i see that my presence is irksome to you painful as it is to me to believe it i see that it is so and cannot be otherwise i blame you and god is my witness that on seeing you at the time of your illness i resolved with my whole heart to forget all that had passed between us and to begin a new life i do not regret and shall never regret what i have done but i have desired one thing your good the good of your soul and now i see i have not attained that tell me yourself what will give you true happiness and peace to your soul i put myself entirely in your hands and trust to your feeling of what is right 
 stepan arkadyevich handed back the letter and with the same surprise continued looking at his not knowing what to say this silence was so awkward for both of them that stepan lips began twitching nervously while he still gazed without speaking at face 
 what i wanted to say to her said alexei alexandrovich turning away 
 yes yes said stepan arkadyevich not able to answer for the tears that were choking him yes yes i understand you he brought out at last 
 i want to know what she would like said alexei alexandrovich 
 i am afraid she does not understand her own position she is not a judge said stepan arkadyevich recovering himself she is crushed simply crushed by your generosity if she were to read this letter she would be incapable of saying anything she would only hang her head lower than ever 
 yes but to be done in that case how explain how find out her wishes 
 if you will allow me to give my opinion i think that it lies with you to point out directly the steps you consider necessary to end the situation 
 so you consider it must be ended alexei alexandrovich interrupted him but how he added with a gesture of his hands before his eyes not usual with him i see no possible way out of it 
 there is some way of getting out of every situation said stepan arkadyevich standing up and becoming more cheerful there was a time when you thought of breaking off if you are convinced now that you cannot make each other happy 
 happiness may be variously understood but suppose that i agree to everything that i want nothing what way is there of getting out of our situation 
 if you care to know my opinion said stepan arkadyevich with the same smile of softening tenderness with which he had been talking to anna his kindly smile was so winning that alexei alexandrovich feeling his own weakness and unconsciously swayed by it was ready to believe what stepan arkadyevich was saying she will never speak out about it but one thing is possible one thing she might desire he went on that is the cessation of your relations and all memories associated with them to my thinking in your situation the essential thing is the formation of a new attitude to one another and that can only rest on a basis of freedom on both sides 
 divorce alexei alexandrovich interrupted in a tone of aversion 
 yes i imagine that divorce yes divorce stepan arkadyevich repeated reddening that is from every point of view the most rational course for married people who find themselves in the situation you are in what can be done if married people find that life is impossible for them together that may always happen 
 alexei alexandrovich sighed heavily and closed his eyes 
 only one point to be considered is either of the parties desirous of forming new ties if not it is very simple said stepan arkadyevich feeling more and more free from constraint 
 alexei alexandrovich scowling with emotion muttered something to himself and made no answer all that seemed so simple to stepan arkadyevich alexei alexandrovich had thought over thousands of times and so far from being simple it all seemed to him utterly impossible divorce the details of which he knew by this time seemed to him now out of the question because the sense of his own dignity and respect for religion forbade his taking upon himself a fictitious charge of adultery and still more suffering his wife pardoned and beloved by him to be caught in the fact and put to public shame divorce appeared to him impossible also on other still more weighty grounds 
 what would become of his son in case of a divorce to leave him with his mother was out of the question the divorced mother would have her own illegitimate family in which his status as a stepson and his education would be probably bad keep him with him he knew that would be an act of vengeance on his part and that he did not desire but apart from this what more than all made divorce seem impossible to alexei alexandrovich was that by consenting to a divorce he would be completely ruining anna the saying of darya alexandrovna at moscow that in deciding on a divorce he was thinking of himself and not considering that by this he would be ruining her irrevocably had sunk into his heart and connecting this saying with his forgiveness of her with his devotion to the children he understood it now in his own way to consent to a divorce to give her her freedom meant in his thoughts to take from himself the last tie that bound him to life the children whom he loved and to take from her the last prop that kept her on the path of right to thrust her down to her ruin if she were divorced he knew she would join her life to and their tie would be an illegitimate and criminal one since a wife by the interpretation of the ecclesiastical law could not marry while her husband was living she will join him and in a year or two he will throw her over or she will form a new tie thought alexei alexandrovich and i by agreeing to an unlawful divorce shall be to blame for her ruin he had thought it all over hundreds of times and was convinced that a divorce was not at all simple as stepan arkadyevich had said but was utterly impossible he did not believe a single word stepan arkadyevich said to him to every word he had a thousand objections to make but he listened to him feeling that his words were the expression of that mighty brutal force which controlled his life and to which he would have to submit 
 the only question is on what terms you agree to give her a divorce she does not want anything does not dare ask you for anything she leaves it all to your magnanimity 
 my god my god what for thought alexei alexandrovich remembering the details of divorce proceedings in which the husband took the blame on himself and with just the same gesture with which vronsky had done it he hid his face in his hands in shame 
 you are troubled i understand that but if you think it over 
 and unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also thought alexei alexandrovich 
 yes yes he cried in a shrill voice i will take the disgrace on myself i will give up even my son but but it be better to let it alone still you may do as you like 
 and turning away so that his could not see him he sat down on a chair at the window there was bitterness there was shame in his heart but with bitterness and shame he felt joy and emotion at the height of his own meekness 
 stepan arkadyevich was touched he was silent for a space 
 alexei alexandrovich believe me she appreciates your magnanimity he said but it seems it was the will of god he added and as he said it felt how foolish a remark it was and with difficulty repressed a smile at his own foolishness 
 alexei alexandrovich would have made some reply but tears stopped him 
 this is an unhappy fatality and one must accept it as such i accept the calamity as an accomplished fact and am doing my best to help both her and you said stepan arkadyevich 
 when he went out of his room he was touched but that did not prevent him from being glad he had successfully brought the matter to a conclusion for he felt certain alexei alexandrovich would not go back on his words to this satisfaction was added the fact that an idea had just struck him for a conundrum turning on his successful achievement when the affair was over he would put it to his wife and most intimate friends he tried this conundrum in two or three different ways but work it out better than that he said to himself with a smile

 and turning away so that his could not see him he sat down on a chair at the window there was bitterness there was shame in his heart but with bitterness and shame he felt joy and emotion at the height of his own meekness 
 stepan arkadyevich was touched he was silent for a space 
 alexei alexandrovich believe me she appreciates your magnanimity he said but it seems it was the will of god he added and as he said it felt how foolish a remark it was and with difficulty repressed a smile at his own foolishness 
 alexei alexandrovich would have made some reply but tears stopped him 
 this is an unhappy fatality and one must accept it as such i accept the calamity as an accomplished fact and am doing my best to help both her and you said stepan arkadyevich 
 when he went out of his room he was touched but that did not prevent him from being glad he had successfully brought the matter to a conclusion for he felt certain alexei alexandrovich would not go back on his words to this satisfaction was added the fact that an idea had just struck him for a conundrum turning on his successful achievement when the affair was over he would put it to his wife and most intimate friends he tried this conundrum in two or three different ways but work it out better than that he said to himself with a smile

 wound had been a dangerous one though it did not touch the heart and for several days he hovered between life and death the first time he was able to speak varia his wife was alone in the room 
 varia he said looking sternly at her i shot myself by accident and please never speak of it and tell everyone so or else too ridiculous 
 without answering his words varia bent over him and with a delighted smile gazed into his face his eyes were clear not feverish but their expression was stern 
 thank god she said not in pain 
 a little here he pointed to his breast 
 then let me change your bandages 
 in silence stiffening his broad jaws he looked at her while she bandaged him up when she had finished he said 
 not delirious please manage that there may be no talk of my having shot myself on purpose 
 no one says so only i hope you shoot yourself by accident any more she said with a questioning smile 
 i think i but it would have been better 
 and he smiled gloomily 
 in spite of these words and this smile which so frightened varia when the inflammation was over and he began to recover he felt that he was completely free from one part of his misery by his action he had as it were washed away the shame and humiliation he had felt before he could now think calmly of alexei alexandrovich he recognized all his magnanimity but he did not now feel himself humiliated by it besides he got back again into the beaten track of his life he saw the possibility of looking men in the face again without shame and he could live in accordance with his own habits one thing he could not pluck out of his heart though he never ceased struggling with it the regret amounting to despair at having lost her forever that having expiated his sin against the husband he was now bound to renounce her and never in future to stand between her with her repentance and her husband he had firmly decided in his heart but he could not tear out of his heart his regret at the loss of her love he could not erase from his memory those moments of happiness which he had known with her and had so little prized at the time and which haunted him with all their charm 
 serpukhovskoy had planned his appointment at tashkend and vronsky agreed to the proposal without the slightest hesitation but the nearer the time of departure came the bitterer was the sacrifice he was making to what he thought his duty 
 his wound had healed and he was driving about making preparations for his departure for tashkend 
 to see her once and then to bury myself to die he thought and as he was paying farewell visits he uttered this thought to betsy charged with this commission betsy had gone to anna and brought him back a negative reply 
 so much the better thought vronsky when he received the news it was a weakness which would have shattered what strength i have left 
 next day betsy herself came to him in the morning and announced that she had heard through oblonsky as a positive fact that alexei alexandrovich had agreed to a divorce and that therefore vronsky could see anna 
 without even troubling himself to see betsy out of his flat forgetting all his resolutions without asking when he could see her or where her husband was vronsky drove straight to the karenins he ran up the stairs seeing no one and nothing and with a rapid step almost breaking into a run he went into her room and without considering without noticing whether there was anyone in the room or not he flung his arms round her and began to cover with kisses her face her hands her neck 
 anna had been preparing herself for this meeting had thought what she would say to him but she did not succeed in saying anything his passion mastered her she tried to calm him to calm herself but it was too late his feeling infected her her lips trembled so that for a long while she could say nothing 
 yes you have conquered me and i am yours she said at last pressing his hands to her bosom

 it will all pass it will all pass we shall be so happy our love if it only could be stronger will be strengthened by there being something terrible in it he said lifting his head and showing his strong teeth in a smile 
 and she could not but respond with a smile not to his words but to the love in his eyes she took his hand and stroked her chilled cheeks and cropped head with it 
 i know you with this short hair grown so pretty a boy but how pale you are 
 yes very weak she said smiling and her lips began trembling again 
 go to italy you will get strong he said 
 can it be possible we could be like husband and wife alone our own family she said looking close into his eyes 
 it only seems strange to me that it can ever have been otherwise

 of fortune 
 it cannot be denied but outward accidents conduce much to fortune favour 
 opportunity death of others occasion fitting virtue but chiefly tile mould of 
 a fortune is in his own hands faber quisque fortunae suae saith the poet 
 and the most frequent of external causes is that the folly of one man is the fortune 
 of another for no man prospers so suddenly as by others errors serpens nisi 
 serpenterm comederit non fit draco overt and apparent virtues bring forth praise 
 but there be secret and hidden virtues that bring forth fortune certain deliveries of a self which have no name the spanish name desemboltura partly expresseth them when there be not stonds nor resdveness in a nature 
 but that the wheels of his mind keep way with the wheels of his fortune for so livy after he had described cato major in these words in ilh viro tanturn robur corporis et animi fiit ut quocwique loco natus esset fortunarus sibi facturs videretur falleth upon that that he had versatile ingenium therefore if a man look sharply and attentively he shall see fortune for though she be blind yet she is not 
 invisible 
 the way of fortune is like the milken way in the sky which is a meeting 
 or knot of a number of small stars not seen asunder but giving light together so are there a number of little and scarce discerned virtues or rather faculties and customs that make men fortunate 
 the italians note some of them such as a man would little think when they speak 
 of one that cannot do amiss they will throw in into his other conditions that he 
 hath poco di motto and certainly there be not two more fortunate properties 
 than to have a little of the fool and not too much of the honest therefore extreme 
 lovers of their country or masters were never fortunate neither can they be for 
 when a man placeth his thoughts without himself he goeth not his own way an hasty fortune maketh an enterpriser and remover the french hath it better entrepreneur or remuamt but the exercised fortune maketh the able man fortune is to be honoured and respected and it be but for her daughters confidence and reputation for those two felicity hreedeth the first within a self the latter in others towards him 
 all wise men to decline me envy of their own virtues use to ascribe them to 
 providence and fortune for so they may the better assume them and besides it is 
 greatness in a man to be the care of me higher powers so caesar said to me pilot 
 in the tempest caesarem portas etfortunam ene so sulla chose the name of felix 
 and not of magnus and it hath been noted that those that ascribe openly too much to their own wisdom and policy end unfortunate it is written that 
 timotheus the athenian after he had in the account he gave to the state of his government often interlaced this speech and in mis fortune had no part never prospered in anything he undertook afterwards certainly mere be whose fortunes are like verses that have a slide and easiness more than the verses of other poets as plutarch sailh of fortune in respect of that of agesilaus or epaminondas and that this should be no doubt it is much in a self

 book confide is sometimes to deliver into a power 
 chapter iii 
 
 it is not all in all sufficient to be wicked in order to prosper the was in a bad way 
 thanks to the francs thenardier had been able to avoid a protest and to honor his signature 
 on the following month they were again in need of money 
 the woman took outfit to paris and pawned it at the for sixty francs as soon as that sum was spent the thenardiers grew accustomed to look on the little girl merely as a child whom they were caring for out of charity and they treated her accordingly 
 as she had no longer any clothes they dressed her in the petticoats and chemises of the thenardier brats that is to say in rags they fed her on what all the rest had little better than the dog a little worse than the cat 
 moreover the cat and the dog were her habitual cosette ate with them under the table from a wooden bowl similar to theirs 
 the mother who had established herself as we shall see later on at m sur m wrote or more correctly caused to be written a letter every month that she might have news of her child the thenardiers replied invariably cosette is doing wonderfully well 
 at the expiration of the first six months the mother sent seven francs for the seventh month and continued her remittances with tolerable regularity from month to month 
 the year was not completed when thenardier said 
 a fine favor she is doing us in sooth 
 what does she expect us to do with her seven francs and he wrote to demand twelve francs 
 the mother whom they had persuaded into the belief that her child was happy and was coming on well submitted and forwarded the twelve francs 
 certain natures cannot love on the one hand without hating on the other 
 mother thenardier loved her two daughters passionately which caused her to hate the stranger 
 it is sad to think that the love of a mother can possess villainous aspects 
 little as was the space occupied by cosette it seemed to her as though it were taken from her own and that that little child diminished the air which her daughters breathed this woman like many women of her sort had a load of caresses and a burden of blows and injuries to dispense each day if she had not had cosette it is certain that her daughters idolized as they were would have received the whole of it but the stranger did them the service to divert the blows to herself her daughters received nothing but caresses 
 cosette could not make a motion which did not draw down upon her head a heavy shower of violent blows and unmerited chastisement 
 the sweet feeble being who should not have understood anything of this world or of god incessantly punished scolded beaten and seeing beside her two little creatures like herself who lived in a ray of dawn 
 madame thenardier was vicious with cosette 
 eponine and azelma were vicious 
 children at that age are only copies of their mother the size is smaller that is all 
 a year passed then another 
 people in the village said 
 those thenardiers are good people 
 they are not rich and yet they are bringing up a poor child who was abandoned on their hands 
 they thought that mother had forgotten her 
 in the meanwhile thenardier having learned it is impossible to say by what obscure means that the child was probably a bastard and that the mother could not acknowledge it exacted fifteen francs a month saying that the creature was growing and eating and threatening to send her away 
 let her not bother me he exclaimed or fire her brat right into the middle of her secrets i must have an increase 
 the mother paid the fifteen francs 
 from year to year the child grew and so did her wretchedness 
 as long as cosette was little she was the of the two other children as soon as she began to develop a little that is to say before she was even five years old she became the servant of the household 
 five years old the reader will say that is not probable alas it is true 
 social suffering begins at all ages have we not recently seen the trial of a man named dumollard an orphan turned bandit who from the age of five as the official documents state being alone in the world worked for his living and stole 
 cosette was made to run on errands to sweep the rooms the courtyard the street to wash the dishes to even carry burdens 
 the thenardiers considered themselves all the more authorized to behave in this manner since the mother who was still at m sur m had become irregular in her payments 
 some months she was in arrears 
 if this mother had returned to montfermeil at the end of these three years she would not have recognized her child 
 cosette so pretty and rosy on her arrival in that house was now thin and pale she had an indescribably uneasy look 
 the sly creature said the thenardiers 
 injustice had made her peevish and misery had made her ugly nothing remained to her except her beautiful eyes which inspired pain because large as they were it seemed as though one beheld in them a still larger amount of sadness 
 it was a thing to see this poor child not yet six years old shivering in the winter in her old rags of linen full of holes sweeping the street before daylight with an enormous broom in her tiny red hands and a tear in her great eyes 
 she was called the lark in the neighborhood 
 the populace who are fond of these figures of speech had taken a fancy to bestow this name on this trembling frightened and shivering little creature no bigger than a bird who was awake every morning before any one else in the house or the village and was always in the street or the fields before daybreak 
 only the little lark never sang

 book two 
 chapter xii 
 
 at the levee prince andrew stood among the austrian officers as he had been told to and the emperor francis merely looked fixedly into his face and just nodded to him with to him with his long head but after it was over the adjutant he had seen the previous day ceremoniously informed bolkonski that the emperor desired to give him an audience the emperor francis received him standing in the middle of the room before the conversation began prince andrew was struck by the fact that the emperor seemed confused and blushed as if not knowing what to say 
 tell me when did the battle begin he asked hurriedly 
 prince andrew replied then followed other questions just as simple was kutuzov well when had he left krems and so on the emperor spoke as if his sole aim were to put a given number of questions the answers to these questions as was only too evident did not interest him 
 at what did the battle begin asked the emperor 
 i cannot inform your majesty at what the battle began at the front but at durrenstein where i was our attack began after five in the afternoon replied bolkonski growing more animated and expecting that he would have a chance to give a reliable account which he had ready in his mind of all he knew and had seen but the emperor smiled and interrupted him 
 how many miles 
 from where to where your majesty 
 from durrenstein to krems 
 three and a half miles your majesty 
 the french have abandoned the left bank 
 according to the scouts the last of them crossed on rafts during the night 
 is there sufficient forage in krems 
 forage has not been supplied to the extent 
 the emperor interrupted him 
 at what was general schmidt killed 
 at seven i believe 
 at seven very sad very sad 
 the emperor thanked prince andrew and bowed prince andrew withdrew and was immediately surrounded by courtiers on all sides everywhere he saw friendly looks and heard friendly words adjutant reproached him for not having stayed at the palace and offered him his own house the minister of war came up and congratulated him on the maria theresa order of the third grade which the emperor was conferring on him the empress chamberlain invited him to see her majesty the archduchess also wished to see him he did not know whom to answer and for a few seconds collected his thoughts then the russian ambassador took him by the shoulder led him to the window and began to talk to him 
 contrary to forecast the news he had brought was joyfully received a thanksgiving service was arranged kutuzov was awarded the grand cross of maria theresa and the whole army received rewards bolkonski was invited everywhere and had to spend the whole morning calling on the principal austrian dignitaries between four and five in the afternoon having made all his calls he was returning to house thinking out a letter to his father about the battle and his visit to brunn at the door he found a vehicle half full of luggage franz man was dragging a portmanteau with some difficulty out of the front door 
 before returning to prince andrew had gone to bookshop to provide himself with some books for the campaign and had spent some time in the shop 
 what is it he asked 
 oh your excellency said franz with difficulty rolling the portmanteau into the vehicle we are to move on still farther the scoundrel is again at our heels 
 eh what asked prince andrew 
 bilibin came out to meet him his usually calm face showed excitement 
 there now confess that this is delightful said he this affair of the thabor bridge at vienna they have crossed without striking a blow 
 prince andrew could not understand 
 but where do you come from not to know what every coachman in the town knows 
 i come from the archduchess i heard nothing there 
 and you see that everybody is packing up 
 i did not what is it all about inquired prince andrew impatiently 
 it all about why the french have crossed the bridge that auersperg was defending and the bridge was not blown up so murat is now rushing along the road to brunn and will be here in a day or two 
 what here but why did they not blow up the bridge if it was mined 
 that is what i ask you no one not even bonaparte knows why 
 bolkonski shrugged his shoulders 
 but if the bridge is crossed it means that the army too is lost it will be cut off said he 
 just it answered bilibin listen the french entered vienna as i told you very well next day which was yesterday those gentlemen messieurs les marechaux murat belliard mount and ride to bridge observe that all three are gascons gentlemen says one of them you know the thabor bridge is mined and doubly mined and that there are menacing fortifications at its head and an army of fifteen thousand men has been ordered to blow up the bridge and not let us cross but it will please our sovereign the emperor napoleon if we take this bridge so let us three go and take it yes say the others and off they go and take the bridge cross it and now with their whole army are on this side of the danube marching on us you and your lines of communication 
 the marshalls 
 stop jesting said prince andrew sadly and seriously this news grieved him and yet he was pleased 
 as soon as he learned that the russian army was in such a hopeless situation it occurred to him that it was he who was destined to lead it out of this position that here was the toulon that would lift him from the ranks of obscure officers and offer him the first step to fame listening to bilibin he was already imagining how on reaching the army he would give an opinion at the war council which would be the only one that could save the army and how he alone would be entrusted with the executing of the plan 
 stop this jesting he said 
 i am not jesting bilibin went on nothing is truer or sadder these gentlemen ride onto the bridge alone and wave white handkerchiefs they assure the officer on duty that they the marshals are on their way to negotiate with prince auersperg he lets them enter the they spin him a thousand gasconades saying that the war is over that the emperor francis is arranging a meeting with bonaparte that they desire to see prince auersperg and so on the officer sends for auersperg these gentlemen embrace the officers crack jokes sit on the cannon and meanwhile a french battalion gets to the bridge unobserved flings the bags of incendiary material into the water and approaches the at length appears the lieutenant general our dear prince auersperg von mautern himself dearest foe flower of the austrian army hero of the turkish wars hostilities are ended we can shake one hand the emperor napoleon burns with impatience to make prince acquaintance in a word those gentlemen gascons indeed so bewildered him with fine words and he is so flattered by his rapidly established intimacy with the french marshals and so dazzled by the sight of mantle and ostrich plumes voit que du feu et oublie celui devait faire faire sur in spite of the animation of his speech bilibin did not forget to pause after this mot to give time for its due appreciation the french battalion rushes to the bridgehead spikes the guns and the bridge is taken but what is best of all he went on his excitement subsiding under the delightful interest of his own story is that the sergeant in charge of the cannon which was to give the signal to fire the mines and blow up the bridge this sergeant seeing that the french troops were running onto the bridge was about to fire but lannes stayed his hand the sergeant who was evidently wiser than his general goes up to auersperg and says prince you are being deceived here are the french murat seeing that all is lost if the sergeant is allowed to speak turns to auersperg with feigned astonishment he is a true gascon and says i recognize the austrian discipline if you allow a subordinate to address you like that it was a stroke of genius prince auersperg feels his dignity at stake and orders the sergeant to be arrested come you must own that this affair of the thabor bridge is delightful it is not exactly stupidity nor rascality 
 bridgehead 
 that their fire gets into his eyes and he forgets that he ought to be firing at the enemy 
 it may be treachery said prince andrew vividly imagining the gray overcoats wounds the smoke of gunpowder the sounds of firing and the glory that awaited him 
 not that either that puts the court in too bad a light replied not treachery nor rascality nor stupidity it is just as at ulm it is he seemed to be trying to find the right expression du mack nous sommes mackes it is it is a bit of mack we are macked he concluded feeling that he had produced a good epigram a fresh one that would be repeated his hitherto puckered brow became smooth as a sign of pleasure and with a slight smile he began to examine his nails 
 where are you off to he said suddenly to prince andrew who had risen and was going toward his room 
 i am going away 
 where to 
 to the army 
 but you meant to stay another two days 
 but now i am off at once 
 and prince andrew after giving directions about his departure went to his room 
 do you know mon cher said bilibin following him i have been thinking about you why are you going 
 and in proof of the conclusiveness of his opinion all the wrinkles vanished from his face 
 prince andrew looked inquiringly at him and gave no reply 
 why are you going i know you think it your duty to gallop back to the army now that it is in danger i understand that mon cher it is heroism 
 not at all said prince andrew 
 but as you are a philosopher be a consistent one look at the other side of the question and you will see that your duty on the contrary is to take care of yourself leave it to those who are no longer fit for anything else you have not been ordered to return and have not been dismissed from here therefore you can stay and go with us wherever our ill luck takes us they say we are going to olmutz and olmutz is a very decent town you and i will travel comfortably in my caleche 
 do stop joking bilibin cried bolkonski 
 i am speaking sincerely as a friend consider where and why are you going when you might remain here you are faced by one of two things and the skin over his left temple puckered either you will not reach your regiment before peace is concluded or you will share defeat and disgrace with whole army 
 and bilibin unwrinkled his temple feeling that the dilemma was insoluble 
 i cannot argue about it replied prince andrew coldly but he thought i am going to save the army 
 my dear fellow you are a hero said bilibin

 chapter forty 
 
 
 when the first bitterness was over the family accepted the inevitable and tried to bear it cheerfully helping one another by the increased affection which comes to bind households tenderly together in times of trouble they put away their grief and each did his or her part toward making that last year a happy one 
 the pleasantest room in the house was set apart for beth and in it was gathered everything that she most loved flowers pictures her piano the little worktable and the beloved pussies best books found their way there easy chair desk finest sketches and every day meg brought her babies on a loving pilgrimage to make sunshine for aunty beth john quietly set apart a little sum that he might enjoy the pleasure of keeping the invalid supplied with the fruit she loved and longed for old hannah never wearied of concocting dainty dishes to tempt a capricious appetite dropping tears as she worked and from across the sea came little gifts and cheerful letters seeming to bring breaths of warmth and fragrance from lands that know no winter 
 here cherished like a household saint in its shrine sat beth tranquil and busy as ever for nothing could change the sweet unselfish nature and even while preparing to leave life she tried to make it happier for those who should remain behind the feeble fingers were never idle and one of her pleasures was to make little things for the school children daily passing to and fro to drop a pair of mittens from her window for a pair of purple hands a needlebook for some small mother of many dolls penwipers for young penmen toiling through forests of pothooks scrapbooks for eyes and all manner of pleasant devices till the reluctant climbers of the ladder of learning found their way strewn with flowers as it were and came to regard the gentle giver as a sort of fairy godmother who sat above there and showered down gifts miraculously suited to their tastes and needs if beth had wanted any reward she found it in the bright little faces always turned up to her window with nods and smiles and the droll little letters which came to her full of blots and gratitude 
 the first few months were very happy ones and beth often used to look round and say how beautiful this is as they all sat together in her sunny room the babies kicking and crowing on the floor mother and sisters working near and father reading in his pleasant voice from the wise old books which seemed rich in good and comfortable words as applicable now as when written centuries ago a little chapel where a paternal priest taught his flock the hard lessons all must learn trying to show them that hope can comfort love and faith make resignation possible simple sermons that went straight to the souls of those who listened for the heart was in the religion and the frequent falter in the voice gave a double eloquence to the words he spoke or read 
 it was well for all that this peaceful time was given them as preparation for the sad hours to come for beth said the needle was so heavy and put it down forever talking wearied her faces troubled her pain claimed her for its own and her tranquil spirit was sorrowfully perturbed by the ills that vexed her feeble flesh ah me such heavy days such long long nights such aching hearts and imploring prayers when those who loved her best were forced to see the thin hands stretched out to them beseechingly to hear the bitter cry help me help me and to feel that there was no help a sad eclipse of the serene soul a sharp struggle of the young life with death but both were mercifully brief and then the natural rebellion over the old peace returned more beautiful than ever with the wreck of her frail body soul grew strong and though she said little those about her felt that she was ready saw that the first pilgrim called was likewise the fittest and waited with her on the shore trying to see the shining ones coming to receive her when she crossed the river 
 jo never left her for an hour since beth had said i feel stronger when you are here she slept on a couch in the room waking often to renew the fire to feed lift or wait upon the patient creature who seldom asked for anything and tried not to be a trouble all day she haunted the room jealous of any other nurse and prouder of being chosen then than of any honor her life ever brought her precious and helpful hours to jo for now her heart received the teaching that it needed lessons in patience were so sweetly taught her that she could not fail to learn them charity for all the lovely spirit that can forgive and truly forget unkindness the loyalty to duty that makes the hardest easy and the sincere faith that fears nothing but trusts undoubtingly 
 often when she woke jo found beth reading in her little book heard her singing softly to beguile the sleepless night or saw her lean her face upon her hands while slow tears dropped through the transparent fingers and jo would lie watching her with thoughts too deep for tears feeling that beth in her simple unselfish way was trying to wean herself from the dear old life and fit herself for the life to come by sacred words of comfort quiet prayers and the music she loved so well 
 seeing this did more for jo than the wisest sermons the saintliest hymns the most fervent prayers that any voice could utter for with eyes made clear by many tears and a heart softened by the tenderest sorrow she recognized the beauty of her unambitious yet full of the genuine virtues which smell sweet and blossom in the dust the that makes the humblest on earth remembered soonest in heaven the true success which is possible to all 
 one night when beth looked among the books upon her table to find something to make her forget the mortal weariness that was almost as hard to bear as pain as she turned the leaves of her old favorite progress she found a little paper scribbled over in hand the name caught her eye and the blurred look of the lines made her sure that tears had fallen on it 
 poor jo fast asleep so i wake her to ask leave she shows me all her things and i think mind if i look at this thought beth with a glance at her sister who lay on the rug with the tongs beside her ready to wake up the minute the log fell apart 
 
 
 my beth 
 sitting patient in the shadow 
 till the blessed light shall come 
 a serene and saintly presence 
 sanctifies our troubled home 
 earthly joys and hopes and sorrows 
 break like ripples on the strand 
 of the deep and solemn river 
 where her willing feet now stand 
 o my sister passing from me 
 out of human care and strife 
 leave me as a gift those virtues 
 which have beautified your life 
 dear bequeath me that great patience 
 which has power to sustain 
 a cheerful uncomplaining spirit 
 in its of pain 
 give me for i need it sorely 
 of that courage wise and sweet 
 which has made the path of duty 
 green beneath your willing feet 
 give me that unselfish nature 
 that with charity devine 
 can pardon wrong for dear sake 
 meek heart forgive me mine 
 thus our parting daily loseth 
 something of its bitter pain 
 and while learning this hard lesson 
 my great loss becomes my gain 
 for the touch of grief will render 
 my wild nature more serene 
 give to life new aspirations 
 a new trust in the unseen 
 henceforth safe across the river 
 i shall see forever more 
 a beloved household spirit 
 waiting for me on the shore 
 hope and faith born of my sorrow 
 guardian angels shall become 
 and the sister gone before me 
 by their hands shall lead me home 
 
 blurred and blotted faulty and feeble as the lines were they brought a look of inexpressible comfort to face for her one regret had been that she had done so little and this seemed to assure her that her life had not been useless that her death would not bring the despair she feared as she sat with the paper folded between her hands the charred log fell asunder jo started up revived the blaze and crept to the bedside hoping beth slept 
 not asleep but so happy dear see i found this and read it i knew you care have i been all that to you jo she asked with wistful humble earnestness 
 oh beth so much so much and head went down upon the pillow beside her 
 then i feel as if wasted my life not so good as you make me but i have tried to do right and now when too late to begin even to do better such a comfort to know that someone loves me so much and feels as if helped them 
 more than any one in the world beth i used to think i let you go but learning to feel that i lose you that be more to me than ever and death part us though it seems to 
 i know it cannot and i fear it any longer for sure i shall be your beth still to love and help you more than ever you must take my place jo and be everything to father and mother when gone they will turn to you fail them and if hard to work alone remember that i forget you and that be happier in doing that than writing splendid books or seeing all the world for love is the only thing that we can carry with us when we go and it makes the go easy 
 try beth and then and there jo renounced her old ambition pledged herself to a new and better one acknowledging the poverty of other desires and feeling the blessed solace of a belief in the immortality of love 
 so the spring days came and went the sky grew clearer the earth greener the flowers were up fairly early and the birds came back in time to say goodbye to beth who like a tired but trustful child clung to the hands that had led her all her life as father and mother guided her tenderly through the valley of the shadow and gave her up to god 
 seldom except in books do the dying utter memorable words see visions or depart with beatified countenances and those who have sped many parting souls know that to most the end comes as naturally and simply as sleep as beth had hoped the tide went out easily and in the dark hour before dawn on the bosom where she had drawn her first breath she quietly drew her last with no farewell but one loving look one little sigh 
 with tears and prayers and tender hands mother and sisters made her ready for the long sleep that pain would never mar again seeing with grateful eyes the beautiful serenity that soon replaced the pathetic patience that had wrung their hearts so long and feeling with reverent joy that to their darling death was a benignant angel not a phantom full of dread 
 when morning came for the first time in many months the fire was out place was empty and the room was very still but a bird sang blithely on a budding bough close by the snowdrops blossomed freshly at the window and the spring sunshine streamed in like a benediction over the placid face upon the pillow a face so full of painless peace that those who loved it best smiled through their tears and thanked god that beth was well at last

lionfish nov epilogue nineteen years latercontents prev chapter 
 
 autumn seemed to arrive suddenly that year the morning of the first of september was crisp as an apple and as the little family bobbed across the rumbling road toward the great sooty station the fumes of car exhausts and the breath of pedestrians sparkled like cobwebs in the cold air two large cages tattled on top of the laden trolleys the parents were pushing the owls inside them hooted indignantly and the redheaded girl trailed fearfully behind here brothers clutching her fathers arm 
 
 it wont be long and youll be going too harry told her 
 
 two years sniffed lily i want to go now 
 
 the commuters stared curiously at the owls as the family wove its way toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten albuss voice drifted back to harry over the surrounding clamor his sons had resumed the argument they had started in the car 
 
 i wont i wont be a slytherin 
 
 james give it a rest said ginny 
 
 i only said he might be said james grinning at his younger brother theres nothing wrong with that he might be in slytherin 
 
 but james caught his mothers eye and fell silent the five potters approached the barrier with a slightly cocky look over his shoulder at his younger brother james took the trolley from his mother and broke into a run a moment later he had vanished 
 
 youll write to me wont you albus asked his parents immediately capitalizing on the momentary absence of his brother 
 
 every day if you want us to said ginny 
 
 not every day said albus quickly james says most people only get letters from home about once a month 
 
 we wrote to james three times a week last year said ginny 
 
 and you dont want to believe everything he tells you about hogwarts harry put in he likes a laugh your brother 
 
 side by side they pushed the second trolley forward gathering speed as they reached the barrier albus winced but no collision came instead the family emerged onto platform nine and which was obscured by thick white steam that was pouring from the scarlet hogwarts express indistinct figures were swarming through the mist into which james had already disappeared 
 
 where are they asked albus anxiously peering at the hazy forms they passed as they made their way down the platform 
 
 well find them said ginny reassuringly 
 
 but the vapor was dense and it was difficult to make out anybodys faces detached from their owners voices sounded unnaturally loud harry thought he head percy discoursing loudly on broomstick regulations and was quite glad of the excuse not to stop and say hello 
 
 i think thats them al said ginny suddenly 
 
 a group of four people emerged from the mist standing alongside the very last carriage their faces only came into focus when harry ginny lily and albus had drawn right up to them 
 
 hi said albus sounding immensely relieved 
 
 rose who was already wearing her hogwarts robes beamed at him 
 
 parked all right then ron asked harry i did hermione didnt believe i could pass a muggle driving test did you she thought id have to confound the examiner 
 
 no i didnt said hermione i had complete faith in you 
 
 as a matter of fact i did confund him ron whispered to harry as together they lifted albuss trunk and owl onto the train i only forgot to look in the wing mirror and lets face it i can use a supersensory charm for that 
 
 back on the platform they found lily and hugo roses younger brother having an animated discussion about which house they would be sorted into when they finally went to hogwarts 
 
 if youre not in gryffindor well disinherit you said ron but no pressure 
 
 ron 
 
 lily and hugo laughed but albus and rose looked solemn 
 
 he doesnt mean it said hermione and ginny but ron was no longer paying attention catching harrys eye he nodded covertly to a point some fifty yards away the steam had thinned for a moment and three people stood in sharp relief against the shifting mist 
 
 look who it is 
 
 draco malfoy was standing there with his wife and son a dark coat buttoned up to his throat his hair was receding somewhat which emphasized the pointed chin the new boy resembled draco as much as albus resembled harry draco caught sight of harry ron hermione and ginny staring at him nodded curtly and turned away again 
 
 so thats little scorpius said ron under his breath make sure you beat him in every test rosie thank god you inherited your mothers brains 
 
 ron for heavens sake said hermione half stern half amused dont try to turn them against each other before theyve even started school 
 
 youre right sorry said ron but unable to help himself he added dont get too friendly with him though rosie granddad weasley would never forgive you if you married a pureblood 
 
 hey 
 
 james had reappeared he had divested himself of his trunk owl and trolley and was evidently bursting with news 
 
 teddys back there he said breathlessly pointing back over his shoulder into the billowing clouds of steam just seen him and guess what hes doing snogging victoire 
 
 he gazed up at the adults evidently disappointed by the lack of reaction 
 
 our teddy teddy lupin snogging our victoire our cousin and i asked teddy what he was doing c 
 
 you interrupted them said ginny you are so like ron c 
 
 c and he said hed come to see her off and then he told me to go away hes snogging her james added as though worried he had not made himself clear 
 
 oh it would be lovely if they got married whispered lily ecstatically teddy would really be part of the family then 
 
 he already comes round for dinner about four times a week said harry why dont we just invite him to live with us and have done with it 
 
 yeah said james enthusiastically i dont mind sharing with al c teddy could have my room 
 
 no said harry firmly you and al will share a room only when i want the house demolished 
 
 he checked the battered old watch that had once been fabian prewetts 
 
 its nearly eleven youd better get on board 
 
 dont forget to give neville our love ginny told james as she hugged him 
 
 mum i cant give a professor love 
 
 but you know nevillec 
 
 james rolled his eyes 
 
 outside yeah but at school hes professor longbottom isnt he i cant walk into herbology and give him love 
 
 shaking his head at his mothers foolishness he vented his feelings by aiming a kick at albus 
 
 see you later al watch out for the thestrals 
 
 i thought they were invisible you said they were invisible but james merely laughed permitted his mother to kiss him gave his father a fleeting hug then leapt onto the rapidly filling train they saw him wave then sprint away up the corridor to find his friends 
 
 thestrals are nothing to worry about harry told albus theyre gentle things theres nothing scare about them anyway you wont be going up to school in the carriages youll be going in the boats 
 
 ginny kissed albus 
 
 see you at christmas 
 
 bye al said harry as his son hugged him dont forget hagrids invited you to tea next friday dont mess with peeves dont duel anyone till youre learned how and dont let james wind you up 
 
 what if im in slytherin 
 
 the whisper was for his father alone and harry knew that only the moment of departure could have forced albus to reveal how great and sincere that fear was 
 
 harry crouched down so that albuss face was slightly above his own alone of harrys three children albus had inherited lilys eyes 
 
 albus severus harry said quietly so that nobody but ginny could hear and she was tactful enough to pretend to be waving to rose who was now on the train you were named for two headmasters of hogwarts one of them was a slytherin and he was probably the bravest man i ever knew 
 
 but just sayc 
 
 cthen slytherin house will have gained an excellent student wont it it doesnt matter to us al but if it matter to you youll be able to choose gryffindor over slytherin the sorting hat takes your choice into account 
 
 really 
 
 it did for me said harry 
 
 he had never told any of his children that before and he saw the wonder in albuss face when he said it but how the doors were slamming all along the scarlet train and the blurred outlines of parents swarming forward for final kisses reminders albus jumped into the carriage and ginny closed the door behind him students were hanging from the windows nearest them a great number of faces both on the train and off seemed to be turned toward harry 
 
 why are they all staring demanded albus as he and rose craned around to look at the other students 
 
 dont let it worry you said ron its me im extremely famous 
 
 albus rose hugo and lily laughed the train began to more and harry walked alongside it watching his sons thin face already ablaze with excitement harry kept smiling and waving even though it was like a little bereavement watching his son glide away from him 
 
 the last trace of steam evaporated in the autumn air the train rounded a corner harrys hand was still raised in farewell 
 
 hell be alright murmured ginny 
 
 as harry looked at her he lowered his hand absentmindedly and touched the lightning scar on his forehead 
 
 i know he will 
 
 the scar had not pained harry for nineteen years all was well

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the butterfly 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 there was once a butterfly who wished for a bride and as may 
 be supposed he wanted to choose a very pretty one from among the 
 flowers he glanced with a very critical eye at all the 
 and found that the flowers were seated quietly and demurely on their 
 stalks just as maidens should sit before they are engaged but 
 there was a great number of them and it appeared as if his search 
 would become very wearisome the butterfly did not like to take too 
 much trouble so he flew off on a visit to the daisies the french 
 call this flower marguerite and they say that the little daisy 
 can prophesy lovers pluck off the leaves and as they pluck each 
 leaf they ask a question about their lovers thus does he or she 
 love me ardently distractedly very much a little not at all 
 and so on every one speaks these words in his own language the 
 butterfly came also to marguerite to inquire but he did not pluck off 
 her leaves he pressed a kiss on each of them for he thought there 
 was always more to be done by kindness 
 
 darling marguerite daisy he said to her you are the wisest 
 woman of all the flowers pray tell me which of the flowers i shall 
 choose for my wife which will be my bride when i know i will fly 
 directly to her and propose 
 
 but marguerite did not answer him she was offended that he should 
 call her a woman when she was only a girl and there is a great 
 difference he asked her a second time and then a third but she 
 remained dumb and answered not a word then he would wait no 
 longer but flew away to commence his wooing at once it was in the 
 early spring when the crocus and the snowdrop were in full bloom 
 they are very pretty thought the butterfly charming little 
 lasses but they are rather formal 
 
 then as the young lads often do he looked out for the elder 
 girls he next flew to the anemones these were rather sour to his 
 taste the violet a little too sentimental the too 
 small and besides there was such a large family of them the 
 though they looked like roses bloomed but 
 might fall off with the first wind that blew and he 
 thought that a marriage with one of them might last too short a 
 time the pleased him most of all she was white and 
 red graceful and slender and belonged to those domestic maidens 
 who have a pretty appearance and can yet be useful in the kitchen he was just about to make her an offer when close by the maiden he saw a pod with a withered flower hanging at the end 
 
 who is that he asked 
 
 that is my sister replied the 
 
 oh indeed and you will be like her some day said he and he 
 flew away directly for he felt quite shocked 
 
 a honeysuckle hung forth from the hedge in full bloom but 
 there were so many girls like her with long faces and sallow 
 complexions no he did not like her but which one did he like 
 spring went by and summer drew towards its close autumn came 
 but he had not decided the flowers now appeared in their most 
 gorgeous robes but all in vain they had not the fresh fragrant 
 air of youth for the heart asks for fragrance even when it is no 
 longer young and there is very little of that to be found in the 
 dahlias or the dry chrysanthemums therefore the butterfly turned to 
 the mint on the ground you know this plant has no blossom but it is sweetness all over full of fragrance from head to foot with the 
 scent of a flower in every leaf 
 
 i will take her said the butterfly and he made her an offer 
 but the mint stood silent and stiff as she listened to him at last 
 she said 
 
 friendship if you please nothing more i am old and you are 
 old but we may live for each other just the same as to marrying no 
 let us appear ridiculous at our age 
 
 and so it happened that the butterfly got no wife at all he had 
 been too long choosing which is always a bad plan and the 
 butterfly became what is called an old bachelor 
 
 it was late in the autumn with rainy and cloudy weather the cold 
 wind blew over the bowed backs of the willows so that they creaked 
 again it was not the weather for flying about in summer clothes 
 but fortunately the butterfly was not out in it he had got a 
 shelter by chance it was in a room heated by a stove and as warm 
 as summer he could exist here he said well enough 
 
 but it is not enough merely to exist said he i need 
 freedom sunshine and a little flower for a companion 
 
 then he flew against the and was seen and admired 
 by those in the room who caught him and stuck him on a pin in a box of curiosities they could not do more for him 
 
 now i am perched on a stalk like the flowers said the 
 butterfly it is not very pleasant certainly i should imagine it is 
 something like being married for here i am stuck fast and with this 
 thought he consoled himself a little 
 
 that seems very poor consolation said one of the plants in 
 the room that grew in a pot 
 
 ah thought the butterfly one very well trust these 
 plants in pots they have too much to do with mankind

 of usury 
 many have made witty invectives against usury they say that it is pity the devil 
 should have part which is the tithe that the usurer is me greatest sabbath 
 breaker because his plough goeth every sunday that the userer is the drone that 
 virgil speaketh of ignavum fucos pecus a praesepibus arcent 
 
 that the usurer breaketh the first law that was made for mankind after the fall 
 which was in sudore vultus tui comedes panem tuum not in sudore vultus aliem that usurers should have bonnets because they do judaise that it is against nature for money to beget money and the like i say this only that usury is a concessum propter duritiem cads for since there must be borrowing and lending and men are so hard of heart as they will not lend freely usury must be permitted some others have made suspicious and cunning propositions of banks discovery of estates and other inventions 
 but few have spoken of usury usefully it is good to set before us the incommodides and commodities of usury that the good may be either weighed out or culled out and warily to provide that while we make forth to that which is better we meet not with that which is worse 
 
 the discommodities of usury are first that it makes fewer merchants for were it 
 not for this lazy trade of usury money would not lie still but would in great part 
 be employed upon merchandising which is the vena porta of wealth in a state the 
 second that it makes poor merchants for as a fanner cannot husband his ground so well if he sit at a great rent so the merchant cannot drive his trade so well if 
 he sit at great usury the third is incident to the other two and that is the decay of customs of kings or states which ebb or flow with merchandising the fourth that it bringeth the treasure of a realm or state into a few hands for the usurer being at certainties and others at uncertainties at the end of the game most of the money will be in the box and ever a state flourisheth when wealth is more equally spread the fifth that it beats down the price of land for the employment of money is chiefly either merchandising or purchasing and usury waylays both the sixth that it dolh dull and damp all industries improvements and new inventions wherein money would be stirring if it were not for this slug the last that it is the cancer and ruin of many estates which in process of time breeds a public poverty 
 on the other side the commodities of usury are first that howsoever usury in some respect hindereth merchandising yet in some other it advanceth it for it is certain that the greatest part of trade is driven by young merchants upon borrowing at interest so as if the usurer either call in or keep back his money there will ensue presently a great stand of trade the second is that were it not for this easy borrowing upon interest necessities would draw upon them a most sudden undoing in that they would be forced to sell their means be it lands or goods far under foot and so whereas duty doth but gnaw upon them bad markets would swallow them quite up 
 as for mortgaging or pawning it will lime mend the matter for either men will not take pawns without use or if they do they will look precisely for the forfeiture i remember a cruel moneyed man in the country that would say the devil 
 take this usury it keeps us from forfeitures of mortgages and bonds the third and 
 last is that it is a vanity to conceive that there would be ordinary borrowing without 
 profit and it is impossible to conceive the number ofinconveniencies that will ensue if borrowing be cramped 
 therefore to speak of the abolishing of usury is idle all states have ever had it in one kind or rate or other so as that opinion must be sent to utopia 
 
 to speak now of the reformation and reiglement of usury how the discommodities of it may be best avoided and the commodities retained it appears by the balance of commodities and discommodities of usury two things are to be reconciled the one that the tooth of usury be grinded that it bite not too much the other that there be left open a means to invite moneyed men to lend to the merchants for the continuing and quickening of trade this cannot be done except you introduce two several sorts of usury a less and a greater for if you reduce usury to one low rate it will ease the common borrower but the merchant will be to seek for money and it is to be noted that the trade of merchandise being the most lucrative may bear usury at a good rate other contracts not so 
 
 to serve both intentions the way would be briefly thus that there be two rates of 
 usury the one free and general for all the other under licence only to certain 
 persons and in certain places of merchandising first therefore let usury in 
 general be reduced to five in the hundred and let that rate be proclaimed to be 
 free and current and let the state shut itself out to take any penalty for the same 
 
 this will preserve borrowing from any general stop or dryness this will ease infinite borrowers in the country this will in good part raise the price of land because land purchased at sixteen years purchase will yield six in the hundred and somewhat more whereas this rate of interest yields but five this by like reason will encourage and edge industrious and profitable improvements because many will rather venture in that kind than take five in the hundred especially having been used to greater profit secondly let there be certain persons licensed to lend to known merchants upon usury at a higher rate and let it be with the cautions following 
 let the rate be even with the merchant himself somewhat more easy than that he 
 used formerly to pay for by that means all borrowers shall have some ease by this reformation be he merchant or whosoever let it be no rank or common stock but every man be master of his own money not that i altogether mislike banks but they will hardly be brooked in regard of certain suspicions let me state be answered some small matter for the licence and the rest left to the lender for if the abatement be but small it will no whit discourage the lender for he for example that took before ten or nine in the hundred will sooner descend to eight in the hundred than give over his trade of usury and go from certain gains to gains of hazard 
 let these licenced lenders be in number indefinite but restrained to certain 
 principal cities and towns of merchandising for then they will be hardly able to 
 colour other monies in the country so as the licence of nine will not suck 
 away the current rate of five for no man will send his monies far off nor put them 
 into unknown hands 
 
 if it be objected that this doth in a sort authorise usury which before was in 
 some places but permissive the answer is mat it is better to mitigate usury by 
 declaration than to suffer it to rage by connivance

 chapter i 
 
 the history of a progress in black glass trinkets 
 and in the meantime what had become of that mother who according to the people at montfermeil seemed to have abandoned her child where was she 
 what was she doing 
 after leaving her little cosette with the thenardiers she had continued her journey and had reached m sur m 
 this it will be remembered was in 
 fantine had quitted her province ten years before 
 m sur m had changed its aspect 
 while fantine had been slowly descending from wretchedness to wretchedness her native town had prospered 
 about two years previously one of those industrial facts which are the grand events of small districts had taken place 
 this detail is important and we regard it as useful to develop it at length we should almost say to underline it 
 from time immemorial m sur m had had for its special industry the imitation of english jet and the black glass trinkets of germany this industry had always vegetated on account of the high price of the raw material which reacted on the manufacture at the moment when fantine returned to m sur m an transformation had taken place in the production of black goods towards the close of a man a stranger had established himself in the town and had been inspired with the idea of substituting in this manufacture for resin and for bracelets in particular slides of simply laid together for slides of soldered 
 this very small change had effected a revolution 
 this very small change had in fact prodigiously reduced the cost of the raw material which had rendered it possible in the first place to raise the price of manufacture a benefit to the country in the second place to improve the workmanship an advantage to the consumer in the third place to sell at a lower price while trebling the profit which was a benefit to the manufacturer 
 thus three results ensued from one idea 
 in less than three years the inventor of this process had become rich which is good and had made every one about him rich which is better 
 he was a stranger in the department 
 of his origin nothing was known of the beginning of his career very little it was rumored that he had come to town with very little money a few hundred francs at the most 
 it was from this slender capital enlisted in the service of an ingenious idea developed by method and thought that he had drawn his own fortune and the fortune of the whole countryside 
 on his arrival at m sur m he had only the garments the appearance and the language of a workingman 
 it appears that on the very day when he made his obscure entry into the little town of m sur m just at nightfall on a december evening knapsack on back and thorn club in hand a large fire had broken out in the this man had rushed into the flames and saved at the risk of his own life two children who belonged to the captain of the gendarmerie this is why they had forgotten to ask him for his passport 
 afterwards they had learned his name he was called father madeleine

 he looked with disdain at the endless confused mass of detachments carts guns artillery and again baggage wagons and vehicles of all kinds overtaking one another and blocking the muddy road three and sometimes four abreast from all sides behind and before as far as ear could reach there were the rattle of wheels the creaking of carts and gun carriages the tramp of horses the crack of whips shouts the urging of horses and the swearing of soldiers orderlies and officers all along the sides of the road fallen horses were to be seen some flayed some not and carts beside which solitary soldiers sat waiting for something and again soldiers straggling from their companies crowds of whom set off to the neighboring villages or returned from them dragging sheep fowls hay and bulging sacks at each ascent or descent of the road the crowds were yet denser and the din of shouting more incessant soldiers floundering in mud pushed the guns and wagons themselves whips cracked hoofs slipped traces broke and lungs were strained with shouting the officers directing the march rode backward and forward between the carts their voices were but feebly heard amid the uproar and one saw by their faces that they despaired of the possibility of checking this disorder 
 here is our dear orthodox russian army thought bolkonski recalling words 
 wishing to find out where the commander in chief was he rode up to a convoy directly opposite to him came a strange vehicle evidently rigged up by soldiers out of any available materials and looking like something between a cart a cabriolet and a caleche a soldier was driving and a woman enveloped in shawls sat behind the apron under the leather hood of the vehicle prince andrew rode up and was just putting his question to a soldier when his attention was diverted by the desperate shrieks of the woman in the vehicle an officer in charge of transport was beating the soldier who was driving the vehicle for trying to get ahead of others and the strokes of his whip fell on the apron of the equipage the woman screamed piercingly seeing prince andrew she leaned out from behind the apron and waving her thin arms from under the woolen shawl cried 
 mr mr for sake protect me what will become of us i am the wife of the doctor of the seventh chasseurs they let us pass we are left behind and have lost our people 
 flatten you into a pancake shouted the angry officer to the soldier turn back with your slut 
 mr help me what does it all mean screamed the wife 
 kindly let this cart pass you see a woman said prince andrew riding up to the officer 
 the officer glanced at him and without replying turned again to the soldier teach you to push on back 
 let them pass i tell you repeated prince andrew compressing his lips 
 and who are you cried the officer turning on him with tipsy rage who are you are you in command here eh i am commander here not you go back or flatten you into a pancake repeated he this expression evidently pleased him 
 that was a nice snub for the little came a voice from behind 
 prince andrew saw that the officer was in that state of senseless tipsy rage when a man does not know what he is saying he saw that his championship of the wife in her queer trap might expose him to what he dreaded more than anything in the world to ridicule but his instinct urged him on before the officer finished his sentence prince andrew his face distorted with fury rode up to him and raised his riding whip 
 let them pass 
 the officer flourished his arm and hastily rode away 
 all the fault of these fellows on the staff that this disorder he muttered do as you like 
 prince andrew without lifting his eyes rode hastily away from the wife who was calling him her deliverer and recalling with a sense of disgust the minutest details of this humiliating scene he galloped on to the village where he was told that the commander in chief was 
 on reaching the village he dismounted and went to the nearest house intending to rest if but for a moment eat something and try to sort out the stinging and tormenting thoughts that confused his mind this is a mob of scoundrels and not an army he was thinking as he went up to the window of the first house when a familiar voice called him by name 
 he turned round handsome face looked out of the little window nesvitski moving his moist lips as he chewed something and flourishing his arm called him to enter 
 bolkonski bolkonski you hear eh come quick he shouted 
 entering the house prince andrew saw nesvitski and another adjutant having something to eat they hastily turned round to him asking if he had any news on their familiar faces he read agitation and alarm this was particularly noticeable on usually laughing countenance 
 where is the commander in chief asked bolkonski 
 here in that house answered the adjutant 
 well is it true that peace and capitulation asked nesvitski 
 i was going to ask you i know nothing except that it was all i could do to get here 
 and we my dear boy terrible i was wrong to laugh at mack getting it still worse said nesvitski but sit down and have something to eat 
 you be able to find either your baggage or anything else now prince and god only knows where your man peter is said the other adjutant 
 where are headquarters 
 we are to spend the night in znaim 
 well i have got all i need into packs for two horses said nesvitski made up splendid packs for me fit to cross the bohemian mountains with a bad lookout old fellow but the matter with you you must be ill to shiver like that he added noticing that prince andrew winced as at an electric shock 
 nothing replied prince andrew 
 he had just remembered his recent encounter with the wife and the convoy officer 
 what is the commander in chief doing here he asked 
 i make out at all said nesvitski 
 well all i can make out is that everything is abominable abominable quite abominable said prince andrew and he went off to the house where the commander in chief was 
 passing by carriage and the exhausted saddle horses of his suite with their cossacks who were talking loudly together prince andrew entered the passage kutuzov himself he was told was in the house with prince bagration and weyrother weyrother was the austrian general who had succeeded schmidt in the passage little kozlovski was squatting on his heels in front of a clerk the clerk with cuffs turned up was hastily writing at a tub turned bottom upwards face looked worn he too had evidently not slept all night he glanced at prince andrew and did not even nod to him 
 second line have you written it he continued dictating to the clerk the kiev grenadiers podolian 
 one write so fast your honor said the clerk glancing angrily and disrespectfully at kozlovski 
 through the door came the sounds of voice excited and dissatisfied interrupted by another an unfamiliar voice from the sound of these voices the inattentive way kozlovski looked at him the disrespectful manner of the exhausted clerk the fact that the clerk and kozlovski were squatting on the floor by a tub so near to the commander in chief and from the noisy laughter of the cossacks holding the horses near the window prince andrew felt that something important and disastrous was about to happen 
 he turned to kozlovski with urgent questions 
 immediately prince said kozlovski dispositions for bagration 
 what about capitulation 
 nothing of the sort orders are issued for a battle 
 prince andrew moved toward the door from whence voices were heard just as he was going to open it the sounds ceased the door opened and kutuzov with his eagle nose and puffy face appeared in the doorway prince andrew stood right in front of kutuzov but the expression of the commander in one sound eye showed him to be so preoccupied with thoughts and anxieties as to be oblivious of his presence he looked straight at his face without recognizing him 
 well have you finished said he to kozlovski 
 one moment your excellency 
 bagration a gaunt man of medium height with a firm impassive face of oriental type came out after the commander in chief 
 i have the honor to present myself repeated prince andrew rather loudly handing kutuzov an envelope 
 ah from vienna very good later later 
 kutuzov went out into the porch with bagration 
 well prince said he to bagration my blessing and may christ be with you in your great endeavor 
 his face suddenly softened and tears came into his eyes with his left hand he drew bagration toward him and with his right on which he wore a ring he made the sign of the cross over him with a gesture evidently habitual offering his puffy cheek but bagration kissed him on the neck instead 
 christ be with you kutuzov repeated and went toward his carriage get in with me said he to bolkonski 
 your excellency i should like to be of use here allow me to remain with prince detachment 
 get in said kutuzov and noticing that bolkonski still delayed he added i need good officers myself need them myself 
 they got into the carriage and drove for a few minutes in silence 
 there is still much much before us he said as if with an old penetration he understood all that was passing in mind if a tenth part of his detachment returns i shall thank god he added as if speaking to himself 
 prince andrew glanced at face only a foot distant from him and involuntarily noticed the carefully washed seams of the scar near his temple where an ismail bullet had pierced his skull and the empty eye socket yes he has a right to speak so calmly of those death thought bolkonski 
 that is why i beg to be sent to that detachment he said 
 kutuzov did not reply he seemed to have forgotten what he had been saying and sat plunged in thought five minutes later gently swaying on the soft springs of the carriage he turned to prince andrew there was not a trace of agitation on his face with delicate irony he questioned prince andrew about the details of his interview with the emperor about the remarks he had heard at court concerning the krems affair and about some ladies they both knew

 chapter 
 
 
 lecture did laurie good though of course he did not own it till long afterward men seldom do for when women are the advisers the lords of creation take the advice till they have persuaded themselves that it is just what they intended to do then they act upon it and if it succeeds they give the weaker vessel half the credit of it if it fails they generously give her the whole laurie went back to his grandfather and was so dutifully devoted for several weeks that the old gentleman declared the climate of nice had improved him wonderfully and he had better try it again there was nothing the young gentleman would have liked better but elephants could not have dragged him back after the scolding he had received pride forbid and whenever the longing grew very strong he fortified his resolution by repeating the words that had made the deepest impression i despise you go and do something splendid that will make her love you 
 laurie turned the matter over in his mind so often that he soon brought himself to confess that he had been selfish and lazy but then when a man has a great sorrow he should be indulged in all sorts of vagaries till he has lived it down he felt that his blighted affections were quite dead now and though he should never cease to be a faithful mourner there was no occasion to wear his weeds ostentatiously jo love him but he might make her respect and admire him by doing something which should prove that a no had not spoiled his life he had always meant to do something and advice was quite unnecessary he had only been waiting till the aforesaid blighted affections were decently interred that being done he felt that he was ready to hide his stricken heart and still toil on 
 as goethe when he had a joy or a grief put it into a song so laurie resolved to embalm his love sorrow in music and to compose a requiem which should harrow up soul and melt the heart of every hearer therefore the next time the old gentleman found him getting restless and moody and ordered him off he went to vienna where he had musical friends and fell to work with the firm determination to distinguish himself but whether the sorrow was too vast to be embodied in music or music too ethereal to uplift a mortal woe he soon discovered that the requiem was beyond him just at present it was evident that his mind was not in working order yet and his ideas needed clarifying for often in the middle of a plaintive strain he would find himself humming a dancing tune that vividly recalled the christmas ball at nice especially the stout frenchman and put an effectual stop to tragic composition for the time being 
 then he tried an opera for nothing seemed impossible in the beginning but here again unforeseen difficulties beset him he wanted jo for his heroine and called upon his memory to supply him with tender recollections and romantic visions of his love but memory turned traitor and as if possessed by the perverse spirit of the girl would only recall oddities faults and freaks would only show her in the most unsentimental mats with her head tied up in a bandana barricading herself with the sofa pillow or throwing cold water over his passion a la an irresistable laugh spoiled the pensive picture he was endeavoring to paint jo be put into the opera at any price and he had to give her up with a bless that girl what a torment she is and a clutch at his hair as became a distracted composer 
 when he looked about him for another and a less intractable damsel to immortalize in melody memory produced one with the most obliging readiness this phantom wore many faces but it always had golden hair was enveloped in a diaphanous cloud and floated airily before his eye in a pleasing chaos of roses peacocks white ponies and blue ribbons he did not give the complacent wraith any name but he took her for his heroine and grew quite fond of her as well he might for he gifted her with every gift and grace under the sun and escorted her unscathed through trials which would have annihilated any mortal woman 
 thanks to this inspiration he got on swimmingly for a time but gradually the work lost its charm and he forgot to compose while he sat musing pen in hand or roamed about the gay city to get some new ideas and refresh his mind which seemed to be in a somewhat unsettled state that winter he did not do much but he thought a great deal and was conscious of a change of some sort going on in spite of himself genius simmering perhaps let it simmer and see what comes of it he said with a secret suspicion all the while that it genius but something far more common whatever it was it simmered to some purpose for he grew more and more discontented with his desultory life began to long for some real and earnest work to go at soul and body and finally came to the wise conclusion that everyone who loved music was not a composer returning from one of grand operas splendidly performed at the royal theatre he looked over his own played a few of the best parts sat staring at the busts of mendelssohn beethoven and bach who stared benignly back again then suddenly he tore up his music sheets one by one and as the last fluttered out of his hand he said soberly to himself 
 she is right talent genius and you make it so that music has taken the vanity out of my as rome took it out of her and i be a humbug any longer now what shall i do 
 that seemed a hard question to answer and laurie began to wish he had to work for his daily bread now if ever occurred an eligible opportunity for going to the devil as he once forcibly expressed it for he had plenty of money and nothing to do and satan is proverbially fond of providing employment for full and idle hands the poor fellow had temptations enough from without and from within but he withstood them pretty well for much as he valued liberty he valued good faith and confidence more so his promise to his grandfather and his desire to be able to look honestly into the eyes of the women who loved him and say well kept him safe and steady 
 very likely some mrs grundy will observe i believe it boys will be boys young men must sow their wild oats and women must not expect miracles i dare say you mrs grundy but true nevertheless women work a good many miracles and i have a persuasion that they may perform even that of raising the standard of manhood by refusing to echo such sayings let the boys be boys the longer the better and let the young men sow their wild oats if they must but mothers sisters and friends may help to make the crop a small one and keep many tares from spoiling the harvest by believing and showing that they believe in the possibility of loyalty to the virtues which make men manliest in good eyes if it is a feminine delusion leave us to enjoy it while we may for without it half the beauty and the romance of life is lost and sorrowful forebodings would embitter all our hopes of the brave tenderhearted little lads who still love their mothers better than themselves and are not ashamed to own it 
 laurie thought that the task of forgetting his love for jo would absorb all his powers for years but to his great surprise he discovered it grew easier every day he refused to believe it at first got angry with himself and understand it but these hearts of ours are curious and contrary things and time and nature work their will in spite of us heart ache the wound persisted in healing with a rapidity that astonished him and instead of trying to forget he found himself trying to remember he had not foreseen this turn of affairs and was not prepared for it he was disgusted with himself surprised at his own fickleness and full of a queer mixture of disappointment and relief that he could recover from such a tremendous blow so soon he carefully stirred up the embers of his lost love but they refused to burst into a blaze there was only a comfortable glow that warmed and did him good without putting him into a fever and he was reluctantly obliged to confess that the boyish passion was slowly subbsiding into a more tranquil sentiment very tender a little sad and resentful still but that was sure to pass away in time leaving a brotherly affection which would last unbroken to the end 
 as the word brotherly passed through his mind in one of his reveries he smiled and glanced up at the picture of mozart that was before him 
 well he was a great man and when he have one sister he took the other and was happy 
 laurie did not utter the words but he thought them and the next instant kissed the little old ring saying to himself no i i forgotten i never can try again and if that fails why then 
 leaving his sentence unfinished he seized pen and paper and wrote to jo telling her that he could not settle to anything while there was the least hope of her changing her mind she she and let him come home and be happy while waiting for an answer he did nothing but he did it energetically for he was in a fever of impatience it came at last and settled his mind effectually on one point for jo decidedly and she was wrapped up in beth and never wished to hear the word love again then she begged him to be happy with somebody else but always keep a little corner of his ghart for his loving sister jo in a postscript she desired him not to tell amy that beth was worse she was coming home in the spring and there was no need of saddening the remainder of her stay that would be time enough please god but laurie must write to her often and not let her feel lonely homesick or anxious 
 so i will at once poor little girl it will be a sad going home for her afraid and laurie opened his desk as if writing to amy had been the proper conclusion of the sentence left unfinished some weeks before 
 but he did not write the letter that day for as he rummaged out his best paper he came across something which changed his purpose tumbling about in one part of the desk among bills passports and business documents of various kinds were several of letters and in another compartment were three notes from amy carefully tied up with one of her blue ribbons and sweetly suggestive of the little dead roses put away inside with a expression laurie gathered up all letters smoothed folded and put them neatly into a small drawer of the desk stood a minute turning the ring thoughtfully on his finger then slowly drew it off laid it with the letters locked the drawer and went out to hear high mass at saint feeling as if there had been a funeral and though not overwhelmed with affliction this seemed a more proper way to spend the rest of the day than in writing letters to charming young ladies 
 the letter went very soon however and was promptly answered for amy was homesick and confessed it in the most delightfully confiding manner the correspondence flourished famously and letters flew to and fro with unfailing regularity all through the early spring laurie sold his busts made allumettes of his opera and went back to paris hoping somebody would arrive before long he wanted desperately to go to nice but would not till he was asked and amy would not ask him for just then she was having little experiences of her own which made her rather wish to avoid the quizzical eyes of out boy 
 fred vaughn had returned and put the question to which she had once decided to answer yes thank you but now she said no thank you kindly but steadily for when the time came her courage failed her and she found that something more than money and position was needed to satisfy the new longing that filled her heart so full of tender hopes and fears the words fred is a good fellow but not at all the man i fancied you would ever like and face when he uttered them kept returning to her as pertinaciously as her own did when she said in look if not in words i shall marry for money it troubled her to remember that now she wished she could take it back it sounded so unwomanly she want laurie to think her a heartless worldly creature she care to be a queen of society now half so much as she did to be a lovable woman she was so glad he hate her for the dreadful things she said but took them so beautifully and was kinder than ever his letters were such a comfort for the home letters were very irregular and not half so satisfactory as his when they did come it was not only a pleasure but a duty to answer them for the poor fellow was forlorn and needed petting since jo persisted in being stonyhearted she ought to have made an effort and tried to love him it be very hard many people would be proud and glad to have such a dear boy care for them but jo never would act like other girls so there was nothing to do but be very kind and treat him like a brother 
 if all brothers were treated as well as laurie was at this period they would be a much happier race of beings than they are amy never lectured now she asked his opinion on all subjects she was interested in everything he did made charming little presents for him and sent him two letters a week full of lively gossip sisterly confidences and captivating sketches of the lovely scenes about her as few brothers are complimented by having their letters carried about in their pockets read and reread diligently cried over when short kissed when long and treasured carefully we will not hint that amy did any of these fond and foolish things but she certainly did grow a little pale and pensive that spring lost much of her relish for society and went out sketching alone a good deal she never had much to show when she came home but was studying nature i dare say while she sat for hours with her hands folded on the terrace at valrosa or absently sketched any fancy that occurred to her a stalwart knight carved on a tomb a young man asleep in the grass with his hat over his eyes or a curly haired girl in gorgeous array promenading down a ballroom on the arm of a tall gentleman both faces being left a blur according to the last fashion in art which was safe but not altogether satisfactory 
 her aunt thought that she regretted her answer to fred and finding denials useless and explanations impossible amy left her to think what she liked taking care that laurie should know that fred had gone to egypt that was all but he understood it and looked relieved as he said to himself with a venerable air 
 i was sure she would think better of it poor old fellow been through it all and i can sympathize 
 with that he heaved a great sigh and then as if he had discharged his duty to the past put his feet up on the sofa and enjoyed letter luxuriously 
 while these changes were going on abroad trouble had come at home but the letter telling that beth was failing never reached amy and when the next found her at vevay for the heat had driven them from nice in may and they had travelled slowly to switzerland by way of genoa and the italian lakes she bore it very well and quietly submitted to the family decree that she should not shorten her visit for since it was too late to say goodbye to beth she had better stay and let absence soften her sorrow but her heart was very heavy she longed to be at home and every day looked wistfully across the lake waiting for laurie to come and comfort her 
 he did come very soon for the same mail brought letters to them both but he was in germany and it took some days to reach him the moment he read it he packed his knapsack bade adieu to his fellow pedestrians and was off to keep his promise with a heart full of joy and sorrow hope and suspense 
 he knew vevay well and as soon as the boat touched the little quay he hurried along the shore to la tour where the carrols were living en pension the garcon was in despair that the whole family had gone to take a promenade on the lake but no the blonde mademoiselle might be in the chateau garden if monsier would give himself the pain of sitting down a flash of time should present her but monsieur could not wait even a flash of time and in the middle of the speech departed to find mademoiselle himself 
 a pleasant old garden on the borders of the lovely lake with chestnuts rustling overhead ivy climbing everywhere and the black shadow of the tower falling far across the sunny water at one corner of the wide low wall was a seat and here amy often came to read or work or console herself with the beauty all about her she was sitting here that day leaning her head on her hand with a homesick heart and heavy eyes thinking of beth and wondering why laurie did not come she did not hear him cross the courtyard beyond nor see him pause in the archway that led from the subterranean path into the garden he stood a minute looking at her with new eyes seeing what no one had ever seen before the tender side of character everything about her mutely suggested love and sorrow the blotted letters in her lap the black ribbon that tied up her hair the womanly pain and patience in her face even the little ebony cross at her throat seemed pathetic to laurie for he had given it to her and she wore it as her only ornament if he had any doubts about the reception she would give him they were set at rest the minute she looked up and saw him for dropping everything she ran to him exclaiming in a tone of unmistakable love and longing 
 oh laurie laurie i knew come to me 
 i think everything was said and settled then for as they stood together quite silent for a moment with the dark head bent down protectingly over the light one amy felt that no one could comfort and sustain her so well as laurie and laurie decided that amy was the only woman in the world who could fill place and make him happy he did not tell her so but she was not disappointed for both felt the truth were satisfied and gladly left the rest to silence 
 in a minute amy went back to her place and while she dried her tears laurie gathered up the scattered papers finding in the sight of sundry letters and suggestive sketches good omens for the future as he sat down beside her amy felt shy again and turned rosy red at the recollection of her impulsive greeting 
 i help it i felt so lonely and sad and was so very glad to see you it was such a surprise to look up and find you just as i was beginning to fear you come she said trying in vain to speak quite naturally 
 i came the minute i heard i wish i could say something to comfort you for the loss of dear little beth but i can only feel and he could not get any further for her too turned bashful all of a sudden and did not quite know what to say he longed to lay head down on his shoulder and tell her to have a good cry but he did not dare so took her hand instead and gave it a sympathetic squeeze that was better than words 
 you say anything this comforts me she said softly beth is well and happy and i wish her back but i dread the going home much as i long to see them all we talk about it now for it makes me cry and i want to enjoy you while you stay you go right back need you 
 not if you want me dear 
 i do so much aunt and flo are very kind but you seem like one of the family and it would be so comfortable to have you for a little while 
 amy spoke and looked so like a homesick child whose heart was full that laurie forgot his bashfulness all at once and gave her just what she petting she was used to and the cheerful conversation she needed 
 poor little soul you look as if grieved yourself half sick going to take care of you so cry any more but come and walk about with me the wind is too chilly for you to sit still he said in the way that amy liked as he tied on her hat drew her arm through his and began to pace up and down the sunny walk under the chestnuts he felt more at ease upon his legs and amy found it pleasant to have a strong arm to lean upon a familiar face to smile at her and a kind voice to talk delightfully for her alone 
 the quaint old garden had sheltered many pairs of lovers and seemed expressly made for them so sunny and secluded was it with nothing but the tower to overlook them and the wide lake to carry away the echo of their words as it rippled by below for an hour this new pair walked and talked or rested on the wall enjoying the sweet influences which gave such a charm to time and place and when an unromantic dinner bell warned them away amy felt as if she left her burden of lonliness and sorrow behind her in the chateau garden 
 the moment mrs carrol saw the altered face she was illuminated with a new idea and exclaimed to herself now i understand it child has been pining for young laurence bless my heart i never thought of such a thing 
 with praiseworthy discretion the good lady said nothing and betrayed no sign of enlightenment but cordially urged laurie to stay and begged amy to enjoy his society for it would do her more good than so much solitude amy was a model of docility and as her aunt was a good deal occupied with flo she was left to entertain her friend and did it with more than her usual success 
 at nice laurie had lounged and amy had scolded at vevay laurie was never idle but always walking riding boating or studying in the most energetic manner while amy admired everything he did and followed his example as far and as fast as she could he said the change was owing to the climate and she did not contradict him being glad of a like excuse for her own recovered health and spirits 
 the invigorating air did them both good and much exercise worked wholesome changes in minds as well as bodies they seemed to get clearer views of life and duty up there among the everlasting hills the fresh winds blew away desponding doubts delusive fancies and moody mists the warm spring sunshine brought out all sorts of aspiring ideas tender hopes and happy thoughts the lake seemed to wash away the troubles of the past and the grand old mountains to look benignly down upon them saying little children love one another 
 in spite of the new sorrow it was a very happy time so happy that laurie could not bear to disturb it by a word it took him a little while to recover from his surprise at the cure of his first and as he had firmly believed his last and only love he consoled himself for the seeming disloyalty by the thought that sister was almost the same as self and the conviction that it would have been impossible to love any other woman but amy so soon and so well his first wooing had been of the tempestuous order and he looked back upon it as if through a long vista of years with a feeling of compassion blended with regret he was not ashamed of it but put it away as one of the experiences of his life for which he could be grateful when the pain was over his second wooing he resolved should be as calm and simple as possible there was no need of having a scene hardly any need of telling amy that he loved her she knew it without words and had given him his answer long ago it all came about so naturally that no one could complain and he knew that everybody would be pleased even jo but when our first little passion has been crushed we are apt to be wary and slow in making a second trial so laurie let the days pass enjoying every hour and leaving to chance the utterance of the word that would put an end to the first and sweetest part of his new romance 
 he had rather imagined that the denoument would take place in the chateau garden by moonlight and in the most graceful and decorus manner but it turned out exactly the reverse for the matter was settled on the lake at noonday in a few blunt words they had been floating about all the morning from gloomy st gingolf to sunny montreux with the alps of savoy on one side mont st bernard and the dent du midi on the other pretty vevay in the valley and lausanne upon the hill beyond a cloudless blue sky overhead and the bluer lake below dotted with the picturesque boats that look like gulls 
 they had been talking of bonnivard as they glided past chillon and of rousseau as they looked up at clarens where he wrote his heloise neither had read it but they knew it was a love story and each privately wondered if it was half as interesting as their own amy had been dabbling her hand in the water during the little pause that fell between them and when she looked up laurie was leaning on his oars with an expression in his eyes that made her say hastily merely for the sake of saying something 
 you must be tired rest a little and let me row it will do me good for since you came i have been altogether lazy and luxurious 
 not tired but you may take an oar if you like room enough though i have to sit nearly in the middle else the boat trim returned laurie as if he rather liked the arrangment 
 feeling that she had not mended matters much amy took the offered third of a seat shook her hair over her face and accepted an oar she rowed as well as she did many other things and though she used both hands and laurie but one the oars kept time and the boat went smoothly through the water 
 how well we pull together we said amy who objected to silence just then 
 so well that i wish we might always pull in the same boat will you amy very tenderly 
 yes laurie very low 
 then they both stopped rowing and unconsciously added a pretty little tableau of human love and happiness to the dissolving views reflected in the lake

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the child in the grave 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 it was a very sad day and every heart in the house felt the 
 deepest grief for the youngest child a boy of four years old the 
 joy and hope of his parents was dead two daughters the elder of 
 whom was going to be confirmed still remained they were both good charming girls but the lost child always seems the dearest and 
 when it is youngest and a son it makes the trial still more heavy 
 
 the sisters mourned as young hearts can mourn and were especially 
 grieved at the sight of their parents sorrow the heart 
 was bowed down but the mother sunk completely under the deep grief 
 
 day and night she had attended to the sick child nursing and carrying 
 it in her bosom as a part of herself she could not realize the 
 fact that the child was dead and must be laid in a coffin to rest 
 in the ground she thought god could not take her darling little one 
 from her and when it did happen notwithstanding her hopes and her 
 belief and there could be no more doubt on the subject she said in 
 her feverish agony god does not know it he has 
 ministering spirits on earth who do according to their own will 
 and heed not a prayers thus in her great grief she fell 
 away from her faith in god and dark thoughts arose in her mind 
 respecting death and a future state she tried to believe that man was 
 but dust and that with his life all existence ended but these doubts 
 were no support to her nothing on which she could rest and she 
 sunk into the fathomless depths of despair in her darkest hours she 
 ceased to weep and thought not of the young daughters who were 
 still left to her the tears of her husband fell on her forehead 
 but she took no notice of him her thoughts were with her dead 
 child her whole existence seemed wrapped up in the remembrances of the little one and of every innocent word it had uttered 
 
 the day of the little funeral came for nights 
 previously the mother had not slept but in the morning twilight of 
 this day she sunk from weariness into a deep sleep in the mean time 
 the coffin was carried into a distant room and there nailed down 
 that she might not hear the blows of the hammer when she awoke and wanted to see her child the husband with tears said we have 
 closed the coffin it was necessary to do so 
 
 when god is so hard to me how can i expect men to be better 
 she said with groans and tears 
 
 the coffin was carried to the grave and the disconsolate mother 
 sat with her young daughters she looked at them but she saw them 
 not for her thoughts were far away from the domestic hearth she gave herself up to her grief and it tossed her to and fro as the sea 
 tosses a ship without compass or rudder so the day of the funeral 
 passed away and similar days followed of dark wearisome pain 
 
 with tearful eyes and mournful glances the sorrowing daughters and 
 the afflicted husband looked upon her who would not hear their words of comfort and indeed what comforting words could they speak when they were themselves so full of grief it seemed as if she 
 would never again know sleep and yet it would have been her best 
 friend one who would have strengthened her body and poured peace into her soul they at last persuaded her to lie down and then she would lie as still as if she slept 
 
 one night when her husband listened as he often did to her 
 breathing he quite believed that she had at length found rest and 
 relief in sleep he folded his arms and prayed and soon sunk 
 himself into healthful sleep therefore he did not notice that his 
 wife arose threw on her clothes and glided silently from the 
 house to go where her thoughts constantly lingered to the grave of 
 her child she passed through the garden to a path across a field 
 that led to the churchyard no one saw her as she walked nor did 
 she see any one for her eyes were fixed upon the one object of her 
 wanderings it was a lovely starlight night in the beginning of 
 september and the air was mild and still she entered the 
 churchyard and stood by the little grave which looked like a large 
 nosegay of fragrant flowers she sat down and bent her head low over the grave as if she could see her child through the earth that 
 covered him her little boy whose smile was so vividly before her 
 and the gentle expression of whose eyes even on his she 
 could not forget how full of meaning that glance had been as she 
 leaned over him holding in hers the pale hand which he had no longer 
 strength to raise as she had sat by his little cot so now she sat 
 by his grave and here she could weep freely and her tears fell upon 
 it 
 
 thou wouldst gladly go down and be with thy child said a 
 voice quite close to her a voice that sounded so deep and clear 
 that it went to her heart 
 
 she looked up and by her side stood a man wrapped in a black 
 cloak with a hood closely drawn over his face but her keen glance 
 could distinguish the face under the hood it was stern yet 
 awakened confidence and the eyes beamed with youthful radiance 
 
 down to my child she repeated and tones of despair and 
 entreaty sounded in the words 
 
 darest thou to follow me asked the form i am death 
 she bowed her head in token of assent then suddenly it appeared 
 as if all the stars were shining with the radiance of the full moon on 
 the flowers that decked the grave the earth that covered it was drawn back like a floating drapery she sunk down and the spectre covered her with a black cloak night closed around her the night of death she sank deeper than the spade of the sexton could penetrate till the churchyard became a roof above her then the cloak was removed and she found herself in a large hall of 
 dimensions in which there was a subdued light like 
 twilight reigning and in a moment her child appeared before her 
 smiling and more beautiful than ever with a silent cry she pressed 
 him to her heart a glorious strain of music sounded now distant now near never had she listened to such tones as these they came from beyond a large dark curtain which separated the regions of death 
 from the land of eternity 
 
 my sweet darling mother she heard the child say it was the 
 beloved voice and kiss followed kiss in boundless 
 delight then the child pointed to the dark curtain there is nothing 
 so beautiful on earth as it is here mother do you not see them 
 all oh it is happiness indeed 
 
 but the mother saw nothing of what the child pointed out only the 
 dark curtain she looked with earthly eyes and could not see as the 
 child saw he whom god has called to be with himself she could 
 hear the sounds of music but she heard not the words the word in 
 which she was to trust 
 
 i can fly now mother said the child i can fly with other 
 happy children into the presence of the almighty i would fain fly 
 away now but if you weep for me as you are weeping now you may never see me again and yet i would go so gladly may i not fly away and you will come to me soon will you not dear mother 
 
 oh stay stay implored the mother only one moment more only 
 once more that i may look upon thee and kiss thee and press thee to my heart 
 
 then she kissed and fondled her child suddenly her name was 
 called from above what could it mean her name uttered in a plaintive 
 voice 
 
 hearest thou said the child it is my father who calls 
 thee and in a few moments deep sighs were heard as of children 
 weeping they are my sisters said the child mother surely you 
 have not forgotten them 
 
 and then she remembered those she left behind and a great 
 terror came over her she looked around her at the dark night dim 
 forms flitted by she seemed to recognize some of them as they 
 floated through the regions of death towards the dark curtain where 
 they vanished would her husband and her daughters flit past no 
 their sighs and lamentations still sounded from above and she had 
 nearly forgotten them for the sake of him who was dead 
 
 mother now the bells of heaven are ringing said the child 
 
 mother the sun is going to rise 
 
 an overpowering light streamed in upon her the child had 
 vanished and she was being borne upwards all around her became cold 
 
 she lifted her head and saw that she was lying in the churchyard 
 on the grave of her child the lord in a dream had been a guide to 
 her feet and a light to her spirit she bowed her knees and prayed 
 for forgiveness she had wished to keep back a soul from its 
 immortal flight she had forgotten her duties towards the living who 
 were left her and when she had offered this prayer her heart felt 
 lighter the sun burst forth over her head a little bird carolled his 
 song and the sounded for the early service everything 
 around her seemed holy and her heart was chastened she 
 acknowledged the goodness of god she acknowledged the duties she had to perform and eagerly she returned home she bent over her 
 husband who still slept her warm devoted kiss awakened him and 
 words of heartfelt love fell from the lips of both now she was gentle 
 and strong as a wife can be and from her lips came the words of 
 faith whatever he doeth is right and best 
 
 then her husband asked from whence hast thou all at once derived 
 such strength and comforting faith 
 
 and as she kissed him and her children she said it came from 
 god through my child in the grave

 of youth age 
 a man that is young in years may be old in hours if he have lost no time but that 
 happeneth rarely generally youth is like the first cogitations not so wise as the 
 second for there is a youth in thoughts as well as in ages and yet the invention 
 of young men is more lively than that of old and imaginations stream into their minds better and as it were more divinely natures that have much heat and great and violent desires and perturbations are not ripe for action till they have passed 
 the meridian of meir years as it was with julius caesar and septimius severus of 
 the latter of whom it is said iuventutem egit enwibus imo fwonbus plenorn and 
 yet he was the ablest emperor almost of all me list but reposed natures may do well in youth as it is seen in augustus caesar cosmus duke of florence gaston de fois and others 
 on the other side heat and vivacity in age is an excellent composition 
 for business young men are fitter to invent than to judge fitter for execution 
 than for counsel and fitter for new projects man for settled business for the 
 experience of age in things that fall within the compass of it directeth them but 
 in new things abuseth them the errors of young men are the ruin of business but 
 me errors of aged men amount but to this that more might have been done or sooner 
 
 young men in the conduct and manage of actions embrace more than they can hold stir more than they can quiet fly to the end without consideration of the means and degrees pursue some few principles which they have chanced upon absurdly care not to innovate which draws unknown inconveniences use extreme remedies at first and that which doubled all errors will not acknowledge or retract them like an unready horse that will neither stop nor turn men of age object too much consult too long adventure too little repent too soon and seldom drive business home to the full period but content themselves with a mediocrity of success 
 certainly it is good to compound employments of both for that will be good for the present because the virtues of either age may correct the defects of both and good for succession mat young men may be learners while men in age are actors and lastly good for extreme accidents because authority followeth old men and favour and popularity youth 
 but far the moral part perhaps youth will have the as age hath for the politic a certain rabbin upon the text your young men that see visions and your old men that dream dreams inferreth that young men are admitted nearer to god than old because vision is a clearer revelation than a dream and certainly me more a man drinketh of the world the more it intoxicateth and age doth profit rather in the powers of understanding man in the virtues of me will and affections 
 there be some have an ripeness in their years which fadeth betimes these are first such as have brittle wits the edge whereof is soon turned such as was hermogenes the rhetorician whose books are exceeding subtle who afterwards waxed stupid 
 a second sort is of those that have some natural dispositions which have 
 better grace in youth than in age such as is a fluent and luxuriant speech which 
 becomes youth well but not age so tully saith of hortentius idem manebat neque 
 idem decdxtt the third is of such as take too high a strain at the first and are 
 magnanimous more than tract of years can uphold as was sdpio africanus of whom livy saith in effect ultima prims cedebant

 madeleine 
 he was a man about fifty years of age who had a preoccupied air and who was good 
 that was all that could be said about him 
 thanks to the rapid progress of the industry which he had so admirably m sur m had become a rather important centre of trade 
 spain which consumes a good deal of black jet made enormous purchases there each year 
 m sur m almost rivalled london and berlin in this branch of commerce 
 father profits were such that at the end of the second year he was able to erect a large factory in which there were two vast workrooms one for the men and the other for women 
 any one who was hungry could present himself there and was sure of finding employment and bread 
 father madeleine required of the men good will of the women pure morals and of all probity 
 he had separated the in order to separate the sexes and so that the women and girls might remain discreet 
 on this point he was inflexible it was the only thing in which he was in a manner intolerant he was all the more firmly set on this severity since m sur m being a garrison town opportunities for corruption abounded however his coming had been a boon and his presence was a godsend before father arrival everything had languished in the country now everything lived with a healthy life of toil a strong circulation warmed everything and penetrated everywhere slack seasons and wretchedness were unknown 
 there was no pocket so obscure that it had not a little money in it no dwelling so lowly that there was not some little joy within it 
 father madeleine gave employment to every one 
 he exacted but one thing 
 be an honest man 
 be an honest woman 
 as we have said in the midst of this activity of which he was the cause and the pivot father madeleine made his fortune but a singular thing in a simple man of business it did not seem as though that were his chief care 
 he appeared to be thinking much of others and little of himself 
 in he was known to have a sum of six hundred and thirty thousand francs lodged in his name with laffitte but before reserving these six hundred and thirty thousand francs he had spent more than a million for the town and its poor 
 the hospital was badly endowed he founded six beds there 
 m sur m is divided into the upper and the lower town 
 the lower town in which he lived had but one school a miserable hovel which was falling to ruin 
 he constructed two one for girls the other for boys he allotted a salary from his own funds to the two instructors a salary twice as large as their meagre official salary and one day he said to some one who expressed surprise the two prime functionaries of the state are the nurse and the schoolmaster he created at his own expense an infant school a thing then almost unknown in france and a fund for aiding old and infirm workmen as his factory was a centre a new quarter in which there were a good many indigent families rose rapidly around him he established there a free dispensary 
 at first when they watched his beginnings the good souls said a jolly fellow who means to get rich 
 when they saw him enriching the country before he enriched himself the good souls said he is an ambitious man 
 this seemed all the more probable since the man was religious and even practised his religion to a certain degree a thing which was very favorably viewed at that epoch 
 he went regularly to low mass every sunday the local deputy who nosed out all rivalry everywhere soon began to grow uneasy over this religion 
 this deputy had been a member of the legislative body of the empire and shared the religious ideas of a father of the oratoire known under the name of fouche duc whose creature and friend he had been 
 he indulged in gentle raillery at god with closed doors 
 but when he beheld the wealthy manufacturer madeleine going to low mass at seven he perceived in him a possible candidate and resolved to outdo him he took a jesuit confessor and went to high mass and to vespers ambition was at that time in the direct acceptation of the word a race to the steeple 
 the poor profited by this terror as well as the good god for the honorable deputy also founded two beds in the hospital which made twelve 
 nevertheless in a rumor one morning circulated through the town to the effect that on the representations of the prefect and in consideration of the services rendered by him to the country father madeleine was to be appointed by the king mayor of m sur m those who had pronounced this to be an ambitious fellow seized with delight on this opportunity which all men desire to exclaim there what did we say 
 all m sur m was in an uproar the rumor was well founded 
 several days later the appointment appeared in the moniteur 
 on the following day father madeleine refused 
 in this same year of the products of the new process invented by madeleine figured in the industrial exhibition when the jury made their report the king appointed the inventor a chevalier of the legion of honor 
 a fresh excitement in the little town well so it was the cross that he wanted 
 father madeleine refused the cross 
 decidedly this man was an enigma 
 the good souls got out of their predicament by saying after all he is some sort of an adventurer 
 we have seen that the country owed much to him the poor owed him everything he was so useful and he was so gentle that people had been obliged to honor and respect him 
 his workmen in particular adored him and he endured this adoration with a sort of melancholy gravity when he was known to be rich people in society bowed to him and he received invitations in the town he was called in town monsieur madeleine his workmen and the children continued to call him father madeleine and that was what was most adapted to make him smile in proportion as he mounted throve invitations rained down upon him society claimed him for its own 
 the prim little on m sur m which of course had at first been closed to the artisan opened both leaves of their to the millionnaire they made a thousand advances to him 
 he refused 
 this time the good gossips had no trouble 
 he is an ignorant man of no education 
 no one knows where he came from 
 he would not know how to behave in society 
 it has not been absolutely proved that he knows how to read 
 when they saw him making money they said he is a man of business when they saw him scattering his money about they said he is an ambitious man 
 when he was seen to decline honors they said he is an adventurer 
 when they saw him repulse society they said he is a brute 
 in five years after his arrival in m sur m the services which he had rendered to the district were so dazzling the opinion of the whole country round about was so unanimous that the king again appointed him mayor of the town 
 he again declined but the prefect resisted his refusal all the notabilities of the place came to implore him the people in the street besought him the urging was so vigorous that he ended by accepting it was noticed that the thing which seemed chiefly to bring him to a decision was the almost irritated apostrophe addressed to him by an old woman of the people who called to him from her threshold in an angry way 
 a good mayor is a useful thing 
 is he drawing back before the good which he can do 
 this was the third phase of his ascent 
 father madeleine had become monsieur madeleine 
 monsieur madeleine became monsieur le maire

 book two 
 chapter xiv 
 
 on november kutuzov had received through a spy news that the army he commanded was in an almost hopeless position the spy reported that the french after crossing the bridge at vienna were advancing in immense force upon line of communication with the troops that were arriving from russia if kutuzov decided to remain at krems army of one hundred and fifty thousand men would cut him off completely and surround his exhausted army of forty thousand and he would find himself in the position of mack at ulm if kutuzov decided to abandon the road connecting him with the troops arriving from russia he would have to march with no road into unknown parts of the bohemian mountains defending himself against superior forces of the enemy and abandoning all hope of a junction with buxhowden if kutuzov decided to retreat along the road from krems to olmutz to unite with the troops arriving from russia he risked being forestalled on that road by the french who had crossed the vienna bridge and encumbered by his baggage and transport having to accept battle on the march against an enemy three times as strong who would hem him in from two sides 
 kutuzov chose this latter course 
 the french the spy reported having crossed the vienna bridge were advancing by forced marches toward znaim which lay miles off on the line of retreat if he reached znaim before the french there would be great hope of saving the army to let the french forestall him at znaim meant the exposure of his whole army to a disgrace such as that of ulm or to utter destruction but to forestall the french with his whole army was impossible the road for the french from vienna to znaim was shorter and better than the road for the russians from krems to znaim 
 the night he received the news kutuzov sent vanguard four thousand strong to the right across the hills from the to the road bagration was to make this march without resting and to halt facing vienna with znaim to his rear and if he succeeded in forestalling the french he was to delay them as long as possible kutuzov himself with all his transport took the road to znaim 
 marching thirty miles that stormy night across roadless hills with his hungry soldiers and losing a third of his men as stragglers by the way bagration came out on the road at hollabrunn a few hours ahead of the french who were approaching hollabrunn from vienna kutuzov with his transport had still to march for some days before he could reach znaim hence bagration with his four thousand hungry exhausted men would have to detain for days the whole enemy army that came upon him at hollabrunn which was clearly impossible but a freak of fate made the impossible possible the success of the trick that had placed the vienna bridge in the hands of the french without a fight led murat to try to deceive kutuzov in a similar way meeting weak detachment on the znaim road he supposed it to be whole army to be able to crush it absolutely he awaited the arrival of the rest of the troops who were on their way from vienna and with this object offered a three days truce on condition that both armies should remain in position without moving murat declared that negotiations for peace were already proceeding and that he therefore offered this truce to avoid unnecessary bloodshed count nostitz the austrian general occupying the advanced posts believed emissary and retired leaving division exposed another emissary rode to the russian line to announce the peace negotiations and to offer the russian army the three days truce bagration replied that he was not authorized either to accept or refuse a truce and sent his adjutant to kutuzov to report the offer he had received 
 a truce was sole chance of gaining time giving exhausted troops some rest and letting the transport and heavy convoys whose movements were concealed from the french advance if but one stage nearer znaim the offer of a truce gave the only and a quite unexpected chance of saving the army on receiving the news he immediately dispatched adjutant general wintzingerode who was in attendance on him to the enemy camp wintzingerode was not merely to agree to the truce but also to offer terms of capitulation and meanwhile kutuzov sent his adjutants back to hasten to the utmost the movements of the baggage trains of the entire army along the road exhausted and hungry detachment which alone covered this movement of the transport and of the whole army had to remain stationary in face of an enemy eight times as strong as itself 
 expectations that the proposals of capitulation which were in no way binding might give time for part of the transport to pass and also that mistake would very soon be discovered proved correct as soon as bonaparte who was at schonbrunn sixteen miles from hollabrunn received dispatch with the proposal of a truce and a capitulation he detected a ruse and wrote the following letter to murat 
 schonbrunn th brumaire 
 at eight in the morning 
 to prince murat 
 i cannot find words to express to you my displeasure you command only my advance guard and have no right to arrange an armistice without my order you are causing me to lose the fruits of a campaign break the armistice immediately and march on the enemy inform him that the general who signed that capitulation had no right to do so and that no one but the emperor of russia has that right 
 if however the emperor of russia ratifies that convention i will ratify it but it is only a trick march on destroy the russian army you are in a position to seize its baggage and artillery 
 the russian is an impostor officers are nothing when they have no powers this one had none the austrians let themselves be tricked at the crossing of the vienna bridge you are letting yourself be tricked by an of the emperor 
 napoleon 
 adjutant rode full gallop with this menacing letter to murat bonaparte himself not trusting to his generals moved with all the guards to the field of battle afraid of letting a ready victim escape and four thousand men merrily lighted campfires dried and warmed themselves cooked their porridge for the first time for three days and not one of them knew or imagined what was in store for him

 chapter 
 
 
 it was easy to promise when self was wrapped up in another and heart and soul were purified by a sweet example but when the helpful voice was silent the daily lesson over the beloved presence gone and nothing remained but lonliness and grief then jo found her promise very hard to keep how could she comfort father and mother when her own heart ached with a ceaseless longing for her sister how could she make the house cheerful when all its light and warmth and beauty seemed to have deserted it when beth left the old home for the new and where in all the world could she find some useful happy work to do that would take the place of the loving service which had been its own reward she tried in a blind hopeless way to do her duty secretly rebelling against it all the while for it seemed unjust that her few joys should be lessened her burdens made heavier and life get harder and harder as she toiled along some people seemed to get all sunshine and some all shadow it was not fair for she tried more than amy to be good but never got any reward only disappointment trouble and hard work 
 poor jo these were dark days to her for something like despair came over her when she thought of spending all her life in that quiet house devoted to humdrum cares a few small pleasures and the duty that never seemed to grow any easier i do it i meant for a life like this and i know i shall break away and do something desperate if somebody come and help me she said to herself when her first efforts failed and she fell into the moody miserable state of mind which often comes when strong wills have to yield to the inevitable 
 but someone did come and help her though jo did not recognize her good angels at once because they wore familiar shapes and used the simple spells best fitted to poor humanity often she started up at night thinking beth called her and when the sight of the little empty bed made her cry with the bitter cry of unsubmissive sorrow oh beth come back come back she did not stretch out her yearning arms in vain for as quick to hear her sobbing as she had been to hear her faintest whisper her mother came to comfort her not with words only but the patient tenderness that soothes by a touch tears that were mute reminders of a greater grief than and broken whispers more eloquent than prayers because hopeful resignation went with natural sorrow sacred moments when heart talked to heart in the silence of the night turning affliction to a blessing which chastened grief and strengthned love feeling this burden seemed easier to bear duty grew sweeter and life looked more endurable seen from the safe shelter of her arms 
 when aching heart was a little comforted troubled mind likewise found help for one day she went to the study and leaning over the good gray head lifted to welcome her with a tranquil smile she said very humbly father talk to me as you did to beth i need it more than she did for all wrong 
 my dear nothing can comfort me like this he answered with a falter in his voice and both arms round her as if he too needed help and did not fear to ask for it 
 then sitting in little chair close beside him jo told her troubles the resentful sorrow for her loss the fruitless efforts that discouraged her the want of faith that made life look so dark and all the sad bewilderment which we call despair she gave him entire confidence he gave her the help she needed and both found consolation in the act for the time had come when they could talk together not only as father and daughter but as man and woman able and glad to serve each other with mutual sympathy as well as mutual love happy thoughtful times there in the old study which jo called the church of one member and from which she came with fresh courage recovered cheerfulness and a more submissive spirit for the parents who had taught one child to meet death without fear were trying now to teach another to accept life without despondency or distrust and to use its beautiful opportunities with gratitude and power 
 other helps had wholesome duties and delights that would not be denied their part in serving her and which she slowly learned to see and value brooms and dishcloths never could be as distasteful as they once had been for beth had presided over both and something of her housewifely spirit seemed to linger around the little mop and the old brush never thrown away as she used them jo found herself humming the songs beth used to hum imitating orderly ways and giving the little touches here and there that kept everything fresh and cozy which was the first step toward making home happy though she know it till hannah said with an approving squeeze of the hand 
 you thoughtful creeter determined we miss that dear lamb ef you can help it we say much but we see it and the lord will bless you see ef he 
 as they sat sewing together jo discovered how much improved her sister meg was how well she could talk how much she knew about good womanly impulses thoughts and feelings how happy she was in husband and children and how much they were all doing for each other 
 marriage is an excellent thing after all i wonder if i should blossom out half as well as you have if i tried it said jo as she constructed a kite for demi in the nursery 
 just what you need to bring out the tender womanly half of your nature jo you are like a chestnut burr prickly outside but within and a sweet kernal if one can only get at it love will make you show your heart one day and then the rough burr will fall off 
 frost opens chestnut burrs and it takes a good shake to bring them down boys go nutting and i care to be bagged by them returned jo pasting away at the kite which no wind that blows would ever carry up for daisy had tied herself on as a bob 
 meg laughed for she was glad to see a glimmer of old spirit but she felt it her duty to enforce her opinion by every argument in her power and the sisterly chats were not wasted especially as two of most effective arguments were the babies whom jo loved tenderly grief is the best opener of some hearts and was nearly ready for the bag a little more sunshine to ripen the nut then not a impatient shake but a hand reached up to pick it gently from the burr and find the kernal sound and sweet if she suspected this she would have shut up tight and been more prickly than ever fortunately she thinking about herself so when the time came down she dropped 
 now if she had been the heroine of a moral storybook she ought at this period of her life to have become quite saintly renounced the world and gone about doing good in a mortified bonnet with tracts in her pocket but you see jo a heroine she was only a struggling human girl like hundreds of others and she just acted out her nature being sad cross listless or energetic as the mood suggested highly virtuous to say be good but we do it all at once and it takes a long pull a strong pull and a pull all together before some of us even get our feet set in the right way jo had got so far she was learning to do her duty and to feel unhappy if she did not but to do it cheerfully ah that was another thing she had often said she wanted to do something splendid no matter how hard and now she had her wish for what could be more beautiful than to devote her life to father and mother trying to make home as happy to them as they had to her and if difficulties were necessary to increase the splendor of the effort what could be harder for a restless ambitious girl than to give up her own hopes plans and desires and cheerfully live for others 
 providence had taken her at her word here was the task not what she had expected but better because self had no part in it now could she do it she decided that she would try and in her first attempt she found the helps i have suggested still another was given her and she took it not as a reward but as a comfort as christian took the refreshment afforded by the little arbor where he rested as he climbed the hill called difficulty 
 why you write that always used to make you happy said her mother once when the desponding fit jo 
 no heart to write and if i had nobody cares for my things 
 we do write something for us and never mind the rest of the world try it dear sure it would do you good and please us very much 
 believe i can but jo got out her desk and began to overhaul her manuscripts 
 an hour afterward her mother peeped in and there she was scratching away with her black pinafore on and an absorbed expression which caused mrs march to smile and slip away well pleased with the success of her suggestion jo never knew how it happened but something got into that story that went straight to the hearts of those who read it for when her family had laughed and cried over it her father sent it much against her will to one of the popular magazines and to her utter surprise it was not only paid for but others requested letters from several persons whose praise was honor followed the appearance of the little story newspapers copied it and strangers as well as friends admired it for a small thing it was a great success and jo was more astonished than when her novel was commended and condemned all at once 
 i understand it what can there be in a simple little story like that to make people praise it so she said quite bewildered 
 there is truth in it jo the secret humor and pathos make it alive and you have found your style at last you wrote with not thoughts of fame and money and put your heart into it my daughter you have had the bitter now comes the sweet do your best and grow as happy as we are in your success 
 if there is anything good or true in what i write it mine i owe it all to you and mother and beth said jo more touched by her words than by any amount of praise from the world 
 so taught by love and sorrow jo wrote her little stories and sent them away to make friends for themselves and her finding it a very charitable world to such humble wanderers for they were kindly welcomed and sent home comfortable tokens to their mother like dutiful children whom good fortune overtakes 
 when amy and laurie wrote of their engagement mrs march feared that jo would find it difficult to rejoice over it but her fears were soon set at rest for thought jo looked grave at first she took it very quietly and was full of hopes and plans for the children before she read the letter twice it was a sort of written duet wherein each glorified the other in loverlike fashion very pleasant to read and satisfactory to think of for no one had any objection to make 
 you like it mother said jo as they laid down the closely written sheets and looked at one another 
 yes i hoped it would be so ever since amy wrote that she had refused fred i felt sure then that something better than what you call the mercenary spirit had come over her and a hint here and there in her letters made me suspect that love and laurie would win the day 
 how sharp you are marmee and how silent you never said a worked to me 
 mothers have need of sharp eyes and discreet tongues when they have girls to manage i was half afraid to put the idea into your head lest you should write and congratulate them before the thing was settled 
 not the scatterbrain i was you may trust me sober and sensible enough for confidante now 
 so you are my dear and i should have made you mine only i fancied it might pain you to learn that your teddy loved someone else 
 now mother did you really think i could be so silly and selfish after refused his love when it was freshest if not best 
 i knew you were sincere then jo but lately i have thought that if he came back and asked again you might perhaps feel like giving another answer forgive me dear i help seeing that you are very lonely and sometimes there is a hungry look in your eyes that goes to my heart so i fancied that your boy might fill the empty place if he tried now 
 no mother it is better as it ia and glad amy has learned to love him but you are right in one thing i am lonely and perhaps if teddy had tried again i might have said yes not because i love him any more but because i care more to be loved than when he went away 
 glad of that jo for it shows that you are getting on there are plenty to love you so try to be satisfied with father and mother sisters and brothers friends and babies till the best lover of all comes to give you your reward 
 mothers are the best lovers in the world but i mind whispering to marmee that like to try all kinds very curious but the more i try to satisfy myself with all sorts of natural affections the more i seem to want no idea hearts could take in so many mine is so elastic it never seems full now and i used to be quite contented with my family i understand it 
 i do and mrs march smiled her wise smile as jo turned back the leaves to read what amy said of laurie 
 it is so beautiful to be loved as laurie loves me he sentimental say much about it but i see and feel it in all he says and does and it makes me so happy and so humble that i seem to be the same girl i was i never knew how good and generous and tender he was till now for he lets me read his heart and i find it full of noble impulses and hopes and purposes and am so proud to know mine he says he feels as if he could make a prosperous voyage now with me aboard as mate and lots of love for ballast i pray he may and try to be all he believes me for i love my gallant captain with all my heart and soul and might and never will desert him while god lets us be together oh mother i never knew how much like heaven this world could be when two people love and live for one another 
 and our cool reserved and worldly amy truly love does work miracles how very very happy they must be and jo laid the rustling sheets together with a careful hand as one might shut the covers of a lovely romance which holds the reader fast till the end comes and he finds himself alone in the workaday world again 
 jo roamed away upstairs for it was rainy and she could not walk a restless spirit possessed her and the old feeling came again not bitter as it once was but a sorrowfully patient wonder why one sister should have all she asked the other nothing it was not true she knew that and tried to put it away but the natural craving for affection was strong and happiness woke the hungry longing for someone to love with heart and soul and cling to while god let them be together up in the garret where unquiet wanderings ended stood four little wooden chests in a row each marked with its owners name and each filled with relics of the childhood and girlhood ended now for all jo glanced into them and when she came to her own leaned her chin on the edge and stared absently at the chaotic collection till a bundle of old exercise books caught her eye she drew them out turned them over and relived that pleasant winter at kind mrs she had smiled at first then she looked thoughtful next sad and when she came to a little message written in the hand her lips began to tremble the books slid out of her lap and she sat looking at the friendly words as they took a new meaning and touched a tender spot in her heart 
 wait for me my friend i may be a little late but i shall surely come 
 oh if he only would so kine so good so patient with me always my dear old fritz i value him half enough when i had him but now how i should love to see him for everyone seems going away from me and all alone 
 and holding the little paper fast as if it were a promise yet to be fulfilled jo laid her head down on a comfortable rag bag and cried as if in opposition to the rain pattering on the roof 
 was it all loneliness or low spirits or was it the waking up of a sentiment which had bided its time as patiently as its inspirer who shall say
