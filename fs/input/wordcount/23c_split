lionfish nov chapter the yule ballcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 despite the very heavy load of homework that the fourth years had been given for the holidays harry was in no mood to work when term ended and spent the week leading up to christmas enjoying himself as fully as possible along with everyone else gryffindor tower was hardly less crowded now than during it seemed to have shrunk slightly too as its inhabitants were being so much rowdier than usual fred and george had had a great success with their canary creams and for the first couple of days of the holidays people kept bursting into feather all over the place before long however all the gryffindors had learned to treat food anybody else offered them with extreme caution in case it had a canary cream concealed in the center and george confided to harry that he and fred were now working on developing something else harry made a mental note never to accept so much as a crisp from fred and george in future he still forgotten dudley and the toffee 
 
 snow was falling thickly upon the castle and its grounds now the pale blue beauxbatons carriage looked like a large chilly frosted pumpkin next to the iced gingerbread house that was cabin while the durmstrang portholes were glazed with ice the rigging white with frost the down in the kitchen were outdoing themselves with a series of rich warming stews and savory puddings and only fleur delacour seemed to be able to find anything to complain about 
 
 it is too eavy all zis ogwarts food they heard her saying grumpily as they left the great hall behind her one evening ron skulking behind harry keen not to be spotted by fleur i will not fit into my dress robes 
 
 oooh a tragedy hermione snapped as fleur went out into the entrance hall she really thinks a lot of herself that one she 
 
 hermione who are you going to the ball with said ron 
 
 he kept springing this question on her hoping to startle her into a response by asking it when she least expected it however hermione merely frowned and said not telling you just make fun of me 
 
 joking weasley said malfoy behind them not telling me asked that to the ball not the mudblood 
 
 harry and ron both whipped around but hermione said loudly waving to somebody over shoulder hello professor moody 
 
 malfoy went pale and jumped backward looking wildly around for moody but he was still up at the staff table finishing his stew 
 
 twitchy little ferret you malfoy said hermione scathingly and she harry and ron went up the marble staircase laughing heartily 
 
 hermione said ron looking sideways at her suddenly frowning your teeth 
 
 what about them she said 
 
 well just noticed 
 
 of course they are did you expect me to keep those fangs malfoy gave me 
 
 no i mean different to how they were before he put that hex on allstraight and and 
 
 hermione suddenly smiled very mischievously and harry noticed it too it was a very different smile from the one he remembered 
 
 wellwhen i went up to madam pomfrey to get them shrunk she held up a mirror and told me to stop her when they were back to how they normally were she said and i justlet her carry on a bit she smiled even more widely mum and dad be too pleased been trying to persuade them to let me shrink them for ages but they wanted me to carry on with my braces you know dentists they just think teeth and magic should look back 
 
 tiny owl was twittering madly on the top of the banisters a scroll of parchment tied to his leg people passing him were pointing and laughing and a group of girls paused and said oh look at the weeny owl he cute 
 
 stupid little feathery git ron hissed hurrying up the stairs and snatching up pigwidgeon you bring letters to the addressee you hang around showing off 
 
 pigwidgeon hooted happily his head protruding over fist the girls all looked very shocked 
 
 clear off ron snapped at them waving the fist holding pigwidgeon who hooted more happily than ever as he soared through the air here take it harry ron added in an undertone as the girls scuttled away looking scandalized he pulled reply off pigwidgeons leg harry pocketed it and they hurried back to gryffindor tower to read it 
 
 everyone in the common room was much too busy in letting off more holiday steam to observe what anyone else was up to ron harry and hermione sat apart from everyone else by a dark window that was gradually filling up with snow and harry read out 
 
 dear harry 
 congratulations on getting past the horntail whoever put your name in that goblet be feeling too happy right now i was going to suggest a conjunctivitus curse as a eyes are its weakest point what krum did hermione whispered but your way was better impressed 
 get complacent though harry only done one task whoever put you in for the got plenty more opportunity if trying to hurt you keep your eyes open particularly when the person we discussed is around and concentrate on keeping yourself out of trouble 
 keep in touch i still want to hear about anything unusual 
 sirius 
 he sounds exactly like moody said harry quietly tucking the letter away again inside his robes constant vigilance think i walk around with my eyes shut banging off the walls 
 
 but right harry said hermione you have still got two tasks to do you really ought to have a look at that egg you know and start working out what it means 
 
 hermione got ages snapped ron want a game of chess harry 
 
 yeah okay said harry then spotting the look on face he said come on i supposed to concentrate with all this noise going on i even be able to hear the egg over this lot 
 
 oh i suppose not she sighed and she sat down to watch their chess match which culminated in an exciting checkmate of involving a couple of recklessly brave pawns and a very violent bishop 
 
 
 
 harry awoke very suddenly on christmas day wondering what had caused his abrupt return to consciousness he opened his eyes and saw something with very large round green eyes staring back at him in the darkness so close they were almost nose to nose 
 
 dobby harry yelled scrambling away from the elf so fast he almost fell out of bed do that 
 
 dobby is sorry sir squeaked dobby anxiously jumping backward with his long fingers over his mouth dobby is only wanting to wish harry potter merry christmas and bring him a present sir harry potter did say dobby could come and see him sometimes sir 
 
 okay said harry still breathing rather faster than usual while his heart rate returned to normal just just prod me or something in future all right bend over me like that 
 
 harry pulled back the curtains around his took his glasses from his bedside table and put them on his yell had awoken ron seamus dean and neville all of them were peering through the gaps in their own hangings and 
 
 someone attacking you harry seamus asked sleepily 
 
 no just dobby harry muttered go back to sleep 
 
 nahpresents said seamus spotting the large pile at the foot of his bed ron dean and neville decided that now they were awake they might as well get down to some too harry turned back to dobby who was now standing nervously next to bed still looking worried that he had upset harry there was a christmas bauble tied to the loop on top of his tea cozy 
 
 can dobby give harry potter his present he squeaked tentatively 
 
 course you can said harry got something for you too 
 
 it was a lie he bought anything for dobby at all but he quickly opened his trunk and pulled out a particularly knobbly pair of socks they were his oldest and foulest mustard yellow and had once belonged to uncle vernon the reason they were was that harry had been using them to cushion his sneakoscope for over a year now he pulled out the and handed the socks to dobby saying sorry i forgot to wrap them 
 
 but dobby was utterly delighted 
 
 socks are favorite favorite clothes sir he said ripping off his odd ones and pulling on uncle i has seven now sir he said his eyes widening having pulled both socks up to their highest extent so that they reached to the bottom of his shorts they has made a mistake in the shop harry potter they is giving you two the same 
 
 ah no harry how come you spot that said ron grinning over from his own bed which was now strewn with wrapping paper tell you what dobby here you go take these two and you can mix them up properly and your sweater 
 
 he threw dobby a pair of violet socks he had just unwrapped and the sweater mrs weasley had sent dobby looked quite overwhelmed 
 
 sir is very kind he squeaked his eyes brimming with tears again bowing deeply to ron dobby knew sir must be a great wizard for he is harry greatest friend but dobby did not know that he was also as generous of spirit as noble as selfless 
 
 only socks said ron who had gone slightly pink around the ears though he looked rather pleased all the same wow harry he had just opened present a chudley cannon hat cool he jammed it onto his head where it clashed horribly with his hair 
 
 dobby now handed harry a small package which turned out to be socks 
 
 dobby is making them himself sir the elf said happily he is buying the wool out of his wages sir 
 
 the left sock was bright red and had a pattern of broomsticks upon it the right sock was green with a pattern of snitches 
 
 reallywell thanks dobby said harry and he pulled them on causing eyes to leak with happiness again 
 
 dobby must go now sir we is already making christmas dinner in the kitchens said dobby and he hurried out of the dormitory waving to ron and the others as he passed 
 
 other presents were much more satisfactory than odd socks with the obvious exception of the dursleys which consisted of a single tissue an low harry supposed they too were remember ing the toffee hermione had given harry a book called quidditch teams of britain and ireland ron a bulging bag of dungbombs sirius a handy penknife with attachments to unlock any lock and undo any knot and hagrid a vast box of sweets including all favorites bertie every flavor beans chocolate frogs best blowing gum and fizzing whizbees there was also of course mrs usual package including a new sweater green with a picture of a dragon on it harry supposed charlie had told her all about the horntail and a large quantity of homemade mince pies 
 
 harry and ron met up with hermione in the common room and they went down to breakfast together they spent most of the morning in gryffindor tower where everyone was enjoying their presents then returned to the great hall for a magnificent lunch which included at least a hundred turkeys and christmas puddings and large piles of wizarding crackers 
 
 they went out onto the grounds in the afternoon the snow was untouched except for the deep channels made by the durmstrang and beauxbatons students on their way up to the castle hermione chose to watch harry and the weasleys snowball fight rather than join in and at five said she was going back upstairs to get ready for the ball 
 
 what you need three hours said ron looking at her incredulously and paying for his lapse in concentration when a large snowball thrown by george hit him hard on the side of the head you going with he yelled after hermione but she just waved and disappeared up the stone steps into the castle 
 
 there was no christmas tea today as the ball included a feast so at seven when it had become hard to aim properly the others abandoned their snowball fight and trooped back to the common room the fat lady was sitting in her frame with her friend violet from downstairs both of them extremely tipsy empty boxes of chocolate liqueurs littering the bottom other picture 
 
 lairy fights the one she giggled when they gave the password and she swung forward to let them inside 
 
 harry ron seamus dean and neville changed into their dress robes up in their dormitory all of them looking very but none as much as ron who surveyed himself in the long mirror in the corner with an appalled look on his face there was just no getting around the fact that his robes looked more like a dress than anything else in a desperate attempt to make them look more manly he used a severing charm on the ruff and cuffs it worked fairly well at least he was now although he done a very neat job and the edges still looked depressingly frayed as the boys set off downstairs 
 
 i still work out how you two got the girls in the year muttered dean 
 
 animal magnetism said ron gloomily pulling stray threads out of his cuffs 
 
 the common room looked strange full of people wearing different colors instead of the usual mass of black parvati was waiting for harry at the foot of the stairs she looked very pretty indeed in robes of shocking pink with her long dark plait braided with gold and gold bracelets glimmering at her wrists harry was relieved to see that she giggling 
 
 you er look nice he said awkwardly 
 
 thanks she said going to meet you in the entrance hall she added to ron 
 
 right said ron looking around hermione 
 
 parvati shrugged shall we go down then harry 
 
 okay said harry wishing he could just stay in the common room fred winked at harry as he passed him on the way out of the portrait hole 
 
 the entrance hall was packed with students too all milling around waiting for eight when the doors to the great hall would be thrown open those people who were meeting partners from different houses were edging through the crowd trying to find one another parvati found her sister padma and led her over to harry and ron 
 
 hi said padma who was looking just as pretty as parvati in robes of bright turquoise she look too enthusiastic about having ron as a partner though her dark eyes lingered on the frayed neck and sleeves of his dress robes as she looked him up and down 
 
 hi said ron not looking at her but staring around at the crowd oh no 
 
 he bent his knees slightly to hide behind harry because fleur delacour was passing looking stunning in robes of satin and accompanied by the ravenclaw quidditch captain roger davies when they had disappeared ron stood straight again and stared over the heads of the crowd 
 
 where is hermione he said again 
 
 a group of slytherins came up the steps from their dungeon common room malfoy was in front he was wearing dress robes of black velvet with a high collar which in opinion made him look like a vicar pansy parkinson in very frilly robes of pale pink was clutching arm crabbe and goyle were both wearing green they resembled boulders and neither of them harry was pleased to see had managed to find a partner 
 
 the oak front doors opened and everyone turned to look as the durmstrang students entered with professor karkaroff krum was at the front of the party accompanied by a pretty girl in blue robes harry know over their heads he saw that an area of lawn right in front of the castle had been transformed into a sort of grotto full of fairy lights meaning hundreds of actual living fairies were sitting in the rosebushes that had been conjured there and fluttering over the statues of what seemed to be father christmas and his reindeer 
 
 then professor voice called champions over here please 
 
 parvati readjusted her bangles beaming she and harry said see you in a minute to ron and padma and walked forward the chattering crowd parting to let them through professor mcgonagall who was wearing dress robes of red tartan and had arranged a rather ugly wreath of thistles around the brim other hat told them to wait on one side of the doors while everyone else went inside they were to enter the great hall in procession when the rest of the students had sat down fleur delacour and roger davies stationed themselves nearest the doors davies looked so stunned by his good fortune in having fleur for a partner that he could hardly take his eyes off her cedric and cho were close to harry too he looked away from them so he have to talk to them his eyes fell instead on the girl next to krum his jaw dropped 
 
 it was hermione 
 
 but she look like hermione at all she had done something with her hair it was no longer bushy but sleek and shiny and twisted up into an elegant knot at the back of her head she was wearing robes made of a floaty material and she was holding herself differently somehow or maybe it was merely the absence of the twenty or so books she usually had slung over her back she was also smiling rather nervously it was true but the reduction in the size of her front teeth was more noticeable than ever harry understand how he spotted it before 
 
 hi harry she said hi parvati 
 
 parvati was gazing at hermione in unflattering disbelief she the only one either when the doors to the great hall opened fan club from the library stalked past throwing hermione looks of deepest loathing pansy parkinson gaped at her as she walked by with malfoy and even he seem to be able to find an insult to throw at her ron however walked right past hermione without looking at her 
 
 once everyone else was settled in the hall professor mcgonagall told the champions and their partners to get in line in pairs and to follow her they did so and everyone in the great hall applauded as they entered and started walking up toward a large round table at the top of the hall where the judges were sitting 
 
 the walls of the hall had all been covered in sparkling silver frost with hundreds of garlands of mistletoe and ivy crossing the starry black ceiling the house tables had vanished instead there were about a hundred smaller ones each seating about a dozen people 
 
 harry concentrated on not tripping over his feet parvati seemed to be enjoying herself she was beaming around at everybody steering harry so forcefully that he felt as though he were a show dog she was putting through its paces he caught sight of ron and padma as he neared the top table ron was watching hermione pass with narrowed eyes padma was looking sulky 
 
 dumbledore smiled happily as the champions approached the top table but karkaroff wore an expression remarkably like as he watched krum and hermione draw nearer ludo bagman tonight in robes of bright purple with large yellow stars was clapping as enthusiastically as any of the students and madame maxime who had changed her usual uniform of black satin for a flowing gown of lavender silk was applauding them politely but mr crouch harry suddenly realized was not there the fifth seat at the table was occupied by percy weasley 
 
 when the champions and their partners reached the table percy drew out the empty chair beside him staring pointedly at harry harry took the hint and sat down next to percy who was wearing dress robes and an expression of such smugness that harry thought it ought to be fined 
 
 been promoted percy said before harry could even ask and from his tone he might have been announcing his election as supreme ruler of the universe now mr personal assistant and here representing him 
 
 why he come harry asked he looking forward to being lectured on cauldron bottoms all through dinner 
 
 afraid to say mr crouch well not well at all been right since the world cup hardly surprising overwork not as young as he was though still quite brilliant of course the mind remains as great as it ever was but the world cup was a fiasco for the whole ministry and then mr crouch suffered a huge personal shock with the misbehavior of that of his blinky or whatever she was called naturally he dismissed her immediately afterward but well as i say getting on he needs looking after and i think found a definite drop in his home comforts since she left and then we had the tournament to arrange and the aftermath of the cup to deal with that revolting skeeter woman buzzing around no poor man having a well earned quiet christmas just glad he knew he had someone he could rely upon to take his place 
 
 harry wanted very much to ask whether mr crouch had stopped calling percy weatherby yet but resisted the temptation 
 
 there was no food as yet on the glittering golden plates but small menus were lying in front of each of them harry picked his up uncertainly and looked around there were no waiters dumbledore however looked carefully down at his own menu then said very clearly to his plate pork chops 
 
 and pork chops appeared getting the idea the rest of the table placed their orders with their plates too harry glanced up at hermione to see how she felt about this new and more complicated method of dining surely it meant plenty of extra work for the but for once hermione seem to be thinking about she was deep in talk with viktor krum and hardly seemed to notice what she was eating 
 
 it now occurred to harry that he had never actually heard krum speak before but he was certainly talking now and very enthusiastically at that 
 
 veil ve have a castle also not as big as this nor as comfortable i am thinking he was telling hermione ve have just four floors and the fires are lit only for magical purposes but ve have grounds larger even than these though in vinter ve have very little daylight so ve are not enjoying them but in summer ve are flying every day over the lakes and the mountains 
 
 now now viktor said karkaroff with a laugh that reach his cold eyes go giving away anything else now or your charming friend will know exactly where to find us 
 
 dumbledore smiled his eyes twinkling igor all this secrecy one would almost think you want visitors 
 
 well dumbledore said karkaroff displaying his yellowing teeth to their fullest extent we are all protective of our private domains are we not do we not jealously guard the halls of learning that have been entrusted to us are we not right to be proud that we alone know our secrets and right to protect them 
 
 oh i would never dream of assuming i know all hogwarts secrets igor said dumbledore amicably only this morning for instance i took a wrong turning on the way to the bathroom and found myself in a beautifully proportioned room i have never seen before containing a really rather magnificent collection of chamber pots when i went back to investigate more closely i discovered that the room had vanished but i must keep an eye out for it possibly it is only accessible at in the morning or it may only appear at the quarter moon or when the seeker has an exceptionally full bladder 
 
 harry snorted into his plate of goulash percy frowned but harry could have sworn dumbledore had given him a very small wink 
 
 meanwhile fleur delacour was criticizing the hogwarts decorations to roger davies 
 
 zis is nothing she said dismissively looking around at the sparkling walls of the great hall at ze palace of beauxbatons we ave ice sculptures all around ze dining chamber at chreestmas zey do not melt of coursezey are like uge statues of diamond glittering around ze place and ze food is seemply superb and we ave choirs of wood nymphs oo serenade us as we eat we ave none of zis ugly armor in ze alls and eef a poltergeist ever entaired into beauxbatons e would be expelled like zat she slapped her hand onto the table impatiently 
 
 roger davies was watching her talk with a very dazed look on his face and he kept missing his mouth with his fork harry had the impression that davies was too busy staring at fleur to take in a word she was saying 
 
 absolutely right he said quickly slapping his own hand down on the table in imitation of fleur like that yeah 
 
 harry looked around the hall hagrid was sitting at one of the other staff tables he was back in his horrible hairy brown suit and gazing up at the top table harry saw him give a small wave and looking around saw madame maxime return it her opals glittering in the candlelight 
 
 hermione was now teaching krum to say her name properly he kept calling her 
 
 she said slowly and clearly 
 
 
 
 close enough she said catching eye and grinning 
 
 when all the food had been consumed dumbledore stood up and asked the students to do the same then with a wave of his wand all the tables zoomed back along the walls leaving the floor clear and then he conjured a raised platform into existence along the right wall a set of drums several guitars a lute a cello and some bagpipes were set upon it 
 
 the weird sisters now trooped up onto the stage to wildly enthusiastic applause they were all extremely hairy and dressed in black robes that had been artfully ripped and torn they picked up their instruments and harry who had been so interested in watching them that he had almost forgotten what was coming suddenly realized that the lanterns on all the other tables had gone out and that the other champions and their partners were standing up 
 
 come on parvati hissed supposed to dance 
 
 harry tripped over his dress robes as he stood up the weird sisters struck up a slow mournful tune harry walked onto the brightly lit dance floor carefully avoiding catching eye he could see seamus and dean waving at him and sniggering and next moment parvati had seized his hands placed one around her waist and was holding the other tightly in hers 
 
 it as bad as it could have been harry thought revolving slowly on the spot parvati was steering he kept his eyes fixed over the heads of the watching people and very soon many of them too had come onto the dance floor so that the champions were no longer the center of attention neville and ginny were dancing nearby he could see ginny wincing frequently as neville trod on her feet and dumbledore was waltzing with madame maxime he was so dwarfed by her that the top of his pointed hat barely tickled her chin however she moved very gracefully for a woman so large moody was doing an extremely ungainly with professor sinistra who was nervously avoiding his wooden leg 
 
 nice socks potter moody growled as he passed his magical eye staring through robes 
 
 oh yeah dobby the knitted them for me said harry grinning 
 
 he is so creepy parvati whispered as moody clunked away i think that eye should be allowed 
 
 
 
 harry heard the final quavering note from the bagpipe with relief the weird sisters stopped playing applause filled the hall once more and harry let go of parvati at once 
 
 sit down shall we 
 
 oh but this is a really good one parvati said as the weird sisters struck up a new song which was much faster 
 
 no i like it harry lied and he led her away from the dance floor past fred and angelina who were dancing so exhuberantly that people around them were backing away in fear of injury and over to the table where ron and padma were sitting 
 
 it going harry asked ron sitting down and opening a bottle of butterbeer 
 
 ron answer he was glaring at hermione and krum who were dancing nearby padma was sitting with her arms and legs crossed one foot jiggling in time to the music every now and then she threw a disgruntled look at ron who was completely ignoring her parvati sat down on other side crossed her arms and legs too and within minutes was asked to dance by a boy from beauxbatons 
 
 you mind do you harry parvati said 
 
 what said harry who was now watching cho and cedric 
 
 oh never mind snapped parvati and she went off with the boy from beauxbatons when the song ended she did not return 
 
 hermione came over and sat down in empty chair she was a bit pink in the face from dancing 
 
 hi said harry ron say anything 
 
 hot it said hermione fanning herself with her hand just gone to get some drinks 
 
 ron gave her a withering look viktor he said he asked you to call him vicky yet 
 
 hermione looked at him in surprise up with you she said 
 
 if you know said ron scathingly not going to tell you 
 
 hermione stared at him then at harry who shrugged 
 
 ron what 
 
 from durmstrang spat ron competing against harry against hogwarts you ron was obviously casting around for words strong enough to describe crime fraternizing with the enemy what doing 
 
 mouth fell open 
 
 be so stupid she said after a moment the enemy honestly who was the one who was all excited when they saw him arrive who was the one who wanted his autograph got a model of him up in their dormitory 
 
 ron chose to ignore this i he asked you to come with him while you were both in the library 
 
 yes he did said hermione the pink patches on her cheeks glowing more brightly so what 
 
 what happened trying to get him to join spew were you 
 
 no i if you really want to know he he said been coming up to the library every day to try and talk to me but he been able to pluck up the courage 
 
 hermione said this very quickly and blushed so deeply that she was the same color as robes 
 
 yeah well his story said ron nastily 
 
 and that supposed to mean 
 
 obvious it student he he knows who you hang around just trying to get closer to harry get inside information on him or get near enough to jinx him 
 
 hermione looked as though ron had slapped her when she spoke her voice quivered 
 
 for your information he asked me one single thing about harry not one 
 
 ron changed tack at the speed of light 
 
 then hoping help him find out what his egg means i suppose been putting your heads together during those cozy little library sessions 
 
 never help him work out that egg said hermione looking outraged never how could you say something like that i want harry to win the tournament harry knows that you harry 
 
 got a funny way of showing it sneered ron 
 
 this whole supposed to be about getting to know foreign wizards and making friends with them said hermione hotly 
 
 no it shouted ron about winning 
 
 people were starting to stare at them 
 
 ron said harry quietly i got a problem with hermione coming with krum 
 
 but ron ignored harry too 
 
 why you go and find vicky be wondering where you are said ron 
 
 call him vicky 
 
 hermione jumped to her feet and stormed off across the dance floor disappearing into the crowd ron watched her go with a mixture of anger and satisfaction on his face 
 
 are you going to ask me to dance at all padma asked him 
 
 no said ron still glaring after hermione 
 
 fine snapped padma and she got up and went to join parvati and the beauxbatons boy who conjured up one of his friends to join them so fast that harry could have sworn he had zoomed him there by a summoning charm 
 
 vare is said a voice 
 
 krum had just arrived at their table clutching two butterbeers 
 
 no idea said ron mulishly looking up at him lost her have you 
 
 krum was looking surly again 
 
 veil if you see her tell her i haff drinks he said and he slouched off 
 
 made friends with viktor krum have you ron 
 
 percy had bustled over rubbing his hands together and looking extremely pompous excellent the whole point you know international magical cooperation 
 
 to displeasure percy now took vacated seat the top table was now empty professor dumbledore was dancing with professor sprout ludo bagman with professor mcgonagall madame maxime and hagrid were cutting a wide path around the dance floor as they waltzed through the students and karkaroff was nowhere to be seen when the next song ended everybody applauded once more and harry saw ludo bagman kiss professor hand and make his way back through the crowds at which point fred and george accosted him 
 
 what do they think doing annoying senior ministry members percy hissed watching fred and george suspiciously no respect 
 
 ludo bagman shook off fred and george fairly quickly however and spotting harry waved and came over to their table 
 
 i hope my brothers bothering you mr bagman said percy at once 
 
 what oh not at all not at all said bagman no they were just telling me a bit more about those fake wands of theirs wondering if i could advise them on the marketing promised to put them in touch with a couple of contacts of mine at joke shop 
 
 percy look happy about this at all and harry was prepared to bet he would be rushing to tell mrs weasley about this the moment he got home apparently fred and plans had grown even more ambitious lately if they were hoping to sell to the public bagman opened his mouth to ask harry something but percy diverted him 
 
 how do you feel the going mr bagman our quite satisfied the hitch with the goblet of fire he glanced at harry was a little unfortunate of course but it seems to have gone very smoothly since you think 
 
 oh yes bagman said cheerfully all been enormous fun old barty doing shame he come 
 
 oh sure mr crouch will be up and about in no time said percy importantly but in the meantime more than willing to take up the slack of course not all attending balls he laughed airily oh no had to deal with all sorts of things that have cropped up in his absence you heard ali bashir was caught smuggling a consignment of flying carpets into the country and then been trying to persuade the transylvanians to sign the international ban on dueling got a meeting with their head of magical cooperation in the new year 
 
 go for a walk ron muttered to harry get away from percy 
 
 pretending they wanted more drinks harry and ron left the table edged around the dance floor and slipped out into the entrance hall the front doors stood open and the fluttering fairy lights in the rose garden winked and twinkled as they went down the front steps where they found themselves surrounded by bushes winding ornamental paths and large stone statues harry could hear splashing water which sounded like a fountain here and there people were sitting on carved benches he and ron set off along one of the winding paths through the rosebushes but they had gone only a short way when they heard an unpleasantly familiar voice 
 
 see what there is to fuss about igor 
 
 severus you cannot pretend this happening karkaroffs voice sounded anxious and hushed as though keen not to be overheard been getting clearer and clearer for months i am becoming seriously concerned i deny it 
 
 then flee said voice curtly flee i will make your excuses i however am remaining at hogwarts 
 
 snape and karkaroff came around the corner snape had his wand out and was blasting rosebushes apart his expression most squeals issued from many of the bushes and dark shapes emerged from them 
 
 ten points from ravenclaw fawcett snape snarled as a girl ran past him and ten points from hufflepuff too stebbins as a boy went rushing after her and what are you two doing he added catching sight of harry and ron on the path ahead karkaroff harry saw looked slightly discomposed to see them standing there his hand went nervously to his goatee and he began winding it around his finger 
 
 we re walking ron told snape shortly not against the law is it 
 
 keep walking then snape snarled and he brushed past them his long black cloak billowing out behind him karkaroff hurried away after snape harry and ron continued down the path 
 
 got karkaroff all worried ron muttered 
 
 and since when have he and snape been on harry slowly 
 
 they had reached a large stone reindeer now over which they could see the sparkling jets of a tall fountain the shadowy outlines of two enormous people were visible on a stone bench watching the water in the moonlight and then harry heard hagrid speak 
 
 momen i saw yeh i knew he was saying in an oddly husky voice 
 
 harry and ron froze this sound like the sort of scene they ought to walk in on looked around back up the path and saw fleur delacour and roger davies standing in a rosebush nearby he tapped ron on the shoulder and jerked his head toward them meaning that they could easily sneak off that way without being noticed fleur and davies looked very busy to harry but ron eyes widening in horror at the sight of fleur shook his head vigorously and pulled harry deeper into the shadows behind the reindeer 
 
 what did you know agrid said madame maxime a purr in her low voice 
 
 harry definitely want to listen to this he knew hagrid would hate to be overheard in a situation like this he certainly would have if it had been possible he would have put his fingers in his ears and hummed loudly but that really an option instead he tried to interest himself in a beetle crawling along the stone back but the beetle just interesting enough to block out next words 
 
 i jus knewknew you were like it yer mother or yer father 
 
 i i know what you mean agrid 
 
 it was my mother said hagrid quietly she was one o the las ones in britain course i can remember her too wellshe left see when i was abou three she wasn really the maternal sort not in their natures is it dunno what happened to hermight be dead fer all i know 
 
 madame maxime say anything and harry in spite of himself took his eyes off the beetle and looked over the top of the antlers had never heard hagrid talk about his childhood before 
 
 me dad was when she wen tiny little bloke my dad was by the time i was six i could lift him up an put him on top o the dresser if he annoyed me used ter make him deep voice broke madame maxime was listening motionless apparently staring at the silvery fountain dad raised mebut he died o course jus after i started school sorta had ter make me own way after that dumbledore was a real help mind very kind ter me he was 
 
 hagrid pulled out a large spotted silk handkerchief and blew his nose heavily 
 
 soanywayenough abou me what about you which side you got it on 
 
 but madame maxime had suddenly got to her feet 
 
 it is chilly she said but whatever the weather was doing it was nowhere near as cold as her voice i think i will go in now 
 
 eh said hagrid blankly no don go never met another one before 
 
 anuzzer what precisely said madame maxime her tone icy 
 
 harry could have told hagrid it was best not to answer he stood there in the shadows gritting his teeth hoping against hope he but it was no good 
 
 another o course said hagrid 
 
 ow dare you shrieked madame maxime her voice exploded through the peaceful night air like a foghorn behind him harry heard fleur and roger fall out of their rosebush i ave nevair been more insulted in my life moi i ave i ave big bones 
 
 she stormed away great multicolored swarms of fairies rose into the air as she passed angrily pushing aside bushes hagrid was still sitting on the bench staring after her it was much too dark to make out his expression then after about a minute he stood up and strode away not back to the castle but off out into the dark grounds in the direction of his cabin 
 
 harry said very quietly to ron go 
 
 but ron move 
 
 up said harry looking at him 
 
 ron looked around at harry his expression very serious indeed 
 
 did you know he whispered about hagrid being 
 
 no harry said shrugging so what 
 
 he knew immediately from the look ron was giving him that he was once again revealing his ignorance of the wizarding world brought up by the dursleys there were many things that wizards took for granted that were revelations to harry but these surprises had become fewer with each successive year now however he could tell that most wizards would not have said so what upon finding out that one of their friends had a giantess for a mother 
 
 explain inside said ron quietly 
 
 fleur and roger davies had disappeared probably into a more private clump of bushes harry and ron returned to the great hall parvati and padma were now sitting at a distant table with a whole crowd of beauxbatons boys and hermione was once more dancing with krum harry and ron sat down at a table far removed from the dance floor 
 
 so harry prompted ron the problem with giants 
 
 well ron struggled for words not very nice he finished lamely 
 
 who cares harry said nothing wrong with hagrid 
 
 i know there butblimey no wonder he keeps it quiet ron said shaking his head i always thought got in the way of a bad engorgement charm when he was a kid or something like to mention it 
 
 but it matter if his mother was a giantess said harry 
 
 wellno one who knows him will care cos know not dangerous said ron slowly butharry just vicious giants like hagrid said in their natures like trollsthey just like killing everyone knows that there any left in britain now though 
 
 what happened to them 
 
 well they were dying out anyway and then loads got themselves killed by aurors supposed to be giants abroad hide out in mountains mostly 
 
 i know who maxime thinks kidding harry said watching madame maxime sitting alone at the judges table looking very somber if she definitely is big only thing got bigger bones than her is a dinosaur 
 
 harry and ron spent the rest of the ball discussing giants in their corner neither of them having any inclination to dance harry tried not to watch cho and cedric too much it gave him a strong desire to kick something 
 
 when the weird sisters finished playing at midnight everyone gave them a last loud round of applause and started to wend their way into the entrance hall many people were expressing the wish that the ball could have gone on longer but harry was perfectly happy to be going to bed as far as he was concerned the evening been much fun 
 
 out in the entrance hall harry and ron saw hermione saying good night to krum before he went back to the durmstrang ship she gave ron a very cold look and swept past him up the marble staircase without speaking harry and ron followed her but halfway up the staircase harry heard someone calling him 
 
 
 
 it was cedric diggory harry could see cho waiting for him in the entrance hall below 
 
 yeah said harry coldly as cedric ran up the stairs toward him 
 
 cedric looked as though he want to say whatever it was in front of ron who shrugged looking and continued to climb the stairs 
 
 listen cedric lowered his voice as ron disappeared i owe you one for telling me about the dragons you know that golden egg does yours wail when you open it 
 
 yeah said harry 
 
 welltake a bath okay 
 
 what 
 
 take a bath and er take the egg with you and er just mull things over in the hot water help you me 
 
 harry stared at him 
 
 tell you what cedric said use the prefects bathroom fourth door to the left of that statue of boris the bewildered on the fifth floor pine fresh gotta gowant to say good night 
 
 he grinned at harry again and hurried back down the stairs to cho 
 
 harry walked back to gryffindor tower alone that had been extremely strange advice why would a bath help him to work out what the wailing egg meant was cedric pulling his leg was he trying to make harry look like a fool so cho would like him even more by comparison 
 
 the fat lady and her friend vi were snoozing in the picture over the portrait hole harry had to yell fairy lights before he woke them up and when he did they were extremely irritated he climbed into the common room and found ron and hermione having a blazing row standing ten feet apart they were bellowing at each other each scarlet in the face 
 
 well if you like it you know what the solution is you yelled hermione her hair was coming down out of its elegant bun now and her face was screwed up in anger 
 
 oh yeah ron yelled back that 
 
 next time a ball ask me before someone else does and not as a last resort 
 
 ron mouthed soundlessly like a goldfish out of water as hermione turned on her heel and stormed up the girls staircase to bed ron turned to look at harry 
 
 well he sputtered looking thunderstruck well that just proves completely missed the point 
 
 harry say anything he liked being back on speaking terms with ron too much to speak his mind right now but he somehow thought that hermione had gotten the point much better than ron had 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire
