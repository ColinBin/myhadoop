 the little mermaid 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 far out in the ocean where the water is as blue as the prettiest cornflower and as clear as crystal it is very very deep so deep indeed that no cable could fathom it many church steeples piled one upon another would not reach from the ground beneath to the surface of the water above there dwell the sea king and his subjects we must not imagine that there is nothing at the bottom of the sea but bare yellow sand no indeed the most singular flowers and plants grow there the leaves and stems of which are so pliant that the slightest agitation of the water causes them to stir as if they had life fishes both large and small glide between the branches as birds fly among the trees here upon land in the deepest spot of all stands the castle of the sea king 
 
 its walls are built of coral and the long gothic windows are of 
 the clearest amber the roof is formed of shells that open and 
 close as the water flows over them their appearance is very 
 beautiful for in each lies a glittering pearl which would be fit for 
 the diadem of a queen 
 
 the sea king had been a widower for many years and his aged 
 mother kept house for him she was a very wise woman and 
 exceedingly proud of her high birth on that account she wore twelve 
 oysters on her tail while others also of high rank were only 
 allowed to wear six she was however deserving of very great praise especially for her care of the little her 
 they were six beautiful children but the youngest 
 was the prettiest of them all her skin was as clear and delicate as a 
 and her eyes as blue as the deepest sea but like all 
 the others she had no feet and her body ended in a tail 
 
 all day long they played in the great halls of the castle or among 
 the living flowers that grew out of the walls the large amber windows 
 were open and the fish swam in just as the swallows fly into our 
 houses when we open the windows excepting that the fishes swam up to the princesses ate out of their hands and allowed themselves to be stroked outside the castle there was a beautiful garden in 
 which grew bright red and dark blue flowers and blossoms like 
 flames of fire the fruit glittered like gold and the leaves and 
 stems waved to and fro continually the earth itself was the finest 
 sand but blue as the flame of burning sulphur over everything lay 
 a peculiar blue radiance as if it were surrounded by the air from 
 above through which the blue sky shone instead of the dark depths of the sea in calm weather the sun could be seen looking like a 
 purple flower with the light streaming from the calyx each of the 
 young princesses had a little plot of ground in the garden where 
 she might dig and plant as she pleased one arranged her 
 into the form of a whale another thought it better to make hers 
 like the figure of a little mermaid but that of the youngest was 
 round like the sun and contained flowers as red as his rays at 
 sunset she was a strange child quiet and thoughtful and while her 
 sisters would be delighted with the wonderful things which they 
 obtained from the wrecks of vessels she cared for nothing but her 
 pretty red flowers like the sun excepting a beautiful marble statue 
 it was the representation of a handsome boy carved out of pure 
 white stone which had fallen to the bottom of the sea from a wreck 
 
 she planted by the statue a weeping willow it grew 
 splendidly and very soon hung its fresh branches over the statue 
 almost down to the blue sands the shadow had a violet tint and waved to and fro like the branches it seemed as if the crown of the tree and the root were at play and trying to kiss each other nothing gave her so much pleasure as to hear about the world above the sea 
 she made her old grandmother tell her all she knew of the ships and of the towns the people and the animals to her it seemed most wonderful and beautiful to hear that the flowers of the land should have fragrance and not those below the sea that the trees of the forest should be green and that the fishes among the trees could sing so sweetly that it was quite a pleasure to hear them her grandmother 
 called the little birds fishes or she would not have understood 
 her for she had never seen birds 
 
 when you have reached your fifteenth year said the 
 you will have permission to rise up out of the sea 
 to sit on the rocks in the moonlight while the great ships are 
 sailing by and then you will see both forests and towns 
 
 in the following year one of the sisters would be fifteen but as 
 each was a year younger than the other the youngest would have to 
 wait five years before her turn came to rise up from the bottom of the 
 ocean and see the earth as we do however each promised to tell 
 the others what she saw on her first visit and what she thought the 
 most beautiful for their grandmother could not tell them enough 
 there were so many things on which they wanted information none of them longed so much for her turn to come as the youngest she who had the longest time to wait and who was so quiet and thoughtful 
 
 many nights she stood by the open window looking up through the 
 dark blue water and watching the fish as they splashed about with 
 their fins and tails she could see the moon and stars shining 
 faintly but through the water they looked larger than they do to 
 our eyes when something like a black cloud passed between her and 
 them she knew that it was either a whale swimming over her head or a ship full of human beings who never imagined that a pretty little 
 mermaid was standing beneath them holding out her white hands towards the keel of their ship 
 
 as soon as the eldest was fifteen she was allowed to rise to 
 the surface of the ocean when she came back she had hundreds of 
 things to talk about but the most beautiful she said was to lie 
 in the moonlight on a sandbank in the quiet sea near the coast and 
 to gaze on a large town nearby where the lights were twinkling like 
 hundreds of stars to listen to the sounds of the music the noise 
 of carriages and the voices of human beings and then to hear the 
 merry bells peal out from the church steeples and because she could 
 not go near to all those wonderful things she longed for them more 
 than ever oh did not the youngest sister listen eagerly to all these 
 descriptions and afterwards when she stood at the open window 
 looking up through the dark blue water she thought of the great city 
 with all its bustle and noise and even fancied she could hear the 
 sound of the church bells down in the depths of the sea 
 in another year the second sister received permission to rise to 
 the surface of the water and to swim about where she pleased she 
 rose just as the sun was setting and this she said was the most 
 beautiful sight of all the whole sky looked like gold while violet 
 and clouds which she could not describe floated over 
 her and still more rapidly than the clouds flew a large flock of 
 wild swans towards the setting sun looking like a long white veil 
 across the sea she also swam towards the sun but it sunk into the 
 waves and the rosy tints faded from the clouds and from the sea 
 
 the third turn followed she was the boldest of them all 
 and she swam up a broad river that emptied itself into the sea on the 
 banks she saw green hills covered with beautiful vines palaces and 
 castles peeped out from amid the proud trees of the forest she 
 heard the birds singing and the rays of the sun were so powerful that 
 she was obliged often to dive down under the water to cool her burning face in a narrow creek she found a whole troop of little human children quite naked and sporting about in the water she wanted to play with them but they fled in a great fright and then a 
 little black animal came to the water it was a dog but she did not 
 know that for she had never before seen one this animal barked at 
 her so terribly that she became frightened and rushed back to the 
 open sea but she said she should never forget the beautiful forest 
 the green hills and the pretty little children who could swim in 
 the water although they had not tails 
 
 the fourth sister was more timid she remained in the midst of the 
 sea but she said it was quite as beautiful there as nearer the 
 land she could see for so many miles around her and the sky above 
 looked like a bell of glass she had seen the ships but at such a 
 great distance that they looked like the dolphins sported 
 in the waves and the great whales spouted water from their nostrils 
 till it seemed as if a hundred fountains were playing in every 
 direction 
 the fifth birthday occurred in the winter so when her 
 turn came she saw what the others had not seen the first time they 
 went up the sea looked quite green and large icebergs were 
 floating about each like a pearl she said but larger and loftier 
 than the churches built by men they were of the most singular shapes 
 and glittered like diamonds she had seated herself upon one of the 
 largest and let the wind play with her long hair and she remarked 
 that all the ships sailed by rapidly and steered as far away as 
 they could from the iceberg as if they were afraid of it towards 
 evening as the sun went down dark clouds covered the sky the 
 thunder rolled and the lightning flashed and the red light glowed 
 on the icebergs as they rocked and tossed on the heaving sea on all 
 the ships the sails were reefed with fear and trembling while she sat 
 calmly on the floating iceberg watching the blue lightning as it 
 darted its forked flashes into the sea 
 
 when first the sisters had permission to rise to the surface they 
 were each delighted with the new and beautiful sights they saw but 
 now as girls they could go when they pleased and they 
 had become indifferent about it they wished themselves back again 
 in the water and after a month had passed they said it was much 
 more beautiful down below and pleasanter to be at home yet often in the evening hours the five sisters would twine their arms round 
 each other and rise to the surface in a row they had more beautiful 
 voices than any human being could have and before the approach of a storm and when they expected a ship would be lost they swam before the vessel and sang sweetly of the delights to be found in the depths of the sea and begging the sailors not to fear if they sank to the bottom but the sailors could not understand the song they took it for the howling of the storm and these things were never to be 
 beautiful for them for if the ship sank the men were drowned and 
 their dead bodies alone reached the palace of the sea king 
 
 when the sisters rose through the water in this 
 way their youngest sister would stand quite alone looking after 
 them ready to cry only that the mermaids have no tears and 
 therefore they suffer more oh were i but fifteen years old said 
 she i know that i shall love the world up there and all the 
 people who live in it 
 
 at last she reached her fifteenth year well now you are 
 grown up said the old dowager her grandmother so you must let 
 me adorn you like your other sisters and she placed a wreath of 
 white lilies in her hair and every flower leaf was half a pearl then 
 the old lady ordered eight great oysters to attach themselves to the 
 tail of the princess to show her high rank 
 
 but they hurt me so said the little mermaid 
 
 pride must suffer pain replied the old lady oh how gladly she 
 would have shaken off all this grandeur and laid aside the heavy 
 wreath the red flowers in her own garden would have suited her much better but she could not help herself so she said farewell and rose as lightly as a bubble to the surface of the water the sun had just set as she raised her head above the waves but the clouds were tinted with crimson and gold and through the glimmering twilight beamed the evening star in all its beauty the sea was calm and the air mild and fresh a large ship with three masts lay becalmed on the water with only one sail set for not a breeze stiffed and the sailors sat idle on deck or amongst the rigging there was music and song on board and as darkness came on a hundred colored lanterns were lighted as if the flags of all nations waved in the air the little mermaid swam close to the cabin windows and now and then as the waves lifted her up she could look in through clear glass and see a number of people within 
 among them was a young prince the most beautiful of all with large black eyes he was sixteen years of age and his birthday was being kept with much rejoicing the sailors were dancing on deck but when the prince came out of the cabin more than a hundred rockets rose in 
 the air making it as bright as day the little mermaid was so 
 startled that she dived under water and when she again stretched 
 out her head it appeared as if all the stars of heaven were falling 
 around her she had never seen such fireworks before great suns 
 spurted fire about splendid fireflies flew into the blue air and 
 everything was reflected in the clear calm sea beneath the ship 
 itself was so brightly illuminated that all the people and even the 
 smallest rope could be distinctly and plainly seen and how 
 handsome the young prince looked as he pressed the hands of all 
 present and smiled at them while the music resounded through the 
 clear night air 
 
 it was very late yet the little mermaid could not take her eyes 
 from the ship or from the beautiful prince the colored lanterns 
 had been extinguished no more rockets rose in the air and the cannon had ceased firing but the sea became restless and a moaning 
 grumbling sound could be heard beneath the waves still the little 
 mermaid remained by the cabin window rocking up and down on the 
 water which enabled her to look in after a while the sails were 
 quickly unfurled and the noble ship continued her passage but soon 
 the waves rose higher heavy clouds darkened the sky and lightning 
 appeared in the distance a dreadful storm was approaching once 
 more the sails were reefed and the great ship pursued her flying 
 course over the raging sea the waves rose mountains high as if 
 they would have overtopped the mast but the ship dived like a swan 
 between them and then rose again on their lofty foaming crests to 
 the little mermaid this appeared pleasant sport not so to the 
 sailors at length the ship groaned and creaked the thick planks gave 
 way under the lashing of the sea as it broke over the deck the 
 mainmast snapped asunder like a reed the ship lay over on her side 
 and the water rushed in the little mermaid now perceived that the 
 crew were in danger even she herself was obliged to be careful to 
 avoid the beams and planks of the wreck which lay scattered on the 
 water at one moment it was so pitch dark that she could not see a 
 single object but a flash of lightning revealed the whole scene 
 she could see every one who had been on board excepting the prince 
 when the ship parted she had seen him sink into the deep waves and 
 she was glad for she thought he would now be with her and then she 
 remembered that human beings could not live in the water so that when he got down to her palace he would be quite dead but he must not die so she swam about among the beams and planks which strewed the surface of the sea forgetting that they could crush her to pieces then she dived deeply under the dark waters rising and 
 falling with the waves till at length she managed to reach the 
 young prince who was fast losing the power of swimming in that stormy sea his limbs were failing him his beautiful eyes were closed and he would have died had not the little mermaid come to his 
 assistance she held his head above the water and let the waves drift 
 them where they would 
 
 in the morning the storm had ceased but of the ship not a 
 single fragment could be seen the sun rose up red and glowing from 
 the water and its beams brought back the hue of health to the 
 cheeks but his eyes remained closed the mermaid kissed 
 his high smooth forehead and stroked back his wet hair he seemed to her like the marble statue in her little garden and she kissed him 
 again and wished that he might live presently they came in sight 
 of land she saw lofty blue mountains on which the white snow 
 rested as if a flock of swans were lying upon them near the coast 
 were beautiful green forests and close by stood a large building 
 whether a church or a convent she could not tell orange and citron 
 trees grew in the garden and before the door stood lofty palms the 
 sea here formed a little bay in which the water was quite still 
 but very deep so she swam with the handsome prince to the beach 
 which was covered with fine white sand and there she laid him in the 
 warm sunshine taking care to raise his head higher than his body 
 
 then bells sounded in the large white building and a number of 
 young girls came into the garden the little mermaid swam out 
 farther from the shore and placed herself between some high rocks that rose out of the water then she covered her head and neck with the foam of the sea so that her little face might not be seen and watched to see what would become of the poor prince she did not wait long before she saw a young girl approach the spot where he lay 
 she seemed frightened at first but only for a moment then she fetched a number of people and the mermaid saw that the prince came to life again and smiled upon those who stood round him but to her he sent no smile he knew not that she had saved him this made her very unhappy and when he was led away into the great building she dived down sorrowfully into the water and returned to her castle she had always been silent and thoughtful and now she was more so than ever her sisters asked her what she had seen during her first visit to the surface of the water but she would tell them nothing many an evening and morning did she rise to the place where she had left the prince she saw the fruits in the garden ripen till they were gathered the snow on the tops of the mountains melt away but she never saw the prince and therefore she returned home always more sorrowful than before it was her only comfort to sit in her own little garden and fling her arm round the beautiful marble statue which was like the prince but she gave up tending her flowers and they grew in wild confusion over the paths twining their long leaves and stems round the branches of the trees so that the whole place became dark and gloomy at length she could bear it no longer and told one of her sisters all about it then the others heard the secret and very soon it became known to two mermaids whose intimate friend happened to know who the prince was she had also seen the festival on board ship and she told them where the prince came from and where his palace stood 
 
 come little sister said the other princesses then they 
 entwined their arms and rose up in a long row to the surface of the 
 water close by the spot where they knew the palace stood it 
 was built of bright yellow shining stone with long flights of 
 marble steps one of which reached quite down to the sea splendid 
 gilded cupolas rose over the roof and between the pillars that 
 surrounded the whole building stood statues of marble 
 
 through the clear crystal of the lofty windows could be seen noble 
 rooms with costly silk curtains and hangings of tapestry while the 
 walls were covered with beautiful paintings which were a pleasure to 
 look at in the centre of the largest saloon a fountain threw its 
 sparkling jets high up into the glass cupola of the ceiling through 
 which the sun shone down upon the water and upon the beautiful 
 plants growing round the basin of the fountain now that she knew 
 where he lived she spent many an evening and many a night on the 
 water near the palace she would swim much nearer the shore than any of the others ventured to do indeed once she went quite up the narrow channel under the marble balcony which threw a broad shadow on the water here she would sit and watch the young prince who thought himself quite alone in the bright moonlight she saw him many times of an evening sailing in a pleasant boat with music playing and flags waving she peeped out from among the green rushes and if the wind caught her long veil those who saw it believed it to be a swan spreading out its wings on many a night too when the fishermen with their torches were out at sea she heard them relate so many good things about the doings of the young prince that she was glad she had saved his life when he had been tossed about on the waves and she remembered that his head had rested on her bosom and how heartily she had kissed him but he knew nothing of all this and could not even dream of her she grew more and more fond of human beings and wished more and more to be able to wander about with those whose world seemed to be so much larger than her own 
 
 they could fly over the sea in ships and mount the high hills which 
 were far above the clouds and the lands they possessed their woods 
 and their fields stretched far away beyond the reach of her sight 
 
 there was so much that she wished to know and her sisters were unable to answer all her questions then she applied to her old 
 grandmother who knew all about the upper world which she very 
 rightly called the lands above the sea 
 
 if human beings are not drowned asked the little mermaid 
 
 can they live forever do they never die as we do here in the sea 
 
 yes replied the old lady they must also die and their term 
 of life is even shorter than ours we sometimes live to three 
 hundred years but when we cease to exist here we only become the foam on the surface of the water and we have not even a grave down here of those we love we have not immortal souls we shall never live again but like the green when once it has been cut off we can never flourish more human beings on the contrary have a soul which lives forever lives after the body has been turned to dust 
 
 it rises up through the clear pure air beyond the glittering stars 
 as we rise out of the water and behold all the land of the earth 
 so do they rise to unknown and glorious regions which we shall never 
 see 
 
 why have not we an immortal soul asked the little mermaid 
 mournfully i would give gladly all the hundreds of years that i have 
 to live to be a human being only for one day and to have the hope of 
 knowing the happiness of that glorious world above the stars 
 
 you must not think of that said the old woman we feel 
 ourselves to be much happier and much better off than human beings 
 
 so i shall die said the little mermaid and as the foam of the 
 sea i shall be driven about never again to hear the music of the 
 waves or to see the pretty flowers nor the red sun is there anything 
 i can do to win an immortal soul 
 
 no said the old woman unless a man were to love you so much 
 that you were more to him than his father or mother and if all his 
 thoughts and all his love were fixed upon you and the priest placed 
 his right hand in yours and he promised to be true to you here and 
 hereafter then his soul would glide into your body and you would 
 obtain a share in the future happiness of mankind he would give a 
 soul to you and retain his own as well but this can never happen 
 your tail which amongst us is considered so beautiful is 
 thought on earth to be quite ugly they do not know any better and 
 they think it necessary to have two stout props which they call legs 
 in order to be handsome 
 
 then the little mermaid sighed and looked sorrowfully at her 
 tail let us be happy said the old lady and dart and 
 spring about during the three hundred years that we have to live 
 which is really quite long enough after that we can rest ourselves 
 all the better this evening we are going to have a court ball 
 
 it is one of those splendid sights which we can never see on 
 earth the walls and the ceiling of the large were of thick 
 but transparent crystal may hundreds of colossal shells some of a 
 deep red others of a grass green stood on each side in rows with 
 blue fire in them which lighted up the whole saloon and shone 
 through the walls so that the sea was also illuminated innumerable 
 fishes great and small swam past the crystal walls on some of 
 them the scales glowed with a purple brilliancy and on others they 
 shone like silver and gold through the halls flowed a broad stream 
 and in it danced the mermen and the mermaids to the music of their own sweet singing no one on earth has such a lovely voice as theirs 
 
 the little mermaid sang more sweetly than them all the whole court 
 applauded her with hands and tails and for a moment her heart felt 
 quite gay for she knew she had the loveliest voice of any on earth or 
 in the sea but she soon thought again of the world above her for she 
 could not forget the charming prince nor her sorrow that she had 
 not an immortal soul like his therefore she crept away silently out 
 of her palace and while everything within was gladness and 
 song she sat in her own little garden sorrowful and alone then she 
 heard the bugle sounding through the water and thought he is 
 certainly sailing above he on whom my wishes depend and in whose 
 hands i should like to place the happiness of my life i will 
 venture all for him and to win an immortal soul while my sisters are 
 dancing in my palace i will go to the sea witch of whom i 
 have always been so much afraid but she can give me counsel and 
 help 
 
 and then the little mermaid went out from her garden and took the 
 road to the foaming whirlpools behind which the sorceress lived 
 she had never been that way before neither flowers nor grass grew 
 there nothing but bare gray sandy ground stretched out to the 
 whirlpool where the water like foaming whirled round 
 everything that it seized and cast it into the fathomless deep 
 through the midst of these crushing whirlpools the little mermaid 
 was obliged to pass to reach the dominions of the sea witch and also for a long distance the only road lay right across a quantity of warm bubbling mire called by the witch her turfmoor beyond this stood her house in the centre of a strange forest in which all the trees and flowers were polypi half animals and half plants they looked like 
 serpents with a hundred heads growing out of the ground the 
 branches were long slimy arms with fingers like flexible worms 
 moving limb after limb from the root to the top all that could be 
 reached in the sea they seized upon and held fast so that it never 
 escaped from their clutches the little mermaid was so alarmed at what she saw that she stood still and her heart beat with fear and she was very nearly turning back but she thought of the prince and of the human soul for which she longed and her courage returned she fastened her long flowing hair round her head so that the polypi 
 might not seize hold of it she laid her hands together across her 
 bosom and then she darted forward as a fish shoots through the water between the supple arms and fingers of the ugly polypi which were stretched out on each side of her she saw that each held in its grasp something it had seized with its numerous little arms as if they were iron bands the white skeletons of human beings who had perished at sea and had sunk down into the deep waters skeletons of land animals oars rudders and chests of ships were lying tightly grasped by their clinging arms even a little mermaid whom they had caught and strangled and this seemed the most shocking of all to the 
 little princess 
 
 she now came to a space of marshy ground in the wood where large 
 fat were rolling in the mire and showing their ugly 
 bodies in the midst of this spot stood a house built 
 with the bones of shipwrecked human beings there sat the sea witch 
 allowing a toad to eat from her mouth just as people sometimes feed a canary with a piece of sugar she called the ugly her 
 little chickens and allowed them to crawl all over her bosom 
 
 i know what you want said the sea witch it is very stupid 
 of you but you shall have your way and it will bring you to 
 sorrow my pretty princess you want to get rid of your tail 
 and to have two supports instead of it like human beings on earth so 
 that the young prince may fall in love with you and that you may have 
 an immortal soul and then the witch laughed so loud and 
 disgustingly that the toad and the snakes fell to the ground and lay 
 there wriggling about you are but just in time said the witch 
 for after sunrise i should not be able to help you till the 
 end of another year i will prepare a draught for you with which 
 you must swim to land tomorrow before sunrise and sit down on the 
 shore and drink it your tail will then disappear and shrink up 
 into what mankind calls legs and you will feel great pain as if a 
 sword were passing through you but all who see you will say that 
 you are the prettiest little human being they ever saw you will still 
 have the same floating gracefulness of movement and no dancer will 
 ever tread so lightly but at every step you take it will feel as if 
 you were treading upon sharp knives and that the blood must flow 
 if you will bear all this i will help you 
 
 yes i will said the little princess in a trembling voice as 
 she thought of the prince and the immortal soul 
 
 but think again said the witch for when once your shape has 
 become like a human being you can no more be a mermaid you will 
 never return through the water to your sisters or to your 
 palace again and if you do not win the love of the prince so that he 
 is willing to forget his father and mother for your sake and to 
 love you with his whole soul and allow the priest to join your 
 hands that you may be man and wife then you will never have an 
 immortal soul the first morning after he marries another your heart 
 will break and you will become foam on the crest of the waves 
 i will do it said the little mermaid and she became pale as 
 death 
 
 but i must be paid also said the witch and it is not a trifle 
 that i ask you have the sweetest voice of any who dwell here in the 
 depths of the sea and you believe that you will be able to charm 
 the prince with it also but this voice you must give to me the 
 best thing you possess will i have for the price of my draught my own blood must be mixed with it that it may be as sharp as a sword 
 
 but if you take away my voice said the little mermaid what is 
 left for me 
 
 your beautiful form your graceful walk and your expressive 
 eyes surely with these you can enchain a heart well have 
 you lost your courage put out your little tongue that i may cut it 
 off as my payment then you shall have the powerful draught 
 
 it shall be said the little mermaid then the witch placed her cauldron on the fire to prepare the magic draught 
 
 cleanliness is a good thing said she scouring the vessel 
 with snakes which she had tied together in a large knot then she 
 pricked herself in the breast and let the black blood drop into it 
 the steam that rose formed itself into such horrible shapes that no 
 one could look at them without fear every moment the witch threw 
 something else into the vessel and when it began to boil the sound 
 was like the weeping of a crocodile when at last the magic draught 
 was ready it looked like the clearest water there it is for you 
 said the witch then she cut off the tongue so that she 
 became dumb and would never again speak or sing if the polypi 
 should seize hold of you as you return through the wood said the 
 witch throw over them a few drops of the potion and their fingers 
 will be torn into a thousand pieces but the little mermaid had no 
 occasion to do this for the polypi sprang back in terror when they 
 caught sight of the glittering draught which shone in her hand like a 
 twinkling star 
 
 so she passed quickly through the wood and the marsh and 
 between the rushing whirlpools she saw that in her palace 
 the torches in the ballroom were extinguished and all within 
 asleep but she did not venture to go in to them for now she was dumb and going to leave them forever she felt as if her heart would break 
 
 she stole into the garden took a flower from the of 
 each of her sisters kissed her hand a thousand times towards the 
 palace and then rose up through the dark blue waters the sun had not risen when she came in sight of the palace and approached the beautiful marble steps but the moon shone clear and bright 
 then the little mermaid drank the magic draught and it seemed as if a 
 sword went through her delicate body she fell into a swoon and lay like one dead when the sun arose and shone over the sea she recovered and felt a sharp pain but just before her stood the 
 handsome young prince he fixed his eyes upon her so 
 earnestly that she cast down her own and then became aware that her 
 tail was gone and that she had as pretty a pair of white 
 legs and tiny feet as any little maiden could have but she had no 
 clothes so she wrapped herself in her long thick hair the prince 
 asked her who she was and where she came from and she looked at 
 him mildly and sorrowfully with her deep blue eyes but she could 
 not speak every step she took was as the witch had said it would 
 be she felt as if treading upon the points of needles or sharp 
 knives but she bore it willingly and stepped as lightly by the 
 side as a so that he and all who saw her 
 wondered at her movements she was very soon 
 arrayed in costly robes of silk and muslin and was the most beautiful 
 creature in the palace but she was dumb and could neither speak 
 nor sing 
 
 beautiful female slaves dressed in silk and gold stepped forward 
 and sang before the prince and his royal parents one sang better than 
 all the others and the prince clapped his hands and smiled at her 
 this was great sorrow to the little mermaid she knew how much more sweetly she herself could sing once and she thought oh if he 
 could only know that i have given away my voice forever to be with 
 him 
 
 the slaves next performed some pretty dances to the 
 sound of beautiful music then the little mermaid raised her lovely 
 white arms stood on the tips of her toes and glided over the 
 floor and danced as no one yet had been able to dance at each moment her beauty became more revealed and her expressive eyes appealed more directly to the heart than the songs of the slaves every one was enchanted especially the prince who called her his little foundling and she danced again quite readily to please him though each time her foot touched the floor it seemed as if she trod on sharp knives 
 the prince said she should remain with him always and she 
 received permission to sleep at his door on a velvet cushion he 
 had a dress made for her that she might accompany him on 
 horseback they rode together through the woods where the green boughs touched their shoulders and the little birds sang among the fresh leaves she climbed with the prince to the tops of high mountains and although her tender feet bled so that even her 
 steps were marked she only laughed and followed him till they 
 could see the clouds beneath them looking like a flock of birds 
 travelling to distant lands while at the palace and when 
 all the household were asleep she would go and sit on the broad 
 marble steps for it eased her burning feet to bathe them in the 
 cold and then she thought of all those below in the deep 
 once during the night her sisters came up singing 
 sorrowfully as they floated on the water she beckoned to them and 
 then they recognized her and told her how she had grieved them 
 after that they came to the same place every night and once she saw in the distance her old grandmother who had not been to the surface of the sea for many years and the old sea king her father with his crown on his head they stretched out their hands towards her but they did not venture so near the land as her sisters did 
 
 as the days passed she loved the prince more fondly and he loved 
 her as he would love a little child but it never came into his head 
 to make her his wife yet unless he married her she could not 
 receive an immortal soul and on the morning after his marriage 
 with another she would dissolve into the foam of the sea 
 
 do you not love me the best of them all the eyes of the 
 little mermaid seemed to say when he took her in his arms and kissed her fair forehead 
 
 yes you are dear to me said the prince for you have the best 
 heart and you are the most devoted to me you are like a young maiden whom i once saw but whom i shall never meet again i was in a ship that was wrecked and the waves cast me ashore near a holy temple where several young maidens performed the service the youngest of them found me on the shore and saved my life i saw her but twice and she is the only one in the world whom i could love but you are like her and you have almost driven her image out of my mind she belongs to the holy temple and my good fortune has sent you to me instead of her and we will never part 
 
 ah he knows not that it was i who saved his life thought the 
 little mermaid i carried him over the sea to the wood where the 
 temple stands i sat beneath the foam and watched till the human 
 beings came to help him i saw the pretty maiden that he loves 
 better than he loves me and the mermaid sighed deeply but she could not shed tears he says the maiden belongs to the holy temple 
 therefore she will never return to the world they will meet no 
 more while i am by his side and see him every day i will take 
 care of him and love him and give up my life for his sake 
 
 very soon it was said that the prince must marry and that the 
 beautiful daughter of a neighboring king would be his wife for a fine 
 ship was being fitted out although the prince gave out that he merely 
 intended to pay a visit to the king it was generally supposed that he 
 really went to see his daughter a great company were to go with 
 him the little mermaid smiled and shook her head she knew the 
 thoughts better than any of the others 
 
 i must travel he had said to her i must see this beautiful 
 princess my parents desire it but they will not oblige me to bring 
 her home as my bride i cannot love her she is not like the beautiful 
 maiden in the temple whom you resemble if i were forced to choose 
 a bride i would rather choose you my dumb foundling with those 
 expressive eyes and then he kissed her rosy mouth played with her 
 long waving hair and laid his head on her heart while she dreamed of 
 human happiness and an immortal soul you are not afraid of the 
 sea my dumb child said he as they stood on the deck of the noble 
 ship which was to carry them to the country of the neighboring king 
 and then he told her of storm and of calm of strange fishes in the 
 deep beneath them and of what the divers had seen there and she 
 smiled at his descriptions for she knew better than any one what 
 wonders were at the bottom of the sea 
 
 in the moonlight when all on board were asleep excepting the man 
 at the helm who was steering she sat on the deck gazing down 
 through the clear water she thought she could distinguish her 
 castle and upon it her aged grandmother with the silver 
 crown on her head looking through the rushing tide at the keel of the 
 vessel then her sisters came up on the waves and gazed at her 
 mournfully wringing their white hands she beckoned to them and 
 smiled and wanted to tell them how happy and well off she was but 
 the approached and when her sisters dived down he thought it was only the foam of the sea which he saw 
 
 the next morning the ship sailed into the harbor of a beautiful 
 town belonging to the king whom the prince was going to visit the 
 church bells were ringing and from the high towers sounded a flourish of trumpets and soldiers with flying colors and glittering bayonets lined the rocks through which they passed every day was a festival balls and entertainments followed one another 
 
 but the princess had not yet appeared people said that she was 
 being brought up and educated in a religious house where she was 
 learning every royal virtue at last she came then the little 
 mermaid who was very anxious to see whether she was really beautiful was obliged to acknowledge that she had never seen a more perfect vision of beauty her skin was delicately fair and beneath her long dark her laughing blue eyes shone with truth and purity 
 
 it was you said the prince who saved my life when i lay 
 dead on the beach and he folded his blushing bride in his arms oh i am too happy said he to the little mermaid my fondest hopes are all fulfilled you will rejoice at my happiness for your devotion to me is great and sincere 
 
 the little mermaid kissed his hand and felt as if her heart 
 were already broken his wedding morning would bring death to her and she would change into the foam of the sea all the church bells 
 rung and the heralds rode about the town proclaiming the betrothal 
 perfumed oil was burning in costly silver lamps on every altar the 
 priests waved the censers while the bride and bridegroom joined their 
 hands and received the blessing of the bishop the little mermaid 
 dressed in silk and gold held up the train but her ears 
 heard nothing of the festive music and her eyes saw not the holy 
 ceremony she thought of the night of death which was coming to her 
 and of all she had lost in the world on the same evening the bride 
 and bridegroom went on board ship cannons were roaring flags waving and in the centre of the ship a costly tent of purple and gold had been erected it contained elegant couches for the reception of the bridal pair during the night the ship with swelling sails and a 
 favorable wind glided away smoothly and lightly over the calm sea 
 when it grew dark a number of colored lamps were lit and the 
 sailors danced merrily on the deck the little mermaid could not 
 help thinking of her first rising out of the sea when she had seen 
 similar festivities and joys and she joined in the dance poised 
 herself in the air as a swallow when he pursues his prey and all 
 present cheered her with wonder she had never danced so elegantly 
 before her tender feet felt as if cut with sharp knives but she 
 cared not for it a sharper pang had pierced through her heart she 
 knew this was the last evening she should ever see the prince for 
 whom she had forsaken her kindred and her home she had given up her beautiful voice and suffered pain daily for him while 
 he knew nothing of it this was the last evening that she would 
 breathe the same air with him or gaze on the starry sky and the 
 deep sea an eternal night without a thought or a dream awaited her 
 she had no soul and now she could never win one all was joy and 
 gayety on board ship till long after midnight she laughed and 
 danced with the rest while the thoughts of death were in her heart 
 the prince kissed his beautiful bride while she played with his raven 
 hair till they went to rest in the splendid tent then all 
 became still on board the ship the helmsman alone awake stood at 
 the helm the little mermaid leaned her white arms on the edge of 
 the vessel and looked towards the east for the first blush of 
 morning for that first ray of dawn that would bring her death she 
 saw her sisters rising out of the flood they were as pale as herself 
 but their long beautiful hair waved no more in the wind and had 
 been cut off 
 
 we have given our hair to the witch said they to obtain 
 help for you that you may not die she has given us a knife 
 here it is see it is very sharp before the sun rises you must plunge 
 it into the heart of the prince when the warm blood falls upon your 
 feet they will grow together again and form into a tail and 
 you will be once more a mermaid and return to us to live out your 
 three hundred years before you die and change into the salt sea 
 foam haste then he or you must die before sunrise our old 
 grandmother moans so for you that her white hair is falling off 
 from sorrow as ours fell under the scissors kill the 
 prince and come back hasten do you not see the first red streaks 
 in the sky in a few minutes the sun will rise and you must die and 
 then they sighed deeply and mournfully and sank down beneath the 
 waves 
 
 the little mermaid drew back the crimson curtain of the tent 
 and beheld the fair bride with her head resting on the 
 breast she bent down and kissed his fair brow then looked at the sky on which the rosy dawn grew brighter and brighter then she glanced at the sharp knife and again fixed her eyes on the prince who whispered the name of his bride in his dreams she was in his thoughts and the knife trembled in the hand of the little mermaid then she flung it far away from her into the waves the water turned red where it fell and the drops that spurted up looked like blood she cast one more lingering glance at the prince and then threw herself from the ship into the sea and thought her body was 
 dissolving into foam the sun rose above the waves and his warm 
 rays fell on the cold foam of the little mermaid who did not feel 
 as if she were dying she saw the bright sun and all around her 
 floated hundreds of transparent beautiful beings she could see 
 through them the white sails of the ship and the red clouds in the 
 sky their speech was melodious but too ethereal to be heard by 
 mortal ears as they were also unseen by mortal eyes the little 
 mermaid perceived that she had a body like theirs and that she 
 continued to rise higher and higher out of the foam where am i 
 asked she and her voice sounded ethereal as the voice of those who 
 were with her no earthly music could imitate it 
 
 among the daughters of the air answered one of them a mermaid 
 has not an immortal soul nor can she obtain one unless she wins the 
 love of a human being on the power of another hangs her eternal 
 destiny but the daughters of the air although they do not possess an 
 immortal soul can by their good deeds procure one for themselves 
 we fly to warm countries and cool the sultry air that destroys 
 mankind with the pestilence we carry the perfume of the flowers to 
 spread health and restoration after we have striven for three hundred 
 years to all the good in our power we receive an immortal soul and 
 take part in the happiness of mankind you poor little mermaid 
 have tried with your whole heart to do as we are doing you have 
 suffered and endured and raised yourself to the by your 
 good deeds and now by striving for three hundred years in the same 
 way you may obtain an immortal soul 
 
 the little mermaid lifted her glorified eyes towards the sun 
 and felt them for the first time filling with tears on the ship in 
 which she had left the prince there were life and noise she saw 
 him and his beautiful bride searching for her sorrowfully they 
 gazed at the pearly foam as if they knew she had thrown herself 
 into the waves unseen she kissed the forehead of her bride and 
 fanned the prince and then mounted with the other children of the air 
 to a rosy cloud that floated through the aether 
 
 after three hundred years thus shall we float into the kingdom 
 of heaven said she and we may even get there sooner whispered 
 one of her companions unseen we can enter the houses of men where there are children and for every day on which we find a good child who is the joy of his parents and deserves their love our time of probation is shortened the child does not know when we fly through the room that we smile with joy at his good conduct for we can count one year less of our three hundred years but when we see a naughty or a wicked child we shed tears of sorrow and for every tear a day is added to our time of trial
