 by order of the ministry of magic 
 
 
 
 dolores jane umbridge high inquisitor has replaced 
 
 albus dumbledore as head of hogwarts school of 
 
 witchcraft and wizardry 
 
 
 
 the above is in accordance with educational decree number 
 
 
 
 signed cornelius oswald fudge minister for magic 
 
 the notices had gone up all around the school overnight but they did not explain how every single person within the castle seemed to know that dumbledore had overcome two aurors the high inquisitor the minister for magic and his junior assistant to escape no matter where harry went within the castle the sole topic of conversation was flight and though some of the details may have gone awry in the retelling harry overheard one girl assuring another that fudge was now lying in st with a pumpkin for a head it was surprising how accurate the rest of their information was everybody knew for instance that harry and marietta were the only students to have witnessed the scene in office and as marietta was now in the hospital wing harry found himself besieged with requests to give a account 
 
 dumbledore will be back before long said ernie macmillan confidently on the way back from herbology after listening intently to story they keep him away in our second year and they be able to this time the fat friar told me he dropped his voice conspiratorially so that harry ron and hermione had to lean closer to him to hear that umbridge tried to get back into his office last night after searched the castle and grounds for him get past the gargoyle the office has sealed itself against her ernie smirked apparently she had a right little tantrum 
 
 oh i expect she really fancied herself sitting up there in the office said hermione viciously as they walked up the stone steps into the entrance hall lording it over all the other teachers the stupid old 
 
 now do you really want to finish that sentence granger 
 
 draco malfoy had slid out from behind the door closely followed by crabbe and goyle his pale pointed face was alight w th malice 
 
 afraid going to have to dock a few points from gryffincor and hufflepuff he drawled 
 
 only teachers who can dock points from houses malfoy said ernie at once 
 
 yeah prefects too remember snarled ron 
 
 i know prefects dock points weasel king sneered maltby crabbe and goyle sniggered but members of the inquisitorial squad 
 
 the what said hermione sharply 
 
 the inquisitorial squad granger said malfoy pointing towards a tiny silver i on his robes just beneath his badge a select group of students who are supportive of the ministry of magic by professor umbridge anyway members of the inquisitorial squad do have the power to dock points so granger have five from you for being rude about our new headmistress macmillan five for contradicting me five because i like you potter weasley your untucked so have another five for that oh yeah i forgot a mudblood granger so ten off for that 
 
 ron pulled out his wand but hermione pushed it away whispering 
 
 wise move granger breathed malfoy new head new times be good now potty weasel king 
 
 laughing heartily he strode away with crabbe and goyle 
 
 he was bluffing said ernie looking appalled he be allowed to dock points that would be ridiculous it would completely undermine the prefect system 
 
 but harry ron and hermione had turned automatically towards the giant set in niches along the wall behind them which recorded the gryffindor and ravenclaw had been neck and neck in the lead that morning even as they watched stones flew upwards reducing the amounts in the lower bulbs in fact the only glass that seemed unchanged was the one of slytherin 
 
 noticed have you said voice 
 
 he and george had just come down the marble staircase and joined harry ron hermione and ernie in front of the 
 
 malfoy just docked us all about fifty points said harry furiously as they watched several more stones fly upwards from the gryffindor 
 
 yeah montague tried to do us during break said george 
 
 what do you mean tried said ron quickly 
 
 he never managed to get all the words out said fred due to the fact that we forced him into that vanishing cabinet on the first floor 
 
 hermione looked very shocked 
 
 but get into terrible trouble 
 
 not until montague reappears and that could take weeks i dunno where we sent him said fred coolly anyway decided we care about getting into trouble any more 
 
 have you ever asked hermione 
 
 course we have said george never been expelled have we 
 
 always known where to draw the line said fred 
 
 we might have put a toe across it occasionally said george 
 
 but always stopped short of causing real mayhem said fred 
 
 but now said ron tentatively 
 
 well now said george 
 
 what with dumbledore gone said fred 
 
 we reckon a bit of mayhem said george 
 
 is exactly what our dear new head deserves said fred 
 
 you whispered hermione you really love a reason to expel you 
 
 you get it hermione do you said fred smiling at her we care about staying any more walk out right now if we determined to do our bit for dumbledore first so anyway he checked his watch phase one is about to begin get in the great hall for lunch if i were you that way the teachers will see you have had anything to do with it 
 
 anything to do with what said hermione anxiously 
 
 see said george run along now 
 
 fred and george turned away and disappeared into the swelling crowd descending the stairs towards lunch looking highly disconcerted ernie muttered something about unfinished transfiguration homework and scurried away 
 
 i think we should get out of here you know said hermione nervously just in case 
 
 yeah all right said ron and the three of them moved towards the doors to the great hall but harry had barely glimpsed the ceiling of scudding white clouds when somebody tapped him on the shoulder and turning he found himself almost with filch the caretaker he took several hasty steps backwards filch was best viewed at a distance 
 
 the headmistress would like to see you potter he leered 
 
 i do it said harry stupidly thinking of whatever fred and george were planning jowls wobbled with silent laughter 
 
 guilty conscience eh he wheezed follow me 
 
 harry glanced back at ron and hermione who were both looking worried he shrugged and followed filch back into the entrance hall against the tide of hungry students 
 
 filch seemed to be in an extremely good mood he hummed creakily under his breath as they climbed the marble staircase as they reached the first landing he said things are changing around here potter 
 
 noticed said harry coldly 
 
 yerse been telling dumbledore for years and years too soft with you all said filch chuckling nastily you filthy little beasts would never have dropped stink pellets if known i had it in my power to whip you raw would you now nobody would have thought of throwing fanged frisbees down the corridors if i strung you up by the ankles in my office would they but when educational decree number comes in potter be allowed to do them things and asked the minister to sign an order for the expulsion of peeves oh things are going to be very different around here with her in charge 
 
 umbridge had obviously gone to some lengths to get filch on her side harry thought and the worst of it was that he would probably prove an important weapon his knowledge of the secret passageways and hiding places was probably second only to that of the weasley twins 
 
 here we are he said leering down at harry as he rapped three times on professor door and pushed it open the potter boy to see you 
 
 office so very familiar to harry from his many detentions was the same as usual except for the large wooden block lying across the front of her desk on which golden letters spelled the word headmistress also his firebolt and fred and cleansweeps which he saw with a pang were chained and padlocked to a stout iron peg in the wall behind the desk 
 
 umbridge was sitting behind the desk busily scribbling on some of her pink parchment but she looked up and smiled widely at their entrance 
 
 thank you argus she said sweetly 
 
 not at all not at all said filch bowing as low as his rheumatism would permit and exiting backwards 
 
 sit said umbridge curtly pointing towards a chair harry sat she continued to scribble for a few moments he watched some of the foul kittens gambolling around the plates over her head wondering what fresh horror she had in store for him 
 
 well now she said finally setting down her quill and surveying him complacently like a toad about to swallow a particularly juicy fly what would you like to drink 
 
 what said harry quite sure he had misheard her 
 
 to drink mr potter she said smiling still more widely tea coffee pumpkin juice 
 
 as she named each drink she gave her short wand a wave and a cup or glass of it appeared on her desk 
 
 nothing thank you said harry 
 
 i wish you to have a drink with me she said her voice becoming dangerously sweet choose one 
 
 fine tea then said harry shrugging 
 
 she got up and made quite a performance of adding milk with her back to him she then bustled around the desk with it smiling in a sinisterly sweet fashion 
 
 there she said handing it to him drink it before it gets cold you well now mr potter i thought we ought to have a little chat after the distressing events of last night 
 
 he said nothing she settled herself back into her seat and waited when several long moments had passed in silence she said gaily not drinking up 
 
 he raised the cup to his lips and then just as suddenly lowered it one of the horrible painted kittens behind umbridge had great round blue eyes just like magical one and it had just occurred to harry what would say if he ever heard that harry had drunk anything offered by a known enemy 
 
 the matter said umbridge who was still watching him closely do you want sugar 
 
 no said harry 
 
 he raised the cup to his lips again and pretended to take a sip though keeping his mouth tightly closed smile widened 
 
 good she whispered very good now then she leaned forwards a little where is albus dumbledore 
 
 no idea said harry promptly 
 
 drink up drink up she said still smiling now mr potter let us not play childish games i know that you know where he has gone you and dumbledore have been in this together from the beginning consider your position mr potter 
 
 i know where he is harry repeated 
 
 he pretended to drink again she was watching him very closely 
 
 very well she said though she looked displeased in that case you will kindly tell me the whereabouts of sirius black 
 
 stomach turned over and his hand holding the teacup shook so that it rattled in its saucer he tilted the cup to his mouth with his lips pressed together so that some of the hot liquid trickled down on to his robes 
 
 i know he said a little too quickly 
 
 mr potter said umbridge let me remind you that it was i who almost caught the criminal black in the gryffindor fire in october i know perfectly well it was you he was meeting and if i had had any proof neither of you would be at large today i promise you i repeat mr potter where is sirius black 
 
 no idea said harry loudly got a clue 
 
 they stared at each other so long that harry felt his eyes watering then umbridge stood up 
 
 very well potter i will take your word for it this time but be warned the might of the ministry stands behind me all channels of communication in and out of this school are being monitored a floo network regulator is keeping watch over every fire in hogwartsexcept my own of course my inquisitorial squad is opening and reading all owl post entering and leaving the castle and mr filch is observing all secret passages in and out of the castle if i find a shred of evidence 
 
 boom 
 
 the very floor of the office shook umbridge slipped sideways clutching her desk for support and looking shocked 
 
 what was 
 
 she was gazing towards the door harry took the opportunity to empty his cup of tea into the nearest vase of dried flowers he could hear people running and screaming several floors below 
 
 back to lunch you go potter cried umbridge raising her wand and dashing out of the office harry gave her a few seconds start then hurried after her to see what the source of all the uproar was 
 
 it was not difficult to find one floor down pandemonium reigned somebody and harry had a very shrewd idea who had set off what seemed to be an enormous crate of enchanted fireworks 
 
 dragons comprised entirely of green and gold sparks were soaring up and down the corridors emitting loud fiery blasts and bangs as they went catherine wheels five feet in diameter were whizzing lethally through the air like so many flying saucers rockets with long tails of brilliant silver stars were ricocheting off the walls sparklers were writing swear words in midair of their own accord firecrackers were exploding like mines everywhere harry looked and instead of burning themselves out fading from sight or fizzling to a halt these pyrotechnical miracles seemed to be gaining in energy and momentum the longer he watched 
 
 filch and umbridge were standing apparently transfixed in horror halfway down the stairs as harry watched one of the larger catherine wheels seemed to decide that what it needed was more room to manoeuvre it whirled towards umbridge and filch with a sinister wheeeeeeeeee they both yelled with fright and ducked and it soared straight out of the window behind them and off across the grounds meanwhile several of the dragons and a large purple bat that was smoking ominously took advantage of the open door at the end of the corridor to escape towards the second floor 
 
 hurry filch hurry shrieked umbridge be all over the school unless we do somethingstupefy 
 
 a jet of red light shot out of the end of her wand and hit one of the rockets instead of freezing in midair it exploded with such force that it blasted a hole in a painting of a witch in the middle of a meadow she ran for it just in time reappearing seconds later squashed into the next painting where a couple of wizards playing cards stood up hastily to make room for her 
 
 stun them filch shouted umbridge angrily for all the world as though it had been his incantation 
 
 right you are headmistress wheezed filch who as a squib could no more have stunned the fireworks than swallowed them he dashed to a nearby cupboard pulled out a broom and began swatting at the fireworks in midair within seconds the head of the broom was ablaze 
 
 harry had seen enough laughing he ducked down low ran to a door he knew was concealed behind a tapestry a little way along the corridor and slipped through it to find fred and george hiding just behind it listening to umbridge and yells and quaking with suppressed mirth 
 
 impressive harry said quietly grinning very impressive put dr filibuster out of business no problem 
 
 cheers whispered george wiping tears of laughter from his face oh i hope she tries vanishing them next they multiply by ten every time you try 
 
 the fireworks continued to burn and to spread all over the school that afternoon though they caused plenty of disruption particularly the firecrackers the other teachers seem to mind them very much 
 
 dear dear said professor mcgonagall sardonically as one of the dragons soared around her classroom emitting loud bangs and exhaling flame miss brown would you mind running along to the headmistress and informing her that we have an escaped firework in our classroom 
 
 the upshot of it all was that professor umbridge spent her first afternoon as headmistress running all over the school answering the summonses of the other teachers none of whom seemed able to rid their rooms of the fireworks without her when the final bell rang and they were heading back to gryffindor tower with their bags harry saw with immense satisfaction a dishevelled and umbridge tottering from professor classroom 
 
 thank you so much professor said professor flitwick in his squeaky little voice i could have got rid of the sparklers myself of course but i sure whether or not i had the authority 
 
 beaming he closed his classroom door in her snarling face 
 
 fred and george were heroes that night in the gryffindor common room even hermione fought her way through the excited crowd to congratulate them 
 
 they were wonderful fireworks she said admiringly 
 
 thanks said george looking both surprised and pleased weasleys wildfire only thing is we used our whole stock going to have to start again from scratch now 
 
 it was worth it though said fred who was taking orders from clamouring gryffindors if you want to add your name to the waiting list hermione five galleons for your basic blaze box and twenty for the deflagration deluxe 
 
 hermione returned to the table where harry and ron were sitting staring at their schoolbags as though hoping their homework would spring out and start doing itself 
 
 oh why we have a night off said hermione brightly as a weasley rocket zoomed past the window after all the easter holidays start on friday have plenty of time then 
 
 are you feeling all right ron asked staring at her in disbelief 
 
 now you mention it said hermione happily know i think feeling a bit rebellious 
 
 harry could still hear the distant bangs of escaped firecrackers when he and ron went up to bed an hour later and as he got undressed a sparkler floated past the tower still resolutely spelling out the word poo 
 
 he got into bed yawning with his glasses off the occasional firework passing the window had become blurred looking like sparkling clouds beautiful and mysterious against the black sky he turned on to his side wondering how umbridge was feeling about her first day in job and how fudge would react when he heard that the school had spent most of the day in a state of advanced disruption smiling to himself harry closed his eyes 
 
 the whizzes and bangs of escaped fireworks in the grounds seemed to be growing more distant or perhaps he was simply speeding away from them 
 
 he had fallen right into the corridor leading to the department of mysteries he was speeding towards the plain black door let it open let it open 
 
 it did he was inside the circular room lined with doors he crossed it placed his hand on an identical door and it swung inwards 
 
 now he was in a long rectangular room full of an odd mechanical clicking there were dancing flecks of light on the walls but he did not pause to investigate he had to go on 
 
 there was a door at the far end it too opened at his touch 
 
 and now he was in a dimly lit room as high and wide as a church full of nothing but rows and rows of towering shelves each laden with small dusty spheres now heart was beating fast with excitement he knew where to go he ran forwards but his footsteps made no noise in the enormous deserted room 
 
 there was something in this room he wanted very very much 
 
 something he wanted or somebody else wanted 
 
 his scar was hurting 
 
 bang 
 
 harry awoke instantly confused and angry the dark dormitory was full of the sound of laughter 
 
 cool said seamus who was silhouetted against the window i think one of those catherine wheels hit a rocket and like they mated come and see 
 
 harry heard ron and dean scramble out of bed for a better look he lay quite still and silent while the pain in his scar subsided and disappointment washed over him he felt as though a wonderful treat had been snatched from him at the very last moment he had got so close that time 
 
 glittering pink and silver winged piglets were now soaring past the windows of gryffindor tower harry lay and listened to the appreciative whoops of gryffindors in the dormitories below them his stomach gave a sickening jolt as he remembered that he had occlumency the following evening 
 
 harry spent the whole of the next day dreading what snape was going to say if he found out how much further into the department of mysteries harry had penetrated during his last dream with a surge of guilt he realised that he had not practised occlumency once since their last lesson there had been too much going on since dumbledore had left he was sure he would not have been able to empty his mind even if he had tried he doubted however whether snape would accept that excuse 
 
 he attempted a little practice during classes that day but it was no good hermione kept asking him what was wrong whenever he fell silent trying to rid himself of all thought and emotion and after all the best moment to empty his brain was not while teachers were firing revision questions at the class 
 
 resigned to the worst he set off for office after dinner halfway across the entrance hall however cho came hurrying up to him 
 
 over here said harry glad of a reason to postpone his meeting with snape and beckoning her across to the corner of the entrance hall where the giant stood was now almost empty are you ok umbridge been asking you about the da has she 
 
 oh no said cho hurriedly no it was only well i just wanted to say harry i never dreamed marietta would tell 
 
 yeah well said harry moodily he did feel cho might have chosen her friends a bit more carefully it was small consolation that the last he had heard marietta was still up in the hospital wing and madam pomfrey had not been able to make the slightest improvement to her pimples 
 
 a lovely person really said cho she just made a mistake 
 
 harry looked at her incredulously 
 
 a lovely person who made a sold us all out including you 
 
 well we all got away we said cho pleadingly you know her mum works for the ministry really difficult for her 
 
 dad works for the ministry too harry said furiously and in case you noticed he got sneak written across his face 
 
 that was a really horrible trick of hermione said cho fiercely she should have told us jinxed that list 
 
 i think it was a brilliant idea said harry coldly cho flushed and her eyes grew brighter 
 
 oh yes i forgot of course if it was darling hermiones idea 
 
 start crying again said harry warningly 
 
 i going to she shouted 
 
 yeah well good he said got enough to cope with at the moment 
 
 go and cope with it then cho said furiously turning on her heel and stalking off 
 
 fuming harry descended the stairs to dungeon and though he knew from experience how much easier it would be for snape to penetrate his mind if he arrived angry and resentful he succeeded in nothing but thinking of a few more things he should have said to cho about marietta before reaching the dungeon door 
 
 late potter said snape coldly as harry closed the door behind him 
 
 snape was standing with his back to harry removing as usual certain of his thoughts and placing them carefully in pensieve he dropped the last silvery strand into the stone basin and turned to face harry 
 
 so he said have you been practising 
 
 yes harry lied looking carefully at one of the legs of desk 
 
 well soon find out we said snape smoothly wand out potter 
 
 harry moved into his usual position facing snape with the desk between them his heart was pumping last with anger at cho and anxiety about how much snape was about to extract from his mind 
 
 on the count of three then said snape lazily onetwo 
 
 office door banged open and draco malfoy sped in 
 
 professor snape sirohsorry 
 
 malfoy was looking at snape and harry in some surprise 
 
 all right draco said snape lowering his wand potter is here for a little remedial potions 
 
 harry had not seen malfoy look so gleeful since umbridge had turned up to inspect hagrid 
 
 i know he said leering at harry who knew his face was burning he would have given a great deal to be able to shout the truth at malfoyor even better to hit him with a good curse 
 
 well draco what is it asked snape 
 
 professor umbridge sirshe needs your help said malfoy 
 
 found montague sir turned up jammed inside a toilet on the fourth floor 
 
 how did he get in there demanded snape 
 
 i know sir a bit confused 
 
 very well very well potter said snape we shall resume this lesson tomorrow evening 
 
 he turned and swept from his office malfoy mouthed remedial potions at harry behind back before following him 
 
 seething harry replaced his wand inside his robes and made to leave the room at least he had more hours in which to practise he knew he ought to feel grateful for the narrow escape though it was hard that it came at the expense of malfoy telling the whole school that he needed remedial potions 
 
 he was at the office door when he saw it a patch of shivering light dancing on the doorframe he stopped and stood looking at it reminded of something then he remembered it was a little like the lights he had seen in his dream last night the lights in the second room he had walked through on his journey through the department of mysteries 
 
 he turned around the light was coming from the pensieve sitting on desk the contents were ebbing and swirling within thoughts things he did not want harry to see if he broke through defences accidentally 
 
 harry gazed at the pensieve curiosity welling inside him what was it that snape was so keen to hide from harry 
 
 the silvery lights shivered on the wall harry took two steps towards the desk thinking hard could it possibly be information about the department of mysteries that snape was determined to keep from him 
 
 harry looked over his shoulder his heart now pumping harder and faster than ever how long would it take snape to release montague from the toilet would he come straight back to his office afterwards or accompany montague to the hospital wing surely the latter montague was captain of the slytherin quidditch team snape would want to make sure he was all right 
 
 harry walked the remaining few feet to the pensieve and stood over it gazing into its depths he hesitated listening then pulled out his wand again the office and the corridor beyond were completely silent he gave the contents of the pensieve a small prod with the end of his wand 
 
 the silvery stuff within began to swirl very fast harry leaned forwards over it and saw that it had become transparent he was once again looking down into a room as though through a circular window in the ceiling in fact unless he was much mistaken he was looking down into the great hall 
 
 his breath was actually fogging the surface of thoughts his brain seemed to be in limbo it would be insane to do the thing he was so strongly tempted to do he was trembling snape could be back at any moment but harry thought of anger of jeering face and a reckless daring seized him 
 
 he took a great gulp of breath and plunged his face into the surface of thoughts at once the floor of the office lurched tipping harry into the pensieve 
 
 he was falling through cold blackness spinning furiously as he went and then 
 
 he was standing in the middle of the great hall but the four house tables were gone instead there were more than a hundred smaller tables all facing the same way at each of which sat a student head bent low scribbling on a roll of parchment the only sound was the scratching of quills and the occasional rustle as somebody adjusted their parchment it was clearly exam time 
 
 sunshine was streaming through the high windows on to the bent heads which shone chestnut and copper and gold in the bright light harry looked around carefully snape had to be here somewhere this was his memory 
 
 and there he was at a table right behind harry harry stared had a stringy pallid look about him like a plant kept in the dark his hair was lank and greasy and was flopping on to the table his hooked nose barely half an inch from the surface of the parchment as he scribbled harry moved around behind snape and read the heading of the examination paper defence against the dark artsordinary wizarding level 
 
 so snape had to be fifteen or sixteen around own age his hand was flying across the parchment he had written at least a foot more than his closest neighbours and yet his writing was minuscule and cramped 
 
 five more minutes 
 
 the voice made harry jump turning he saw the top of professor head moving between the desks a short distance away professor flitwick was walking past a boy with untidy black hair very untidy black hair 
 
 harry moved so quickly that had he been solid he would have knocked desks flying instead he seemed to slide dreamlike across two aisles and up a third the back of the head drew nearer and he was straightening up now putting down his quill pulling his roll of parchment towards him so as to reread what he had written 
 
 harry stopped in front of the desk and gazed down at his father 
 
 excitement exploded in the pit of his stomach it was as though he was looking at himself but with deliberate mistakes eyes were hazel his nose was slightly longer than and there was no scar on his forehead but they had the same thin face same mouth same eyebrows hair stuck up at the back exactly as did his hands could have been and harry could tell that when james stood up they would be within an inch of each other in height 
 
 james yawned hugely and rumpled up his hair making it even messier than it had been then with a glance towards professor flitwick he turned in his seat and grinned at a boy sitting four seats behind him 
 
 with another shock of excitement harry saw sirius give james the sirius was lounging in his chair at his ease tilting it back on two legs he was very his dark hair fell into his eyes with a sort of casual elegance neither nor could ever have achieved and a girl sitting behind him was eyeing him hopefully though he seem to have noticed and two seats along from this stomach gave another pleasurable squirm was remus lupin he looked rather pale and peaky was the full moon approaching and was absorbed in the exam as he reread his answers he scratched his chin with the end of his quill frowning slightly 
 
 so that meant wormtail had to be around here somewhere too and sure enough harry spotted him within seconds a small boy with a pointed nose wormtail looked anxious he was chewing his fingernails staring down at his paper scuffing the ground with his toes every now and then he glanced hopefully at his paper harry stared at wormtail for a moment then back at james who was now doodling on a bit of scrap parchment he had drawn a snitch and was now tracing the letters what did they stand for 
 
 quills down please squeaked professor flitwick that means you too stebbins please remain seated while i collect your parchment accio 
 
 over a hundred rolls of parchment zoomed into the air and into professor outstretched arms knocking him backwards off his feet several people laughed a couple of students at the front desks got up took hold of professor flitwick beneath the elbows and lifted him back on to his feet 
 
 thank you thank you panted professor flitwick very well everybody free to go 
 
 harry looked down at his father who had hastily crossed out the he had been embellishing jumped to his feet stuffed his quill and the exam paper into his bag which he slung over his back and stood waiting for sirius to join him 
 
 harry looked around and glimpsed snape a short way away moving between the tables towards the doors to the entrance hall still absorbed in his own exam paper yet angular he walked in a twitchy manner that recalled a spider and his oily hair was jumping about his face 
 
 a gang of chattering girls separated snape from james sirius and lupin and by planting himself in their midst harry managed to keep snape in sight while straining his ears to catch the voices of james and his friends 
 
 did you like question ten moony asked sirius as they emerged into the entrance hall 
 
 loved it said lupin briskly give five signs that identify the question 
 
 think you managed to get all the signs said james in tones of mock concern 
 
 think i did said lupin seriously as they joined the crowd thronging around the front doors eager to get out into the sunlit grounds one sitting on my chair two wearing my clothes three his remus lupin 
 
 wormtail was the only one who laugh 
 
 i got the snout shape the pupils of the eyes and the tufted tail he said anxiously but i think what else 
 
 how thick are you wormtail said james impatiently you run round with a werewolf once a month 
 
 keep your voice down implored lupin 
 
 harry looked anxiously behind him again snape remained close by still buried in his exam questionsbut this was memory and harry was sure that if snape chose to wander off in a different direction once outside in the grounds he harry would not be able to follow james any further to his intense relief however when james and his three friends strode off down the lawn towards the lake snape followed still poring over the exam paper and apparently with no fixed idea of where he was going by keeping a little ahead of him harry managed to maintain a close watch on james and the others 
 
 well i thought that paper was a piece of cake he heard sirius say be surprised if i get outstanding on it at least 
 
 me too said james he put his hand in his pocket and took out a struggling golden snitch 
 
 you get that 
 
 nicked it said james casually he started playing with the snitch allowing it to fly as much as a foot away before seizing it again his reflexes were excellent wormtail watched him in awe 
 
 they stopped in the shade of the very same beech tree on the edge of the lake where harry ron and hermione had once spent a sunday finishing their homework and threw themselves down on the grass harry looked over his shoulder yet again and saw to his delight that snape had settled himself on the grass in the dense shadow of a clump of bushes he was as deeply immersed in the owl paper as ever which left harry free to sit down on the grass between the beech and the bushes and watch the foursome under the tree the sunlight was dazzling on the smooth surface of the lake on the bank of which the group of laughing girls who had just left the great hall were sitting with their shoes and socks off cooling their feet in the water 
 
 lupin had pulled out a book and was reading sirius stared around at the students milling over the grass looking rather haughty and bored but very handsomely so james was still playing with the snitch letting it zoom further and further away almost escaping but always grabbed at the last second wormtail was watching him with his mouth open every time james made a particularly difficult catch wormtail gasped and applauded after five minutes of this harry wondered why james tell wormtail to get a grip on himself but james seemed to be enjoying the attention harry noticed that his father had a habit of rumpling up his hair as though to keep it from getting too tidy and he also kept looking over at the girls by the edge 
 
 put that away will you said sirius finally as james made a fine catch and wormtail let out a cheer before wormtail wets himself with excitement 
 
 wormtail turned slightly pink but james grinned 
 
 if it bothers you he said stuffing the snitch back in his pocket harry had the distinct impression that sirius was the only one for whom james would have stopped showing off 
 
 bored said sirius wish it was full moon 
 
 you might said lupin darkly from behind his book still got transfiguration if bored you could test me here and he held out his book 
 
 but sirius snorted i need to look at that rubbish i know it all 
 
 liven you up padfoot said james quietly look who it is head turned he became very still like a dog that has scented a rabbit 
 
 excellent he said softly snivellus 
 
 harry turned to see what sirius was looking at 
 
 snape was on his feet again and was stowing the owl paper in his bag as he left the shadows of the bushes and set off across the grass sirius and james stood up 
 
 lupin and wormtail remained sitting lupin was still staring down at his book though his eyes were not moving and a faint frown line had appeared between his eyebrows wormtail was looking from sirius and james to snape with a look of avid anticipation on his face 
 
 all right snivellus said james loudly 
 
 snape reacted so fast it was as though he had been expecting an attack dropping his bag he plunged his hand inside his robes and his wand was halfway into the air when james shouted expelliarmus 
 
 wand flew twelve feet into the air and fell with a little thud in the grass behind him sirius let out a bark of laughter 
 
 impedimenta he said pointing his wand at snape who was knocked off his feet halfway through a dive towards his own fallen wand 
 
 students all around had turned to watch some of them had got to their feet and were edging nearer some looked apprehensive others entertained 
 
 snape lay panting on the ground james and sirius advanced on him wands raised james glancing over his shoulder at the girls at the edge as he went wormtail was on his feet now watching hungrily edging around lupin to get a clearer view 
 
 the exam go snivelly said james 
 
 i was watching him his nose was touching the parchment said sirius viciously be great grease marks all over it they be able to read a word 
 
 several people watching laughed snape was clearly unpopular wormtail sniggered shrilly snape was trying to get up but the jinx was still operating on him he was struggling as though bound by invisible ropes 
 
 youwait he panted staring up at james with an expression of purest loathing you wait 
 
 wait for what said sirius coolly you going to do snivelly wipe your nose on us 
 
 snape let out a stream of mixed swear words and hexes but with his wand ten feet away nothing happened 
 
 wash out your mouth said james coldly scourgify 
 
 pink soap bubbles streamed from mouth at once the froth was covering his lips making him gag choking him 
 
 leave him alone 
 
 james and sirius looked round free hand immediately jumped to his hair 
 
 it was one of the girls from the lake edge she had thick dark red hair that fell to her shoulders and startlingly green eyes 
 
 mother 
 
 all right evans said james and the tone of his voice was suddenly pleasant deeper more mature 
 
 leave him alone lily repeated she was looking at james with every sign of great dislike he done to you 
 
 well said james appearing to deliberate the point more the fact that he exists if you know what i mean 
 
 many of the surrounding students laughed sirius and wormtail included but lupin still apparently intent on his book and nor did lily 
 
 you think funny she said coldly but just an arrogant bullying toerag potter leave him alone 
 
 i will if you go out with me evans said james quickly go on go out with me and never lay a wand on old snivelly again 
 
 behind him the impediment jinx was wearing off snape was beginning to inch towards his fallen wand spitting out soapsuds as he crawled 
 
 i go out with you if it was a choice between you and the giant squid said lily 
 
 bad luck prongs said sirius briskly and turned back to snape oi 
 
 but too late snape had directed his wand straight at james there was a flash of light and a gash appeared on the side of face spattering his robes with blood james whirled about a second flash of light later snape was hanging in the air his robes falling over his head to reveal skinny pallid legs and a pair of greying underpants 
 
 many people in the small crowd cheered sirius james and wormtail roared with laughter 
 
 lily whose furious expression had twitched for an instant as though she was going to smile said let him down 
 
 certainly said james and he jerked his wand upwards snape fell into a crumpled heap on the ground disentangling himself from his robes he got quickly to his feet wand up but sirius said petrificus totalus and snape keeled over again rigid as a board 
 
 leave him alone lily shouted she had her own wand out now james and sirius eyed it warily 
 
 ah evans make me hex you said james earnestly 
 
 take the curse off him then 
 
 james sighed deeply then turned to snape and muttered the 
 
 there you go he said as snape struggled to his feet lucky evans was here snivellus 
 
 i need help from filthy little mudbloods like her 
 
 lily blinked 
 
 fine she said coolly i bother in future and wash your pants if i were you snivellus 
 
 apologise to evans james roared at snape his wand pointed threateningly at him 
 
 i want you to make him apologise lily shouted rounding on james as bad as he is 
 
 what yelped james never call you 
 
 messing up your hair because you think it looks cool to look like just got off your broomstick showing off with that stupid snitch walking down corridors and hexing anyone who annoys you just because you surprised your broomstick can get off the ground with that fat head on it you make me sick 
 
 she turned on her heel and hurried away 
 
 evans james shouted after her hey evans 
 
 but she look back 
 
 what is it with her said james trying and failing to look as though this was a throwaway question of no real importance to him 
 
 reading between the lines say she thinks a bit conceited mate said sirius 
 
 right said james who looked furious now right 
 
 there was another flash of light and snape was once again hanging in the air 
 
 who wants to see me take off pants 
 
 but whether james really did take off pants harry never found out a hand had closed tight over his upper arm closed with a grip wincing harry looked round to see who had hold of him and saw with a thrill of horror a fully grown snape standing right beside him white with rage 
 
 having fun 
 
 harry felt himself rising into the air the day evaporated around him he was floating upwards through icy blackness hand still tight upon his upper arm then with a swooping feeling as though he had turned in midair his feet hit the stone floor of dungeon and he was standing again beside the pensieve on desk in the shadowy potion study 
 
 so said snape gripping arm so tightly hand was starting to feel numb so been enjoying yourself potter 
 
 said harry trying to free his arm 
 
 it was scary lips were shaking his face was white his teeth were bared 
 
 amusing man your father he said snape shaking harry so hard his glasses slipped down his nose 
 
 
 
 snape threw harry from him with all his might harry fell hard on to the dungeon floor 
 
 you will not repeat what you saw to anybody snape bellowed 
 
 no said harry getting to his feet as far from snape as he could no of course i w 
 
 get out get out i want to see you in this office ever again 
 
 and as harry hurtled towards the door a jar of dead cockroaches exploded over his head he wrenched the door open and hew along the corridor stopping only when he had put three floors between himself and snape there he leaned against the wall panting and rubbing his bruised arm 
 
 he had no desire at all to return to gryffindor tower so early nor to tell ron and hermione what he had just seen what was making harry feel so horrified and unhappy was not being shouted at or having jars thrown at him it was that he knew how it felt to be humiliated in the middle of a circle of onlookers knew exactly how snape had felt as his father had taunted him and that judging from what he had just seen his father had been every bit as arrogant as snape had always told him
