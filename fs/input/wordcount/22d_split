 harry was so relieved she was taking him seriously that he did not hesitate but jumped out of bed at once pulled on his dressing gown and pushed his glasses back on to his nose 
 
 weasley you ought to come too said professor mcgonagall 
 
 they followed professor mcgonagall past the silent figures of neville dean and seamus out of the dormitory down the spiral stairs into the common room through the portrait hole and off along the fat moonlit corridor harry felt as though the panic inside him might spill over at any moment he wanted to run to yell for dumbledore mr weasley was bleeding as they walked along so sedately and what if those fangs harry tried hard not to think my fangs had been poisonous they passed mrs norris who turned her lamplike eyes upon them and hissed faintly but professor mcgonagall said shoo mrs norris slunk away into the shadows and in a few minutes they had reached the stone gargoyle guarding the entrance to dumbledore s office 
 
 fizzing whizzbee said professor mcgonagall 
 
 the gargoyle sprang to life and leapt aside the wall behind it split in two to reveal a stone staircase that was moving continually upwards like a spiral escalator the three of them stepped on to the moving stairs the wall closed behind them with a thud and they were moving upwards in tight circles until they reached the highly polished oak door with the brass knocker shaped like a griffin 
 
 though it was now well past midnight there were voices coming from inside the room a positive babble of them it sounded as though dumbledore was entertaining at least a dozen people 
 
 professor mcgonagall rapped three times with the griffin knocker and the voices ceased abruptly as though someone had switched them all off the door opened of its own accord and professor mcgonagall led harry and ron inside 
 
 the room was in the strange silver instruments standing on tables were silent and still rather than whirring and emitting puffs of smoke as they usually did the portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses covering the walls were all snoozing in their frames behind the door a magnificent red and gold bird the size of a swan dozed on its perch with its head under its wing 
 
 oh you professor mcgonagall and ah 
 
 dumbledore was sitting in a chair behind his desk he leaned forward into the pool of candlelight illuminating the papers laid out before him he was wearing a magnificently embroidered purple and gold dressing gown over a snowy white nightshirt but seemed his penetrating light blue eyes fixed intently upon professor mcgonagall 
 
 professor dumbledore potter has had a well a nightmare said professor mcgonagall he says 
 
 it a nightmare said harry quickly 
 
 professor mcgonagall looked round at harry frowning slightly 
 
 very well then potter you tell the headmaster about it 
 
 i well i was asleep said harry and even in his terror and his desperation to make dumbledore understand he felt slightly irritated that the headmaster was not looking at him but examining his own interlocked fingers but it an ordinary dream it was real i saw it happen he took a deep breath dadmr weasleyhas been attacked by a giant snake 
 
 the words seemed to reverberate in the air after he had said them sounding slightly ridiculous even comic there was a pause in which dumbledore leaned back and stared meditatively at the ceiling ron looked from harry to dumbledore and shocked 
 
 how did you see this dumbledore asked quietly still not looking at harry 
 
 well i know said harry rather angrilywhat did it matter inside my head i suppose 
 
 you misunderstand me said dumbledore still in the same calm tone i mean can you remembererwhere you were positioned as you watched this attack happen were you perhaps standing beside the victim or else looking down on the scene from above 
 
 this was such a curious question that harry gaped at dumbledore it was almost as though he knew 
 
 i was the snake he said i saw it all from the point of view 
 
 nobody else spoke for a moment then dumbledore now looking at ron who was still asked in a new and sharper voice is arthur seriously injured 
 
 yes said harry emphaticallywhy were they all so slow on the uptake did they not realise how much a person bled when fangs that long pierced their side and why could dumbledore not do him the courtesy of looking at him 
 
 but dumbledore stood up so quickly it made harry jump and addressed one of the old portraits hanging very near the ceiling everard he said sharply and you too dilys 
 
 a wizard with a short black fringe and an elderly witch with long silver ringlets in the frame beside him both of whom seemed to have been in the deepest of sleeps opened their eyes immediately 
 
 you were listening said dumbledore 
 
 the wizard nodded the witch said naturally 
 
 the man has red hair and glasses said dumbledore everard you will need to raise the alarm make sure he is found by the right people 
 
 both nodded and moved sideways out of their frames but instead of emerging in neighbouring pictures as usually happened at hogwarts neither reappeared one frames now contained nothing but a backdrop of dark curtain the other a handsome leather armchair harry noticed that many of the other headmasters and mistresses on the walls though snoring and drooling most convincingly kept sneaking peeks at him from under their eyelids and he suddenly understood who had been talking when they had knocked 
 
 everard and dilys were two of hogwartss most celebrated heads dumbledore said now sweeping around harry ron and professor mcgonagall to approach the magnificent sleeping bird on his perch beside the door their renown is such that both have portraits hanging in other important wizarding institutions as they are free to move between their own portraits they can tell us what may be happening elsewhere 
 
 but mr weasley could be anywhere said harry 
 
 please sit down all three of you said dumbledore as though harry had not spoken everard and dilys may not be back for several minutes professor mcgonagall if you could draw up extra chairs 
 
 professor mcgonagall pulled her wand from the pocket of her dressing gown and waved it three chairs appeared out of thin air and wooden quite unlike the comfortable chintz armchairs that dumbledore had conjured up at hearing harry sat down watching dumbledore over his shoulder dumbledore was now stroking plumed golden head with one finger the phoenix awoke immediately he stretched his beautiful head high and observed dumbledore through bright dark eyes 
 
 we will need dumbledore said very quietly to the bird a warning 
 
 there was a flash of fire and the phoenix had gone 
 
 dumbledore now swooped down upon one of the fragile silver instruments whose function harry had never known carried it over to his desk sat down facing them again and tapped it gently with the tip of his wand 
 
 the instrument tinkled into life at once with rhythmic clinking noises tiny puffs of pale green smoke issued from the minuscule silver tube at the top dumbledore watched the smoke closely his brow furrowed after a few seconds the tiny puffs became a steady stream of smoke that thickened and coiled in the air a head grew out of the end of it opening its mouth wide harry wondered whether the instrument was confirming his story he looked eagerly at dumbledore for a sign that he was right but dumbledore did not look up 
 
 naturally naturally murmured dumbledore apparently to himself still observing the stream of smoke without the slightest sign of surprise but in essence divided 
 
 harry could make neither head nor tail of this question the smoke serpent however split itself instantly into two snakes both coiling and undulating in the dark air with a look of grim satisfaction dumbledore gave the instrument another gentle tap with his wand the clinking noise slowed and died and the smoke serpents grew faint became a formless haze and vanished 
 
 dumbledore replaced the instrument on its spindly little table harry saw many of the old headmasters in the portraits follow him with their eyes then realising that harry was watching them hastily pretend to be sleeping again harry wanted to ask what the strange silver instrument was for but before he could do so there was a shout from the top of the wall to their right the wizard called everard had reappeared in his portrait panting slightly 
 
 dumbledore 
 
 what news said dumbledore at once 
 
 i yelled until someone came running said the wizard who was mopping his brow on the curtain behind him said heard something moving downstairsthey sure whether to believe me but went down to checkyou know there are no portraits down there to watch from anyway they carried him up a few minutes later he look good covered in blood i ran along to elfrida portrait to get a good view as they left 
 
 good said dumbledore as ron made a convulsive movement i take it dilys will have seen him arrive then 
 
 and moments later the witch had reappeared in her picture too she sank coughing into her armchair and said yes taken him to st dumbledore they carried him past my portrait he looks bad 
 
 thank you said dumbledore he looked round at professor mcgonagall 
 
 minerva i need you to go and wake the other weasley children 
 
 of course 
 
 professor mcgonagall got up and moved swiftly to the door harry cast a sideways glance at ron who was looking terrified 
 
 and dumbledore what about molly said professor mcgonagall pausing at the door 
 
 that will be a job for fawkes when he has finished keeping a lookout for anybody approaching said dumbledore but she may already know that excellent clock of hers 
 
 harry knew dumbledore was referring to the clock that told not the time but the whereabouts and conditions of the various weasley family members and with a pang he thought that mr hand must even now be pointing at mortal it was very late mrs weasley was probably asleep not watching the clock harry felt cold as he remembered mrs boggart turning into mr lifeless body his glasses askew blood running down his face but mr weasley going to die he 
 
 dumbledore was now rummaging in a cupboard behind harry and ron he emerged from it carrying a blackened old kettle which he placed carefully on his desk he raised his wand and murmured portus for a moment the kettle trembled glowing with an odd blue light then it quivered to rest as solidly black as ever 
 
 dumbledore marched over to another portrait this time of a wizard with a pointed beard who had been painted wearing the slytherin colours of green and silver and was apparently sleeping so deeply that he could not hear voice when he attempted to rouse him 
 
 phineas phineas 
 
 the subjects of the portraits lining the room were no longer pretending to be asleep they were shifting around in their frames the better to watch what was happening when the wizard continued to feign sleep some of them shouted his name too 
 
 phineas phineas phineas 
 
 he could not pretend any longer he gave a theatrical jerk and opened his eyes wide 
 
 did someone call 
 
 i need you to visit your other portrait again phineas said dumbledore got another message 
 
 visit my other portrait said phineas in a reedy voice giving a long fake yawn his eyes travelling around the room and focusing on harry oh no dumbledore i am too tired tonight 
 
 something about voice was familiar to harry where had he heard it before but before he could think the portraits on the surrounding walls broke into a storm of protest 
 
 insubordination sir roared a corpulent wizard brandishing his fists dereliction of duty 
 
 we are to give service to the present headmaster of hogwarts cried a old wizard whom harry recognised as predecessor armando dippet sharne on you phineas 
 
 shall i persuade him dumbledore called a witch raising an unusually thick wand that looked not unlike a birch rod 
 
 oh very well said the wizard called phineas eyeing the wand with mild apprehension though he may well have destroyed my picture by now done away with most of the family 
 
 sirius knows not to destroy your portrait said dumbledore and harry realised immediately where he had heard voice before issuing from the apparently empty frame in his bedroom in grimmauld place you are to give him the message that arthur weasley has been gravely injured and that his wife children and harry potter will be arriving at his house shortly do you understand 
 
 arthur weasley injured wife and children and harry potter coming to stay repeated phineas in a bored voice yes yes very well 
 
 he sloped away into the frame of the portrait and disappeared from view at the very moment the study door opened again fred george and ginny were ushered inside by professor mcgonagall all three of them looking dishevelled and shocked still in their night things 
 
 going on asked ginny who looked frightened professor mcgonagall says you saw dad get hurt 
 
 your father has been injured in the course of his work for the order of the phoenix said dumbledore before harry could speak he has been taken to st hospital for magical maladies and injuries i am sending you back to house which is much more convenient for the hospital than the burrow you will meet your mother there 
 
 we going asked fred looking shaken floo powder 
 
 no said dumbledore floo powder is not safe at the moment the network is being watched you will be taking a portkey he indicated the old kettle lying innocently on his desk we are just waiting for phineas nigellus to report back i want to be sure that the coast is clear before sending you 
 
 there was a flash of flame in the very middle of the office leaving behind a single golden feather that floated gently to the floor 
 
 it is warning said dumbledore catching the feather as it fell professor umbridge must know out of your beds minerva go and head her offtell her any story 
 
 professor mcgonagall was gone in a swish of tartan 
 
 he says be delighted said a bored voice behind dumbledore the wizard called phineas had reappeared in front of his slytherin banner my has always had an odd taste in 
 
 come here then dumbledore said to harry and the weasleys and quickly before anyone else joins us 
 
 harry and the others gathered around desk 
 
 you have all used a portkey before asked dumbledore and they nodded each reaching out to touch some part of the blackened kettle good on the count of three then one two 
 
 it happened in a fraction of a second in the infinitesimal pause before dumbledore said three harry looked up at himthey were very close togetherand clear blue gaze moved from the portkey to face 
 
 at once scar burned as though the old wound had burst open againand unbidden unwanted but terrifyingly strong there rose within harry a hatred so powerful he felt for that instant he would like nothing better than to striketo biteto sink his fangs into the man before him 
 
 three 
 
 harry felt a powerful jerk behind his navel the ground vanished from beneath his feet his hand was glued to the kettle he was banging into the others as they all sped forwards in a swirl of colours and a rush of wind the kettle pulling them onwards until his feet hit the ground so hard his knees buckled the kettle clattered to the ground and somewhere close at hand a voice said 
 
 back again the brats is it true their dying 
 
 out roared a second voice 
 
 harry scrambled to his feet and looked around they had arrived in the gloomy basement kitchen of number twelve grimmauld place the only sources of light were the fire and one guttering candle which illuminated the remains of a solitary supper kreacher was disappearing through the door to the hall looking back at them malevolently as he hitched up his loincloth sirius was hurrying towards them all looking anxious he was unshaven and still in his day clothes there was also a slightly whiff of stale drink about him 
 
 going on he said stretching out a hand to help ginny up thineas nigellus said been badly injured 
 
 ask harry said fred 
 
 yeah i want to hear this for myself said george 
 
 the twins and ginny were staring at him footsteps had stopped on the stairs outside 
 
 it was harry began this was even worse than telling mcgonagall and dumbledore i had aa kind ofvision 
 
 and he told them all that he had seen though he altered the story so that it sounded as though he had watched from the sidelines as the snake attacked rather than from behind the own eyes ron who was still very white gave him a fleeting look but did not speak when harry had finished fred george and ginny continued to stare at him for a moment harry did not know whether he was imagining it or not but he fancied there was something accusatory in their looks well if they were going to blame him just for seeing the attack he was glad he had not told them that he had been inside the snake at the time 
 
 is mum here said fred turning to sirius 
 
 she probably even know happened yet said sirius the important thing was to get you away before umbridge could interfere i expect letting molly know now 
 
 got to go to st mungos said ginny urgently she looked around at her brothers they were of course still in their pyjamas sirius can you lend us cloaks or anything 
 
 hang on you go tearing off to st said sirius 
 
 course we can go to st if we want said fred with a mulish expression our dad 
 
 and how are you going to explain how you knew arthur was attacked before the hospital even let his wife know 
 
 what does that matter said george hotly 
 
 it matters because we want to draw attention to the fact that harry is having visions of things that are happening hundreds of miles away said sirius angrily have you any idea what the ministry would make off that information 
 
 fred and george looked as though they could not care less what the ministry made of anything ron was still and silent 
 
 ginny said somebody else could have told us we could have heard it somewhere other than harry 
 
 like who said sirius impatiently listen your been hurt while on duty for the order and the circumstances are fishy enough without his children knowing about it seconds after it happened you could seriously damage the 
 
 we care about the dumb order shouted fred 
 
 our dad dying talking about yelled george 
 
 your father knew what he was getting into and he thank you for messing things up for the order said sirius equally angry this is how it isthis is why not in the orderyou understandthere are things worth dying for 
 
 easy for you to say stuck here bellowed fred i see you risking your neck 
 
 the little colour remaining in face drained from it he looked for a moment as though he would quite like to hit fred but when he spoke it was in a voice of determined calm 
 
 i know hard but all got to act as though we know anything yet got to stay put at least until we hear from your mother all right 
 
 fred and george still looked mutinous ginny however took a few steps over to the nearest chair and sank into it harry looked at ron who made a funny movement somewhere between a nod and a shrug and they sat down too the twins glared at sirius for another minute then took seats either side of ginny 
 
 right said sirius encouragingly come on lets all all have a drink while waiting accio butterbeer 
 
 he raised his wand as he spoke and half a dozen bottles came flying towards them out of the pantry skidded along the table scattering the debris of meal and stopped neatly in front of the six of them they all drank and for a while the only sounds were those of the crackling of the kitchen fire and the soft thud of their bottles on the table 
 
 harry was only drinking to have something to do with his hands his stomach was full of horrible hot bubbling guilt they would not be here if it were not for him they would all still be asleep in bed and it was no good telling himself that by raising the alarm he had ensured that mr weasley was found because there was also the inescapable business of it being he who had attacked mr weasley in the first place 
 
 be stupid you got fangs he told himself trying to keep calm though the hand on his butterbeer bottle was shaking you were lying in bed you attacking anyone 
 
 but then what just happened in office he asked himself i felt like i wanted to attack dumbledore too 
 
 he put the bottle down a little harder than he meant to and it slopped over on to the table no one took any notice then a burst of fire in midair illuminated the dirty plates in front of them and as they gave cries of shock a scroll of parchment fell with a thud on to the table accompanied by a single golden phoenix tail feather 
 
 fawkes said sirius at once snatching up the parchment not writing it must be a message from your motherhere 
 
 he thrust the letter into hand who ripped it open and read aloud dad is still alive i am setting out for st now stay where you are i will send news as soon as i can mum 
 
 george looked around the table 
 
 still alive he said slowly but that makes it sound 
 
 he did not need to finish the sentence it sounded to harry too as though mr weasley was hovering somewhere between life and death still exceptionally pale ron stared at the back of his letter as though it might speak words of comfort to him fred pulled the parchment out of hands and read it for himself then looked up at harry who felt his hand shaking on his butterbeer bottle again and clenched it more tightly to stop the trembling 
 
 if harry had ever sat through a longer night than this one he could not remember it sirius suggested once without any real conviction that they all go to bed but the weasleys looks of disgust were answer enough they mostly sat in silence around the table watching the candle wick sinking lower and lower into liquid wax occasionally raising a bottle to their lips speaking only to check the time to wonder aloud what was happening and to reassure each other that if there was bad news they would know straightaway for mrs weasley must long since have arrived at st 
 
 fred fell into a doze his head lolling sideways on to his shoulder ginny was curled like a cat on her chair but her eyes were open harry could see them reflecting the firelight ron was sitting with his head in his hands whether awake or asleep it was impossible to tell harry and sirius looked at each other every so often intruders upon the family grief waiting waiting 
 
 at ten past five in the morning by watch the kitchen door swung open and mrs weasley entered the kitchen she was extremely pale but when they all turned to look at her fred ron and harry half rising from their chairs she gave a wan smile 
 
 going to be all right she said her voice weak with tiredness sleeping we can all go and see him later sitting with him now going to take the morning off work 
 
 fred fell back into his chair with his hands over his face george and ginny got up walked swiftly over to their mother and hugged her ron gave a very shaky laugh and downed the rest of his butterbeer in one 
 
 breakfast said sirius loudly and joyfully jumping to his feet that accursed kreacher kreacher 
 
 but kreacher did not answer the summons 
 
 oh forget it then muttered sirius counting the people in front of him so breakfast seeseven bacon and eggs i think and some tea and toast 
 
 harry hurried over to the stove to help he did not want to intrude on the weasleys happiness and he dreaded the moment when mrs weasley would ask him to recount his vision however he had barely taken plates from the dresser when mrs weasley lifted them out of his hands and pulled him into a hug 
 
 i know what would have happened if it been for you harry she said in a muffled voice they might not have found arthur for hours and then it would have been too late but thanks to you alive and been able to think up a good cover story for arthur being where he was no idea what trouble he would have been in otherwise look at poor sturgis 
 
 harry could hardly bear her gratitude but fortunately she soon released him to turn to sirius and thank him for looking after her children through the night sirius said he was very pleased to have been able to help and hoped they would all stay with him as long as mr weasley was in hospital 
 
 oh sirius so grateful they think be there a little while and it would be wonderful to be nearer of course that might mean here for christmas 
 
 the more the merrier said sirius with such obvious sincerity that mrs weasley beamed at him threw on an apron and began to help with breakfast 
 
 sirius harry muttered unable to stand it a moment longer can i have a quick word er now 
 
 he walked into the dark pantry and sirius followed without preamble harry told his godfather every detail of the vision he had had including the fact that he himself had been the snake who had attacked mr weasley 
 
 when he paused for breath sirius said did you tell dumbledore this 
 
 yes said harry impatiently but he tell me what it meant well he tell me anything any more 
 
 i m sure he would have told you if it was anything to worry about said sirius steadily 
 
 but not all said harry in a voice only a little above a whisper sirius i i think going mad back in office just before we took the portkey for a couple of seconds there i thought i was a snake i felt like onemy scar really hurt when i was looking at dumbledoresirius i wanted to attack him 
 
 he could only see a sliver of face the rest was in darkness 
 
 it must have been the aftermath of the vision all said sirius you were still thinking of the dream or whatever it was and 
 
 it that said harry shaking his head it was like something rose up inside me like a snake inside me 
 
 you need to sleep said sirius firmly going to have breakfast then go upstairs to bed and after lunch you can go and see arthur with the others in shock harry blaming yourself for something you only witnessed and lucky you did witness it or arthur might have died just stop worrying 
 
 he clapped harry on the shoulder and left the pantry leaving harry standing alone in the dark 
 
 everyone but harry spent the rest of the morning sleeping he went up to the bedroom he and ron had shared over the last few weeks of summer but while ron crawled into bed and was asleep within minutes harry sat fully clothed hunched against the cold metal bars of the bedstead keeping himself deliberately uncomfortable determined not to fall into a doze terrified that he might become the serpent again in his sleep and wake to find that he had attacked ron or else slithered through the house after one of the others 
 
 when ron woke up harry pretended to have enjoyed a refreshing nap too their trunks arrived from hogwarts while they were eating lunch so they could dress as muggles for the trip to st everybody except harry was riotously happy and talkative as they changed out of their robes into jeans and sweatshirts when tonks and turned up to escort them across london they greeted them gleefully laughing at the bowler hat was wearing at an angle to conceal his magical eye and assuring him truthfully that tonks whose hair was short and bright pink again would attract far less attention on the underground 
 
 tonks was very interested in vision of the attack on mr weasley something harry was not remotely interested in discussing 
 
 there any seer blood in your family is there she enquired curiously as they sat side by side on a train rattling towards the heart of the city 
 
 no said harry thinking of professor trelawney and feeling insulted 
 
 no said tonks musingly no i suppose not really prophecy doing is it i mean not seeing the future seeing the present odd it useful though 
 
 harry answer fortunately they got out at the next stop a station in the very heart of london and in the bustle of leaving the train he was able to allow fred and george to get between himself and tonks who was leading the way they all followed her up the escalator moody clunking along at the back of the group his bowler tilted low and one gnarled hand stuck in between the buttons of his coat clutching his wand harry thought he sensed the concealed eye staring hard at him trying to avoid any more questions about his dream he asked where st was hidden 
 
 not far from here grunted moody as they stepped out into the wintry air on a broad street packed with christmas shoppers he pushed harry a little ahead of him and stumped along just behind harry knew the eye was rolling in all directions under the tilted hat easy to find a good location for a hospital nowhere in diagon alley was big enough and we have it underground like the be healthy in the end they managed to get hold of a building up here theory was sick wizards could come and go and just blend in with the crowd 
 
 he seized shoulder to prevent them being separated by a gaggle of shoppers plainly intent on nothing but making it into a nearby shop full of electrical gadgets 
 
 here we go said moody a moment later 
 
 they had arrived outside a large department store called purge dowse ltd the place had a shabby miserable air the window displays consisted of a few chipped dummies with their wigs askew standing at random and modelling fashions at least ten years out of date large signs on all the dusty doors read closed for refurbishment harry distinctly heard a large woman laden with plastic shopping bags say to her friend as they passed never open that place 
 
 right said tonks beckoning them towards a window displaying nothing but a particularly ugly female dummy its false eyelashes were hanging off and it was modelling a green nylon pinafore dress everybody ready 
 
 they nodded clustering around her moody gave harry another shove between the shoulder blades to urge him forward and tonks leaned close to the glass looking up at the very ugly dummy her breath steaming up the glass wotcher she said here to see arthur weasley 
 
 harry thought how absurd it was for tonks to expect the dummy to hear her talking so quietly through a sheet of glass with buses rumbling along behind her and all the racket of a street full of shoppers then he reminded himself that dummies hear anyway next second his mouth opened in shock as the dummy gave a tiny nod and beckoned with its jointed finger and tonks had seized ginny and mrs weasley by the elbows stepped right through the glass and vanished 
 
 fred george and ron stepped after them harry glanced around at the jostling crowd not one of them seemed to have a glance to spare for window displays as ugly as those of purge dowse ltd nor did any of them seem to have noticed that six people had just melted into thin air in front of them 
 
 growled moody giving harry yet another poke in the back and together they stepped forward through what felt like a sheet of cool water emerging quite warm and dry on the other side 
 
 there was no sign of the ugly dummy or the space where she had stood they were in what seemed to be a crowded reception area where rows of witches and wizards sat upon rickety wooden chairs some looking perfectly normal and perusing copies of witch weekly others sporting gruesome disfigurements such as elephant trunks or extra hands sticking out of their chests the room was scarcely less quiet than the street outside for many of the patients were making very peculiar noises a witch in the centre of the front row who was fanning herself vigorously with a copy of the daily prophet kept letting off a whistle as steam came pouring out of her mouth a warlock in the corner clanged like a bell every time he moved and with each clang his head vibrated horribly so that he had to seize himself by the ears to hold it steady 
 
 witches and wizards in robes were walking up and down the rows asking questions and making notes on clipboards like harry noticed the emblem embroidered on their chests a wand and bone crossed 
 
 are they doctors he asked ron quietly 
 
 doctors said ron looking startled those muggle nutters that cut people up nah healers 
 
 over here called mrs weasley above the renewed clanging of the warlock in the corner and they followed her to the queue in front of a plump blonde witch seated at a desk marked wall behind her was covered in notices and posters saying things like a clean cauldron keeps potions from becoming poisons and antidotes are unless approved by a qualified healer there was also a large portrait of a witch with long silver ringlets which was labelled 
 
 dilys derwent 
 
 st healer 
 
 headmistress of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry 
 
 
 
 dilys was eyeing the weasley party closely as though counting them when harry caught her eye she gave a tiny wink walked sideways out of her portrait and vanished 
 
 meanwhile at the front of the queue a young wizard was performing an odd jig and trying in between yelps of pain to explain his predicament to the witch behind the desk 
 
 these ouchshoes my brother gave meowthey re eating myouchfeetlook at them there must be some kind ofaarghjinx on them and i aaaaarghget them off he hopped from one foot to the other as though dancing on hot coals 
 
 the shoes prevent you reading do they said the blonde witch irritably pointing at a large sign to the left of her desk you want spell damage fourth floor just like it says on the floor guide next 
 
 as the wizard hobbled and pranced sideways out of the way the weasley party moved forward a few steps and harry read the floor guide

 if you are unsure where to go incapable of normal speech or unable to remember why you are here our welcomewitch will be pleased to help 
 
 a very old stooped wizard with a hearing trumpet had shuffled to the front of the queue now here to see broderick bode he wheezed 
 
 ward but afraid wasting your time said the witch dismissively completely addled you knowstill thinks a teapot next 
 
 a wizard was holding his small daughter tightly by the ankle while she flapped around his head using the immensely large feathery wings that had sprouted right out through the back of her romper suit 
 
 fourth floor said the witch in a bored voice without asking and the man disappeared through the double doors beside the desk holding his daughter like an oddly shaped balloon next 
 
 mrs weasley moved forward to the desk 
 
 hello she said my husband arthur weasley was supposed to be moved to a different ward this morning could you tell us 
 
 arthur weasley said the witch running her finger down a long list in front of her yes first floor second door on the right dai llewellyn ward 
 
 thank you said mrs weasley come on you lot 
 
 they followed her through the double doors and along the narrow corridor beyond which was lined with more portraits of famous healers and lit by crystal bubbles full of candles that floated up on the ceiling looking like giant soapsuds more witches and wizards in robes walked in and out of the doors they passed a yellow gas wafted into the passageway as they passed one door and every now and then they heard distant wailing they climbed a flight of stairs and entered the injuries corridor where the second door on the right bore the words dangerous dai llewellyn ward serious this was a card in a brass holder on which had been handwritten hippocrates smethwyck trainee healer augustus pye 
 
 wait outside molly tonks said arthur want too many visitors at once it ought to be just the family first 
 
 growled his approval of this idea and set himself with his back against the corridor wall his magical eye spinning in all directions harry drew back too but mrs weasley reached out a hand and pushed him through the door saying be silly harry arthur wants to thank you 
 
 the ward was small and rather dingy as the only window was narrow and set high in the wall facing the door most of the light came from more shining crystal bubbles clustered in the middle of the ceiling the walls were of panelled oak and there was a portrait of a rather wizard on the wall captioned urquhart rackharrow inventor of the curse 
 
 there were only three patients mr weasley was occupying the bed at the far end oi the ward beside the tiny window harry was pleased and relieved to see that he was propped up on several pillows and reading the daily prophet by the solitary ray of sunlight falling on to his bed he looked up as they walked towards him and seeing who it was beamed 
 
 hello he called throwing the prophet aside bill just left molly had to get back to work but he says drop in on you later 
 
 how are you arthur asked mrs weasley bending down to kiss his cheek and looking anxiously into his face still looking a bit peaky 
 
 i feel absolutely fine said mr weasley brightly holding out his good arm to give ginny a hug if they could only take the bandages off be fit to go home 
 
 why they take them off dad asked fred 
 
 well i start bleeding like mad every time they try said mr weasley cheerfully reaching across for his wand which lay on his bedside cabinet and waving it so that six extra chairs appeared at his bedside to seat them all it seems there was some rather unusual kind of poison in that fangs that keeps wounds open sure find an antidote though they say had much worse cases than mine and in the meantime i just have to keep taking a potion every hour but that fellow over there he said dropping his voice and nodding towards the bed opposite in which a man lay looking green and sickly and staring at the ceiling bitten by a werewolf poor chap no cure at all 
 
 a werewolf whispered mrs weasley looking alarmed is he safe in a public ward he be in a private room 
 
 two weeks till full moon mr weasley reminded her quietly been talking to him this morning the healers you know trying to persuade him be able to lead an almost normal life i said to mention names of course but i said i knew a werewolf personally very nice man who finds the condition quite easy to manage 
 
 what did he say asked george 
 
 said give me another bite if i shut up said mr weasley sadly and that woman over there he indicated the only other occupied bed which was right beside the door tell the healers what bit her which makes us all think it must have been something she was handling illegally whatever it was took a real chunk out of her leg very nasty smell when they take off the dressings 
 
 so you going to tell us what happened dad asked fred pulling his chair closer to the bed 
 
 well you already know you said mr weasley with a significant smile at harry very had a very long day dozed off got sneaked up on and bitten 
 
 is it in the prophet you being attacked asked fred indicating the newspaper mr weasley had cast aside 
 
 no of course not said mr weasley with a slightly bitter smile the ministry want everyone to know a dirty great serpent got 
 
 arthur mrs weasley warned him 
 
 goter me mr weasley said hastily though harry was quite sure that was not what he had meant to say 
 
 so where were you when it happened dad asked george 
 
 my business said mr weasley though with a small smile he snatched up the daily prophet shook it open again and said i was just reading about willy arrest when you arrived you know willy turned out to be behind those regurgitating toilets back in the summer one of his jinxes backfired the toilet exploded and they found him lying unconscious in the wreckage covered from head to foot in 
 
 when you say you were on duty fred interrupted in a low voice what were you doing 
 
 you heard your father whispered mrs weasley we are not discussing this here go on about willy widdershins arthur 
 
 well ask me how but he actually got off the toilet charge said mr weasley grimly i can only suppose gold changed hands 
 
 you were guarding it you said george quietly the weapon the thing after 
 
 george be quiet snapped mrs weasley 
 
 anyway said mr weasley in a raised voice this time been caught selling biting doorknobs to muggles and i think be able to worm his way out of it because according to this article two muggles have lost fingers and are now in st for emergency bone and memory modification just think of it muggles in st i wonder which ward in 
 
 and he looked eagerly around as though hoping to see a signpost 
 
 you say got a snake harry asked fred looking at his father for a reaction a massive one you saw it the night he returned you 
 
 enough said mrs weasley crossly and tonks are outside arthur they want to come and see you and you lot can wait outside she added to her children and harry you can come and say goodbye afterwards go on 
 
 they trooped back into the corridor and tonks went in and closed the door of the ward behind them fred raised his eyebrows 
 
 fine he said coolly rummaging in his pockets be like that tell us anything 
 
 looking for these said george holding out what looked like a tangle of string 
 
 you read my mind said fred grinning see if st puts imperturbable charms on its ward doors shall we 
 
 he and george disentangled the string and separated five extendable ears from each other fred and george handed them around harry hesitated to take one 
 
 go on harry take it you saved life if got the right to eavesdrop on him you 
 
 grinning in spite of himself harry took the end of the string and inserted it into his ear as the twins had done 
 
 ok go fred whispered 
 
 the strings wriggled like long skinny worms and snaked under the door at first harry could hear nothing then he jumped as he heard tonks whispering as clearly as though she were standing right beside him 
 
 they searched the whole area but find the snake anywhere it just seems to have vanished after it attacked you arthur but have expected a snake to get in can he 
 
 i reckon he sent it as a lookout growled moody cause not had any luck so far has he no i reckon trying to get a clearer picture of what facing and if arthur been there the beast had a lot more time to look around so potter says he saw it all happen 
 
 yes said mrs weasley she sounded rather uneasy you know dumbledore seems almost to have been waiting for harry to see something like this 
 
 yeah well said moody something funny about the potter kid we all know that 
 
 dumbledore seemed worried about harry when i spoke to him this morning whispered mrs weasley 
 
 course worried growled moody the seeing things from inside snake obviously potter realise what that means but if possessing him 
 
 harry pulled the extendable ear out of his own his heart hammering very fast and heat rushing up his face he looked around at the others they were all staring at him the strings still trailing from their ears looking suddenly fearful 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter
