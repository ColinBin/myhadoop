lionfish nov chapter sixteen the goblet of firecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 i believe it ron said in a stunned voice as the hogwarts students filed back up the steps behind the party from durmstrang krum harry viktor krum 
 
 for sake ron only a quidditch player said hermione 
 
 only a quidditch player ron said looking at her as though he believe his ears hermione one of the best seekers in the world i had no idea he was still at school 
 
 as they recrossed the entrance hall with the rest of the hogwarts students heading for the great hall harry saw lee jordan jumping up and down on the soles of his feet to get a better look at the back of head several girls were frantically searching their pockets as they walked 
 
 oh i believe it i got a single quill on me 
 
 think sign my hat in lipstick 
 
 really hermione said loftily as they passed the girls now squabbling over the lipstick 
 
 getting his autograph if i can said ron you got a quill have you harry 
 
 nope upstairs in my bag said harry 
 
 they walked over to the gryffindor table and sat down ron took care to sit on the side facing the doorway because krum and his fellow durmstrang students were still gathered around it apparently unsure about where they should sit the students from beauxbatons had chosen seats at the ravenclaw table they were looking around the great hall with glum expressions on their faces three of them were still clutching scarves and shawls around their heads 
 
 not that cold said hermione defensively why they bring cloaks 
 
 over here come and sit over here ron hissed over here hermione budge up make a space 
 
 what 
 
 too late said ron bitterly 
 
 viktor krum and his fellow durmstrang students had settled themselves at the slytherin table harry could see malfoy crabbe and goyle looking very smug about this as he watched malfoy bent forward to speak to krum 
 
 yeah right smarm up to him malfoy said ron scathingly i bet krum can see right through him thoughbet he gets people fawning over him all the reckon going to sleep we could offer him a space in our dormitory harryi mind giving him my bed i could kip on a camp bed 
 
 hermione snorted 
 
 they look a lot happier than the beauxbatons lot said harry the durmstrang students were pulling off their heavy furs and looking up at the starry black ceiling with expressions of interest a couple of them were picking up the golden plates and goblets and examining them apparently impressed 
 
 up at the staff table filch the caretaker was adding chairs he was wearing his moldy old tailcoat in honor of the occasion harry was surprised to see that he added four chairs two on either side of 
 
 but there are only two extra people harry said filch putting out four chairs who else is coming 
 
 eh said ron vaguely he was still staring avidly at krum 
 
 when all the students had entered the hall and settled down at their house tables the staff entered filing up to the top table and taking their seats last in line were professor dumbledore professor karkaroff and madame maxime when their headmistress appeared the pupils from beauxbatons leapt to their feet a few of the hogwarts students laughed the beauxbatons party appeared quite unembarrassed however and did not resume their seats until madame maxime had sat down on side dumbledore remained standing and a silence fell over the great hall 
 
 good evening ladies and gentlemen ghosts and most particularly guests said dumbledore beaming around at the foreign students i have great pleasure in welcoming you all to hogwarts i hope and trust that your stay here will be both comfortable and enjoyable 
 
 one of the beauxbatons girls still clutching a muffler around her head gave what was unmistakably a derisive laugh 
 
 no making you stay hermione whispered bristling at her 
 
 the tournament will be officially opened at the end of the feast said dumbledore i now invite you all to eat drink and make yourselves at home 
 
 he sat down and harry saw karkaroff lean forward at once and engage him in conversation 
 
 the plates in front of them filled with food as usual the in the kitchen seemed to have pulled out all the stops there was a greater variety of dishes in front of them than harry had ever seen including several that were definitely foreign 
 
 that said ron pointing at a large dish of some sort of shellfish stew that stood beside a large pudding 
 
 bouillabaisse said hermione 
 
 bless you said ron 
 
 french said hermione i had it on holiday summer before last very nice 
 
 take your word for it said ron helping himself to black pudding 
 
 the great hall seemed somehow much more crowded than usual even though there were barely twenty additional students there perhaps it was because their differently colored uniforms stood out so clearly against the black of the hogwarts robes now that they had removed their furs the durmstrang students were revealed to be wearing robes of a deep bloodred 
 
 hagrid sidled into the hall through a door behind the staff table twenty minutes after the start of the feast he slid into his seat at the end and waved at harry ron and hermione with a very heavily bandaged hand 
 
 skrewts doing all right hagrid harry called 
 
 thrivin hagrid called back happily 
 
 yeah just bet they are said ron quietly looks like finally found a food they like it fingers 
 
 at that moment a voice said excuse me are you wanting ze bouillabaisse 
 
 it was the girl from beauxbatons who had laughed during speech she had finally removed her muffler a long sheet of hair fell almost to her waist she had large deep blue eyes and very white even teeth 
 
 ron went purple he stared up at her opened his mouth to reply but nothing came out except a faint gurgling noise 
 
 yeah have it said harry pushing the dish toward the girl 
 
 you ave finished wiz it 
 
 yeah ron said breathlessly yeah it was excellent 
 
 the girl picked up the dish and carried it carefully off to the ravenclaw table ron was still goggling at the girl as though he had never seen one before harry started to laugh the sound seemed to jog ron back to his senses 
 
 a veela he said hoarsely to harry 
 
 of course she said hermione tartly i see anyone else gaping at her like an idiot 
 
 but she entirely right about that as the girl crossed the hall many boys heads turned and some of them seemed to have become temporarily speechless just like ron 
 
 telling you not a normal girl said ron leaning sideways so he could keep a clear view of her they make them like that at hogwarts 
 
 they make them okay at hogwarts said harry without thinking cho happened to be sitting only a few places away from the girl with the silvery hair 
 
 when both put your eyes back in said hermione briskly be able to see just arrived 
 
 she was pointing up at the staff table the two remaining empty seats had just been filled ludo bagman was now sitting on professor other side while mr crouch boss was next to madame maxime 
 
 what are they doing here said harry in surprise 
 
 they organized the triwizard tournament they said hermione i suppose they wanted to be here to see it start 
 
 when the second course arrived they noticed a number of unfamiliar desserts too ron examined an odd sort of pale blancmange closely then moved it carefully a few inches to his right so that it would be clearly visible from the ravenclaw table the girl who looked like a veela appeared to have eaten enough however and did not come over to get it 
 
 once the golden plates had been wiped clean dumbledore stood up again a pleasant sort of tension seemed to fill the hall now harry felt a slight thrill of excitement wondering what was coming several seats down from them fred and george were leaning forward staring at dumbledore with great concentration 
 
 the moment has come said dumbledore smiling around at the sea of upturned faces the triwizard tournament is about to start i would like to say a few words of explanation before we bring in the casket 
 
 the what harry muttered 
 
 ron shrugged 
 
 just to clarify the procedure that we will be following this year but first let me introduce for those who do not know them mr bartemius crouch head of the department of international magical cooperation there was a smattering of polite applause and mr ludo bagman head of the department of magical games and sports 
 
 there was a much louder round of applause for bagman than for crouch perhaps because of his fame as a beater or simply because he looked so much more likable he acknowledged it with a jovial wave of his hand bartemius crouch did not smile or wave when his name was announced remembering him in his neat suit at the quidditch world cup harry thought he looked strange in robes his toothbrush mustache and severe parting looked very odd next to long white hair and beard 
 
 mr bagman and mr crouch have worked tirelessly over the last few months on the arrangements for the triwizard tournament dumbledore continued and they will be joining myself professor karkaroff and madame maxime on the panel that will judge the champions efforts 
 
 at the mention of the word champions the attentiveness of the listening students seemed to sharpen perhaps dumbledore had noticed their sudden stillness for he smiled as he said the casket then if you please mr filch 
 
 filch who had been lurking unnoticed in a far corner of the hall now approached dumbledore carrying a great wooden chest encrusted with jewels it looked extremely old a murmur of excited interest rose from the watching students dennis creevey actually stood on his chair to see it properly but being so tiny his head hardly rose above anyone 
 
 the instructions for the tasks the champions will face this year have already been examined by mr crouch and mr bagman said dumbledore as filch placed the chest carefully on the table before him and they have made the necessary arrangements for each challenge there will be three tasks spaced throughout the school year and they will test the champions in many different ways their magical prowess their daring their powers of deduction and of course their ability to cope with danger 
 
 at this last word the hall was filled with a silence so absolute that nobody seemed to be breathing 
 
 as you know three champions compete in the tournament dumbledore went on calmly one from each of the participating schools they will be marked on how well they perform each of the tournament tasks and the champion with the highest total after task three will win the triwizard cup the champions will be chosen by an impartial selector the goblet of fire 
 
 dumbledore now took out his wand and tapped three times upon the top of the casket the lid creaked slowly open dumbledore reached inside it and pulled out a large roughly hewn wooden cup it would have been entirely unremarkable had it not been full to the brim with dancing flames 
 
 dumbledore closed the casket and placed the goblet carefully on top of it where it would be clearly visible to everyone in the hall 
 
 anybody wishing to submit themselves as champion must write their name and school clearly upon a slip of parchment and drop it into the goblet said dumbledore aspiring champions have hours in which to put their names forward tomorrow night halloween the goblet will return the names of the three it has judged most worthy to represent their schools the goblet will be placed in the entrance hall tonight where it will be freely accessible to all those wishing to compete 
 
 to ensure that no underage student yields to temptation said dumbledore i will be drawing an age line around the goblet of fire once it has been placed in the entrance hall nobody under the age of seventeen will be able to cross this line 
 
 finally i wish to impress upon any of you wishing to compete that this tournament is not to be entered into lightly once a champion has been selected by the goblet of fire he or she is obliged to see the tournament through to the end the placing of your name in the goblet constitutes a binding magical contract there can be no change of heart once you have become a champion please be very sure therefore that you are wholeheartedly prepared to play before you drop your name into the goblet now i think it is time for bed good night to you all 
 
 an age line fred weasley said his eyes glinting as they all made their way across the hall to the doors into the entrance hall well that should be fooled by an aging potion it and once your in that goblet laughing it tell whether seventeen or not 
 
 but i think anyone under seventeen will stand a chance said hermione we just learned enough 
 
 speak for yourself said george shortly try and get in you harry 
 
 harry thought briefly of insistence that nobody under seventeen should submit their name but then the wonderful picture of himself winning the triwizard tournament filled his mind wondered how angry dumbledore would be if someone younger than seventeen did find a way to get over the age line 
 
 where is he said ron who listening to a word of this conversation but looking through the crowd to see what had become of krum dumbledore say where the durmstrang people are sleeping did he 
 
 but this query was answered almost instantly they were level with the slytherin table now and karkaroff had just bustled up to his students 
 
 back to the ship then he was saying viktor how are you feeling did you eat enough should i send for some mulled wine from the kitchens 
 
 harry saw krum shake his head as he pulled his furs back on professor ivood like some vine said one of the other durmstrang boys hopefully 
 
 i offering it to you poliakoff snapped karkaroff his warmly paternal air vanishing in an instant i notice you have dribbled food all down the front of your robes again disgusting boy 
 
 karkaroff turned and led his students toward the doors reaching them at exactly the same moment as harry ron and hermione harry stopped to let him walk through first 
 
 thank you said karkaroff carelessly glancing at him 
 
 and then karkaroff froze he turned his head back to harry and stared at him as though he believe his eyes behind their headmaster the students from durmstrang came to a halt too eyes moved slowly up face and fixed upon his scar the durmstrang students were staring curiously at harry too out of the corner of his eye harry saw comprehension dawn on a few of their faces the boy with food all down his front nudged the girl next to him and pointed openly at forehead 
 
 yeah harry potter said a growling voice from behind them 
 
 professor karkaroff spun around moody was standing there leaning heavily on his staff his magical eye glaring unblinkingly at the durmstrang headmaster 
 
 the color drained from face as harry watched a terrible look of mingled fury and fear came over him 
 
 you he said staring at moody as though unsure he was really seeing him 
 
 me said moody grimly and unless got anything to say to potter karkaroff you might want to move blocking the doorway 
 
 it was true half the students in the hall were now waiting behind them looking over one shoulders to see what was causing the holdup 
 
 without another word professor karkaroff swept his students away with him moody watched him until he was out of sight his magical eye fixed upon his back a look of intense dislike upon his mutilated face 
 
 
 
 as the next day was saturday most students would normally have breakfasted late harry ron and hermione however were not alone in rising much earlier than they usually did on weekends when they went down into the entrance hall they saw about twenty people milling around it some of them eating toast all examining the goblet of fire it had been placed in the center of the hall on the stool that normally bore the sorting hat a thin golden line had been traced on the floor forming a circle ten feet around it in every direction 
 
 anyone put their name in yet ron asked a girl eagerly 
 
 all the durmstrang lot she replied but i seen anyone from hogwarts yet 
 
 bet some of them put it in last night after all gone to bed said harry i if it had been have wanted everyone watching what if the goblet just gobbed you right back out again 
 
 someone laughed behind harry turning he saw fred george and lee jordan hurrying down the staircase all three of them looking extremely excited 
 
 done it fred said in a triumphant whisper to harry ron and hermione just taken it 
 
 what said ron 
 
 the aging potion dung brains said fred 
 
 one drop each said george rubbing his hands together with glee we only need to be a few months older 
 
 going to split the thousand galleons between the three of us if one of us wins said lee grinning broadly 
 
 not sure this is going to work you know said hermione warningly sure dumbledore will have thought of this 
 
 fred george and lee ignored her 
 
 ready fred said to the other two quivering with excitement then go first 
 
 harry watched fascinated as fred pulled a slip of parchment out of his pocket bearing the words fred weasley hogwarts fred walked right up to the edge of the line and stood there rocking on his toes like a diver preparing for a drop then with the eyes of every person in the entrance hall upon him he took a great breath and stepped over the line 
 
 for a split second harry thought it had worked george certainly thought so for he let out a yell of triumph and leapt after fred but next moment there was a loud sizzling sound and both twins were hurled out of the golden circle as though they had been thrown by an invisible they landed painfully ten feet away on the cold stone floor and to add insult to injury there was a loud popping noise and both of them sprouted identical long white beards 
 
 the entrance hall rang with laughter even fred and george joined in once they had gotten to their feet and taken a good look at each beards 
 
 i did warn you said a deep amused voice and everyone turned to see professor dumbledore coming out of the great hall he surveyed fred and george his eyes twinkling i suggest you both go up to madam pomfrey she is already tending to miss fawcett of ravenclaw and mr summers of hufflepuff both of whom decided to age themselves up a little too though i must say neither of their beards is anything like as fine as yours 
 
 fred and george set off for the hospital wing accompanied by lee who was howling with laughter and harry ron and hermione also chortling went in to breakfast 
 
 the decorations in the great hall had changed this morning as it was halloween a cloud of live bats was fluttering around the enchanted ceiling while hundreds of carved pumpkins leered from every corner harry led the way over to dean and seamus who were discussing those hogwarts students of seventeen or over who might be entering 
 
 a rumor going around that warrington got up early and put his name in dean told harry that big bloke from slytherin who looks like a sloth 
 
 harry who had played quidditch against warrington shook his head in disgust 
 
 we have a slytherin champion 
 
 and all the hufflepuffs are talking about diggory said seamus contemptuously but i have thought have wanted to risk his good looks 
 
 listen said hermione suddenly 
 
 people were cheering out in the entrance hall they all swiveled around in their seats and saw angelina johnson coming into the hall grinning in an embarrassed sort of way a tall black girl who played chaser on the gryffindor quidditch team angelina came over to them sat down and said well done it just put my name in 
 
 kidding said ron looking impressed 
 
 are you seventeen then asked harry 
 
 course she is see a beard can you said ron 
 
 i had my birthday last week said angelina 
 
 well glad someone from entering said hermione i really hope you get it angelina 
 
 thanks hermione said angelina smiling at her 
 
 yeah better you than diggory said seamus causing several hufflepuffs passing their table to scowl heavily at him 
 
 we going to do today then ron asked harry and hermione when they had finished breakfast and were leaving the great hall 
 
 we been down to visit hagrid yet said harry 
 
 okay said ron just as long as he ask us to donate a few fingers to the skrewts 
 
 a look of great excitement suddenly dawned on face 
 
 just realized i asked hagrid to join yet she said brightly wait for me will you while i nip upstairs and get the badges 
 
 what is it with her said ron exasperated as hermione ran away up the marble staircase 
 
 hey ron said harry suddenly your friend 
 
 the students from beauxbatons were coming through the front doors from the grounds among them the those gathered around the goblet of fire stood back to let them pass watching eagerly 
 
 madame maxime entered the hall behind her students and organized them into a line one by one the beauxbatons students stepped across the age line and dropped their slips of parchment into the flames as each name entered the fire it turned briefly red and emitted sparks 
 
 what happen to the ones who chosen ron muttered to harry as the dropped her parchment into the goblet of fire reckon go back to school or hang around to watch the tournament 
 
 dunno said harry hang around i staying to judge she 
 
 when all the beauxbatons students had submitted their names madame maxime led them back out of the hall and out onto the grounds again 
 
 where are they sleeping then said ron moving toward the front doors and staring after them 
 
 a loud rattling noise behind them announced reappearance with the box of s p badges 
 
 oh good hurry up said ron and he jumped down the stone steps keeping his eyes on the back of the who was now halfway across the lawn with madame maxime 
 
 as they neared cabin on the edge of the forbidden forest the mystery of the beauxbatons sleeping quarters was solved the gigantic carriage in which they had arrived had been parked two hundred yards from front door and the students were climbing back inside it the elephantine flying horses that had pulled the carriage were now grazing in a makeshift paddock alongside it 
 
 harry knocked on door and booming barks answered instantly 
 
 bout time said hagrid when flung open the door thought you forgotten where i live 
 
 been really busy hag hermione started to say but then she stopped dead looking up at hagrid apparently lost for words 
 
 hagrid was wearing his best and very horrible hairy brown suit plus a checked tie this the worst of it though he had evidently tried to tame his hair using large quantities of what appeared to be axle grease it was now slicked down into two bunches perhaps he had tried a ponytail like but found he had too much hair the look really suit hagrid at all for a moment hermione goggled at him then obviously deciding not to comment she said erm where are the skrewts 
 
 out by the pumpkin patch said hagrid happily gettin massive mus be nearly three foot long now trouble is started killin each other 
 
 oh no really said hermione shooting a repressive look at ron who staring at odd hairstyle had just opened his mouth to say something about it 
 
 yeah said hagrid sadly s okay though got em in separate boxes now still got abou twenty 
 
 well lucky said ron hagrid missed the sarcasm 
 
 cabin comprised a single room in one corner of which was a gigantic bed covered in a patchwork quilt a similarly enormous wooden table and chairs stood in front of the fire beneath the quantity of cured hams and dead birds hanging from the ceiling they sat down at the table while hagrid started to make tea and were soon immersed in yet more discussion of the triwizard tournament hagrid seemed quite as excited about it as they were 
 
 you wait he said grinning you jus wait yer going ter see some stuff never seen before firs taskah but not supposed ter say 
 
 go on hagrid harry ron and hermione urged him but he just shook his head grinning 
 
 i don want ter spoil it fer yeh said hagrid but gonna be spectacular tell yeh that them going ter have their work cut out never thought live ter see the triwizard tournament played again 
 
 they ended up having lunch with hagrid though they eat much hagrid had made what he said was a beef casserole but after hermione unearthed a large talon in hers she harry and ron rather lost their appetites however they enjoyed themselves trying to make hagrid tell them what the tasks in the tournament were going to be speculating which of the entrants were likely to be selected as champions and wondering whether fred and george were beardless yet 
 
 a light rain had started to fall by midafternoon it was very cozy sitting by the fire listening to the gentle patter of the drops on the window watching hagrid darning his socks and arguing with hermione about for he flatly refused to join when she showed him her badges 
 
 be doin em an unkindness hermione he said gravely threading a massive bone needle with thick yellow yarn in their nature ter look after humans what they like see be makin em unhappy ter take away their work an insutin em if yeh tried ter pay em 
 
 but harry set dobby free and he was over the moon about it said hermione and we heard asking for wages now 
 
 yeah well yeh get weirdos in every breed not sayin there the odd elf take freedom but never persuade most of em ter do it no nothin doin hermione 
 
 hermione looked very cross indeed and stuffed her box of badges back into her cloak pocket 
 
 by half past five it was growing dark and ron harry and hermione decided it was time to get back up to the castle for the halloween feast and more important the announcement of the school champions 
 
 come with yeh said hagrid putting away his darning jus give us a sec 
 
 hagrid got up went across to the chest of drawers beside his bed and began searching for something inside it they pay too much attention until a truly horrible smell reached their nostrils coughing ron said hagrid that 
 
 eh said hagrid turning around with a large bottle in his hand don yeh like it 
 
 is that aftershave said hermione in a slightly choked voice 
 
 er eau de cologne hagrid muttered he was blushing 
 
 maybe a bit much he said gruffly go take it off hang on 
 
 he stumped out of the cabin and they saw him washing himself vigorously in the water barrel outside the window 
 
 eau de cologne said hermione in amazement hagrid 
 
 and with the hair and the suit said harry in an undertone 
 
 look said ron suddenly pointing out of the window hagrid had just straightened up and turned round if he had been blushing before it was nothing to what he was doing now getting to their feet very cautiously so that hagrid spot them harry ron and hermione peered through the window and saw that madame maxime and the beauxbatons students had just emerged from their carriage clearly about to set off for the feast too they hear what hagrid was saying but he was talking to madame maxime with a rapt expression harry had only ever seen him wear once before when he had been looking at the baby dragon norbert 
 
 going up to the castle with her said hermione indignantly i thought he was waiting for us 
 
 without so much as a backward glance at his cabin hagrid was trudging off up the grounds with madame maxime the beauxbatons students following in their wake jogging to keep up with their enormous strides 
 
 he fancies her said ron incredulously well if they end up having children be setting a world record bet any baby of theirs would weigh about a ton 
 
 they let themselves out of the cabin and shut the door behind them it was surprisingly dark outside drawing their cloaks more closely around themselves they set off up the sloping lawns 
 
 ooh them look hermione whispered 
 
 the durmstrang party was walking up toward the castle from the lake viktor krum was walking side by side with karkaroff and the other durmstrang students were straggling along behind them ron watched krum excitedly but krum did not look around as he reached the front doors a little ahead of hermione ron and harry and proceeded through them 
 
 when they entered the candlelit great hall it was almost full the goblet of fire had been moved it was now standing in front of empty chair at the teachers table fred and george again seemed to have taken their disappointment fairly well 
 
 hope angelina said fred as harry ron and hermione sat down 
 
 so do i said hermione breathlessly well soon know 
 
 the halloween feast seemed to take much longer than usual perhaps because it was their second feast in two days harry seem to fancy the extravagantly prepared food as much as he would have normally like everyone else in the hall judging by the constantly craning necks the impatient expressions on every face the fidgeting and the standing up to see whether dumbledore had finished eating yet harry simply wanted the plates to clear and to hear who had been selected as champions 
 
 at long last the golden plates returned to their original spotless state there was a sharp upswing in the level of noise within the hall which died away almost instantly as dumbledore got to his feet on either side of him professor karkaroff and madame maxime looked as tense and expectant as anyone ludo bagman was beaming and winking at various students mr crouch however looked quite uninterested almost bored 
 
 well the goblet is almost ready to make its decision said dumbledore i estimate that it requires one more minute now when the champions names are called i would ask them please to come up to the top of the hall walk along the staff table and go through into the next chamber he indicated the door behind the staff table where they will be receiving their first instructions 
 
 he took out his wand and gave a great sweeping wave with it at once all the candles except those inside the carved pumpkins were extinguished plunging them into a state of semidarkness the goblet of fire now shone more brightly than anything in the whole hall the sparkling bright of the flames almost painful on the eyes everyone watched few people kept checking their watches 
 
 any second lee jordan whispered two seats away from harry 
 
 the flames inside the goblet turned suddenly red again sparks began to fly from it next moment a tongue of flame shot into the air a charred piece of parchment fluttered out of it the whole room gasped 
 
 dumbledore caught the piece of parchment and held it at length so that he could read it by the light of the flames which had turned back to 
 
 the champion for durmstrang he read in a strong clear voice will be viktor krum 
 
 no surprises there yelled ron as a storm of applause and cheering swept the hall harry saw viktor krum rise from the slytherin table and slouch up toward dumbledore he turned right walked along the staff table and disappeared through the door into the next chamber 
 
 bravo viktor boomed karkaroff so loudly that everyone could hear him even over all the applause knew you had it in you 
 
 the clapping and chatting died down now attention was focused again on the goblet which seconds later turned red once more a second piece of parchment shot out of it propelled by the flames 
 
 the champion for beauxbatons said dumbledore is fleur delacour 
 
 her ron harry shouted as the girl who so resembled a veela got gracefully to her feet shook back her sheet of silvery blonde hair and swept up between the ravenclaw and hufflepuff tables 
 
 oh look all disappointed hermione said over the noise nodding toward the remainder of the beauxbatons party disappointed was a bit of an understatement harry thought two of the girls who had not been selected had dissolved into tears and were sobbing with their heads on their arms 
 
 when fleur delacour too had vanished into the side chamber silence fell again but this time it was a silence so stiff with excitement you could almost taste it the hogwarts champion next 
 
 and the goblet of fire turned red once more sparks showered out of it the tongue of flame shot high into the air and from its tip dumbledore pulled the third piece of parchment 
 
 the hogwarts champion he called is cedric diggory 
 
 no said ron loudly but nobody heard him except harry the uproar from the next table was too great every single hufflepuff had jumped to his or her feet screaming and stamping as cedric made his way past them grinning broadly and headed off toward the chamber behind the teachers table indeed the applause for cedric went on so long that it was some time before dumbledore could make himself heard again 
 
 excellent dumbledore called happily as at last the tumult died down well we now have our three champions i am sure i can count upon all of you including the remaining students from beauxbatons and durmstrang to give your champions every ounce of support you can muster by cheering your champion on you will contribute in a very real 
 
 but dumbledore suddenly stopped speaking and it was apparent to everybody what had distracted him 
 
 the fire in the goblet had just turned red again sparks were flying out of it a long flame shot suddenly into the air and borne upon it was another piece of parchment 
 
 automatically it seemed dumbledore reached out a long hand and seized the parchment he held it out and stared at the name written upon it there was a long pause during which dumbledore stared at the slip in his hands and everyone in the room stared at dumbledore and then dumbledore cleared his throat and read out 
 
 harry potter 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire 
 

lionfish nov chapter sixteen in the headcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 hermione made no mention of harry giving defence against the dark arts lessons for two whole weeks after her original suggestion detentions with umbridge were finally over he doubted whether the words now etched into the back of his hand would ever fade entirely ron had had four more quidditch practices and not been shouted at during the last two and all three of them had managed to vanish their mice in transfiguration hermione had actually progressed to vanishing kittens before the subject was broached again on a wild blustery evening at the end of september when the three of them were sitting in the library looking up potion ingredients for snape 
 
 i was wondering hermione said suddenly whether thought any more about defence against the dark arts harry 
 
 course i have said harry grumpily forget it can we with that hag teaching us 
 
 i meant the idea ron and i had ron cast her an alarmed threatening kind of look she frowned at him oh all right the idea i had thenabout you teaching us 
 
 harry did not answer at once he pretended to be perusing a page of asiatic because he did not want to say what was in his mind 
 
 he had given the matter a great deal of thought over the past fortnight sometimes it seemed an insane idea just as it had on the night hermione had proposed it but at others he had found himself thinking about the spells that had served him best in his various encounters with dark creatures and death eatersfound himself in fact subconsciously planning lessons 
 
 well he said slowly when he could no longer pretend to find asiatic interesting yeah thought about it a bit 
 
 and said hermione eagerly 
 
 i dunno said harry playing for time he looked up at ron 
 
 i thought it was a good idea from the start said ron who seemed keener to join in this conversation now that he was sure harry was not going to start shouting again 
 
 harry shifted uncomfortably in his chair 
 
 you did listen to what i said about a load of it being luck you 
 
 yes harry said hermione gently but all the same no point pretending that not good at defence against the dark arts because you are you were the only person last year who could throw off the imperius curse completely you can produce a patronus you can do all sorts of stuff that wizards viktor always said 
 
 ron looked round at her so fast he appeared to crick his neck rubbing it he said yeah what did vicky say 
 
 ho ho said hermione in a bored voice he said harry knew how to do stuff even he and he was in the final year at durmstrang 
 
 ron was looking at hermione suspiciously 
 
 not still in contact with him are you 
 
 so what if i am said hermione coolly though her face was a little pink i can have a if i 
 
 he only want to be your said ron accusingly 
 
 hermione shook her head exasperatedly and ignoring ron who was continuing to watch her said to harry well what do you think will you teach us 
 
 just you and ron yeah 
 
 well said hermione looking a mite anxious again well now fly off the handle again harry please but i really think you ought to teach anyone who wants to learn i mean talking about defending ourselves against oh be pathetic ron it seem fair if we offer the chance to other people 
 
 harry considered this for a moment then said yeah but i doubt anyone except you two would want to be taught by me a nutter remember 
 
 well i think you might be surprised how many people would be interested in hearing what got to say said hermione seriously look she leaned towards him ron who was still watching her with a frown on his face leaned forwards to listen know the first weekend in a hogsmeade weekend how would it be if we tell anyone interested to meet us in the village and we can talk it over 
 
 why do we have to do it outside school said ron 
 
 because said hermione returning to the diagram of the chinese chomping cabbage she was copying i think umbridge would be very happy if she found out what we were up to 
 
 harry had been looking forward to the weekend trip into hogsmeade but there was one thing worrying him sirius had maintained a stony silence since he had appeared in the fire at the beginning of september harry knew they had made him angry by saying they want him to comebut he still worried from time to time that sirius might throw caution to the winds and turn up anyway what were they going to do if the great black dog came bounding up the street towards them in hogsmeade perhaps under the nose of draco malfoy 
 
 well you blame him for wanting to get out and about said ron when harry discussed his fears with him and hermione i mean been on the run for over two years he and i know that have been a laugh but at least he was free he and now just shut up all the time with that ghastly elf 
 
 hermione scowled at ron but otherwise ignored the slight on kreacher 
 
 the trouble is she said to harry until for comes out into the open sirius is going to have to stay hidden he i mean the stupid ministry going to realise sirius is innocent until they accept that been telling the truth about him all along and once the fools start catching real death eaters again be obvious sirius one i mean he got the mark for one thing 
 
 i reckon be stupid enough to turn up said ron bracingly go mad if he did and sirius listens to dumbledore even if he like what he hears 
 
 when harry continued to look worried hermione said listen ron and i have been sounding out people who we thought might want to learn some proper defence against the dark arts and there are a couple who seem interested told them to meet us in hogsmeade 
 
 right said harry vaguely his mind still on sirius 
 
 worry harry hermione said quietly got enough on your plate without sirius too 
 
 she was quite right of course he was barely keeping up with his homework though he was doing much better now that he was no longer spending every evening in detention with umbridge ron was even further behind with his work than harry because while they both had quidditch practice twice a week ron also had his prefect duties however hermione who was taking more subjects than either of them had not only finished all her homework but was also finding time to knit more elf clothes harry had to admit that she was getting better it was now almost always possible to distinguish between the hats and the socks 
 
 the morning of the hogsmeade visit dawned bright but windy alter breakfast they queued up in front of filch who matched their names to the long list of students who had permission from their parents or guardian to visit the village with a slight pang harry remembered that if it been for sirius he would not have been going at all 
 
 when harry reached filch the caretaker gave a great sniff as though trying to detect a whiff of something from harry then he gave a curt nod that set his jowls aquiver again and harry walked on out on to the stone steps and the cold sunlit day 
 
 erwhy was filch sniffing you asked ron as he harry and hermione set off at a brisk pace down the wide drive to the gates 
 
 i suppose he was checking for the smell of dungbombs said harry with a small laugh i forgot to tell you 
 
 and he recounted the story of sending his letter to sirius and filch bursting in seconds later demanding to see the letter to his slight surprise hermione found this story highly interesting much more indeed than he did himself 
 
 he said he was tipped off you were ordering dungbombs but who tipped him off 
 
 i dunno said harry shrugging maybe malfoy think it was a laugh 
 
 they walked between the tall stone pillars topped with winged boars and turned left on to the road into the village the wind whip ping their hair into their eyes 
 
 malfoy said hermione sceptically well yes maybe 
 
 and she remained deep in thought all the way into the outskirts of hogsmeade 
 
 where are we going anyway harry asked the three broomsticks 
 
 ohno said hermione coming out of her reverie no always packed and really noisy told the others to meet us in the head that other pub you know the one not on the main road i think a bit you know dodgy but students normally go in there so i think be overheard 
 
 they walked down the main street past wizarding joke shop where they were not surprised to see fred george and lee jordan past the post office from which owls issued at regular intervals and turned up a at the top of which stood a small inn a battered wooden sign hung from a rusty bracket over the door with a picture on it of a wild severed head leaking blood on to the white cloth around it the sign creaked in the wind as they approached all three of them hesitated outside the door 
 
 well come on said hermione slightly nervously harry led the way inside 
 
 it was not at all like the three broomsticks whose large bar gave an impression of gleaming warmth and cleanliness the head bar comprised one small dingy and very dirty room that smelled strongly of something that might have been goats the bay windows were so encrusted with grime that very little daylight could permeate the room which was lit instead with the stubs of candles sitting on rough wooden tables the floor seemed at first glance to be compressed earth though as harry stepped on to it he realised that there was stone beneath what seemed to be the accumulated filth of centuries 
 
 harry remembered hagrid mentioning this pub in his first year yeh get a lot o funny folk in the head he had said explaining how he had won a egg from a hooded stranger there at the time harry had wondered why hagrid had not found it odd that the stranger kept his face hidden throughout their encounter now he saw that keeping your face hidden was something of a fashion in the head there was a man at the bar whose whole head was wrapped in dirty grey bandages though he was still managing to gulp endless glasses of some smoking fiery substance through a slit over his mouth two figures shrouded in hoods sat at a table in one of the windows harry might have thought them dementors if they had not been talking in strong yorkshire accents and in a shadowy corner beside the fireplace sat a witch with a thick black veil that fell to her toes they could just see the tip of her nose because it caused the veil to protrude slightly 
 
 i know about this hermione harry muttered as they crossed to the bar he was looking particularly at the heavily veiled witch has it occurred to you umbridge might be under that 
 
 hermione cast an appraising eye over the veiled figure 
 
 umbridge is shorter than that woman she said quietly and anyway even if umbridge does come in here nothing she can do to stop us harry because double and the school rules not out of bounds i specifically asked professor flitwick whether students were allowed to come in the head and he said yes but he advised me strongly to bring our own glasses and looked up everything i can think of about study groups and homework groups and definitely allowed i just think a good idea if we parade what doing 
 
 no said harry drily especially as not exactly a homework group planning is it 
 
 the barman sidled towards them out of a back room he was a old man with a great deal of long grey hair and beard he was tall and thin and looked vaguely familiar to harry 
 
 what he grunted 
 
 three butterbeers please said hermione 
 
 the man reached beneath the counter and pulled up three very dusty very dirty bottles which he slammed on the bar 
 
 six sickles he said 
 
 get them said harry quickly passing over the silver the eyes travelled over harry resting for a fraction of a second on his scar then he turned away and deposited money in an ancient wooden till whose drawer slid open automatically to receive it harry ron and hermione retreated to the furthest table from the bar and sat down looking around the man in the dirty grey bandages rapped the counter with his knuckles and received another smoking drink from the barman 
 
 you know what ron murmured looking over at the bar with enthusiasm we could order anything we liked in here i bet that bloke would sell us anything he care always wanted to try firewhisky 
 
 youareaprefect snarled hermione 
 
 oh said ron the smile fading from his face yeah 
 
 so who did you say is supposed to be meeting us harry asked wrenching open the rusty top of his butterbeer and taking a swig 
 
 just a couple of people hermione repeated checking her watch and looking anxiously towards the door i told them to be here about now and sure they all know where it isoh look this might be them now 
 
 the door of the pub had opened a thick band of dusty sunlight split the room in two for a moment and then vanished blocked by the incoming rush of a crowd of people 
 
 first came neville with dean and lavender who were closely followed by parvati and padma patil with stomach did a cho and one of her girlfriends then on her own and looking so dreamy she might have walked in by accident luna lovegood then katie bell alicia spinnet and angelina johnson colin and dennis creevey ernie macmillan justin hannah abbott a hufflepuff girl with a long plait clown her back whose name harry did not know three ravenclaw boys he was pretty sure were called anthony goldstein michael corner and terry boot ginny closely followed by a tall skinny blond boy with an upturned nose whom harry recognised vaguely as being a member of the hufflepuff quidditch team and bringing up the rear fred and george weasley with their friend lee jordan all three of whom were carrying large paper bags crammed with merchandise 
 
 a couple of people said harry hoarsely to hermione a couple of people 
 
 yes well the idea seemed quite popular said hermione happily ron do you want to pull up some more chairs 
 
 the barman had frozen in the act of wiping out a glass with a rag so filthy it looked as though it had never been washed possibly he had never seen his pub so full 
 
 hi said fred reaching the bar first and counting his companions quickly could we have butterbeers please 
 
 the barman glared at him for a moment then throwing down his rag irritably as though he had been interrupted in something very important he started passing up dusty butterbeers from under the bar 
 
 cheers said fred handing them out cough up everyone i got enough gold for all of these 
 
 harry watched numbly as the large chattering group took their beers from fred and rummaged in their robes to find coins he could not imagine what all these people had turned up for until the horrible thought occurred to him that they might be expecting same kind of speech at which he rounded on hermione 
 
 what have you been telling people he said in a low voice what are they expecting 
 
 told you they just want to hear what got to say said hermione soothingly but harry continued to look at her so furiously that she added quickly you have to do anything yet speak to them first 
 
 hi harry said neville beaming and taking a seat opposite him 
 
 harry tried to smile back but did not speak his mouth was exceptionally dry cho had just smiled at him and sat down on right her friend who had curly hair did not smile but gave harry a thoroughly mistrustful look which plainly told him that given her way she would not be here at all 
 
 in twos and threes the new arrivals settled around harry ron and hermione some looking rather excited others curious luna lovegood gazing dreamily into space when everybody had pulled up a chair the chatter died out every eye was upon harry 
 
 er said hermione her voice slightly higher than usual out of nerves wellerhi 
 
 the group focused its attention on her instead though eyes continued to dart back regularly to harry 
 
 well erm well you know why here erm well harry here had the ideai mean harry had thrown her a sharp look i had the ideathat it might be good if people who wanted to study defence against the dark artsand i mean really study it you know not the rubbish that umbridge is doing with us voice became suddenly much stronger and more confident because nobody could call that defence against the dark arts hear hear said anthony goldstein and hermione looked heartened well i thought it would be good if we well took matters into our own hands 
 
 she paused looked sideways at harry and went on and by that i mean learning how to defend ourselves properly not just in theory but doing the real spells 
 
 you want to pass your defence against the dark arts owl too though i bet said michael corner who was watching her closely 
 
 of course i do said hermione at once but more than that i want to be properly trained in defence because because she took a great breath and finished because lord voldemort is back 
 
 the reaction was immediate and predictable friend shrieked and slopped butterbeer down herself terry boot gave a kind of involuntary twitch padma patil shuddered and neville gave an odd yelp that he managed to turn into a cough all of them however looked fixedly even eagerly at harry 
 
 well the plan anyway said hermione if you want to join us we need to decide how going to 
 
 the proof back said the blond hufflepuff player in a rather aggressive voice 
 
 well dumbledore believes it hermione began 
 
 you mean dumbledore believes him said the blond boy nodding at harry 
 
 who are you said ron rather rudely 
 
 zacharias smith said the boy and i think got the right to know exactly what makes him say back 
 
 look said hermione intervening swiftly really not what this meeting was supposed to be about 
 
 ok hermione said harry 
 
 it had just dawned on him why there were so many people there he thought hermione should have seen this coming some of these peoplemaybe even most of themhad turned up in the hopes of hearing story firsthand 
 
 what makes me say back he repeated looking zacharias straight in the face i saw him but dumbledore told the whole school what happened last year and if you believe him you believe me and not wasting an afternoon trying to convince anyone 
 
 the whole group seemed to have held its breath while harry spoke harry had the impression that even the barman was listening he was wiping the same glass with the filthy rag making it steadily dirtier 
 
 zacharias said dismissively all dumbledore told us last year was that cedric diggory got killed by and that you brought body back to hogwarts he give us details he tell us exactly how diggory got murdered i think all like to know 
 
 if come to hear exactly what it looks like when voldemort murders someone i help you harry said his temper always so close to the surface these days was rising again he did not take his eyes from zacharias aggressive face and was determined not to look at cho i want to talk about cedric diggory all right so if what here for you might as well clear out 
 
 he cast an angry look in direction this was he felt all her fault she had decided to display him like some sort of freak and of course they had all turned up to see just now wild his story was but none of them left their seats not even zacharias smith though he continued to gaze intently at harry 
 
 so said hermione her voice very again so like i was saying if you want to learn some defence then we need to work out how going to do it how often going to meet and where going to 
 
 is it true interrupted the girl with the long plait down her back looking at harry that you can produce a patronus 
 
 there was a murmur of interest around the group at this 
 
 yeah said harry slightly defensively 
 
 a corporeal patronus 
 
 the phrase stirred something in memory 
 
 eryou know madam bones do you he asked 
 
 the girl smiled 
 
 my auntie she said susan bones she told me about your hearing sois it really true you make a stag patronus 
 
 yes said harry 
 
 blimey harry said lee looking deeply impressed i never knew that 
 
 mum told ron not to spread it around said fred grinning at harry she said you got enough attention as it was 
 
 not wrong mumbled harry and a couple of people laughed 
 
 the veiled witch sitting alone shifted very slightly in her seat 
 
 and did you kill a basilisk with that sword in office demanded terry boot what one of the portraits on the wall told me when i was in there last year 
 
 eryeah i did yeah said harry 
 
 justin whistled the creevey brothers exchanged awestruck looks and lavender brown said wow softly harry was feeling slightly hot around the collar now he was determinedly looking anywhere but at cho 
 
 and in our first year said neville to the group at large he saved that philological stone 
 
 hissed hermione 
 
 yes thatfrom finished neville 
 
 hannah abbotts eyes were as round as galleons 
 
 and not to mention said cho eyes snapped across to her she was looking at him smiling his stomach did another somersault all the tasks he had to get through in the triwizard tournament last yeargetting past dragons and merpeople and acromantula and things 
 
 there was a murmur of impressed agreement around the table insides were squirming he was trying to arrange his face so that he did not look too pleased with himself the fact that cho had just praised him made it much much harder for him to say the thing he had sworn to himself he would tell them 
 
 look he said and everyone fell silent at once i i want to sound like trying to be modest or anything but i had a lot of help with all that stuff 
 
 not with the dragon you said michael corner at once that was a seriously cool bit of flying 
 
 yeah well said harry feeling it would be churlish to disagree 
 
 and nobody helped you get rid of those dementors this summer said susan bones 
 
 no said harry no ok i know i did bits of it without help but the point trying to make is 
 
 are you trying to weasel out of showing us any of this stuff said zacharias smith 
 
 an idea said ron loudly before harry could speak why you shut your mouth 
 
 perhaps the word weasel had affected ron particularly strongly in any case he was now looking at zacharias as though he would like nothing better than to thump him zacharias flushed 
 
 well all turned up to learn from him and now telling us he really do any of it he said 
 
 not what he said snarled fred 
 
 would you like us to clean out your ears for you enquired greorge pulling a long and metal instrument from inside one of the bags 
 
 or any part of your body really not fussy where we stick this said fred 
 
 yes well said hermione hastily moving on the point is are we agreed we want to take lessons from harry 
 
 there was a murmur of general agreement zacharias folded his arms and said nothing though perhaps this was because he was too busy keeping an eye on the instrument in hand 
 
 right said hermione looking relieved that something had at last been settled well then the next question is how often we do it i really think any point in meeting less than once a week 
 
 hang on said angelina we need to make sure this clash with our quidditch practice 
 
 no said cho nor with ours 
 
 nor ours added zacharias smith 
 
 sure we can find a night that suits everyone said hermione slightly impatiently but you know this is rather important talking about learning to defend ourselves against death eaters 
 
 well said barked ernie macmillan who harry had been expecting to speak long before this personally i think this is really important possibly more important than anything else do this year even with our owls coming up 
 
 he looked around impressively as though waiting for people to cry surely not when nobody spoke he went on i personally am at a loss to see why the ministry has foisted such a useless teacher on us at this critical period obviously they are in denial about the return of but to give us a teacher who is trying to actively prevent us from using defensive spells 
 
 we think the reason umbridge want us trained in defence against the dark arts said hermione is that got some some mad idea that dumbledore could use the students in the school as a kind of private army she thinks mobilise us against the ministry 
 
 nearly everybody looked stunned at this news everybody except luna lovegood who piped up well that makes sense after all cornelius fudge has got his own private army 
 
 what said harry completely thrown by this unexpected piece of information 
 
 yes got an army of heliopaths said luna solemnly 
 
 no he snapped hermione 
 
 yes he has said luna 
 
 what are heliopaths asked neville looking blank 
 
 spirits of fire said luna her protuberant eyes widening so that she looked madder than ever great tall flaming creatures that gallop across the ground burning everything in front of 
 
 they exist neville said hermione tartly 
 
 oh yes they do said luna angrily 
 
 sorry but the proof of that snapped hermione 
 
 there are plenty of accounts just because so you need to have everything shoved under your nose before you 
 
 hem hem said ginny in such a good imitation of professor umbridge that several people looked around in alarm and then laughed we trying to decide how often going to meet and have defence lessons 
 
 yes said hermione at once yes we were right ginny 
 
 well once a week sounds cool said lee jordan 
 
 as long as began angelina 
 
 yes yes we know about the quidditch said hermione in a tense voice well the other thing to decide is where going to meet 
 
 this was rather more difficult the whole group fell silent 
 
 library suggested katie bell after a few moments 
 
 i see madam pince being too chuffed with us doing jinxes in the library said harry 
 
 maybe an unused classroom said dean 
 
 yeah said ron mcgonagall might let us have hers she did when harry was practising for the tri wizard 
 
 but harry was pretty certain that mcgonagall would not be so accommodating this time for all that hermione had said about study and homework groups being allowed he had the distinct feeling that this one might be considered a lot more rebellious 
 
 right well try to find somewhere said hermione send a message round to everybody when got a time and a place for the first meeting 
 
 she rummaged in her bag and produced parchment and a quill then hesitated rather as though she was steeling herself to say something 
 
 ii think everybody should write their name down just so we know who was here but i also think she took a deep breath that we all ought to agree not to shout about what doing so if you sign agreeing not to tell umbridge or anybody else what up to 
 
 fred reached out for the parchment and cheerfully wrote his signature but harry noticed at once that several people looked less than happy at the prospect of putting their names on the list 
 
 er said zacharias slowly not taking the parchment that george was trying to pass to him well sure ernie will tell me when the meeting is 
 
 but ernie was looking rather hesitant about signing too hermione raised her eyebrows at him 
 
 iwell we are prefects ernie burst out and if this list was found well i mean to say you said yourself if umbridge finds out 
 
 you just said this group was the most important thing do this year harry reminded him 
 
 iyes said ernie yes i do believe that just 
 
 ernie do you really think leave that list lying around said hermione testily 
 
 no no of course not said ernie looking slightly less anxious iyes of course sign 
 
 nobody raised objections after ernie though harry saw friend give her a rather reproachful look before adding her own name when the last personzacharias had signed hermione took the parchment back and slipped it carefully into her bag there was an odd feeling in the group now it was as though they had just signed some kind of contract 
 
 well ticking on said fred briskly getting to his feet george lee and i have got items of a sensitive nature to purchase be seeing you all later 
 
 in twos and threes the rest of the group took their leave too 
 
 cho made rather a business of fastening the catch on her bag before leaving her long dark curtain of hair swinging forwards to hide her face but her friend stood beside her arms folded clicking her tongue so that cho had little choice but to leave with her as her friend ushered her through the door cho looked back and waved at harry 
 
 well i think that went quite well said hermione happily as she harry and ron walked out of the head into the bright sunlight a few moments later harry and ron were clutching their bottles of butterbeer 
 
 that zacharias a wart said ron who was glowering after the figure of smith just discernible in the distance 
 
 i like him much either admitted hermione but he overheard me talking to ernie and hannah at the hufflepuff table and he seemed really interested in coming so what could i say but the more people the better reallyi mean michael corner and his friends have come if he been going out with ginny 
 
 ron who had been draining the last few drops from his butterbeer bottle gagged and sprayed butterbeer down his front 
 
 what spluttered ron outraged his ears now resembling curls of raw beef going out withmy goingwhat mean michael corner 
 
 well why he and his friends came i thinkwell obviously interested in learning defence but if ginny told michael what was going on 
 
 when did this when did she 
 
 they met at the yule ball and got together at the end of last year said hermione composedly they had turned into the high street and she paused outside quill shop where there was a handsome display of pheasant feather quills in the window hmm i could do with a new quill 
 
 she turned into the shop harry and ron followed her 
 
 which one was michael corner ron demanded furiously 
 
 the dark one said hermione 
 
 i like him said ron at once 
 
 big surprise said hermione under her breath 
 
 but said ron following hermione along a row of quills in copper pots i thought ginny fancied harry 
 
 hermione looked at him rather pityingly and shook her head 
 
 ginny used to fancy harry but she gave up on him months ago not that she like you of course she added kindly to harry while she examined a long black and gold quill 
 
 harry whose head was still full of parting wave did not find this subject quite as interesting as ron who was positively quivering with indignation but it did bring something home to him that until now he had not really registered 
 
 so why she talks now he asked hermione she never used to talk in front of me 
 
 exactly said hermione yes i think have this one 
 
 she went up to the counter and handed over fifteen sickles and two knuts with ron still breathing down her neck 
 
 ron she said severely as she turned and trod on his feet this is exactly why ginny told you seeing michael she knew take it badly so harp on about it for sake 
 
 what mean taking anything badly not going to harp on about anything ron continued to chunter under his breath all the way down the street 
 
 hermione rolled her eyes at harry and then said in an undertone while ron was still muttering imprecations about michael corner and talking about michael and ginny what about cho and you 
 
 what mean said harry quickly 
 
 it was as though boiling water was rising rapidly inside him a burning sensation that was causing his face to smart in the coldhad he been that obvious 
 
 well said hermione smiling slightly she just keep her eyes off you could she 
 
 harry had never before appreciated just how beautiful the village of hogsmeade was 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter sixteen a very frosty christmascontents prev chapter next chapter 
 so snape was offering to help him he was definitely offering to help him 
 
 if you ask that once more said harry going to stick this sprout 
 
 only checking said ron they were standing alone at the kitchen sink peeling a mountain of sprouts for mrs weasley snow was drifting past the window in front of them 
 
 yes snape was offering to help him said harry he said promised mother to protect him that made an unbreakable oath or something 
 
 an unbreakable vow said ron looking stunned nah he have are you sure 
 
 yes sure said harry why what does it mean 
 
 well you break an unbreakable vow 
 
 worked that much out for myself funnily enough what happens if you break it then 
 
 you die said ron simply fred and george tried to get me to make one when i was about five i nearly did too i was holding hands with fred and everything when dad found us he went mental said ron with a reminiscent gleam in his eyes only time ever seen dad as angry as mum fred reckons his left buttock has never been the same since 
 
 yeah well passing over left buttock 
 
 i beg your pardon said voice as the twins entered the kitchen 
 
 aaah george look at this using knives and everything bless them 
 
 be seventeen in two and a bit months time said ron grumpily and then be able to do it by magic 
 
 but meanwhile said george sitting down at the kitchen table and putting his feet up on it we can enjoy watching you demonstrate the correct use of a 
 
 you made me do that said ron angrily sucking his cut thumb you wait when seventeen 
 
 sure dazzle us all with hitherto unsuspected magical skills yawned fred 
 
 and speaking of hitherto unsuspected skills ronald said george what is this we hear from ginny about you and a young lady calledunless our information is faultylavender brown 
 
 ron turned a little pink but did not look displeased as he turned back to the sprouts mind your own business 
 
 what a snappy retort said fred i really know how you think of them no what we wanted to know was how did it happen 
 
 what mean 
 
 did she have an accident or something 
 
 what 
 
 well how did she sustain such extensive brain damage careful now 
 
 mrs weasley entered the room just in time to see ron throw the sprout knife at fred who had turned it into a paper airplane with one lazy flick of his wand 
 
 ron she said furiously you ever let me see you throwing knives again 
 
 i said ron let you see he added under his breath as he turned back to the sprout mountain 
 
 fred george sorry dears but remus is arriving tonight so bill will have to squeeze in with you two 
 
 no problem said george 
 
 then as charlie coming home that just leaves harry and ron in the attic and if fleur shares with ginny 
 
 make christmas muttered fred 
 
 everyone should be comfortable well have a bed anyway said mrs weasley sounding slightly harassed 
 
 percy definitely not showing his ugly face then asked fred 
 
 mrs weasley turned away before she answered 
 
 no busy i expect at the ministry 
 
 or the biggest prat said fred as mrs weasley left the kitchen one of the two well get going then george 
 
 what are you two up to asked ron cant you help us with these sprouts you could just use your wand and then be free too 
 
 no i think we can do that said fred seriously very stuff learning to peel sprouts without magic makes you appreciate how difficult it is for muggles and squibs 
 
 and if you want people to help you ron added george throwing the paper airplane at him i chuck knives at them just a little hint off to the village a very pretty girl working in the paper shop who thinks my card tricks are something marvelous almost like real magic 
 
 gits said ron darkly watching fred and george setting off across the snowy yard only taken them ten seconds and then we gone too 
 
 i said harry i promised dumbledore i wander off while staying here 
 
 oh yeah said ron he peeled a few more sprouts and then said are you going to tell dumbledore what you heard snape and malfoy saying to each other 
 
 yep said harry going to tell anyone who can put a stop to it and top of the list i might have another word with your dad too 
 
 pity you hear what actually doing though 
 
 i have done could i that was the whole point he was refusing to tell snape 
 
 there was silence for a moment or two then ron said course you know what all say dad and dumbledore and all of them say snape really trying to help malfoy he was just trying to find out what up to 
 
 they hear him said harry flatly no that good an actor not even snape 
 
 yeah just saying though said ron 
 
 harry turned to face him frowning 
 
 you think right though 
 
 yeah i do said ron hastily seriously i do but all convinced in the order they 
 
 harry said nothing it had already occurred to him that this would be the most likely objection to his new evidence he could hear hermione now 
 
 obviously harry he was pretending to offer help so he could trick malfoy into telling him what doing 
 
 this was pure imagination however as he had had no opportunity to tell hermione what he had overheard she had disappeared from party before he returned to it or so he had been informed by an irate mclaggen and she had already gone to bed by the time he returned to the common room as he and ron had left for the burrow early the next day he had barely had time to wish her a happy christmas and to tell her that he had some very important news when they got back from the holidays he was not entirely sure that she had heard him though ron and lavender had been saying a thoroughly goodbye just behind him at the time 
 
 still even hermione would not be able to deny one thing malfoy was definitely up to something and snape knew it so harry felt fully justified in saying i told you so which he had done several times to ron already 
 
 harry did not get the chance to speak to mr weasley who was working very long hours at the ministry until christmas eve night the weasleys and their guests were sitting in the living room which ginny had decorated so lavishly that it was rather like sitting in a explosion fred george harry and ron were the only ones who knew that the angel on top of the tree was actually a garden gnome that had bitten fred on the ankle as he pulled up carrots for christmas dinner stupefied painted gold stuffed into a miniature tutu and with small wings glued to his back it glowered down at them all the ugliest angel harry had ever seen with a large bald head like a potato and rather hairy feet 
 
 they were all supposed to be listening to a christmas broadcast by mrs favorite singer celestina warbeck whose voice was warbling out of the large wooden wireless set fleur who seemed to find celestina very dull was talking so loudly in the corner that a scowling mrs weasley kept pointing her wand at the volume control so that celestina grew louder and louder under cover of a particularly jazzy number called a cauldron full of hot strong love fred and george started a game of exploding snap with ginny ron kept shooting bill and fleur covert looks as though hoping to pick up tips meanwhile remus lupin who was thinner and more than ever was sitting beside the fire staring into its depths as though he could not hear voice 
 
 oh come and stir my cauldron 
 
 and if you do it right 
 
 boil you up some hot strong love 
 
 to keep you warm tonight 
 
 we danced to this when we were eighteen said mrs weasley wiping her eyes on her knitting do you remember arthur 
 
 mphf said mr weasley whose head had been nodding over the satsuma he was peeling oh yes marvelous tune 
 
 with an effort he sat up a little straighter and looked around at harry who was sitting next to him 
 
 sorry about this he said jerking his head toward the wireless as celestina broke into the chorus be over soon 
 
 no problem said harry grinning has it been busy at the ministry 
 
 very said mr weasley i mind if we were getting anywhere but of the three arrests made in the last couple of months i doubt that one of them is a genuine death eateronly repeat that harry he added quickly looking much more awake all of a sudden 
 
 not still holding stan shunpike are they asked harry 
 
 afraid so said mr weasley i know tried appealing directly to scrimgeour about stan i mean anybody who has actually interviewed him agrees that about as much a death eater as this satsuma but the top levels want to look as though making some progress and three arrests sounds better than three mistaken arrests and releases but again this is all top secret 
 
 i say anything said harry he hesitated for a moment wondering how best to embark on what he wanted to say as he marshaled his thoughts celestina warbeck began a ballad called you charmed the heart right out of me 
 
 mr weasley you know what i told you at the station when we were setting off for school 
 
 i checked harry said mr weasley at once i went and searched the malfoys house there was nothing either broken or whole that have been there 
 
 yeah i know i saw in the prophet that looked but this is something different well something more 
 
 and he told mr weasley everything he had overheard between malfoy and snape as harry spoke he saw head turn a little toward him taking in every word when he had finished there was silence except for crooning 
 
 oh my poor heart where has it gone 
 
 left me for a spell 
 
 has it occurred to you harry said mr weasley that snape was simply pretending 
 
 pretending to offer help so that he could find out what up to said harry quickly yeah i thought say that but how do we know 
 
 it our business to know said lupin unexpectedly he had turned his back on the fire now and faced harry across mr weasley business dumbledore trusts severus and that ought to be good enough for all of us 
 
 but said harry just sayjust say wrong about snape 
 
 people have said it many times it comes down to whether or not you trust judgment i do therefore i trust severus 
 
 but dumbledore can make mistakes argued harry he says it himself and you 
 
 he looked lupin straight in the eye 
 
 do you honestly like snape 
 
 i neither like nor dislike severus said lupin no harry i am speaking the truth he added as harry pulled a skeptical expression we shall never be bosom friends perhaps after all that happened between james and sirius and severus there is too much bitterness there but i do not forget that during the year i taught at hogwarts severus made the wolfsbane potion for me every month made it perfectly so that i did not have to suffer as i usually do at the full moon 
 
 but he accidentally let it slip that a werewolf so you had to leave said harry angrily 
 
 lupin shrugged 
 
 the news would have leaked out anyway we both know he wanted my job but he could have wreaked much worse damage on me by tampering with the potion he kept me healthy i must be grateful 
 
 maybe he dare mess with the potion with dumbledore watching him said harry 
 
 you are determined to hate him harry said lupin with a faint smile and i understand with james as your father with sirius as your godfather you have inherited an old prejudice by all means tell dumbledore what you have told arthur and me but do not expect him to share your view of the matter do not even expect him to be surprised by what you tell him it might have been on orders that severus questioned draco 
 
 and now torn it quite apart 
 
 thank you to give back my heart 
 
 celestina ended her song on a very long note and loud applause issued out of the wireless which mrs weasley joined in with enthusiastically 
 
 eez eet over said fleur loudly thank goodness what an orrible 
 
 shall we have a nightcap then asked mr weasley loudly leaping to his feet who wants eggnog 
 
 what have you been up to lately harry asked lupin as mr weasley bustled off to fetch the eggnog and everybody else stretched and broke into conversation 
 
 oh been underground said lupin almost literally why i been able to write harry sending letters to you would have been something of a 
 
 what do you mean 
 
 been living among my fellows my equals said lupin werewolves he added at look of incomprehension nearly all of them are on side dumbledore wanted a spy and here i was 
 
 he sounded a little bitter and perhaps realized it for he smiled more warmly as he went on i am not complaining it is necessary work and who can do it better than i however it has been difficult gaining their trust i bear the unmistakable signs of having tried to live among wizards you see whereas they have shunned normal society and live on the margins stealingand sometimes killingto eat 
 
 how come they like voldemort 
 
 they think that under his rule they will have a better life said lupin and it is hard to argue with greyback out there 
 
 greyback 
 
 you heard of him hands closed convulsively in his lap fenrir greyback is perhaps the most savage werewolf alive today he regards it as his mission in life to bite and to contaminate as many people as possible he wants to create enough werewolves to overcome the wizards voldemort has promised him prey in return for his services greyback specializes in children bite them young he says and raise them away from their parents raise them to hate normal wizards voldemort has threatened to unleash him upon sons and daughters it is a threat that usually produces good results 
 
 lupin paused and then said it was greyback who bit me 
 
 what said harry astonished whenwhen you were a kid you mean 
 
 yes my father had offended him i did not know for a very long time the identity of the werewolf who had attacked me i even felt pity for him thinking that he had had no control knowing by then how it felt to transform but greyback is not like that at the full moon he positions himself close to victims ensuring that he is near enough to strike he plans it all and this is the man voldemort is using to marshal the werewolves i cannot pretend that my particular brand of reasoned argument is making much headway against insistence that we werewolves deserve blood that we ought to revenge ourselves on normal people 
 
 but you are normal said harry fiercely just got aa problem 
 
 lupin burst out laughing 
 
 sometimes you remind me a lot of james he called it my furry little problem in company many people were under the impression that i owned a badly behaved rabbit 
 
 he accepted a glass of eggnog from mr weasley with a word of thanks looking slightly more cheerful harry meanwhile felt a rush of excitement this last mention of his father had reminded him that there was something he had been looking forward to asking lupin 
 
 have you ever heard of someone called the prince 
 
 the what 
 
 prince said harry watching him closely for signs of recognition 
 
 there are no wizarding princes said lupin now smiling is this a title thinking of adopting i should have thought being the chosen one would be enough 
 
 nothing to do with me said harry indignantly the prince is someone who used to go to hogwarts got his old potions book he wrote spells all over it spells he invented one of them was levicorpus 
 
 oh that one had a great vogue during my time at hogwarts said lupin reminiscently there were a few months in my fifth year when you move for being hoisted into the air by your ankle 
 
 my dad used it said harry i saw him in the pensieve he used it on snape 
 
 he tried to sound casual as though this was a throwaway comment of no real importance but he was not sure he had achieved the right effect smile was a little too understanding 
 
 yes he said but he the only one as i say it was very popular you know how these spells come and go 
 
 but it sounds like it was invented while you were at school harry persisted 
 
 not necessarily said lupin jinxes go in and out of fashion like everything else he looked into face and then said quietly james was a harry and i promise you he never asked us to call him prince 
 
 abandoning pretense harry said and it sirius or you 
 
 definitely not 
 
 oh harry stared into the fire i just thoughtwell helped me out a lot in potions classes the prince has 
 
 how old is this book harry 
 
 i dunno never checked 
 
 well perhaps that will give you some clue as to when the prince was at hogwarts said lupin 
 
 shortly after this fleur decided to imitate celestina singing a cauldron full of hot strong love which was taken by everyone once they had glimpsed mrs expression to be the cue to go to bed harry and ron climbed all the way up to attic bedroom where a camp bed had been added for harry 
 
 ron fell asleep almost immediately but harry delved into his trunk and pulled out his copy of advanced before getting into bed there he turned its pages searching until he finally found at the front of the book the date that it had been published it was nearly fifty years old neither his father nor his friends had been at hogwarts fifty years ago feeling disappointed harry threw the book back into his trunk turned off the lamp and rolled over thinking of werewolves and snape stan shunpike and the prince and finally falling into an uneasy sleep full of creeping shadows and the cries of bitten children 
 
 got to be joking 
 
 harry woke with a start to find a bulging stocking lying over the end of his bed he put on his glasses and looked around the tiny window was almost completely obscured with snow and in front of it ron was sitting bolt upright in bed and examining what appeared to be a thick gold chain 
 
 that asked harry 
 
 from lavender said ron sounding revolted she honestly think wear 
 
 harry looked more closely and let out a shout of laughter dangling from the chain in large gold letters were the words my sweetheart 
 
 nice he said classy you should definitely wear it in front of fred and george 
 
 if you tell them said ron shoving the necklace out of sight under his pillow 
 
 stutter at me said harry grinning come on would i 
 
 how could she think like something like that though ron demanded of thin air looking rather shocked 
 
 well think back said harry have you ever let it slip that like to go out in public with the words my sweetheart round your neck 
 
 well we really talk much said ron mainly 
 
 snogging said harry 
 
 well yeah said ron he hesitated a moment then said is hermione really going out with mclaggen 
 
 i dunno said harry they were at party together but i think it went that well 
 
 ron looked slightly more cheerful as he delved deeper into his stocking 
 
 presents included a sweater with a large golden snitch worked onto the front by mrs weasley a large box of weasleys wizard wheezes products from the twins and a slightly damp package that came with a label reading to master from kreacher 
 
 harry stared at it reckon this is safe to open he asked 
 
 be anything dangerous all our still being searched at the ministry replied ron though he was eyeing the parcel suspiciously 
 
 i think of giving kreacher anything do people usually give their christmas presents asked harry prodding the parcel cautiously 
 
 hermione would said ron but wait and see what it is before you start feeling guilty 
 
 a moment later harry had given a loud yell and leapt out of his camp bed the package contained a large number of maggots 
 
 nice said ron roaring with laughter very thoughtful 
 
 rather have them than that necklace said harry which sobered ron up at once 
 
 everybody was wearing new sweaters when they all sat down for christmas lunch everyone except fleur on whom it appeared mrs weasley had not wanted to waste one and mrs weasley herself who was sporting a midnight blue hat glittering with what looked like tiny starlike diamonds and a spectacular golden necklace 
 
 fred and george gave them to me they beautiful 
 
 well we find we appreciate you more and more mum now washing our own socks said george waving an airy hand parsnips remus 
 
 harry got a maggot in your hair said ginny cheerfully leaning across the table to pick it out harry felt goose bumps erupt up his neck that had nothing to do with the maggot 
 
 ow orrible said fleur with an affected little shudder 
 
 yes it said ron gravy fleur 
 
 in his eagerness to help her he knocked the gravy boat flying bill waved his wand and the gravy soared up in the air and returned meekly to the boat 
 
 you are as bad as zat tonks said fleur to ron when she had finished kissing bill in thanks she is always knocking 
 
 i invited dear tonks to come along today said mrs weasley setting down the carrots with unnecessary force and glaring at fleur but she come have you spoken to her lately remus 
 
 no i been in contact with anybody very much said lupin but tonks has got her own family to go to she 
 
 hmmm said mrs weasley maybe i got the impression she was planning to spend christmas alone actually 
 
 she gave lupin an annoyed look as though it was all his fault she was getting fleur for a instead of tonks but harry glancing across at fleur who was now feeding bill bits of turkey off her own fork thought that mrs weasley was fighting a battle he was however reminded of a question he had with regard to tonks and who better to ask than lupin the man who knew all about patronuses 
 
 patronus has changed its form he told him snape said so anyway i know that could happen why would your patronus change 
 
 lupin took his time chewing his turkey and swallowing before saying slowly sometimes a great shock an emotional upheaval 
 
 it looked big and it had four legs said harry struck by a sudden thought and lowering his voice hey it be 
 
 arthur said mrs weasley suddenly she had risen from her chair her hand was pressed over her heart and she was staring out of the kitchen window percy 
 
 what 
 
 mr weasley looked around everybody looked quickly at the window ginny stood up for a better look there sure enough was percy weasley striding across the snowy yard his glasses glinting in the sunlight he was not however alone 
 
 arthur with the minister 
 
 and sure enough the man harry had seen in the daily prophet was following along in wake limping slightly his mane of graying hair and his black cloak flecked with snow before any of them could say anything before mr and mrs weasley could do more than exchange stunned looks the back door opened and there stood percy 
 
 there was a painful silence then percy said rather stiffly merry christmas mother 
 
 oh percy said mrs weasley and she threw herself into his arms 
 
 rufus scrimgeour paused in the doorway leaning on his walking stick and smiling as he observed this affecting scene 
 
 you must forgive this intrusion he said when mrs weasley looked around at him beaming and wiping her eyes percy and i were in the vicinityworking you know and he resist dropping in and seeing you all 
 
 but percy showed no sign of wanting to greet any of the rest of the family he stood and and stared over everybody heads mr weasley fred and george were all observing him 
 
 please come in sit down minister fluttered mrs weasley straightening her hat have a little purkey or some tooding i mean 
 
 no no my dear molly said scrimgeour harry guessed that he had checked her name with percy before they entered the house i want to intrude be here at all if percy wanted to see you all so badly 
 
 oh perce said mrs weasley tearfully reaching up to kiss him 
 
 only looked in for five minutes so have a stroll around the yard while you catch up with percy no no i assure you i want to butt in well if anybody cared to show me your charming garden ah that young finished why he take a stroll with me 
 
 the atmosphere around the table changed perceptibly everybody looked from scrimgeour to harry nobody seemed to find pretense that he did not know name convincing or find it natural that he should be chosen to accompany the minister around the garden when ginny fleur and george also had clean plates 
 
 yeah all right said harry into the silence 
 
 he was not fooled for all talk that they had just been in the area that percy wanted to look up his family this must be the real reason that they had come so that scrimgeour could speak to harry alone 
 
 fine he said quietly as he passed lupin who had half risen from his chair fine he added as mr weasley opened his mouth to speak 
 
 wonderful said scrimgeour standing back to let harry pass through the door ahead of him just take a turn around the garden and percy and be off carry on everyone 
 
 harry walked across the yard toward the weasleys overgrown garden scrimgeour limping slightly at his side he had harry knew been head of the auror office he looked tough and very different from portly fudge in his bowler hat 
 
 charming said scrimgeour stopping at the garden fence and looking out over the snowy lawn and the indistinguishable plants charming 
 
 harry said nothing he could tell that scrimgeour was watching him 
 
 wanted to meet you for a very long time said scrimgeour after a few moments did you know that 
 
 no said harry truthfully 
 
 oh yes for a very long time but dumbledore has been very protective of you said scrimgeour natural of course natural after what been through especially what happened at the ministry 
 
 he waited for harry to say something but harry did not oblige so he went on i have been hoping for an occasion to talk to you ever since i gained office but dumbledore hasmost understandably as i sayprevented this 
 
 still harry said nothing waiting 
 
 the rumors that have flown around said scrimgeour well of course we both know how these stories get distorted all these whispers of a prophecy of you being the chosen one 
 
 they were getting near it now harry thought the reason scrimgeour was here 
 
 i assume that dumbledore has discussed these matters with you 
 
 harry deliberated wondering whether he ought to lie or not he looked at the little gnome prints all around the flowerbeds and the patch that marked the spot where fred had caught the gnome now wearing the tutu at the top of the christmas tree finally he decided on the truth or a bit of it 
 
 yeah discussed it 
 
 have you have you said scrimgeour harry could see out of the corner of his eye scrimgeour squinting at him so he pretended to be very interested in a gnome that had just poked its head out from underneath a frozen rhododendron and what has dumbledore told you harry 
 
 sorry but between us said harry 
 
 he kept his voice as pleasant as he could and tone too was light and friendly as he said oh of course if a question of confidences i want you to divulge no no and in any case does it really matter whether you are the chosen one or not 
 
 harry had to mull that one over for a few seconds before responding 
 
 i really know what you mean minister 
 
 well of course to you it will matter enormously said scrimgeour with a laugh but to the wizarding community at large all perception it what people believe important 
 
 harry said nothing he thought he saw dimly where they were heading but he was not going to help scrimgeour get there the gnome under the rhododendron was now digging for worms at its roots and harry kept his eyes fixed upon it 
 
 people believe you are the chosen one you see said scrimgeour they think you quite the herowhich of course you arc harry chosen or not how many times have you faced now well anyway he pressed on without waiting for a reply the point is you are a symbol of hope for many harry the idea that there is somebody out there who might be able who might even be destined to destroy naturally it gives people a lift and i help but feel that once you realize this you might consider it well almost a duty to stand alongside the ministry and give everyone a boost 
 
 the gnome had just managed to get hold of a worm it was now tugging very hard on it trying to get it out of the frozen ground harry was silent so long that scrimgeour said looking from harry to the gnome funny little chaps they but what say you harry 
 
 i exactly understand what you want said harry slowly stand alongside the ministry what does that mean 
 
 oh well nothing at all onerous i assure you said scrimgeour if you were to be seen popping in and out of the ministry from time to time for instance that would give the right impression and of course while you were there you would have ample opportunity to speak to gawain robards my successor as head of the auror office dolores umbridge has told me that you cherish an ambition to become an auror well that could be arranged very easily 
 
 harry felt anger bubbling in the pit of his stomach so dolores umbridge was still at the ministry was she 
 
 so basically he said as though he just wanted to clarify a few points like to give the impression that working for the ministry 
 
 it would give everyone a lift to think you were more involved harry said scrimgeour sounding relieved that harry had cottoned on so quickly the chosen one you know all about giving people hope the feeling that exciting things are happening 
 
 but if i keep running in and out of the ministry said harry still endeavoring to keep his voice friendly that seem as though i approve of what the up to 
 
 well said scrimgeour frowning slightly well yes partly why like 
 
 no i think work said harry pleasantly you see i like some of the things the doing locking up stan shunpike for instance 
 
 scrimgeour did not speak for a moment but his expression hardened instantly 
 
 i would not expect you to understand he said and he was not as successful at keeping anger out of his voice as harry had been these are dangerous times and certain measures need to be taken you are sixteen years old 
 
 a lot older than sixteen and he think stan should be in azkaban either said harry making stan a scapegoat just like you want to make me a mascot 
 
 they looked at each other long and hard finally scrimgeour said with no pretense at warmth i see you preferlike your hero dumbledoreto disassociate yourself from the ministry 
 
 i want to be used said harry 
 
 some would say your duty to be used by the ministry 
 
 yeah and others might say your duty to check that people really are death eaters before you chuck them in prison said harry his temper rising now doing what barty crouch did you never get it right you people do you either got fudge pretending lovely while people get murdered right under his nose or got you chucking the wrong people into jail and trying to pretend got the chosen one working for you 
 
 so not the chosen one said scrimgeour 
 
 i thought you said it matter either way said harry with a bitter laugh not to you anyway 
 
 i have said that said scrimgeour quickly it was tactless 
 
 no it was honest said harry one of the only honest things said to me you care whether i live or die but you do care that i help you convince everyone winning the war against voldemort i forgotten minister 
 
 he raised his right fist there shining white on the back of his cold hand were the scars which dolores umbridge had forced him to carve into his own flesh i must not tell lies 
 
 i remember you rushing to my defense when i was trying to tell everyone voldemort was back the ministry so keen to be pals last year 
 
 they stood in silence as icy as the ground beneath their feet the gnome had finally managed to extricate his worm and was now sucking on it happily leaning against the branches of the rhododendron bush 
 
 what is dumbledore up to said scrimgeour brusquely where does he go when he is absent from hogwarts 
 
 no idea said harry 
 
 and you tell me if you knew said scrimgeour would you 
 
 no i said harry 
 
 well then i shall have to see whether i find out by other means 
 
 you can try said harry indifferently but you seem cleverer than fudge so have thought have learned from his mistakes he tried interfering at hogwarts you might have noticed not minister anymore but still headmaster leave dumbledore alone if i were you 
 
 there was a long pause 
 
 well it is clear to me that he has done a very good job on you said scrimgeour his eyes cold and hard behind his glasses man through and through you potter 
 
 yeah i am said harry glad we straightened that out 
 
 and turning his back on the minister of magic he strode back toward the house 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the half blood prince 
 

lionfish nov chapter sixteen godrics hollowcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 when harry woke the following day it was several seconds before he remembered what had happened then he hoped childishly that it had been a dream that ron was still there and had never left yet by turning his head on his pillow he could see rons deserted bunk it was like a dead body in the way it seems to draw his eyes harry jumped down from his own bed keeping his eyes averted from rons hermione who was already busy in the kitchen did not wish harry good morning but turned her face away quickly as he went by hes gone harry told himself hes gone he had to keep thinking it as he washed and dressed as though repetition would dull the shock of it hes gone and hes not coming back and that was the simple truth of it harry knew because their protective enchantments meant that it would be impossible once they vacated this spot for ron to find them again he and hermione ate breakfast in silence hermiones eyes were puffy and red she looked as if she had not slept they packed up their things hermione dawdling harry knew why she wanted to spin out their time on the riverbank several times he saw her look up eagerly and he was sure she had deluded herself into thinking that she heard footsteps through the heavy rain but no figure appeared between the trees every time harry imitated her looked around for he could not help hoping a little himself and saw nothing but woods another little parcel of fury exploded inside him he could hear ron saying we thought you knew what you were doing and he resumed packing with a hard knot in the pit of his stomach 
 
 the muddy river beside them was rising rapidly and would soon spill over onto their bank they had lingered a good hour after they would usually have departed their campsite finally having entirely repacked the beaded bag three times hermione seemed unable to find any more reasons to delay she and harry grasped hands and disapparated reappearing on a windswept hillside the instant they arrived hermione dropped harrys hand and walked away from him finally sitting down on a large rock her face on her knees shaking with what he knew were sobs he watched her supposing that he ought to go and comfort her but something kept him rooted to the spot everything inside him felt cold and tight again he saw the contemptuous expression on rons face harry strode off through the heather walking in a large circle with the distraught hermione at its center casting the spell she usually performed to ensure their protection 
 
 they did not discuss ron at all over the next few days harry was determined never to mention his name again and hermione seemed to know that it was no use forcing the issue although sometimes at night when she thought he was sleeping he would hear her crying meanwhile harry had started bringing out the marauders map and examining it by wandlight he was waiting for the moment when rons labeled dot would reappear in the corridors of hogwarts proving that he had returned to the comfortable castle protected by his status of pureblood however ron did not appear on the map and after a while harry found himself taking it out simply to stare at ginnys name in the girls dormitory wondering whether the intensity with which he gazed at it might break into her sleep that she would somehow know he was thinking about her hoping that she was all right 
 
 by day they devoted themselves to trying to determine the possible locations of gryffindors sword but the more they talked about the places in which dumbledore might have hidden it the more desperate and their speculation became cudgel his brains though he might harry could not remember dumbledore ever mentioning a place in which he might hide something there were moments when he did not know whether he was angrier with ron or with dumbledore we thought you knew what you were doingwe thought dumbledore had told you what to do we thought you had a real plan 
 
 he could not hide it from himself ron had been right dumbledore had left him with virtually nothing they had discovered one horcrux but they had no means of destroying it the others were as unattainable as they had ever been hopelessness threatened to engulf him he was staggered now to think of his own presumption in accepting his friends offers to accompany him on this meandering pointless journey he knew nothing he had no ideas and he was constantly painfully on the alert for any indications that hermione too was about to tell him that she had had enough that she was leaving 
 
 they were spending many evenings in near silence and hermione took to bringing out phineas nigelluss portrait and propping it up in a chair as though he might fill part of the gaping hole left by rons departure despite his previous assertion that he would never visit them again phineas nigellus did not seem able to resist the chance to find out more about what harry was up to and consented to reappear blindfolded every few days of so harry was even glad to see him because he was company albeit of a snide and taunting kind they relished any news about what was happening at hogwarts though phineas nigellus was not an ideal informer he venerated snape the first slytherin headmaster since he himself had controlled the school and they had to be careful not to criticize or ask impertinent questions about snape or phineas nigellus would instantly leave his painting 
 
 however he did let drop certain snippets snape seemed to be facing a constant low level of mutiny from a hard core of students ginny had been banned from going into hogsmeade snape had reinstated umbridges old decree forbidding gatherings of three or more students or any unofficial student societies from all of these things harry deduced that ginny and probably neville and luna along with her had been doing their best to continue dumbledores army this scant news made harry want to see ginny so badly it felt like a stomachache but it also made him think of ron again and of dumbledore and of hogwarts itself which he missed nearly as much as his indeed as phineas niggellus talked about snapes crackdown harry experienced a split second of madness when he imagined simply going back to school to join the destabilization of snapes regime being fed and having a soft bad and other people being in charge seemed the most wonderful prospect in the world at this moment but then he remembered that he was undesirable number one that there was a galleon price on his head and that to walk into hogwarts these days was just as dangerous as walking into the ministry of magic indeed phineas nigellus inadvertently emphasized this fact by slipping in leading questions about harry and hermiones whereabouts hermione shoved him back inside the beaded bag every time he did this and phineas nigellus invariably refused to reappear for several days after these unceremonious 
 
 the weather grew colder and colder they did not dare remain in any area too long so rather than staying in the south of england where a hard ground frost was the worst of their worries they continued to meander up and down the country braving a mountainside where sleet pounded the tent a wide flat marsh where the tent was flooded with chill water and a tiny island in the middle of a scottish loch where snow half buried the tent in the night they had already spotted christmas trees twinkling from several sitting room windows before there came an evening when harry resolved to suggest again what seemed to him the only unexplored avenue left to them they had just eaten an unusually good meal hermione had been to a supermarket under the invisibility cloak scrupulously dropping the money into an open till as she left and harry thought that she might be more persuadable than usual on a stomach full of spaghetti bolognese and tinned pears 
 
 he had also had the foresight to suggest that they take a few hours break from wearing the horcrux which was hanging over the end of the bunk beside him 
 
 hermione 
 
 hmm she was curled up in one of the sagging armchairs with the tales of beedle the bard he could not imagine how much more she could get out of the book which was not after all very long but evidently she was still deciphering something in it because spellmans syllabary lay open on the arm of the chair 
 
 harry cleared his throat he felt exactly as he had done on the occasion several years previously when he had asked professor mcgonagall whether he could go into hogsmeade despite the fact that he had not persuaded the dursleys to sign his permission slip 
 
 hermione ive been thinking and c 
 
 harry could you help me with something 
 
 apparently she had not been listening to him she leaned forward and held out the tales of beedle the bard 
 
 look at that symbol she said pointing to the top of a page above what harry assumed was the title of the story being unable to read runes he could not be sure there was a picture of what looked like a triangular eye its pupil crossed with a vertical line 
 
 i never took ancient runes hermione 
 
 i know that but it isnt a rune and its not in the syllabary either all along i thought it was a picture of an eye but i dont think it is its been inked in look somebodys drawn it there it isnt really part of the book think have you ever seen it before 
 
 no no wait a moment harry looked closer isnt it the same symbol lunas dad was wearing round his neck 
 
 well thats what i thought too 
 
 then its grindelwalds mark 
 
 she stared at him openmouthed 
 
 what 
 
 krum told me 
 
 he recounted the story that viktor krum had told him at the wedding hermione looked astonished 
 
 grindelwalds mark 
 
 she looked from harry to the weird symbol and back again ive never heard that grindelwald had a mark theres no mention of it in anything ive ever read about him 
 
 well like i say krum reckoned that symbol was carved on a wall at durmstrang and grindelwald put it there 
 
 she fell back into the old armchair frowning 
 
 thats very odd if its a symbol of dark magic whats it doing in a book of childrens stories 
 
 yeah it is weird said harry and youd think scrimgeour would have recognized it he was minister he ought to have been expert on dark stuff 
 
 i know perhaps he thought it was an eye just like i did all the other stories have little pictures over the titles 
 
 she did not speak but continued to pore over the strange mark harry tried again 
 
 hermione 
 
 hmm 
 
 ive been thinking i c i want to go to godrics hollow 
 
 she looked up at him but her eyes were unfocused and he was sure she was still thinking about the mysterious mark on the book 
 
 yes she said yes ive been wondering that too i really think well have to 
 
 did you hear me right he asked 
 
 of course i did you want to go to godrics hollow i agree i think we should i mean i cant think of anywhere else it could be either itll be dangerous but the more i think about it the more likely it seems its there 
 
 er c whats there asked harry 
 
 at that she looked just as bewildered as he felt 
 
 well the sword harry dumbledore must have known youd want to go back there and i mean godrics hollow is godric gryffindors birthplace c 
 
 really gryffindor came from godrics hollow 
 
 harry did you ever even open a history of magic 
 
 erm he said smiling for what felt like the first time in months the muscles in his face felt oddly stiff i mightve opened it you know when i bought it just the once 
 
 well as the village is named after him id have thought you might have made the connection said hermione she sounded much more like her old self than she had done of late harry half expected her to announce that she was off to the library theres a bit about the village in a history of magic wait 
 
 she opened the beaded bag and rummaged for a while finally extracting her copy of their old school textbook a history of magic by bathilda bagshot which she thumbed through until finding the page she wanted 
 
 
 
 
 upon the signature of the international statute of secrecy in wizards went into hiding for good it was natural perhaps that they formed their own small communities within a community many small villages and hamlets attracted several magical families who banded together for mutual support and protection the villages of tinworsh in cornwall upper flagley in yorkshire and ottery st catchpole on the south coast of england were notable homes to knots of wizarding families who lived alongside tolerant and sometimes confunded muggles most celebrated of these dwelling places is perhaps godrics hollow the west country village where the great wizard godric gryffindor was born and where bowman wright wizarding smith forged the first golden snitch the graveyard is full of the names of ancient magical families and this accounts no doubt for the stories of hauntings that have dogged the little church beside it for many centuries 
 
 
 
 
 you and your parents arent mentioned hermione said closing the book because professor bagshot doesnt cover anything later than the end of the nineteenth century but you see godrics hollow godric gryffindor gryffindors sword dont you think dumbledore would have expected you to make the connection 
 
 oh yeah 
 
 harry did not want to admit that he had not been thinking about the sword at all when he suggested they go to godrics hollow for him the lore of the village lay in his parents graves the house where he had narrowly escaped death and in the person of bathilda bagshot 
 
 remember what muriel said he asked eventually 
 
 who 
 
 you know he hesitated he did not want to say rons name ginnys at the wedding the one who said you had skinny ankles 
 
 oh said hermione it was a sticky moment harry knew that she had sensed rons name in the offing he rushed on 
 
 she said bathilda bagshot still lived in godrics hollow 
 
 bathilda bagshot murmured hermione running her index finger over bathildas embossed name on the front cover of a history of magic well i suppose c 
 
 she gasped so dramatically that harrys insides turned over he drew his wand looking around at the entrance half expecting to see a hand forcing its way through the entrance flap but there was nothing there 
 
 what he said half angry half relieved what did you do that for i thought youd seen a death eater unzipping the tent at least c 
 
 harry what if bathildas got the sword what if dumbledore entrusted it to her 
 
 harry considered this possibility bathilda would be an extremely old woman by now and according to muriel she was gaga was it likely that dumbledore would have hidden the sword of gryffindor with her if so harry felt that dumbledore had left a great deal to chance dumbledore had never revealed that he had replaced the sword with a fake nor had he so much as mentioned a friendship with bathilda now however was not the moment to cast doubt on hermiones theory not when she was so surprisingly willing to fall in with harrys dearest wish 
 
 yeah he might have done so are we going to go to godrics hollow 
 
 yes but well have to think it through carefully harry she was sitting up now and harry could tell that the prospect of having a plan again had lifted her mood as much as his well need to practice disapparating together under the invisibility cloak for a start and perhaps disillusionment charms would be sensible too unless you think we should go the whole hog and use polyjuice potion in that case well need to collect hair from somebody i actually think wed better do that harry the thicker our disguises the better 
 
 harry let her talk nodding and agreeing whenever there was a pause but his mind had left the conversation for the first time since he had discovered that the sword in gringotts was a fake he felt excited 
 
 he was about to go home about to return to the place where he had had a family it was in godrics hollow that but for voldemort he would have grown up and spent every school holiday he could have invited friends to his house he might even have had brothers and sisters it would have been his mother who had made his seventeenth birthday cake the life he had lost had hardly ever seemed so real to him as at this moment when he knew he was about to see the place where it had been taken from him after hermione had gone to bed that night harry quietly extracted his rucksack from hermiones beaded bag and from inside it the photograph album hagrid had given him so long ago for the first time in months he perused the old pictures of his parents smiling and waving up at him from the images which were all he had left of them now 
 
 harry would gladly have set out for godrics hollow the following day but hermione had other ideas convinced as she was that voldemort would expect harry to return to the scene of his parents deaths she was determined that they would set off only after they had ensured that they had the best disguises possible it was therefore a full week later c once they had surreptitiously obtained hairs from innocent muggles who were christmas shopping and had practiced apparating and disapparating while underneath the invisibility cloak together c that hermione agreed to make the journey 
 
 they were to apparate to the village under cover of darkness so it was late afternoon when they finally swallowed polyjuice potion harry transforming into a balding muggle man hermione into his small and rather mousy wife the beaded bag containing all of their possessions apart from the horcrux which harry was wearing around his neck was tucked into an inside pocket of hermiones coat harry lowered the invisibility cloak over them then they turned into the suffocating darkness once again 
 
 heart beating in his throat harry opened his eyes they were standing hand in hand in a snowy lane under a dark blue sky in which the nights first stars were already glimmering feebly cottages stood on either side of the narrow road christmas decorations twinkling in their windows a short way ahead of them a glow of golden streetlights indicated the center of the village 
 
 all this snow hermione whispered beneath the cloak why didnt we think of snow after all our precautions well leave prints well just have to get rid of them c you go in front ill do it c 
 
 harry did not want to enter the village like a pantomime horse trying to keep themselves concealed while magically covering their traces 
 
 lets take off the cloak said harry and when she looked frightened oh come on we dont look like us and theres no one around 
 
 he stowed the cloak under his jacket and they made their way forward unhampered the icy air stinging their faces as they passed more cottages any one of them might have been the one in which james and lily had once lived or where bathilda lived now harry gazed at the front doors their roofs and their front porches wondering whether he remembered any of them knowing deep inside that it was impossible that he had been little more than a year old when he had left this place forever he was not even sure whether he would be able to see the cottage at all he did not know what happened when the subjects of a fidelius charm died then the little lane along which they were walking curved to the left and the heart of the village a small square was revealed to them 
 
 strung all around with colored lights there was what looked like a war memorial in the middle partly obscured by a windblown christmas tree there were several shops a post office a pub and a little church whose windows were glowing across the square 
 
 the snow here had become impacted it was hard and slippery where people had trodden on it all day villagers were crisscrossing in front of them their figures briefly illuminated by streetlamps they heard a snatch of laughter and pop music as the pub door opened and closed then they heard a carol start up inside the little church 
 
 harry i think its christmas eve said hermione 
 
 is it 
 
 he had lost track of the date they had not seen a newspaper for weeks 
 
 im sure it is said hermione her eyes upon the church they theyll be in there wont they your mum and dad i can see the graveyard behind it 
 
 harry felt a thrill of something that was beyond excitement more like fear now that he was so near he wondered whether he wanted to see after all perhaps hermione knew how he was feeling because she reached for his hand and took the lead for the first time pulling him forward halfway across the square however she stopped dead 
 
 harry look 
 
 she was pointing at the war memorial as they had passed it it had transformed instead of an obelisk covered in names there was a statue of three people a man with untidy hair and glasses a woman with long hair and a kind pretty face and a baby boy sitting in his mothers arms snow lay upon all their heads like fluffy white caps 
 
 harry drew closer gazing up into his parents faces he had never imagined that there would be a statue how strange it was to see himself represented in stone a happy baby without a scar on his forehead 
 
 cmon said harry when he had looked his fill and they turned again toward the church as they crossed the road he glanced over his shoulder the statue had turned back into the war memorial 
 
 the singing grew louder as they approached the church it made harrys throat constrict it reminded him so forcefully of hogwarts of peeves bellowing rude versions of carols from inside suits of armor of the great halls twelve christmas trees of dumbledore wearing a bonnet he had won in a cracker of ron in a sweater 
 
 there was a kissing gate at the entrance to the graveyard hermione pushed it open as quietly as possible and they edged through it on either side of the slippery path to the church doors the snow lay deep and untouched they moved off through the snow carving deep trenches behind them as they walked around the building keeping to the shadows beneath the brilliant windows 
 
 behind the church row upon row of snowy tombstones protruded from a blanket of pale blue that was flecked with dazzling red gold and green wherever the reflections from the stained glass hit the snow keeping his hand closed tightly on the wand in his jacket pocket harry moved toward the nearest grave 
 
 look at this its an abbott could be some relation of hannahs 
 
 keep your voice down hermione begged him 
 
 they waded deeper and deeper into the graveyard gouging dark tracks into the snow behind them stooping to peer at the words on old headstones every now and then squinting into the surrounding darkness to make absolutely sure that they were unaccompanied 
 
 harry here 
 
 hermione was two rows of tombstones away he had to wade back to her his heart positively banging in his chest 
 
 is it c 
 
 no but look 
 
 she pointed to the dark stone harry stooped down and saw upon the frozen granite the words kendra dumbledore and a short way down her dates of birth and death and her daughter ariana there was also a quotation 
 
 where your treasure is there will your heart be also 
 
 so rita skeeter and muriel had got some of their facts right the dumbledore family had indeed lived here and part of it had died here 
 
 seeing the grave was worse than hearing about it harry could not help thinking that he and dumbledore both had deep roots in this graveyard and that dumbledore ought to have told him so yet he had never thought to share the connection they could have visited the place together for a moment harry imagined coming here with dumbledore of what a bond that would have been of how much it would have meant to him but it seemed that to dumbledore the fact that their families lay side by side in the same graveyard had been an unimportant coincidence irrelevant perhaps to the job he wanted harry to do 
 
 hermione was looking at harry and he was glad that his face was hidden in shadow he read the words on the tombstone again where your treasure is there will your heart be also he did not understand what these words meant surely dumbledore had chosen them as the eldest member of the family once his mother had died 
 
 are you sure he never mentioned c hermione began 
 
 no said harry curtly then lets keep looking and he turned away wishing he had not seen the stone he did not want his excited trepidation tainted with resentment 
 
 here cried hermione again a few moments later from out of the darkness oh no sorry i thought it said potter 
 
 she was rubbing at a crumbling mossy stone gazing down at it a little frown on her face 
 
 harry come back a moment 
 
 he did not want to be sidetracked again and only grudgingly made his way back through the snow toward her 
 
 what 
 
 look at this 
 
 the grave was extremely old weathered so that harry could hardly make out the name hermione showed him the symbol beneath it 
 
 harry thats the mark in the book 
 
 he peered at the place she indicated the stone was so worn that it was hard to make out what was engraved there though there did seem to be a triangular mark beneath the nearly illegible name 
 
 yeah it could be 
 
 hermione lit her wand and pointed it at the name on the headstone 
 
 it says ig c ignotus i think 
 
 im going to keep looking for my parents all right harry told her a slight edge to his voice and he set off again leaving her crouched beside the old grave 
 
 every now and then he recognized a surname that like abbott he had met at hogwarts sometimes there were several generations of the same wizarding family represented in the graveyard harry could tell from the dates that it had either died out or the current members had moved away from godrics hollow deeper and deeper amongst the graves he went and every time he reached a new headstone he felt a little lurch of apprehension and anticipation 
 
 the darkness and the silence seemed to become all of a sudden much deeper harry looked around worried thinking of dementors then realized that the carols had finished that the chatter and flurry of churchgoers were fading away as they made their way back into the square somebody inside the church had just turned off the lights 
 
 then hermiones voice came out of the blackness for the third time sharp and clear from a few yards away 
 
 harry theyre here right here 
 
 and he knew by her tone that it was his mother and father this time he moved toward her feeling as if something heavy were pressing on his chest the same sensation he had had right after dumbledore had died a grief that had actually weighed on his heart and lungs 
 
 the headstone was only two rows behind kendra and arianas it was made of white marble just like dumbledores tomb and this made it easy to read as it seemed to shine in the dark harry did not need to kneel or even approach very close to it to make out the words engraved upon it 
 
 
 
 
 james potter lily potter 
 born march born january 
 died october died october 
 
 the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death 
 
 harry read the words slowly as though he would have only one chance to take in their meaning and he read the last of them aloud 
 
 the last enemy that shall be defeated is death a horrible thought came to him and with a kind of panic isnt that a death eater idea why is that there 
 
 it doesnt mean defeating death in the way the death eaters mean it harry said hermione her voice gentle it means you know living beyond death living after death 
 
 but they were not living thought harry they were gone the empty words could not disguise the fact that his parents moldering remains lay beneath snow and stone indifferent unknowing and tears came before he could stop them boiling hot then instantly freezing on his face and what was the point in wiping them off or pretending he let them fall his lips pressed hard together looking down at the thick snow hiding from his eyes the place where the last of lily and james lay bones now surely or dust not knowing or caring that their living son stood so near his heart still beating alive because of their sacrifice and close to wishing at this moment that he was sleeping under the snow with them 
 
 hermione had taken his hand again and was gripping it tightly he could not look at her but returned the pressure now taking deep sharp gulps of the night air trying to steady himself trying to regain control he should have brought something o give them and he had not thought of it and every plant in the graveyard was leafless and frozen but hermione raised her wand moved it in a circle through the air and a wreath of christmas roses blossomed before them harry caught it and laid it on his parents grave 
 
 as soon as he stood up he wanted to leave he did not think he could stand another moment there he put his arm around hermiones shoulders and she put hers around his waist and they turned in silence and walked away through the snow past dumbledores mother and sister back toward the dark church and the kissing gate

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 in a thousand years 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 yes in a thousand years people will fly on the wings of steam 
 through the air over the ocean the young inhabitants of america will 
 become visitors of old europe they will come over to see the 
 monuments and the great cities which will then be in ruins just as 
 we in our time make pilgrimages to the tottering splendors of southern asia in a thousand years they will come 
 
 the thames the danube and the rhine still roll their course 
 mont blanc stands firm with its summit and the northern lights gleam over the land of the north but generation after 
 generation has become dust whole rows of the mighty of the moment are forgotten like those who already slumber under the hill on which 
 the rich trader whose ground it is has built a bench on which he 
 can sit and look out across his waving corn fields 
 
 to europe cry the young sons of america to the land of our 
 ancestors the glorious land of monuments and fancy to europe 
 the ship of the air comes it is crowded with passengers for 
 the transit is quicker than by sea the wire under 
 the ocean has already telegraphed the number of the aerial caravan 
 europe is in sight it is the coast of ireland that they see but 
 the passengers are still asleep they will not be called till they are 
 exactly over england there they will first step on european shore in 
 the land of shakespeare as the educated call it in the land of 
 politics the land of machines as it is called by others 
 
 here they stay a whole day that is all the time the busy race can 
 devote to the whole of england and scotland then the journey is 
 continued through the tunnel under the english channel to france the land of charlemagne and napoleon moliere is named the learned men talk of the classic school of remote antiquity there is rejoicing and shouting for the names of heroes poets and men of science whom our time does not know but who will be born after our time in 
 paris the centre of europe and elsewhere 
 
 the air steamboat flies over the country whence columbus went 
 forth where cortez was born and where calderon sang dramas in 
 sounding verse beautiful women live still in the 
 blooming valleys and the oldest songs speak of the cid and the 
 alhambra 
 
 then through the air over the sea to italy where once lay 
 old everlasting rome it has vanished the campagna lies desert a 
 single ruined wall is shown as the remains of st but there 
 is a doubt if this ruin be genuine 
 
 next to greece to sleep a night in the grand hotel at the top 
 of mount olympus to say that they have been there and the journey is continued to the bosphorus to rest there a few hours and see the 
 place where byzantium lay and where the legend tells that the harem 
 stood in the time of the turks poor fishermen are now spreading their nets 
 
 over the remains of mighty cities on the broad danube cities 
 which we in our time know not the travellers pass but here and 
 there on the rich sites of those that time shall bring forth the 
 caravan sometimes descends and departs thence again 
 
 down below lies germany that was once covered with a close net of 
 railway and canals the region where luther spoke where goethe 
 sang and mozart once held the sceptre of harmony great names shine there in science and in art names that are unknown to us one day devoted to seeing germany and one for the north the country of oersted and linnaeus and for norway the land of the old heroes and the young normans iceland is visited on the journey home the geysers burn no more hecla is an extinct volcano but the rocky island is still fixed in the midst of the foaming sea a continual monument of legend and poetry 
 
 there is really a great deal to be seen in europe says the 
 young american and we have seen it in a week according to the 
 directions of the great traveller and here he mentions the name of 
 one of his contemporaries in his celebrated work how to see all 
 europe in a week

 suddenly a huge rat darts for his hand andy yanks away and almost plummets down the shaft he dangles wildly for a moment arms windmilling then gets his hands pressed firmly against the opposite wall the rat scurries off pissed 
 andy snags the conduit again he contorts out of the hole and dangles into the shaft we now see the purpose for the rope the plastic bag hangs from his ankle with about two feet of slack 
 he kicks his legs across the shaft gets his feet braced wit his back against one wall and feet against the other he starts down the shaft sliding dangerously using pipes for handholds flinching as rats dart this way and that scurrying in the shadows he drops the last few feet to the bottom 
 he approaches the ceramic sewer pipe and kneels before it pulls out the and says a quick silent prayer raises the high and swings it down with all his might once twice third time lucky an enormous eruption of sewage cascades into the air as if the mount st helens of shit andy is instantly coated black he turns away and heaves his guts out the shit keeps coming

 book grandfather and the grandson 
 chapter i 
 
 an ancient salon 
 when m gillenormand lived in the rue servandoni he had frequented many very good and very aristocratic salons 
 although a bourgeois m gillenormand was received in society 
 as he had a double measure of wit in the first place that which was born with him and secondly that which was attributed to him he was even sought out and made much of 
 he never went anywhere except on condition of being the chief person there 
 there are people who will have influence at any price and who will have other people busy themselves over them when they cannot be oracles they turn wags m gillenormand was not of this nature his domination in the royalist salons which he frequented cost his nothing he was an oracle everywhere 
 it had happened to him to hold his own against m de bonald and even against m 
 about he invariably passed two afternoons a week in a house in his own neighborhood in the rue ferou with madame la baronne de t a worthy and respectable person whose husband had been ambassador of france to berlin under louis xvi 
 baron de t who during his lifetime had gone very passionately into ecstasies and magnetic visions had died bankrupt during the emigration leaving as his entire fortune some very curious memoirs about mesmer and his tub in ten manuscript volumes bound in red morocco and gilded on the edges madame de t had not published the memoirs out of pride and maintained herself on a meagre income which had survived no one knew how 
 madame de t lived far from the court a very mixed society as she said in a noble isolation proud and poor 
 a few friends assembled twice a week about her widowed hearth and these constituted a purely royalist salon 
 they sipped tea there and uttered groans or cries of horror at the century the charter the bonapartists the prostitution of the blue ribbon or the jacobinism of louis xviii according as the wind veered towards elegy or dithyrambs and they spoke in low tones of the hopes which were presented by monsieur afterwards charles x 
 the songs of the fishwomen in which napoleon was called nicolas were received there with transports of joy 
 duchesses the most delicate and charming women in the world went into ecstasies over couplets like the following addressed to the federates refoncez dans vos culottes

 or they drew up a list of the chamber of peers an abominably jacobin chamber and from this list they combined alliances of names in such a manner as to form for example phrases like the following damas 
 sabran 
 this was done merrily in that society they parodied the revolution 
 they used i know not what desires to give point to the same wrath in inverse sense they sang their little ca ira ah ca ira ca ira ca ira 
 les bonapartistes a la lanterne 
 songs are like the guillotine they chop away indifferently this head that 
 it is only a variation 
 in the fualdes affair which belongs to this epoch they took part for bastide and jausion because fualdes was a buonapartist they designated the liberals as friends and brothers this constituted the most deadly insult 
 like certain church towers madame de salon had two cocks one of them was m gillenormand the other was comte de of whom it was whispered about with a sort of respect 
 do you know that is the lamothe of the affair of the necklace 
 these singular amnesties do occur in parties 
 let us add the following 
 in the bourgeoisie honored situations decay through too easy relations one must beware whom one admits in the same way that there is a loss of caloric in the vicinity of those who are cold there is a diminution of consideration in the approach of despised persons 
 the ancient society of the upper classes held themselves above this law as above every other 
 marigny the brother of the pompadour had his entry with m le prince de soubise in spite of 
 no because 
 du barry the of the vaubernier was very welcome at the house of m le marechal de richelieu this society is olympus 
 mercury and the prince de guemenee are at home there 
 a thief is admitted there provided he be a god 
 the comte de lamothe who in was an old man years of age had nothing remarkable about him except his silent and sententious air his cold and angular face his perfectly polished manners his coat buttoned up to his cravat and his long legs always crossed in long flabby trousers of the hue of burnt sienna his face was the same color as his trousers 
 this m de lamothe was held in consideration in this salon on account of his celebrity and strange to say though true because of his name of valois 
 as for m gillenormand his consideration was of absolutely quality 
 he had in spite of his levity and without its interfering in any way with his dignity a certain manner about him which was imposing dignified honest and lofty in a bourgeois fashion and his great age added to it 
 one is not a century with impunity the years finally produce around a head a venerable dishevelment 
 in addition to this he said things which had the genuine sparkle of the old rock 
 thus when the king of prussia after having restored louis xviii came to pay the latter a visit under the name of the count de ruppin he was received by the descendant of louis xiv somewhat as though he had been the marquis de brandebourg and with the most delicate impertinence 
 m gillenormand approved 
 all kings who are not the king of france said he are provincial kings one day the following question was put and the following answer returned in his presence 
 to what was the editor of the courrier francais condemned 
 to be suspended 
 sus is superfluous observed m gillenormand remarks of this nature found a situation 
 suspendu suspended pendu hung 
 at the te deum on the anniversary of the return of the bourbons he said on seeing m de talleyrand pass by 
 there goes his excellency the evil one 
 m gillenormand was always accompanied by his daughter that tall mademoiselle who was over forty and looked fifty and by a handsome little boy of seven years white rosy fresh with happy and trusting eyes who never appeared in that salon without hearing voices murmur around him 
 how handsome he is what a pity 
 poor child 
 this child was the one of whom we dropped a word a while ago 
 he was called poor child because he had for a father a brigand of the loire 
 this brigand of the loire was m who has already been mentioned and whom m gillenormand called the disgrace of his family

 chapter iii 
 
 the emperor of russia had meanwhile been in vilna for more than a month reviewing troops and holding maneuvers nothing was ready for the war that everyone expected and to prepare for which the emperor had come from petersburg there was no general plan of action the vacillation between the various plans that were proposed had even increased after the emperor had been at headquarters for a month each of the three armies had its own commander in chief but there was no supreme commander of all the forces and the emperor did not assume that responsibility himself 
 the longer the emperor remained in vilna the less did everybody tired of waiting prepare for the war all the efforts of those who surrounded the sovereign seemed directed merely to making him spend his time pleasantly and forget that war was impending 
 in june after many balls and fetes given by the polish magnates by the courtiers and by the emperor himself it occurred to one of the polish in attendance that a dinner and ball should be given for the emperor by his this idea was eagerly received the emperor gave his consent the collected money by subscription the lady who was thought to be most pleasing to the emperor was invited to act as hostess count bennigsen being a landowner in the vilna province offered his country house for the fete and the thirteenth of june was fixed for a ball dinner regatta and fireworks at zakret count country seat 
 the very day that napoleon issued the order to cross the niemen and his vanguard driving off the cossacks crossed the russian frontier alexander spent the evening at the entertainment given by his at country house 
 it was a gay and brilliant fete connoisseurs of such matters declared that rarely had so many beautiful women been assembled in one place countess bezukhova was present among other russian ladies who had followed the sovereign from petersburg to vilna and eclipsed the refined polish ladies by her massive so called russian type of beauty the emperor noticed her and honored her with a dance 
 boris drubetskoy having left his wife in moscow and being for the present en garcon as he phrased it was also there and though not an had subscribed a large sum toward the expenses boris was now a rich man who had risen to high honors and no longer sought patronage but stood on an equal footing with the highest of those of his own age he was meeting helene in vilna after not having seen her for a long time and did not recall the past but as helene was enjoying the favors of a very important personage and boris had only recently married they met as good friends of long standing 
 at midnight dancing was still going on helene not having a suitable partner herself offered to dance the mazurka with boris they were the third couple boris coolly looking at dazzling bare shoulders which emerged from a dark gauze gown talked to her of old acquaintances and at the same time unaware of it himself and unnoticed by others never for an instant ceased to observe the emperor who was in the same room the emperor was not dancing he stood in the doorway stopping now one pair and now another with gracious words which he alone knew how to utter 
 as the mazurka began boris saw that adjutant general balashev one of those in closest attendance on the emperor went up to him and contrary to court etiquette stood near him while he was talking to a polish lady having finished speaking to her the emperor looked inquiringly at balashev and evidently understanding that he only acted thus because there were important reasons for so doing nodded slightly to the lady and turned to him hardly had balashev begun to speak before a look of amazement appeared on the face he took balashev by the arm and crossed the room with him unconsciously clearing a path seven yards wide as the people on both sides made way for him boris noticed excited face when the sovereign went out with balashev arakcheev looked at the emperor from under his brow and sniffing with his red nose stepped forward from the crowd as if expecting the emperor to address him boris understood that arakcheev envied balashev and was displeased that evidently important news had reached the emperor otherwise than through himself 
 but the emperor and balashev passed out into the illuminated garden without noticing arakcheev who holding his sword and glancing wrathfully around followed some twenty paces behind them 
 all the time boris was going through the figures of the mazurka he was worried by the question of what news balashev had brought and how he could find it out before others in the figure in which he had to choose two ladies he whispered to helene that he meant to choose countess potocka who he thought had gone out onto the veranda and glided over the parquet to the door opening into the garden where seeing balashev and the emperor returning to the veranda he stood still they were moving toward the door boris fluttering as if he had not had time to withdraw respectfully pressed close to the doorpost with bowed head 
 the emperor with the agitation of one who has been personally affronted was finishing with these words 
 to enter russia without declaring war i will not make peace as long as a single armed enemy remains in my country it seemed to boris that it gave the emperor pleasure to utter these words he was satisfied with the form in which he had expressed his thoughts but displeased that boris had overheard it 
 let no one know of it the emperor added with a frown 
 boris understood that this was meant for him and closing his eyes slightly bowed his head the emperor the ballroom and remained there about another 
 boris was thus the first to learn the news that the french army had crossed the niemen and thanks to this was able to show certain important personages that much that was concealed from others was usually known to him and by this means he rose higher in their estimation 
 the unexpected news of the french having crossed the niemen was particularly startling after a month of unfulfilled expectations and at a ball on first receiving the news under the influence of indignation and resentment the emperor had found a phrase that pleased him fully expressed his feelings and has since become famous on returning home at two that night he sent for his secretary shishkov and told him to write an order to the troops and a rescript to field marshal prince saltykov in which he insisted on the words being inserted that he would not make peace so long as a single armed frenchman remained on russian soil 
 next day the following letter was sent to napoleon 
 monsieur mon frere 
 yesterday i learned that despite the loyalty which i have kept my engagements with your majesty your troops have crossed the russian frontier and i have this moment received from petersburg a note in which count lauriston informs me as a reason for this aggression that your majesty has considered yourself to be in a state of war with me from the time prince kuragin asked for his passports the reasons on which the duc de bassano based his refusal to deliver them to him would never have led me to suppose that that could serve as a pretext for aggression in fact the ambassador as he himself has declared was never authorized to make that demand and as soon as i was informed of it i let him know how much i disapproved of it and ordered him to remain at his post if your majesty does not intend to shed the blood of our peoples for such a misunderstanding and consents to withdraw your troops from russian territory i will regard what has passed as not having occurred and an understanding between us will be possible in the contrary case your majesty i shall see myself forced to repel an attack that nothing on my part has provoked it still depends on your majesty to preserve humanity from the calamity of another war i am etc

 one of the red spectres of that epoch 
 any one who had chanced to pass through the little town of vernon at this epoch and who had happened to walk across that fine monumental bridge which will soon be succeeded let us hope by some hideous iron cable bridge might have observed had he dropped his eyes over the parapet a man about fifty years of age wearing a leather cap and trousers and a waistcoat of coarse gray cloth to which something yellow which had been a red ribbon was sewn shod with wooden sabots tanned by the sun his face nearly black and his hair nearly white a large scar on his forehead which ran down upon his cheek bowed bent prematurely aged who walked nearly every day hoe and sickle in hand in one of those compartments surrounded by walls which abut on the bridge and border the left bank of the seine like a chain of terraces charming enclosures full of flowers of which one could say were they much larger 
 these are gardens and were they a little smaller these are bouquets 
 all these enclosures abut upon the river at one end and on a house at the other 
 the man in the waistcoat and the wooden shoes of whom we have just spoken inhabited the smallest of these enclosures and the most humble of these houses about 
 he lived there alone and solitary silently and poorly with a woman who was neither young nor old neither homely nor pretty neither a peasant nor a bourgeoise who served him the plot of earth which he called his garden was celebrated in the town for the beauty of the flowers which he cultivated there these flowers were his occupation 
 by dint of labor of perseverance of attention and of buckets of water he had succeeded in creating after the creator and he had invented certain tulips and certain dahlias which seemed to have been forgotten by nature 
 he was ingenious he had forestalled soulange bodin in the formation of little clumps of earth of heath mould for the cultivation of rare and precious shrubs from america and china 
 he was in his alleys from the break of day in summer planting cutting hoeing watering walking amid his flowers with an air of kindness sadness and sweetness sometimes standing motionless and thoughtful for hours listening to the song of a bird in the trees the babble of a child in a house or with his eyes fixed on a drop of dew at the tip of a spear of grass of which the sun made a carbuncle 
 his table was very plain and he drank more milk than wine 
 a child could make him give way and his servant scolded him 
 he was so timid that be seemed shy he rarely went out and he saw no one but the poor people who tapped at his pane and his cure the abbe mabeuf a good old man nevertheless if the inhabitants of the town or strangers or any chance comers curious to see his tulips rang at his little cottage he opened his door with a smile 
 he was the brigand of the loire 
 any one who had at the same time read military memoirs biographies the moniteur and the bulletins of the grand army would have been struck by a name which occurs there with tolerable frequency the name of georges pontmercy 
 when very young this georges pontmercy had been a soldier in regiment 
 the revolution broke out regiment formed a part of the army of the rhine for the old regiments of the monarchy preserved their names of provinces even after the fall of the monarchy and were only divided into brigades in 
 pontmercy fought at spire at worms at neustadt at turkheim at alzey at mayence where he was one of the two hundred who formed rearguard 
 it was the twelfth to hold its ground against the corps of the prince of hesse behind the old rampart of andernach and only rejoined the main body of the army when the cannon had opened a breach from the cord of the parapet to the foot of the glacis 
 he was under kleber at marchiennes and at the battle of where a ball from a biscaien broke his arm 
 then he passed to the frontier of italy and was one of the thirty grenadiers who defended the col de tende with joubert 
 joubert was appointed its and pontmercy pontmercy was by side in the midst of the of that day at lodi which caused bonaparte to say 
 berthier has been cannoneer cavalier and grenadier he beheld his old general joubert fall at novi at the moment when with uplifted sabre he was shouting 
 forward 
 having been embarked with his company in the exigencies of the campaign on board a pinnace which was proceeding from genoa to some obscure port on the coast he fell into a of seven or eight english vessels the genoese commander wanted to throw his cannon into the sea to hide the soldiers between decks and to slip along in the dark as a merchant vessel 
 pontmercy had the colors hoisted to the peak and sailed proudly past under the guns of the british frigates twenty leagues further on his audacity having increased he attacked with his pinnace and captured a large english transport which was carrying troops to sicily and which was so loaded down with men and horses that the vessel was sunk to the level of the sea in he was in that malher division which took gunzberg from the archduke ferdinand 
 at weltingen he received into his arms beneath a storm of bullets colonel maupetit mortally wounded at the head of the th dragoons 
 he distinguished himself at austerlitz in that admirable march in echelons effected under the fire when the cavalry of the imperial russian guard crushed a battalion of the th of the line pontmercy was one of those who took their revenge and overthrew the guard 
 the emperor gave him the cross pontmercy saw wurmser at mantua melas and alexandria mack at ulm made prisoners in succession 
 he formed a part of the eighth corps of the grand army which mortier commanded and which captured hamburg then he was transferred to the th of the line which was the old regiment of flanders 
 at eylau he was in the cemetery where for the space of two hours the heroic captain louis hugo the uncle of the author of this book sustained alone with his company of men every effort of the hostile army pontmercy was one of the three who emerged alive from that cemetery he was at friedland 
 then he saw moscow 
 then la beresina then lutzen bautzen dresden wachau leipzig and the defiles of gelenhausen then montmirail craon the banks of the marne the banks of the aisne and the redoubtable position of laon at being then a captain he put ten cossacks to the sword and saved not his general but his corporal 
 he was well slashed up on this occasion and splinters were extracted from his left arm alone 
 eight days before the capitulation of paris he had just exchanged with a comrade and entered the cavalry he had what was called under the old regime the double hand that is to say an equal aptitude for handling the sabre or the musket as a soldier or a squadron or a battalion as an officer 
 it is from this aptitude perfected by a military education which certain special branches of the service arise the dragoons for example who are both and infantry at one and the same time he accompanied napoleon to the island of elba 
 at waterloo he was chief of a squadron of cuirassiers in dubois brigade 
 it was he who captured the standard of the lunenburg battalion 
 he came and cast the flag at the feet 
 he was covered with blood while tearing down the banner he had received a across his face 
 the emperor greatly pleased shouted to him 
 you are a colonel you are a baron you are an officer of the legion of honor pontmercy replied 
 sire i thank you for my widow 
 an hour later he fell in the ravine of ohain 
 now who was this georges pontmercy he was this same brigand of the loire 
 we have already seen something of his history 
 after waterloo pontmercy who had been pulled out of the hollow road of ohain as it will be remembered had succeeded in joining the army and had dragged himself from ambulance to ambulance as far as the cantonments of the loire 
 the restoration had placed him on then had sent him into residence that is to say under surveillance at vernon king louis xviii regarding all that which had taken place during the hundred days as not having occurred at all did not recognize his quality as an officer of the legion of honor nor his grade of colonel nor his title of baron 
 he on his side neglected no occasion of signing himself colonel baron pontmercy he had only an old blue coat and he never went out without fastening to it his rosette as an officer of the legion of honor the attorney for the crown had him warned that the authorities would prosecute him for illegal wearing of this decoration when this notice was conveyed to him through an officious intermediary pontmercy retorted with a bitter smile 
 i do not know whether i no longer understand french or whether you no longer speak it but the fact is that i do not understand 
 then he went out for eight successive days with his rosette 
 they dared not interfere with him two or three times the minister of war and the general in command of the department wrote to him with the following address a monsieur le commandant pontmercy 
 he sent back the letters with the seals unbroken 
 at the same moment napoleon at saint helena was treating in the same fashion the missives of sir hudson lowe addressed to general bonaparte 
 pontmercy had ended may we be pardoned the expression by having in his mouth the same saliva as his emperor 
 in the same way there were at rome carthaginian prisoners who refused to salute flaminius and who had a little of spirit 
 one day he encountered the in one of the streets of vernon stepped up to him and said 
 mr crown attorney am i permitted to wear my scar 
 he had nothing save his meagre as chief of squadron he had hired the smallest house which he could find at vernon he lived there alone we have just seen how 
 under the empire between two wars he had found time to marry mademoiselle gillenormand the old bourgeois thoroughly indignant at bottom had given his consent with a sigh saying 
 the greatest families are forced into it in madame pontmercy an admirable woman in every sense by the way lofty in sentiment and rare and worthy of her husband died leaving a child 
 this child had been the joy in his solitude but the grandfather had imperatively claimed his grandson declaring that if the child were not given to him he would disinherit him 
 the father had yielded in the little interest and had transferred his love to flowers 
 moreover he had renounced everything and neither stirred up mischief nor conspired 
 he shared his thoughts between the innocent things which he was then doing and the great things which he had done he passed his time in expecting a pink or in recalling austerlitz 
 m gillenormand kept up no relations with his the colonel was a bandit to him 
 m gillenormand never mentioned the colonel except when he occasionally made mocking allusions to his baronship 
 it had been expressly agreed that pontmercy should never attempt to see his son nor to speak to him under penalty of having the latter handed over to him disowned and disinherited for the gillenormands pontmercy was a man afflicted with the plague they intended to bring up the child in their own way 
 perhaps the colonel was wrong to accept these conditions but he submitted to them thinking that he was doing right and sacrificing no one but himself 
 the inheritance of father gillenormand did not amount to much but the inheritance of mademoiselle gillenormand the elder was considerable this aunt who had remained unmarried was very rich on the maternal side and her son was her natural heir 
 the boy whose name was marius knew that he had a father but nothing more no one opened his mouth to him about it 
 nevertheless in the society into which his grandfather took him whispers innuendoes and winks had eventually enlightened the little mind he had finally understood something of the case and as he naturally took in the ideas and opinions which were so to speak the air he breathed by a sort of infiltration and slow penetration he gradually came to think of his father only with shame and with a pain at his heart 
 while he was growing up in this fashion the colonel slipped away every two or three months came to paris on the sly like a criminal breaking his ban and went and posted himself at at the hour when aunt gillenormand led marius to the mass there trembling lest the aunt should turn round concealed behind a pillar motionless not daring to breathe he gazed at his child the scarred veteran was afraid of that old spinster 
 from this had arisen his connection with the cure of vernon m mabeuf 
 that worthy priest was the brother of a warden of who had often observed this man gazing at his child and the scar on his cheek and the large tears in his eyes 
 that man who had so manly an air yet who was weeping like a woman had struck the warden that face had clung to his mind 
 one day having gone to vernon to see his brother he had encountered colonel pontmercy on the bridge and had recognized the man of the warden had mentioned the circumstance to the cure and both had paid the colonel a visit on some pretext or other 
 this visit led to others 
 the colonel who had been extremely reserved at first ended by opening his heart and the cure and the warden finally came to know the whole history and how pontmercy was sacrificing his happiness to his future this caused the cure to regard him with veneration and tenderness and the colonel on his side became fond of the cure 
 and moreover when both are sincere and good no men so penetrate each other and so amalgamate with each other as an old priest and an old soldier at bottom the man is the same 
 the one has devoted his life to his country here below the other to his country on high that is the only difference 
 twice a year on the first of january and on st day marius wrote duty letters to his father which were dictated by his aunt and which one would have pronounced to be copied from some formula this was all that m gillenormand tolerated and the father answered them with very tender letters which the grandfather thrust into his pocket unread

 nevertheless in the society into which his grandfather took him whispers innuendoes and winks had eventually enlightened the little mind he had finally understood something of the case and as he naturally took in the ideas and opinions which were so to speak the air he breathed by a sort of infiltration and slow penetration he gradually came to think of his father only with shame and with a pain at his heart 
 while he was growing up in this fashion the colonel slipped away every two or three months came to paris on the sly like a criminal breaking his ban and went and posted himself at at the hour when aunt gillenormand led marius to the mass there trembling lest the aunt should turn round concealed behind a pillar motionless not daring to breathe he gazed at his child the scarred veteran was afraid of that old spinster 
 from this had arisen his connection with the cure of vernon m mabeuf 
 that worthy priest was the brother of a warden of who had often observed this man gazing at his child and the scar on his cheek and the large tears in his eyes 
 that man who had so manly an air yet who was weeping like a woman had struck the warden that face had clung to his mind 
 one day having gone to vernon to see his brother he had encountered colonel pontmercy on the bridge and had recognized the man of the warden had mentioned the circumstance to the cure and both had paid the colonel a visit on some pretext or other 
 this visit led to others 
 the colonel who had been extremely reserved at first ended by opening his heart and the cure and the warden finally came to know the whole history and how pontmercy was sacrificing his happiness to his future this caused the cure to regard him with veneration and tenderness and the colonel on his side became fond of the cure 
 and moreover when both are sincere and good no men so penetrate each other and so amalgamate with each other as an old priest and an old soldier at bottom the man is the same 
 the one has devoted his life to his country here below the other to his country on high that is the only difference 
 twice a year on the first of january and on st day marius wrote duty letters to his father which were dictated by his aunt and which one would have pronounced to be copied from some formula this was all that m gillenormand tolerated and the father answered them with very tender letters which the grandfather thrust into his pocket unread

 chapter iv 
 
 at two in the morning of the fourteenth of june the emperor having sent for balashev and read him his letter to napoleon ordered him to take it and hand it personally to the french emperor when dispatching balashev the emperor repeated to him the words that he would not make peace so long as a single armed enemy remained on russian soil and told him to transmit those words to napoleon alexander did not insert them in his letter to napoleon because with his characteristic tact he felt it would be injudicious to use them at a moment when a last attempt at reconciliation was being made but he definitely instructed balashev to repeat them personally to napoleon 
 having set off in the small hours of the fourteenth accompanied by a bugler and two cossacks balashev reached the french outposts at the village of rykonty on the russian side of the niemen by dawn there he was stopped by french cavalry sentinels 
 a french noncommissioned officer of hussars in crimson uniform and a shaggy cap shouted to the approaching balashev to halt balashev did not do so at once but continued to advance along the road at a walking pace 
 the noncommissioned officer frowned and muttering words of abuse advanced his chest against balashev put his hand to his saber and shouted rudely at the russian general asking was he deaf that he did not do as he was told balashev mentioned who he was the noncommissioned officer began talking with his comrades about regimental matters without looking at the russian general 
 after living at the seat of the highest authority and power after conversing with the emperor less than three hours before and in general being accustomed to the respect due to his rank in the service balashev found it very strange here on russian soil to encounter this hostile and still more this disrespectful application of brute force to himself 
 the sun was only just appearing from behind the clouds the air was fresh and dewy a herd of cattle was being driven along the road from the village and over the fields the larks rose trilling one after another like bubbles rising in water 
 balashev looked around him awaiting the arrival of an officer from the village the russian cossacks and bugler and the french hussars looked silently at one another from time to time 
 a french colonel of hussars who had evidently just left his bed came riding from the village on a handsome sleek gray horse accompanied by two hussars the officer the soldiers and their horses all looked smart and well kept 
 it was that first period of a campaign when troops are still in full trim almost like that of peacetime maneuvers but with a shade of martial swagger in their clothes and a touch of the gaiety and spirit of enterprise which always accompany the opening of a campaign 
 the french colonel with difficulty repressed a yawn but was polite and evidently understood importance he led him past his soldiers and behind the outposts and told him that his wish to be presented to the emperor would most likely be satisfied immediately as the quarters were he believed not far off 
 they rode through the village of rykonty past tethered french hussar horses past sentinels and men who saluted their colonel and stared with curiosity at a russian uniform and came out at the other end of the village the colonel said that the commander of the division was a mile and a quarter away and would receive balashev and conduct him to his destination 
 the sun had by now risen and shone gaily on the bright verdure 
 they had hardly ridden up a hill past a tavern before they saw a group of horsemen coming toward them in front of the group on a black horse with trappings that glittered in the sun rode a tall man with plumes in his hat and black hair curling down to his shoulders he wore a red mantle and stretched his long legs forward in french fashion this man rode toward balashev at a gallop his plumes flowing and his gems and gold lace glittering in the bright june sunshine 
 balashev was only two horses length from the equestrian with the bracelets plunies necklaces and gold embroidery who was galloping toward him with a theatrically solemn countenance when julner the french colonel whispered respectfully the king of naples it was in fact murat now called king of naples though it was quite incomprehensible why he should be king of naples he was called so and was himself convinced that he was so and therefore assumed a more solemn and important air than formerly he was so sure that he really was the king of naples that when on the eve of his departure from that city while walking through the streets with his wife some italians called out to him viva il re he turned to his wife with a pensive smile and said poor fellows they know that i am leaving them tomorrow 
 long live the king 
 but though he firmly believed himself to be king of naples and pitied the grief felt by the subjects he was abandoning latterly after he had been ordered to return to military service and especially since his last interview with napoleon in danzig when his august had told him i made you king that you should reign in my way but not in yours he had cheerfully taken up his familiar business and like a but not overfat horse that feels himself in harness and grows skittish between the shafts he dressed up in clothes as variegated and expensive as possible and gaily and contentedly galloped along the roads of poland without himself knowing why or whither 
 on seeing the russian general he threw back his head with its long hair curling to his shoulders in a majestically royal manner and looked inquiringly at the french colonel the colonel respectfully informed his majesty of mission whose name he could not pronounce 
 de said the king overcoming by his assurance the difficulty that had presented itself to the colonel charmed to make your acquaintance general he added with a gesture of kingly condescension 
 as soon as the king began to speak loud and fast his royal dignity instantly forsook him and without noticing it he passed into his natural tone of familiarity he laid his hand on the withers of horse and said 
 well general it all looks like war as if regretting a circumstance of which he was unable to judge 
 your majesty replied balashev my master the emperor does not desire war and as your majesty sees said balashev using the words your majesty at every opportunity with the affectation unavoidable in frequently addressing one to whom the title was still a novelty 
 face beamed with stupid satisfaction as he listened to monsieur de but royaute oblige and he felt it incumbent on him as a king and an ally to confer on state affairs with envoy he dismounted took arm and moving a few steps away from his suite which waited respectfully began to pace up and down with him trying to speak significantly he referred to the fact that the emperor napoleon had resented the demand that he should withdraw his troops from prussia especially when that demand became generally known and the dignity of france was thereby offended 
 royalty has its obligations 
 balashev replied that there was nothing offensive in the demand because but murat interrupted him 
 then you consider the emperor alexander the aggressor he asked unexpectedly with a kindly and foolish smile 
 balashev told him why he considered napoleon to be the originator of the war 
 oh my dear general murat again interrupted him with all my heart i wish the emperors may arrange the affair between them and that the war begun by no wish of mine may finish as quickly as possible said he in the tone of a servant who wants to remain good friends with another despite a quarrel between their masters 
 and he went on to inquiries about the grand duke and the state of his health and to reminiscences of the gay and amusing times he had spent with him in naples then suddenly as if remembering his royal dignity murat solemnly drew himself up assumed the pose in which he had stood at his coronation and waving his right arm said 
 i detain you longer general i wish success to your mission and with his embroidered red mantle his flowing feathers and his glittering ornaments he rejoined his suite who were respectfully awaiting him 
 balashev rode on supposing from words that he would very soon be brought before napoleon himself but instead of that at the next village the sentinels of infantry corps detained him as the pickets of the vanguard had done and an adjutant of the corps commander who was fetched conducted him into the village to marshal davout

 chapter iii 
 
 requiescant 
 madame de salon was all that marius pontmercy knew of the world it was the only opening through which he could get a glimpse of life 
 this opening was sombre and more cold than warmth more night than day came to him through this skylight 
 this child who had been all joy and light on entering this strange world soon became melancholy and what is still more contrary to his age grave 
 surrounded by all those singular and imposing personages he gazed about him with serious amazement 
 everything conspired to increase this astonishment in him 
 there were in madame de salon some very noble ladies named mathan noe was pronounced pronounced cambyse 
 these antique visages and these biblical names mingled in the mind with the old testament which he was learning by heart and when they were all there seated in a circle around a dying fire sparely lighted by a lamp shaded with green with their severe profiles their gray or white hair their long gowns of another age whose lugubrious colors could not be distinguished dropping at rare intervals words which were both majestic and severe little marius stared at them with frightened eyes in the conviction that he beheld not women but patriarchs and magi not real beings but phantoms 
 with these phantoms priests were sometimes mingled frequenters of this ancient salon and some gentlemen the marquis de sass private secretary to madame de berry the vicomte de val who published under the pseudonyme of monorhymed odes the prince de beauff who though very young had a gray head and a pretty and witty wife whose very toilettes of scarlet velvet with gold torsades alarmed these shadows the marquis de the man in all france who best understood proportioned politeness the comte the kindly man with the amiable chin and the chevalier de a pillar of the library of the louvre called the cabinet m de bald and rather aged than old was wont to relate that in at the age of sixteen he had been put in the galleys as refractory and chained with an octogenarian the bishop of mirepoix also refractory but as a priest while he was so in the capacity of a soldier 
 this was at toulon their business was to go at night and gather up on the scaffold the heads and bodies of the persons who had been guillotined during the day they bore away on their backs these dripping corpses and their red blouses had a clot of blood at the back of the neck which was dry in the morning and wet at night these tragic tales abounded in madame de salon and by dint of cursing marat they applauded trestaillon 
 some deputies of the undiscoverable variety played their whist there m thibord du chalard m lemarchant de gomicourt and the celebrated scoffer of the right m the bailiff de ferrette with his short breeches and his thin legs sometimes traversed this salon on his way to m de talleyrand 
 he had been m le comte companion in pleasures and unlike aristotle crouching under campaspe he had made the guimard crawl on all fours and in that way he had exhibited to the ages a philosopher avenged by a bailiff as for the priests there was the abbe halma the same to whom m larose his collaborator on la foudre said 
 bah 
 who is there who is not fifty years old a few greenhorns perhaps the abbe letourneur preacher to the king the abbe frayssinous who was not as yet either count or bishop or minister or peer and who wore an old cassock whose buttons were missing and the abbe keravenant cure of also the nuncio then monsignor macchi archbishop of nisibi later on cardinal remarkable for his long pensive nose and another monsignor entitled thus 
 abbate palmieri domestic prelate one of the seven participant prothonotaries of the holy see canon of the illustrious liberian basilica advocate of the saints postulatore dei santi which refers to matters of canonization and signifies very nearly master of requests of the section of paradise 
 lastly two cardinals m de la luzerne and m de cl t the cardinal of luzerne was a writer and was destined to have a few years later the honor of signing in the conservateur articles side by side with chateaubriand m de cl t was archbishop of toul and often made trips to paris to his nephew the marquis de t who was minister of marine and war 
 the cardinal of cl t was a merry little man who displayed his red stockings beneath his cassock his specialty was a hatred of the encyclopaedia and his desperate play at billiards and persons who at that epoch passed through the rue m on summer evenings where the hotel de cl t then stood halted to listen to the shock of the balls and the piercing voice of the cardinal shouting to his conclavist monseigneur cotiret bishop in partibus of caryste mark abbe i make a cannon 
 the cardinal de cl t had been brought to madame de by his most intimate friend m de roquelaure former bishop of senlis and one of the forty m de roquelaure was notable for his lofty figure and his assiduity at the academy through the glass door of the neighboring hall of the library where the french academy then held its meetings the curious could on every tuesday contemplate the of senlis usually standing erect freshly powdered in violet hose with his back turned to the door apparently for the purpose of allowing a better view of his little collar 
 all these ecclesiastics though for the most part as much courtiers as churchmen added to the gravity of the t salon whose seigniorial aspect was accentuated by five peers of france the marquis de vib the marquis de tal the marquis de herb the vicomte damb and the duc de val this duc de val although prince de mon that is to say a reigning prince abroad had so high an idea of france and its peerage that he viewed everything through their medium it was he who said 
 the cardinals are the peers of france of rome the lords are the peers of france of england 
 moreover as it is indispensable that the revolution should be everywhere in this century this feudal salon was as we have said dominated by a bourgeois m gillenormand reigned there 
 there lay the essence and quintessence of the parisian white society there reputations even royalist reputations were held in quarantine there is always a trace of anarchy in renown 
 chateaubriand had he entered there would have produced the effect of pere duchene 
 some of the did nevertheless penetrate thither on sufferance comte beug was received there subject to correction 
 the noble salons of the present day no longer resemble those salons the faubourg reeks of the fagot even now 
 the royalists of are demagogues let us record it to their credit 
 at madame de the society was superior taste was exquisite and haughty under the cover of a great show of politeness manners there admitted of all sorts of involuntary refinements which were the old regime itself buried but still alive 
 some of these habits especially in the matter of language seem eccentric persons but superficially acquainted with them would have taken for provincial that which was only antique 
 a woman was called madame la generale 
 madame la colonelle was not entirely disused the charming madame de leon in memory no doubt of the duchesses de longueville and de chevreuse preferred this appellation to her title of princesse 
 the marquise de crequy was also called madame la colonelle 
 it was this little high society which invented at the tuileries the refinement of speaking to the king in private as the king in the third person and never as your majesty the designation of your majesty having been soiled by the usurper 
 men and deeds were brought to judgment there 
 they jeered at the age which released them from the necessity of understanding it they abetted each other in amazement 
 they communicated to each other that modicum of light which they possessed methuselah bestowed information on epimenides 
 the deaf man made the blind man acquainted with the course of things 
 they declared that the time which had elasped since coblentz had not existed in the same manner that louis xviii 
 was by the grace of god in the five and twentieth year of his reign the emigrants were by rights in the five and twentieth year of their adolescence 
 all was harmonious nothing was too much alive speech hardly amounted to a breath the newspapers agreeing with the salons seemed a papyrus 
 there were some young people but they were rather dead 
 the liveries in the antechamber were antiquated these utterly obsolete personages were served by domestics of the same stamp 
 they all had the air of having lived a long time ago and of obstinately resisting the sepulchre 
 nearly the whole dictionary consisted of conserver conservation conservateur to be in good odor that was the point 
 there are in fact aromatics in the opinions of these venerable groups and their ideas smelled of it it was a mummified society 
 the masters were embalmed the servants were stuffed with straw 
 a worthy old marquise an emigree and ruined who had but a solitary maid continued to say 
 my people 
 what did they do in madame de salon 
 they were ultra 
 to be ultra this word although what it represents may not have disappeared has no longer any meaning at the present day let us explain it 
 to be ultra is to go beyond 
 it is to attack the sceptre in the name of the throne and the mitre in the name of the attar it is to the thing which one is dragging it is to kick over the traces it is to cavil at the fagot on the score of the amount of cooking received by heretics it is to reproach the idol with its small amount of idolatry it is to insult through excess of respect it is to discover that the pope is not sufficiently papish that the king is not sufficiently royal and that the night has too much light it is to be discontented with alabaster with snow with the swan and the lily in the name of whiteness it is to be a partisan of things to the point of becoming their enemy it is to be so strongly for as to be against 
 the ultra spirit especially characterizes the first phase of the restoration 
 nothing in history resembles that quarter of an hour which begins in and terminates about with the advent of m de villele the practical man of the right 
 these six years were an extraordinary moment at one and the same time brilliant and gloomy smiling and sombre illuminated as by the radiance of dawn and entirely covered at the same time with the shadows of the great catastrophes which still filled the horizon and were slowly sinking into the past 
 there existed in that light and that shadow a complete little new and old world comic and sad juvenile and senile which was rubbing its eyes nothing resembles an awakening like a return a group which regarded france with and which france regarded with irony good old owls of marquises by the streetful who had returned and of ghosts the former subjects of amazement at everything brave and noble gentlemen who smiled at being in france but wept also delighted to behold their country once more in despair at not finding their monarchy the nobility of the crusades treating the nobility of the empire that is to say the nobility of the sword with scorn historic races who had lost the sense of history the sons of the companions of charlemagne disdaining the companions of napoleon the swords as we have just remarked returned the insult the sword of fontenoy was laughable and nothing but a scrap of rusty iron the sword of marengo was odious and was only a sabre 
 former days did not recognize yesterday 
 people no longer had the feeling for what was grand 
 there was some one who called bonaparte scapin this society no longer exists 
 nothing of it we repeat exists when we select from it some one figure at random and attempt to make it live again in thought it seems as strange to us as the world before the deluge 
 it is because it too as a matter of fact has been engulfed in a deluge 
 it has disappeared beneath two revolutions 
 what billows are ideas 
 how quickly they cover all that it is their mission to destroy and to bury and how promptly they create frightful gulfs 
 such was the physiognomy of the salons of those distant and candid times when m martainville had more wit than voltaire 
 these salons had a literature and politics of their own they believed in fievee 
 m agier laid down the law in them they commentated m colnet the old bookseller and publicist of the quay malaquais 
 napoleon was to them thoroughly the corsican ogre later on the introduction into history of m le marquis de bonaparte of the armies was a concession to the spirit of the age 
 these salons did not long preserve their purity 
 beginning with doctrinarians began to spring up in them a disturbing shade their way was to be royalists and to excuse themselves for being so where the ultras were very proud the doctrinarians were rather ashamed they had wit they had silence their political dogma was suitably impregnated with arrogance they should have succeeded they indulged and usefully too in excesses in the matter of white neckties and tightly buttoned coats 
 the mistake or the misfortune of the doctrinarian party was to create aged youth 
 they assumed the poses of wise men 
 they dreamed of engrafting a temperate power on the absolute and excessive principle 
 they opposed and sometimes with rare intelligence conservative liberalism to the liberalism which demolishes 
 they were heard to say thanks for royalism 
 it has rendered more than one service 
 it has brought back tradition worship religion respect 
 it is faithful brave chivalric loving devoted 
 it has mingled though with regret the secular grandeurs of the monarchy with the new grandeurs of the nation 
 its mistake is not to understand the revolution the empire glory liberty young ideas young generations the age 
 but this mistake which it makes with regard to us have we not sometimes been guilty of it towards them 
 the revolution whose heirs we are ought to be intelligent on all points to attack royalism is a misconstruction of liberalism 
 what an error and what blindness 
 revolutionary france is wanting in respect towards historic france that is to say towards its mother that is to say towards itself 
 after the th of september the nobility of the monarchy is treated as the nobility of the empire was treated after the th of july 
 they were unjust to the eagle we are unjust to the it seems that we must always have something to proscribe 
 does it serve any purpose to ungild the crown of louis xiv to scrape the coat of arms of henry iv we scoff at m de vaublanc for erasing the from the bridge of jena what was it that he did 
 what are we doing 
 bouvines belongs to us as well as marengo 
 the are ours as well as the that is our patrimony 
 to what purpose shall we diminish it we must not deny our country in the past any more than in the present why not accept the whole of history 
 why not love the whole of france 
 it is thus that doctrinarians criticised and protected royalism which was displeased at criticism and furious at protection 
 the ultras marked the first epoch of royalism congregation characterized the second skill follows ardor 
 let us confine ourselves here to this sketch 
 in the course of this narrative the author of this book has encountered in his path this curious moment of contemporary history he has been forced to cast a passing glance upon it and to trace once more some of the singular features of this society which is unknown but he does it rapidly and without any bitter or derisive idea 
 souvenirs both respectful and affectionate for they touch his mother attach him to this past 
 moreover let us remark this same petty world had a grandeur of its own one may smile at it but one can neither despise nor hate it it was the france of former days 
 marius pontmercy pursued some studies as all children do 
 when he emerged from the hands of aunt gillenormand his grandfather confided him to a worthy professor of the most purely classic innocence this young soul which was expanding passed from a prude to a vulgar pedant 
 marius went through his years of college then he entered the law school 
 he was a royalist fanatical and severe 
 he did not love his grandfather much as the gayety and cynicism repelled him and his feelings towards his father were gloomy 
 he was on the whole a cold and ardent noble generous proud religious enthusiastic lad dignified to harshness pure to shyness

 there existed in that light and that shadow a complete little new and old world comic and sad juvenile and senile which was rubbing its eyes nothing resembles an awakening like a return a group which regarded france with and which france regarded with irony good old owls of marquises by the streetful who had returned and of ghosts the former subjects of amazement at everything brave and noble gentlemen who smiled at being in france but wept also delighted to behold their country once more in despair at not finding their monarchy the nobility of the crusades treating the nobility of the empire that is to say the nobility of the sword with scorn historic races who had lost the sense of history the sons of the companions of charlemagne disdaining the companions of napoleon the swords as we have just remarked returned the insult the sword of fontenoy was laughable and nothing but a scrap of rusty iron the sword of marengo was odious and was only a sabre 
 former days did not recognize yesterday 
 people no longer had the feeling for what was grand 
 there was some one who called bonaparte scapin this society no longer exists 
 nothing of it we repeat exists when we select from it some one figure at random and attempt to make it live again in thought it seems as strange to us as the world before the deluge 
 it is because it too as a matter of fact has been engulfed in a deluge 
 it has disappeared beneath two revolutions 
 what billows are ideas 
 how quickly they cover all that it is their mission to destroy and to bury and how promptly they create frightful gulfs 
 such was the physiognomy of the salons of those distant and candid times when m martainville had more wit than voltaire 
 these salons had a literature and politics of their own they believed in fievee 
 m agier laid down the law in them they commentated m colnet the old bookseller and publicist of the quay malaquais 
 napoleon was to them thoroughly the corsican ogre later on the introduction into history of m le marquis de bonaparte of the armies was a concession to the spirit of the age 
 these salons did not long preserve their purity 
 beginning with doctrinarians began to spring up in them a disturbing shade their way was to be royalists and to excuse themselves for being so where the ultras were very proud the doctrinarians were rather ashamed they had wit they had silence their political dogma was suitably impregnated with arrogance they should have succeeded they indulged and usefully too in excesses in the matter of white neckties and tightly buttoned coats 
 the mistake or the misfortune of the doctrinarian party was to create aged youth 
 they assumed the poses of wise men 
 they dreamed of engrafting a temperate power on the absolute and excessive principle 
 they opposed and sometimes with rare intelligence conservative liberalism to the liberalism which demolishes 
 they were heard to say thanks for royalism 
 it has rendered more than one service 
 it has brought back tradition worship religion respect 
 it is faithful brave chivalric loving devoted 
 it has mingled though with regret the secular grandeurs of the monarchy with the new grandeurs of the nation 
 its mistake is not to understand the revolution the empire glory liberty young ideas young generations the age 
 but this mistake which it makes with regard to us have we not sometimes been guilty of it towards them 
 the revolution whose heirs we are ought to be intelligent on all points to attack royalism is a misconstruction of liberalism 
 what an error and what blindness 
 revolutionary france is wanting in respect towards historic france that is to say towards its mother that is to say towards itself 
 after the th of september the nobility of the monarchy is treated as the nobility of the empire was treated after the th of july 
 they were unjust to the eagle we are unjust to the it seems that we must always have something to proscribe 
 does it serve any purpose to ungild the crown of louis xiv to scrape the coat of arms of henry iv we scoff at m de vaublanc for erasing the from the bridge of jena what was it that he did 
 what are we doing 
 bouvines belongs to us as well as marengo 
 the are ours as well as the that is our patrimony 
 to what purpose shall we diminish it we must not deny our country in the past any more than in the present why not accept the whole of history 
 why not love the whole of france 
 it is thus that doctrinarians criticised and protected royalism which was displeased at criticism and furious at protection 
 the ultras marked the first epoch of royalism congregation characterized the second skill follows ardor 
 let us confine ourselves here to this sketch 
 in the course of this narrative the author of this book has encountered in his path this curious moment of contemporary history he has been forced to cast a passing glance upon it and to trace once more some of the singular features of this society which is unknown but he does it rapidly and without any bitter or derisive idea 
 souvenirs both respectful and affectionate for they touch his mother attach him to this past 
 moreover let us remark this same petty world had a grandeur of its own one may smile at it but one can neither despise nor hate it it was the france of former days 
 marius pontmercy pursued some studies as all children do 
 when he emerged from the hands of aunt gillenormand his grandfather confided him to a worthy professor of the most purely classic innocence this young soul which was expanding passed from a prude to a vulgar pedant 
 marius went through his years of college then he entered the law school 
 he was a royalist fanatical and severe 
 he did not love his grandfather much as the gayety and cynicism repelled him and his feelings towards his father were gloomy 
 he was on the whole a cold and ardent noble generous proud religious enthusiastic lad dignified to harshness pure to shyness

 chapter v 
 
 davout was to napoleon what arakcheev was to alexander though not a coward like arakcheev he was as precise as cruel and as unable to express his devotion to his monarch except by cruelty 
 in the organism of states such men are necessary as wolves are necessary in the organism of nature and they always exist always appear and hold their own however incongruous their presence and their proximity to the head of the government may be this inevitability alone can explain how the cruel arakcheev who tore out a mustache with his own hands whose weak nerves rendered him unable to face danger and who was neither an educated man nor a courtier was able to maintain his powerful position with alexander whose own character was chivalrous noble and gentle 
 balashev found davout seated on a barrel in the shed of a hut writing he was auditing accounts better quarters could have been found him but marshal davout was one of those men who purposely put themselves in most depressing conditions to have a justification for being gloomy for the same reason they are always hard at work and in a hurry how can i think of the bright side of life when as you see i am sitting on a barrel and working in a dirty shed the expression of his face seemed to say the chief pleasure and necessity of such men when they encounter anyone who shows animation is to flaunt their own dreary persistent activity davout allowed himself that pleasure when balashev was brought in he became still more absorbed in his task when the russian general entered and after glancing over his spectacles at face which was animated by the beauty of the morning and by his talk with murat he did not rise or even stir but scowled still more and sneered malevolently 
 when he noticed in face the disagreeable impression this reception produced davout raised his head and coldly asked what he wanted 
 thinking he could have been received in such a manner only because davout did not know that he was adjutant general to the emperor alexander and even his envoy to napoleon balashev hastened to inform him of his rank and mission contrary to his expectation davout after hearing him became still surlier and ruder 
 where is your dispatch he inquired give it to me i will send it to the emperor 
 balashev replied that he had been ordered to hand it personally to the emperor 
 your orders are obeyed in your army but here said davout you must do as told 
 and as if to make the russian general still more conscious of his dependence on brute force davout sent an adjutant to call the officer on duty 
 balashev took out the packet containing the letter and laid it on the table made of a door with its hinges still hanging on it laid across two barrels davout took the packet and read the inscription 
 you are perfectly at liberty to treat me with respect or not protested balashev but permit me to observe that i have the honor to be adjutant general to his majesty 
 davout glanced at him silently and plainly derived pleasure from the signs of agitation and confusion which appeared on face 
 you will be treated as is fitting said he and putting the packet in his pocket left the shed 
 a minute later the adjutant de castres came in and conducted balashev to the quarters assigned him 
 that day he dined with the marshal at the same board on the barrels 
 next day davout rode out early and after asking balashev to come to him peremptorily requested him to remain there to move on with the baggage train should orders come for it to move and to talk to no one except monsieur de castres 
 after four days of solitude ennui and consciousness of his impotence and insignificance particularly acute by contrast with the sphere of power in which he had so lately moved and after several marches with the baggage and the french army which occupied the whole district balashev was brought to vilna now occupied by the french through the very gate by which he had left it four days previously 
 next day the imperial the comte de turenne came to balashev and informed him of the emperor wish to honor him with an audience 
 four days before sentinels of the preobrazhensk regiment had stood in front of the house to which balashev was conducted and now two french grenadiers stood there in blue uniforms unfastened in front and with shaggy caps on their heads and an escort of hussars and uhlans and a brilliant suite of pages and generals who were waiting for napoleon to come out were standing at the porch round his saddle horse and his mameluke rustan napoleon received balashev in the very house in vilna from which alexander had dispatched him on his mission

 chapter iv 
 
 end of the brigand 
 the conclusion of marius classical studies coincided with m departure from society 
 the old man bade farewell to the faubourg and to madame de salon and established himself in the mardis in his house of the rue des there he had for servants in addition to the porter that chambermaid nicolette who had succeeded to magnon and that and pursy basque who have been mentioned above 
 in marius had just attained his seventeenth year 
 one evening on his return home he saw his grandfather holding a letter in his hand 
 marius said m gillenormand you will set out for vernon 
 why said marius 
 to see your father 
 marius was seized with a trembling fit 
 he had thought of everything except he should one day be called upon to see his father nothing could be more unexpected more surprising and let us admit it more disagreeable to him 
 it was forcing estrangement into reconciliation 
 it was not an affliction but it was an unpleasant duty 
 marius in addition to his motives of political antipathy was convinced that his father the slasher as m gillenormand called him on his amiable days did not love him this was evident since he had abandoned him to others 
 feeling that he was not beloved he did not love 
 nothing is more simple he said to himself 
 he was so astounded that he did not question m gillenormand the grandfather resumed 
 it appears that he is ill 
 he demands your presence 
 and after a pause he added 
 set out morning 
 i think there is a coach which leaves the cour des fontaines at six and which arrives in the evening take it 
 he says that here is haste 
 then he crushed the letter in his hand and thrust it into his pocket marius might have set out that very evening and have been with his father on the following morning 
 a diligence from the rue du bouloi took the trip to rouen by night at that date and passed through vernon 
 neither marius nor thought of making inquiries about it 
 the next day at twilight marius reached vernon 
 people were just beginning to light their candles 
 he asked the first person whom be met for m house 
 for in his own mind he agreed with the restoration and like it did not recognize his claim to the title of either colonel or baron 
 the house was pointed out to him 
 he rang a woman with a little lamp in her hand opened the door 
 m pontmercy said marius 
 the woman remained motionless 
 is this his house demanded marius 
 the woman nodded affirmatively 
 can i speak with him 
 the woman shook her head 
 but i am his son persisted marius 
 he is expecting me 
 he no longer expects you said the woman 
 then he perceived that she was weeping 
 she pointed to the door of a room on the he entered 
 in that room which was lighted by a tallow candle standing on the there were three men one standing erect another kneeling and one lying at full length on the floor in his shirt 
 the one on the floor was the colonel 
 the other two were the doctor and the priest who was engaged in prayer 
 the colonel had been attacked by brain fever three days previously as he had a foreboding of evil at the very beginning of his illness he had written to m gillenormand to demand his son 
 the malady had grown worse 
 on the very evening of marius arrival at vernon the colonel had had an attack of delirium he had risen from his bed in spite of the efforts to prevent him crying 
 my son is not coming 
 i shall go to meet him 
 then he ran out of his room and fell prostrate on the floor of the antechamber 
 he had just expired 
 the doctor had been summoned and the cure 
 the doctor had arrived too late 
 the son had also arrived too late 
 by the dim light of the candle a large tear could be distinguished on the pale and prostrate cheek where it had trickled from his dead eye 
 the eye was extinguished but the tear was not yet dry 
 that tear was his delay 
 marius gazed upon that man whom he beheld for the first time on that venerable and manly face on those open eyes which saw not on those white locks those robust limbs on which here and there brown lines marking and a sort of red stars which indicated were visible 
 he contemplated that gigantic sear which stamped heroism on that countenance upon which god had imprinted goodness 
 he reflected that this man was his father and that this man was dead and a chill ran over him 
 the sorrow which he felt was the sorrow which he would have felt in the presence of any other man whom he had chanced to behold stretched out in death 
 anguish poignant anguish was in that chamber 
 the was lamenting in a corner the cure was praying and his sobs were audible the doctor was wiping his eyes the corpse itself was weeping 
 the doctor the priest and the woman gazed at marius in the midst of their affliction without uttering a word he was the stranger there 
 marius who was far too little affected felt ashamed and embarrassed at his own attitude he held his hat in his hand and he dropped it on the floor in order to produce the impression that grief had deprived him of the strength to hold it 
 at the same time he experienced remorse and he despised himself for behaving in this manner 
 but was it his fault 
 he did not love his father 
 why should he 
 the colonel had left nothing 
 the sale of big furniture barely paid the expenses of his burial 
 the servant found a scrap of paper which she handed to marius it contained the following in the handwriting 
 for my emperor made me a baron on the of waterloo 
 since the restoration disputes my right to this title which i purchased with my blood my son shall take it and bear it that he will be worthy of it is a matter of course 
 below the colonel had added 
 at that same battle of waterloo a sergeant saved my life the name was thenardier 
 i think that he has recently been keeping a little inn in a village in the neighborhood of paris at chelles or montfermeil 
 if my son meets him he will do all the good he can to thenardier 
 marius took this paper and preserved it not out of duty to his father but because of that vague respect for death which is always imperious in the heart of man 
 nothing remained of the colonel 
 m gillenormand had his sword and uniform sold to an dealer 
 the neighbors devastated the garden and pillaged the rare flowers 
 the other plants turned to nettles and weeds and died 
 marius remained only hours at vernon 
 after the interment he returned to paris and applied himself again to his law studies with no more thought of his father than if the latter had never lived in two days the colonel was buried and in three forgotten 
 marius wore crape on his hat 
 that was all

 though balashev was used to imperial pomp he was amazed at the luxury and magnificence of court 
 the comte de turenne showed him into a big reception room where many generals and polish magnates several of whom balashev had seen at the court of the emperor of russia were waiting duroc said that napoleon would receive the russian general before going for his ride 
 after some minutes the who was on duty came into the great reception room and bowing politely asked balashev to follow him 
 balashev went into a small reception room one door of which led into a study the very one from which the russian emperor had dispatched him on his mission he stood a minute or two waiting he heard hurried footsteps beyond the door both halves of it were opened rapidly all was silent and then from the study the sound was heard of other steps firm and resolute they were those of napoleon he had just finished dressing for his ride and wore a blue uniform opening in front over a white waistcoat so long that it covered his rotund stomach white leather breeches tightly fitting the fat thighs of his short legs and hessian boots his short hair had evidently just been brushed but one lock hung down in the middle of his broad forehead his plump white neck stood out sharply above the black collar of his uniform and he smelled of eau de cologne his full face rather with its prominent chin wore a gracious and majestic expression of imperial welcome 
 he entered briskly with a jerk at every step and his head slightly thrown back his whole short corpulent figure with broad thick shoulders and chest and stomach involuntarily protruding had that imposing and stately appearance one sees in men of forty who live in comfort it was evident too that he was in the best of spirits that day 
 he nodded in answer to low and respectful bow and coming up to him at once began speaking like a man who values every moment of his time and does not condescend to prepare what he has to say but is sure he will always say the right thing and say it well 
 good day general said he i have received the letter you brought from the emperor alexander and am very glad to see you he glanced with his large eyes into face and immediately looked past him 
 it was plain that personality did not interest him at all evidently only what took place within his own mind interested him nothing outside himself had any significance for him because everything in the world it seemed to him depended entirely on his will 
 i do not and did not desire war he continued but it has been forced on me even now he emphasized the word i am ready to receive any explanations you can give me 
 and he began clearly and concisely to explain his reasons for dissatisfaction with the russian government judging by the calmly moderate and amicable tone in which the french emperor spoke balashev was firmly persuaded that he wished for peace and intended to enter into negotiations 
 when napoleon having finished speaking looked inquiringly at the russian envoy balashev began a speech he had prepared long before sire the emperor my master but the sight of the eyes bent on him confused him you are flurried compose yourself napoleon seemed to say as with a scarcely perceptible smile he looked at uniform and sword 
 balashev recovered himself and began to speak he said that the emperor alexander did not consider demand for his passports a sufficient cause for war that kurakin had acted on his own initiative and without his assent that the emperor alexander did not desire war and had no relations with england 
 not yet interposed napoleon and as if fearing to give vent to his feelings he frowned and nodded slightly as a sign that balashev might proceed 
 after saying all he had been instructed to say balashev added that the emperor alexander wished for peace but would not enter into negotiations except on condition that here balashev hesitated he remembered the words the emperor alexander had not written in his letter but had specially inserted in the rescript to saltykov and had told balashev to repeat to napoleon balashev remembered these words so long as a single armed foe remains on russian soil but some complex feeling restrained him he could not utter them though he wished to do so he grew confused and said on condition that the french army retires beyond the niemen 
 napoleon noticed embarrassment when uttering these last words his face twitched and the calf of his left leg began to quiver rhythmically without moving from where he stood he began speaking in a louder tone and more hurriedly than before during the speech that followed balashev who more than once lowered his eyes involuntarily noticed the quivering of left leg which increased the more napoleon raised his voice 
 i desire peace no less than the emperor alexander he began have i not for eighteen months been doing everything to obtain it i have waited eighteen months for explanations but in order to begin negotiations what is demanded of me he said frowning and making an energetic gesture of inquiry with his small white plump hand 
 the withdrawal of your army beyond the niemen sire replied balashev 
 the niemen repeated napoleon so now you want me to retire beyond the niemen only the niemen repeated napoleon looking straight at balashev 
 the latter bowed his head respectfully 
 instead of the demand of four months earlier to withdraw from pomerania only a withdrawal beyond the niemen was now demanded napoleon turned quickly and began to pace the room 
 you say the demand now is that i am to withdraw beyond the niemen before commencing negotiations but in just the same way two months ago the demand was that i should withdraw beyond the vistula and the oder and yet you are willing to negotiate 
 he went in silence from one corner of the room to the other and again stopped in front of balashev balashev noticed that his left leg was quivering faster than before and his face seemed petrified in its stern expression this quivering of his left leg was a thing napoleon was conscious of the vibration of my left calf is a great sign with me he remarked at a later date 
 such demands as to retreat beyond the vistula and oder may be made to a prince of baden but not to me napoleon almost screamed quite to his own surprise if you gave me petersburg and moscow i could not accept such conditions you say i have begun this war but who first joined his army the emperor alexander not i and you offer me negotiations when i have expended millions when you are in alliance with england and when your position is a bad one you offer me negotiations but what is the aim of your alliance with england what has she given you he continued hurriedly evidently no longer trying to show the advantages of peace and discuss its possibility but only to prove his own rectitude and power and errors and duplicity 
 the commencement of his speech had obviously been made with the intention of demonstrating the advantages of his position and showing that he was nevertheless willing to negotiate but he had begun talking and the more he talked the less could he control his words 
 the whole purport of his remarks now was evidently to exalt himself and insult alexander just what he had least desired at the commencement of the interview 
 i hear you have made peace with turkey 
 balashev bowed his head affirmatively 
 peace has been concluded he began 
 but napoleon did not let him speak he evidently wanted to do all the talking himself and continued to talk with the sort of eloquence and unrestrained irritability to which spoiled people are so prone 
 yes i know you have made peace with the turks without obtaining moldavia and wallachia i would have given your sovereign those provinces as i gave him finland yes he went on i promised and would have given the emperor alexander moldavia and wallachia and now he have those splendid provinces yet he might have united them to his empire and in a single reign would have extended russia from the gulf of bothnia to the mouths of the danube catherine the great could not have done more said napoleon growing more and more excited as he paced up and down the room repeating to balashev almost the very words he had used to alexander himself at tilsit all that he would have owed to my friendship oh what a splendid reign he repeated several times then paused drew from his pocket a gold snuffbox lifted it to his nose and greedily sniffed at it 
 what a splendid reign the emperor might have been 
 he looked compassionately at balashev and as soon as the latter tried to make some rejoinder hastily interrupted him 
 what could he wish or look for that he would not have obtained through my friendship demanded napoleon shrugging his shoulders in perplexity but no he has preferred to surround himself with my enemies and with whom with steins armfeldts bennigsens and wintzingerodes stein a traitor expelled from his own country armfeldt a rake and an intriguer wintzingerode a fugitive french subject bennigsen rather more of a soldier than the others but all the same an incompetent who was unable to do anything in and who should awaken terrible memories in the emperor mind granted that were they competent they might be made use of continued napoleon hardly able to keep pace in words with the rush of thoughts that incessantly sprang up proving how right and strong he was in his perception the two were one and the same but they are not even that they are neither fit for war nor peace barclay is said to be the most capable of them all but i cannot say so judging by his first movements and what are they doing all these courtiers pfuel proposes armfeldt disputes bennigsen considers and barclay called on to act does not know what to decide on and time passes bringing no result bagration alone is a military man stupid but he has experience a quick eye and resolution and what role is your young monarch playing in that monstrous crowd they compromise him and throw on him the responsibility for all that happens a sovereign should not be with the army unless he is a general said napoleon evidently uttering these words as a direct challenge to the emperor he knew how alexander desired to be a military commander 
 the campaign began only a week ago and you even been able to defend vilna you are cut in two and have been driven out of the polish provinces your army is grumbling 
 on the contrary your majesty said balashev hardly able to remember what had been said to him and following these verbal fireworks with difficulty the troops are burning with eagerness 
 i know everything napoleon interrupted him i know everything i know the number of your battalions as exactly as i know my own you have not two hundred thousand men and i have three times that number i give you my word of honor said napoleon forgetting that his word of honor could carry no weight i give you my word of honor that i have five hundred and thirty thousand men this side of the vistula the turks will be of no use to you they are worth nothing and have shown it by making peace with you as for the swedes it is their fate to be governed by mad kings their king was insane and they changed him for another bernadotte who promptly went mad for no swede would ally himself with russia unless he were mad 
 napoleon grinned maliciously and again raised his snuffbox to his nose 
 balashev knew how to reply to each of remarks and would have done so he continually made the gesture of a man wishing to say something but napoleon always interrupted him to the alleged insanity of the swedes balashev wished to reply that when russia is on her side sweden is practically an island but napoleon gave an angry exclamation to drown his voice napoleon was in that state of irritability in which a man has to talk talk and talk merely to convince himself that he is in the right balashev began to feel uncomfortable as envoy he feared to demean his dignity and felt the necessity of replying but as a man he shrank before the transport of groundless wrath that had evidently seized napoleon he knew that none of the words now uttered by napoleon had any significance and that napoleon himself would be ashamed of them when he came to his senses balashev stood with downcast eyes looking at the movements of stout legs and trying to avoid meeting his eyes 
 but what do i care about your allies said napoleon i have allies the poles there are eighty thousand of them and they fight like lions and there will be two hundred thousand of them 
 and probably still more perturbed by the fact that he had uttered this obvious falsehood and that balashev still stood silently before him in the same attitude of submission to fate napoleon abruptly turned round drew close to face and gesticulating rapidly and energetically with his white hands almost shouted 
 know that if you stir up prussia against me wipe it off the map of europe he declared his face pale and distorted by anger and he struck one of his small hands energetically with the other yes i will throw you back beyond the dvina and beyond the dnieper and will against you that barrier which it was criminal and blind of europe to allow to be destroyed yes that is what will happen to you that is what you have gained by alienating me and he walked silently several times up and down the room his fat shoulders twitching 
 he put his snuffbox into his waistcoat pocket took it out again lifted it several times to his nose and stopped in front of balashev he paused looked ironically straight into eyes and said in a quiet voice 
 and yet what a splendid reign your master might have had 
 balashev feeling it incumbent on him to reply said that from the russian side things did not appear in so gloomy a light napoleon was silent still looking derisively at him and evidently not listening to him balashev said that in russia the best results were expected from the war napoleon nodded condescendingly as if to say i know your duty to say that but you believe it yourself i have convinced you 
 when balashev had ended napoleon again took out his snuffbox sniffed at it and stamped his foot twice on the floor as a signal the door opened a bending respectfully handed the emperor his hat and gloves another brought hima pocket handkerchief napoleon without giving them a glance turned to balashev 
 assure the emperor alexander from me said he taking his hat that i am as devoted to him as before i know him thoroughly and very highly esteem his lofty qualities i will detain you no longer general you shall receive my letter to the emperor 
 and napoleon went quickly to the door everyone in the reception room rushed forward and descended the staircase

 the utility of going to mass in order to become a revolutionist 
 marius had preserved the religious habits of his childhood one sunday when he went to hear mass at at that same chapel of the virgin whither his aunt had led him when a small lad he placed himself behind a pillar being more and thoughtful than usual on that occasion and knelt down without paying any special heed upon a chair of utrecht velvet on the back of which was inscribed this name 
 monsieur mabeuf warden 
 mass had hardly begun when an old man presented himself and said to marius 
 this is my place sir 
 marius stepped aside promptly and the old man took possession of his chair 
 the mass concluded marius still stood thoughtfully a few paces distant the old man approached him again and said 
 i beg your pardon sir for having disturbed you a while ago and for again disturbing you at this moment you must have thought me intrusive and i will explain myself 
 there is no need of that sir said marius 
 yes went on the old man i do not wish you to have a bad opinion of me 
 you see i am attached to this place 
 it seems to me that the mass is better from here 
 why 
 i will tell you it is from this place that i have watched a poor brave father come regularly every two or three months for the last ten years since he had no other opportunity and no other way of seeing his child because he was prevented by family arrangements he came at the hour when he knew that his son would be brought to mass 
 the little one never suspected that his father was there perhaps he did not even know that he had a father poor innocent the father kept behind a pillar so that he might not be seen he gazed at his child and he wept 
 he adored that little fellow poor man 
 i could see that 
 this spot has become sanctified in my sight and i have contracted a habit of coming hither to listen to the mass 
 i prefer it to the stall to which i have a right in my capacity of warden 
 i knew that unhappy gentleman a little too he had a a wealthy aunt relatives i know exactly what all who threatened to disinherit the child if he the father saw him 
 he sacrificed himself in order that his son might be rich and happy some day 
 he was separated from him because of political opinions 
 certainly i approve of political opinions but there are people who do not know where to stop mon dieu a man is not a monster because he was at waterloo a father is not separated from his child for such a reason as that he was one of colonels 
 he is dead i believe 
 he lived at vernon where i have a brother who is a cure and his name was something like pontmarie or montpercy 
 he had a fine on my honor 
 pontmercy suggested marius turning pale 
 precisely pontmercy 
 did you know him 
 sir said marius he was my father 
 the old warden clasped his hands and exclaimed 
 ah you are the child 
 yes true he must be a man by this time 
 well poor child you may say that you had a father who loved you dearly 
 marius offered his arm to the old man and conducted him to his lodgings 
 on the following day he said to m gillenormand 
 i have arranged a with some friends 
 will you permit me to be absent for three days 
 four replied his grandfather 
 go and amuse yourself 
 and he said to his daughter in a low tone and with a wink some love affair

 after all that napoleon had said to him those bursts of anger and the last dryly spoken words i will detain you no longer general you shall receive my letter balashev felt convinced that napoleon would not wish to see him and would even avoid another meeting with him an insulted envoy especially as he had witnessed his unseemly anger but to his surprise balashev received through duroc an invitation to dine with the emperor that day 
 bessieres caulaincourt and berthier were present at that dinner 
 napoleon met balashev cheerfully and amiably he not only showed no sign of constraint or on account of his outburst that morning but on the contrary tried to reassure balashev it was evident that he had long been convinced that it was impossible for him to make a mistake and that in his perception whatever he did was right not because it harmonized with any idea of right and wrong but because he did it 
 the emperor was in very good spirits after his ride through vilna where crowds of people had rapturously greeted and followed him from all the windows of the streets through which he rode rugs flags and his monogram were displayed and the polish ladies welcoming him waved their handkerchiefs to him 
 at dinner having placed balashev beside him napoleon not only treated him amiably but behaved as if balashev were one of his own courtiers one of those who sympathized with his plans and ought to rejoice at his success in the course of conversation he mentioned moscow and questioned balashev about the russian capital not merely as an interested traveler asks about a new city he intends to visit but as if convinced that balashev as a russian must be flattered by his curiosity 
 how many inhabitants are there in moscow how many houses is it true that moscow is called holy moscow how many churches are there in moscow he asked 
 and receiving the reply that there were more than two hundred churches he remarked 
 why such a quantity of churches 
 the russians are very devout replied balashev 
 but a large number of monasteries and churches is always a sign of the backwardness of a people said napoleon turning to caulaincourt for appreciation of this remark 
 balashev respectfully ventured to disagree with the french emperor 
 every country has its own character said he 
 but nowhere in europe is there anything like that said napoleon 
 i beg your pardon returned balashev besides russia there is spain where there are also many churches and monasteries 
 this reply of which hinted at the recent defeats of the french in spain was much appreciated when he related it at court but it was not much appreciated at dinner where it passed unnoticed 
 the uninterested and perplexed faces of the marshals showed that they were puzzled as to what tone suggested if there is a point we see it or it is not at all witty their expressions seemed to say so little was his rejoinder appreciated that napoleon did not notice it at all and naively asked balashev through what towns the direct road from there to moscow passed balashev who was on the alert all through the dinner replied that just as all roads lead to rome so all roads lead to moscow there were many roads and among them the road through poltava which charles xii chose balashev involuntarily flushed with pleasure at the aptitude of this reply but hardly had he uttered the word poltava before caulaincourt began speaking of the badness of the road from petersburg to moscow and of his petersburg reminiscences 
 after dinner they went to drink coffee in study which four days previously had been that of the emperor alexander napoleon sat down toying with his sevres coffee cup and motioned balashev to a chair beside him 
 napoleon was in that mood which more than any reasoned cause makes a man contented with himself and disposed to consider everyone his friend it seemed to him that he was surrounded by men who adored him and he felt convinced that after his dinner balashev too was his friend and worshiper napoleon turned to him with a pleasant though slightly ironic smile 
 they tell me this is the room the emperor alexander occupied strange it general he said evidently not doubting that this remark would be agreeable to his hearer since it went to prove his superiority to alexander 
 balashev made no reply and bowed and bowed his head in silence 
 yes four days ago in this room wintzingerode and stein were deliberating continued napoleon with the same derisive and smile what i understand he went on is that the emperor alexander has surrounded himself with my personal enemies that i do not understand has he not thought that i may the same and he turned inquiringly to balashev and evidently this thought turned him back on to the track of his anger which was still fresh in him 
 and let him know that i will do so said napoleon rising and pushing his cup away with his hand drive all his wurttemberg baden and weimar relations out of germany yes drive them out let him prepare an asylum for them in russia 
 balashev bowed his head with an air indicating that he would like to make his bow and leave and only listened because he could not help hearing what was said to him napoleon did not notice this expression he treated balashev not as an envoy from his enemy but as a man now fully devoted to him and who must rejoice at his former humiliation 
 and why has the emperor alexander taken command of the armies what is the good of that war is my profession but his business is to reign and not to command armies why has he taken on himself such a responsibility 
 again napoleon brought out his snuffbox paced several times up and down the room in silence and then suddenly and unexpectedly went up to balashev and with a slight smile as confidently quickly and simply as if he were doing something not merely important but pleasing to balashev he raised his hand to the russian face and taking him by the ear pulled it gently smiling with his lips only 
 to have ear pulled by the emperor was considered the greatest honor and mark of favor at the french court 
 well adorer and courtier of the emperor alexander why you say anything said he as if it was ridiculous in his presence to be the adorer and courtier of anyone but himself napoleon are the horses ready for the general he added with a slight inclination of his head in reply to bow let him have mine he has a long way to go 
 the letter taken by balashev was the last napoleon sent to alexander every detail of the interview was communicated to the russian monarch and the war began

 book grandfather and the grandson 
 chapter vi 
 
 the consequences of having met a warden 
 where it was that marius went will be disclosed a little further on 
 marius was absent for three days then he returned to paris went straight to the library of the and asked for the files of the moniteur 
 he read the moniteur he read all the histories of the republic and the empire the memorial de all the memoirs all the newspapers the bulletins the proclamations he devoured everything 
 the first time that he came across his name in the bulletins of the grand army he had a fever for a week he went to see the generals under whom georges pontmercy had served among others comte h mabeuf whom he went to see again told him about the life at vernon the retreat his flowers his solitude 
 marius came to a full knowledge of that rare sweet and sublime man that species of who had been his father 
 in the meanwhile occupied as he was with this study which absorbed all his moments as well as his thoughts he hardly saw the gillenormands at all 
 he made his appearance at meals then they searched for him and he was not to be found 
 father gillenormand smiled 
 bah bah he is just of the age for the girls 
 sometimes the old man added the deuce 
 i thought it was only an affair of gallantry it seems that it is an affair of passion 
 it was a passion in fact 
 marius was on the high road to adoring his father 
 at the same time his ideas underwent an extraordinary change the phases of this change were numerous and successive 
 as this is the history of many minds of our day we think it will prove useful to follow these phases step by step and to indicate them all 
 that history upon which he had just cast his eyes appalled him 
 the first effect was to dazzle him 
 up to that time the republic the empire had been to him only monstrous words 
 the republic a guillotine in the twilight the empire a sword in the night 
 he had just taken a look at it and where he had expected to find only a chaos of shadows he had beheld with a sort of unprecedented surprise mingled with fear and joy stars sparkling mirabeau vergniaud robespierre camille desmoulins danton and a sun arise napoleon 
 he did not know where he stood 
 he recoiled blinded by the brilliant lights little by little when his astonishment had passed off he grew accustomed to this radiance he contemplated these deeds without dizziness he examined these personages without terror the revolution and the empire presented themselves luminously in perspective before his eye he beheld each of these groups of events and of men summed up in two tremendous facts the republic in the sovereignty of civil right restored to the masses the empire in the sovereignty of the french idea imposed on europe he beheld the grand figure of the people emerge from the revolution and the grand figure of france spring forth from the empire he asserted in his conscience that all this had been good what his dazzled state neglected in this his first far too synthetic estimation we do not think it necessary to point out here it is the state of a mind on the march that we are recording progress is not accomplished in one stage 
 that stated once for all in connection with what precedes as well as with what is to follow we continue 
 he then perceived that up to that moment he had comprehended his country no more than he had comprehended his father 
 he had not known either the one or the other and a sort of voluntary night had obscured his eyes 
 now he saw and on the one hand he admired while on the other he adored 
 he was filled with regret and remorse and he reflected in despair that all he had in his soul could now be said only to the tomb oh if his father had still been in existence if he had still had him if god in his compassion and his goodness had permitted his father to be still among the living how he would have run how he would have precipitated himself how he would have cried to his father 
 father 
 here i am 
 it is i 
 i have the same heart as thou 
 i am thy son 
 how he would have embraced that white head bathed his hair in tears gazed upon his scar pressed his hands adored his garment kissed his feet 
 oh 
 why had his father died so early before his time before the justice the love of his son had come to him 
 marius had a continual sob in his heart which said to him every moment 
 alas 
 at the same time he became more truly serious more truly grave more sure of his thought and his faith 
 at each instant gleams of the true came to complete his reason 
 an inward growth seemed to be in progress within him 
 he was conscious of a sort of natural enlargement which gave him two things that were new to father and his country 
 as everything opens when one has a key so he explained to himself that which he had hated he penetrated that which he had abhorred henceforth he plainly perceived the providential divine and human sense of the great things which he had been taught to detest and of the great men whom he had been instructed to curse 
 when he reflected on his former opinions which were but those of yesterday and which nevertheless seemed to him already so very ancient he grew indignant yet he smiled 
 from the rehabilitation of his father he naturally passed to the rehabilitation of napoleon 
 but the latter we will confess was not effected without labor 
 from his infancy he had been imbued with the judgments of the party of on bonaparte 
 now all the prejudices of the restoration all its interests all its instincts tended to disfigure napoleon it execrated him even more than it did robespierre 
 it had very cleverly turned to sufficiently good account the fatigue of the nation and the hatred of mothers 
 bonaparte had become an almost fabulous monster and in order to paint him to the imagination of the people which as we lately pointed out resembles the imagination of children the party of made him appear under all sorts of terrifying masks in succession from that which is terrible though it remains grandiose to that which is terrible and becomes grotesque from tiberius to the bugaboo 
 thus in speaking of bonaparte one was free to sob or to puff up with laughter provided that hatred lay at the bottom 
 marius had never entertained about that man as he was other ideas in his mind they had combined with the tenacity which existed in his nature there was in him a headstrong little man who hated napoleon 
 on reading history on studying him especially in the documents and materials for history the veil which concealed napoleon from the eyes of marius was gradually rent 
 he caught a glimpse of something immense and he suspected that he had been deceived up to that moment on the score of bonaparte as about all the rest each day he saw more distinctly and he set about mounting slowly step by step almost regretfully in the beginning then with intoxication and as though attracted by an irresistible fascination first the sombre steps then the vaguely illuminated steps at last the luminous and splendid steps of enthusiasm 
 one night he was alone in his little chamber near the roof his candle was burning he was reading with his elbows resting on his table close to the open window 
 all sorts of reveries reached him from space and mingled with his thoughts 
 what a spectacle is the night 
 one hears dull sounds without knowing whence they proceed one beholds jupiter which is twelve hundred times larger than the earth glowing like a firebrand the azure is black the stars shine it is formidable 
 he was perusing the bulletins of the grand army those heroic strophes penned on the field of battle there at intervals he beheld his name always the name of the emperor the whole of that great empire presented itself to him he felt a flood swelling and rising within him it seemed to him at moments that his father passed close to him like a breath and whispered in his ear he gradually got into a singular state he thought that he heard drums cannon trumpets the measured tread of battalions the dull and distant gallop of the cavalry from time to time his eyes were raised heavenward and gazed upon the colossal constellations as they gleamed in the measureless depths of space then they fell upon his book once more and there they beheld other colossal things moving confusedly 
 his heart contracted within him he was in a transport trembling panting 
 all at once without himself knowing what was in him and what impulse he was obeying he sprang to his feet stretched both arms out of the window gazed intently into the gloom the silence the infinite darkness the eternal immensity and exclaimed 
 long live the emperor 
 from that moment forth all was over the ogre of corsica the monster who was the lover of his own actor who took lessons of poisoner of this vanished and gave place in his mind to a vague and brilliant radiance in which shone at an inaccessible height the pale marble phantom of caesar the emperor had been for his father only the captain whom one admires for whom one sacrifices self he was something more to marius 
 he was the predestined constructor of the french group succeeding the roman group in the domination of the universe he was a prodigious architect of a destruction the continuer of charlemagne of louis xi of henry iv of richelieu of louis xiv and of the committee of public safety having his spots no doubt his faults his crimes even being a man that is to say but august in his faults brilliant in his spots powerful in his crime 
 he was the predestined man who had forced all nations to say the great nation 
 he was better than that he was the very incarnation of france conquering europe by the sword which he grasped and the world by the light which he shed 
 marius saw in bonaparte the dazzling spectre which will always rise upon the frontier and which will guard the future 
 despot but dictator a despot resulting from a republic and summing up a revolution napoleon became for him the as jesus christ is the 
 it will be perceived that like all new converts to a religion his conversion intoxicated him he hurled himself headlong into adhesion and he went too far 
 his nature was so constructed once on the downward slope it was almost impossible for him to put on the drag 
 fanaticism for the sword took possession of him and complicated in his mind his enthusiasm for the idea he did not perceive that along with genius and he was admitting force that is to say that he was installing in two compartments of his idolatry on the one hand that which is divine on the other that which is brutal 
 in many respects he had set about deceiving himself otherwise 
 he admitted everything there is a way of encountering error while on way to the truth he had a violent sort of good faith which took everything in the lump in the new path which he had entered on in judging the mistakes of the old regime as in measuring the glory of napoleon he neglected the attenuating circumstances 
 at all events a tremendous step had been taken 
 where he had formerly beheld the fall of the monarchy he now saw the advent of france his orientation had changed 
 what had been his east became the west he had turned squarely round 
 all these revolutions were accomplished within him without his family obtaining an inkling of the case 
 when during this mysterious labor he had entirely shed his old bourbon and ultra skin when he had cast off the aristocrat the jacobite and the royalist when he had become thoroughly a revolutionist profoundly democratic and republican he went to an engraver on the quai des orfevres and ordered a hundred cards bearing this name le baron marius pontmercy 
 this was only the strictly logical consequence of the change which had taken place in him a change in which everything gravitated round his father 
 only as he did not know any one and could not sow his cards with any porter he put them in his pocket 
 by another natural consequence in proportion as he drew nearer to his father to the memory and to the things for which the colonel had fought five and twenty years before he receded from his grandfather 
 we have long ago said that m temper did not please him 
 there already existed between them all the dissonances of the grave young man and the frivolous old man the gayety of geronte shocks and exasperates the melancholy of werther 
 so long as the same political opinions and the same ideas had been common to them both marius had met m gillenormand there as on a bridge 
 when the bridge fell an abyss was formed and then over and above all marius experienced unutterable impulses to revolt when he reflected that it was m gillenormand who had from stupid motives torn him ruthlessly from the colonel thus depriving the father of the child and the child of the father 
 by dint of pity for his father marius had nearly arrived at aversion for his grandfather 
 nothing of this sort however was betrayed on the exterior as we have already said 
 only he grew colder and colder laconic at meals and rare in the house 
 when his aunt scolded him for it he was very gentle and alleged his studies his lectures the examinations etc as a pretext 
 his grandfather never departed from his infallible diagnosis 
 in love 
 i know all about it 
 from time to time marius absented himself 
 where is it that he goes off like this said his aunt 
 on one of these trips which were always very brief he went to montfermeil in order to obey the injunction which his father had left him and he sought the old sergeant to waterloo the thenardier 
 thenardier had failed the inn was closed and no one knew what had become of him marius was away from the house for four days on this quest 
 he is getting decidedly wild said his grandfather 
 they thought they had noticed that he wore something on his breast under his shirt which was attached to his neck by a black ribbon

 book nine 
 chapter viii 
 
 after his interview with pierre in moscow prince andrew went to petersburg on business as he told his family but really to meet anatole kuragin whom he felt it necessary to encounter on reaching petersburg he inquired for kuragin but the latter had already left the city pierre had warned his that prince andrew was on his track anatole kuragin promptly obtained an appointment from the minister of war and went to join the army in moldavia while in petersburg prince andrew met kutuzov his former commander who was always well disposed toward him and kutuzov suggested that he should accompany him to the army in moldavia to which the old general had been appointed commander in chief so prince andrew having received an appointment on the headquarters staff left for turkey 
 prince andrew did not think it proper to write and challenge kuragin he thought that if he challenged him without some fresh cause it might compromise the young countess rostova and so he wanted to meet kuragin personally in order to find a fresh pretext for a duel but he again failed to meet kuragin in turkey for soon after prince andrew arrived the latter returned to russia in a new country amid new conditions prince andrew found life easier to bear after his betrothed had broken faith with him which he felt the more acutely the more he tried to conceal its effects the surroundings in which he had been happy became trying to him and the freedom and independence he had once prized so highly were still more so not only could he no longer think the thoughts that had first come to him as he lay gazing at the sky on the field of austerlitz and had later enlarged upon with pierre and which had filled his solitude at bogucharovo and then in switzerland and rome but he even dreaded to recall them and them and the bright and boundless horizons they had revealed he was now concerned only with the nearest practical matters unrelated to his past interests and he seized on these the more eagerly the more those past interests were closed to him it was as if that lofty infinite canopy of heaven that had once towered above him had suddenly turned into a low solid vault that weighed him down in which all was clear but nothing eternal or mysterious 
 of the activities that presented themselves to him army service was the simplest and most familiar as a general on duty on staff he applied himself to business with zeal and perseverance and surprised kutuzov by his willingness and accuracy in work not having found kuragin in turkey prince andrew did not think it necessary to rush back to russia after him but all the same he knew that however long it might be before he met kuragin despite his contempt for him and despite all the proofs he deduced to convince himself that it was not worth stooping to a conflict with him he knew that when he did meet him he would not be able to resist calling him out any more than a ravenous man can help snatching at food and the consciousness that the insult was not yet avenged that his rancor was still unspent weighed on his heart and poisoned the artificial tranquillity which he managed to obtain in turkey by means of restless plodding and rather vainglorious and ambitious activity 
 in the year when news of the war with napoleon reached bucharest where kutuzov had been living for two months passing his days and nights with a wallachian woman prince andrew asked kutuzov to transfer him to the western army kutuzov who was already weary of activity which seemed to reproach his own idleness very readily let him go and gave him a mission to barclay de tolly 
 before joining the western army which was then in may encamped at drissa prince andrew visited bald hills which was directly on his way being only two miles off the smolensk highroad during the last three years there had been so many changes in his life he had thought felt and seen so much having traveled both in the east and the west that on reaching bald hills it struck him as strange and unexpected to find the way of life there unchanged and still the same in every detail he entered through the gates with their stone pillars and drove up the avenue leading to the house as if he were entering an enchanted sleeping castle the same old stateliness the same cleanliness the same stillness reigned there and inside there was the same furniture the same walls sounds and smell and the same timid faces only somewhat older princess mary was still the same timid plain maiden getting on in years uselessly and joylessly passing the best years of her life in fear and constant suffering mademoiselle bourienne was the same coquettish girl enjoying every moment of her existence and full of joyous hopes for the future she had merely become more prince andrew thought dessalles the tutor he had brought from switzerland was wearing a coat of russian cut and talking broken russian to the servants but was still the same narrowly intelligent conscientious and pedantic preceptor the old prince had changed in appearance only by the loss of a tooth which left a noticeable gap on one side of his mouth in character he was the same as ever only showing still more irritability and skepticism as to what was happening in the world little nicholas alone had changed he had grown become rosier had curly dark hair and when merry and laughing quite unconsciously lifted the upper lip of his pretty little mouth just as the little princess used to do he alone did not obey the law of immutability in the enchanted sleeping castle but though externally all remained as of old the inner relations of all these people had changed since prince andrew had seen them last the household was divided into two alien and hostile camps who changed their habits for his sake and only met because he was there to the one camp belonged the old prince madmoiselle bourienne and the architect to the other princess mary dessalles little nicholas and all the old nurses and maids 
 during his stay at bald hills all the family dined together but they were ill at ease and prince andrew felt that he was a visitor for whose sake an exception was being made and that his presence made them all feel awkward involuntarily feeling this at dinner on the first day he was taciturn and the old prince noticing this also became morosely dumb and retired to his apartments directly after dinner in the evening when prince andrew went to him and trying to rouse him began to tell him of the young count campaign the old prince began unexpectedly to talk about princess mary blaming her for her superstitions and her dislike of mademoiselle bourienne who he said was the only person really attached to him 
 the old prince said that if he was ill it was only because of princess mary that she purposely worried and irritated him and that by indulgence and silly talk she was spoiling little prince nicholas the old prince knew very well that he tormented his daughter and that her life was very hard but he also knew that he could not help tormenting her and that she deserved it why does prince andrew who sees this say nothing to me about his sister does he think me a scoundrel or an old fool who without any reason keeps his own daughter at a distance and attaches this frenchwoman to himself he understand so i must explain it and he must hear me out thought the old prince and he began explaining why he could not put up with his unreasonable character 
 if you ask me said prince andrew without looking up he was censuring his father for the first time in his life i did not wish to speak about it but as you ask me i will give you my frank opinion if there is any misunderstanding and discord between you and mary i blame her for it at all i know how she loves and respects you since you ask me continued prince andrew becoming irritable as he was always liable to do of late i can only say that if there are any misunderstandings they are caused by that worthless woman who is not fit to be my companion 
 the old man at first stared fixedly at his son and an unnatural smile disclosed the fresh gap between his teeth to which prince andrew could not get accustomed 
 what companion my dear boy eh already been talking it over eh 
 father i did not want to judge said prince andrew in a hard and bitter tone but you challenged me and i have said and always shall say that mary is not to blame but those to blame the one to blame is that frenchwoman 
 ah he has passed judgment passed judgement said the old man in a low voice and as it seemed to prince andrew with some embarrassment but then he suddenly jumped up and cried be off be off let not a trace of you remain here 
 prince andrew wished to leave at once but princess mary persuaded him to stay another day that day he did not see his father who did not leave his room and admitted no one but mademoiselle bourienne and tikhon but asked several times whether his son had gone next day before leaving prince andrew went to his rooms the boy like his mother and glowing with health sat on his knee and prince andrew began telling him the story of bluebeard but fell into a reverie without finishing the story he thought not of this pretty child his son whom he held on his knee but of himself he sought in himself either remorse for having angered his father or regret at leaving home for the first time in his life on bad terms with him and was horrified to find neither what meant still more to him was that he sought and did not find in himself the former tenderness for his son which he had hoped to reawaken by caressing the boy and taking him on his knee 
 well go on said his son 
 prince andrew without replying put him down from his knee and went out of the room 
 as soon as prince andrew had given up his daily occupations and especially on returning to the old conditions of life amid which he had been happy weariness of life overcame him with its former intensity and he hastened to escape from these memories and to find some work as soon as possible 
 so decided to go andrew asked his sister 
 thank god that i can replied prince andrew i am very sorry you 
 why do you say that replied princess mary why do you say that when you are going to this terrible war and he is so old mademoiselle bourienne says he has been asking about you 
 as soon as she began to speak of that her lips trembled and her tears began to fall prince andrew turned away and began pacing the room 
 ah my god my god when one thinks who and what what trash can cause people misery he said with a malignity that alarmed princess mary 
 she understood that when speaking of trash he referred not only to mademoiselle bourienne the cause of her misery but also to the man who had ruined his own happiness 
 andrew one thing i beg i entreat of you she said touching his elbow and looking at him with eyes that shone through her tears i understand you she looked down imagine that sorrow is the work of men men are his tools she looked a little above prince head with the confident accustomed look with which one looks at the place where a familiar portrait hangs sorrow is sent by him not by men men are his instruments they are not to blame if you think someone has wronged you forget it and forgive we have no right to punish and then you will know the happiness of forgiving 
 if i were a woman i would do so mary that is a virtue but a man should not and cannot forgive and forget he replied and though till that moment he had not been thinking of kuragin all his unexpended anger suddenly swelled up in his heart 
 if mary is already persuading me forgive it means that i ought long ago to have punished him he thought and giving her no further reply he began thinking of the glad vindictive moment when he would meet kuragin who he knew was now in the army 
 princess mary begged him to stay one day more saying that she knew how unhappy her father would be if andrew left without being reconciled to him but prince andrew replied that he would probably soon be back again from the army and would certainly write to his father but that the longer he stayed now the more embittered their differences would become 
 andrew remember that misfortunes come from god and men are never to blame were the last words he heard from his sister when he took leave of her 
 then it must be so thought prince andrew as he drove out of the avenue from the house at bald hills she poor innocent creature is left to be victimized by an old man who has outlived his wits the old man feels he is guilty but cannot change himself my boy is growing up and rejoices in life in which like everybody else he will deceive or be deceived and i am off to the army why i myself know i want to meet that man whom i despise so as to give him a chance to kill and laugh at me 
 these conditions of life had been the same before but then they were all connected while now they had all tumbled to pieces only senseless things lacking coherence presented themselves one after another to prince mind

 book grandfather and the grandson 
 chapter vii 
 
 we have mentioned a lancer 
 he was a of m gillenormand on the paternal side who led a garrison life outside the family and far from the domestic hearth 
 lieutenant theodule gillenormand fulfilled all the conditions required to make what is called a fine officer he had a waist a victorious manner of trailing his sword and of twirling his mustache in a hook 
 he visited paris very rarely and so rarely that marius had never seen him the cousins knew each other only by name 
 we think we have said that theodule was the favorite of aunt gillenormand who preferred him because she did not see him 
 not seeing people permits one to attribute to them all possible perfections 
 one morning mademoiselle gillenormand the elder returned to her apartment as much disturbed as her placidity was capable of allowing marius had just asked his permission to take a little trip adding that he meant to set out that very evening go had been his reply and m gillenormand had added in an aside as he raised his eyebrows to the top of his forehead 
 here he is passing the night out again mademoiselle gillenormand had ascended to her chamber greatly puzzled and on the staircase had dropped this exclamation 
 this is too this interrogation 
 but where is it that he goes she espied some adventure of the heart more or less illicit a woman in the shadow a rendezvous a mystery and she would not have been sorry to thrust her spectacles into the affair tasting a mystery resembles getting the first flavor of a scandal sainted souls do not detest this 
 there is some curiosity about scandal in the secret compartments of bigotry 
 so she was the prey of a vague appetite for learning a history 
 in order to get rid of this curiosity which agitated her a little beyond her wont she took refuge in her talents and set about scalloping with one layer of cotton after another one of those embroideries of the empire and the restoration in which there are numerous the work was clumsy the worker cross 
 she had been seated at this for several hours when the door opened 
 mademoiselle gillenormand raised her nose lieutenant theodule stood before her making the regulation salute she uttered a cry of delight 
 one may be old one may be a prude one may be pious one may be an aunt but it is always agreeable to see a lancer enter chamber 
 you here theodule she exclaimed 
 on my way through town aunt 
 embrace me 
 here goes said theodule 
 and he kissed her 
 aunt gillenormand went to her and opened it 
 you will remain with us a week at least 
 i leave this very evening aunt 
 it is not possible 
 mathematically 
 remain my little theodule i beseech you 
 my heart says yes but my orders say no the matter is simple they are changing our garrison we have been at melun we are being transferred to gaillon 
 it is necessary to pass through paris in order to get from the old post to the new one 
 i said 
 i am going to see my aunt 
 here is something for your trouble 
 and she put ten louis into his hand 
 for my pleasure you mean to say my dear aunt 
 theodule kissed her again and she experienced the joy of having some of the skin scratched from her neck by the braidings on his uniform 
 are you making the journey on horseback with your regiment she asked him 
 no aunt 
 i wanted to see you 
 i have special permission my servant is taking my horse i am travelling by diligence and by the way i want to ask you something 
 what is it 
 is my cousin marius pontmercy travelling so too 
 how do you know that said his aunt suddenly pricked to the quick with a lively curiosity 
 on my arrival i went to the diligence to engage my seat in the coupe 
 well 
 a traveller had already come to engage a seat in the imperial i saw his name on the card 
 what name 
 marius pontmercy 
 the wicked fellow exclaimed his aunt 
 ah your cousin is not a steady lad like yourself 
 to think that he is to pass the night in a diligence 
 just as i am going to do 
 but is your duty in his case it is wildness 
 bosh said theodule 
 here an event occurred to mademoiselle gillenormand the elder an idea struck her 
 if she had been a man she would have slapped her brow 
 she apostrophized theodule 
 are you aware whether your cousin knows you 
 no i have seen him but he has never deigned to notice me 
 so you are going to travel together 
 he in the imperial i in the coupe 
 where does this diligence run 
 to andelys 
 then that is where marius is going 
 unless like myself he should stop on the way 
 i get down at vernon in order to take the branch coach for gaillon 
 i know nothing of marius plan of travel 
 marius what an ugly name what possessed them to name him marius while you at least are called theodule 
 i would rather be called alfred said the officer 
 listen theodule 
 i am listening aunt 
 pay attention 
 i am paying attention 
 you understand 
 yes 
 well marius absents himself 
 eh eh 
 he travels 
 ah ah 
 he spends the night out 
 oh oh 
 we should like to know what there is behind all this 
 theodule replied with the composure of a man of bronze 
 some petticoat or other 
 and with that inward laugh which denotes certainty he added 
 a lass 
 that is evident exclaimed his aunt who thought she heard m gillenormand speaking and who felt her conviction become irresistible at that word fillette accentuated in almost the very same fashion by the granduncle and the grandnephew 
 she resumed 
 do us a favor 
 follow marius a little 
 he does not know you it will be easy 
 since a lass there is try to get a sight of her you must write us the tale 
 it will amuse his grandfather 
 theodule had no excessive taste for this sort of spying but he was much touched by the ten louis and he thought he saw a chance for a possible sequel 
 he accepted the commission and said as you please aunt 
 and he added in an aside to himself 
 here i am a duenna 
 mademoiselle gillenormand embraced him 
 you are not the man to play such pranks theodule 
 you obey discipline you are the slave of orders you are a man of scruples and duty and you would not quit your family to go and see a creature 
 the lancer made the pleased grimace of cartouche when praised for his probity 
 marius on the evening following this dialogue mounted the diligence without suspecting that he was watched 
 as for the watcher the first thing he did was to fall asleep 
 his slumber was complete and conscientious 
 argus snored all night long 
 at daybreak the conductor of the diligence shouted 
 vernon relay of vernon 
 travellers for vernon 
 and lieutenant theodule woke 
 good he growled still half asleep this is where i get out 
 then as his memory cleared by degrees the effect of waking he recalled his aunt the ten louis and the account which he had undertaken to render of the deeds and proceedings of marius this set him to laughing 
 perhaps he is no longer in the coach he thought as he rebuttoned the waistcoat of his undress uniform 
 he may have stopped at poissy he may have stopped at triel if he did not get out at meulan he may have got out at mantes unless he got out at rolleboise or if he did not go on as far as pacy with the choice of turning to the left at evreus or to the right at run after him aunty 
 what the devil am i to write to that good old soul 
 at that moment a pair of black trousers descending from the imperial made its appearance at the window of the coupe 
 can that be marius said the lieutenant 
 it was marius 
 a little peasant girl all entangled with the horses and the postilions at the end of the vehicle was offering flowers to the travellers give your ladies flowers she cried 
 marius approached her and purchased the finest flowers in her flat basket 
 come now said theodule leaping down from the coupe this piques my curiosity 
 who the deuce is he going to carry those flowers to she must be a splendidly handsome woman for so fine a bouquet i want to see her 
 and no longer in pursuance of orders but from personal curiosity like dogs who hunt on their own account he set out to follow marius 
 marius paid no attention to theodule 
 elegant women descended from the diligence he did not glance at them 
 he seemed to see nothing around him 
 he is pretty deeply in love thought theodule 
 marius directed his steps towards the church 
 capital said theodule to himself 
 rendezvous seasoned with a bit of mass are the best sort 
 nothing is so exquisite as an ogle which passes over the good head 
 on arriving at the church marius did not enter it but skirted the apse 
 he disappeared behind one of the angles of the apse 
 the rendezvous is appointed outside said theodule 
 have a look at the lass 
 and he advanced on the tips of his boots towards the corner which marius had turned 
 on arriving there he halted in amazement 
 marius with his forehead clasped in his hands was kneeling upon the grass on a grave 
 he had strewn his bouquet there 
 at the extremity of the grave on a little swelling which marked the head there stood a cross of black wood with this name in white letters colonel baron pontmercy 
 marius sobs were audible 
 the lass was a grave

 chapter ix 
 
 prince andrew reached the general headquarters of the army at the end of june the first army with which was the emperor occupied the fortified camp at drissa the second army was retreating trying to effect a junction with the first one from which it was said to be cut off by large french forces everyone was dissatisfied with the general course of affairs in the russian army but no one anticipated any danger of invasion of the russian provinces and no one thought the war would extend farther than the western the polish provinces 
 prince andrew found barclay de tolly to whom he had been assigned on the bank of the drissa as there was not a single town or large village in the vicinity of the camp the immense number of generals and courtiers accompanying the army were living in the best houses of the villages on both sides of the river over a radius of six miles barclay de tolly was quartered nearly three miles from the emperor he received bolkonski stiffly and coldly and told him in his foreign accent that he would mention him to the emperor for a decision as to his employment but asked him meanwhile to remain on his staff anatole kuragin whom prince andrew had hoped to find with the army was not there he had gone to petersburg but prince andrew was glad to hear this his mind was occupied by the interests of the center that was conducting a gigantic war and he was glad to be free for a while from the distraction caused by the thought of kuragin during the first four days while no duties were required of him prince andrew rode round the whole fortified camp and by the aid of his own knowledge and by talks with experts tried to form a definite opinion about it but the question whether the camp was advantageous or disadvantageous remained for him undecided already from his military experience and what he had seen in the austrian campaign he had come to the conclusion that in war the most deeply considered plans have no significance and that all depends on the way unexpected movements of the enemy that cannot be foreseen are met and on how and by whom the whole matter is handled to clear up this last point for himself prince andrew utilizing his position and acquaintances tried to fathom the character of the control of the army and of the men and parties engaged in it and he deduced for himself the following of the state of affairs 
 while the emperor had still been at vilna the forces had been divided into three armies first the army under barclay de tolly secondly the army under bagration and thirdly the one commanded by tormasov the emperor was with the first army but not as commander in chief in the orders issued it was stated not that the emperor would take command but only that he would be with the army the emperor moreover had with him not a commander in staff but the imperial headquarters staff in attendance on him was the head of the imperial staff quartermaster general prince volkonski as well as generals imperial diplomatic officials and a large number of foreigners but not the army staff besides these there were in attendance on the emperor without any definite appointments arakcheev the of war count bennigsen the senior general in rank the grand duke tsarevich constantine pavlovich count rumyantsev the chancellor stein a former prussian minister armfeldt a swedish general pfuel the chief author of the plan of campaign paulucci an adjutant general and sardinian emigre wolzogen and many others though these men had no military appointment in the army their position gave them influence and often a corps commander or even the commander in chief did not know in what capacity he was questioned by bennigsen the grand duke arakcheev or prince volkonski or was given this or that advice and did not know whether a certain order received in the form of advice emanated from the man who gave it or from the emperor and whether it had to be executed or not but this was only the external condition the essential significance of the presence of the emperor and of all these people from a point of view and in an vicinity all became courtiers was clear to everyone it was this the emperor did not assume the title of commander in chief but disposed of all the armies the men around him were his assistants arakcheev was a faithful custodian to enforce order and acted as the bodyguard bennigsen was a landlord in the vilna province who appeared to be doing the honors of the district but was in reality a good general useful as an adviser and ready at hand to replace barclay the grand duke was there because it suited him to be the stein was there because his advice was useful and the emperor alexander held him in high esteem personally armfeldt virulently hated napoleon and was a general full of a quality that always influenced alexander paulucci was there because he was bold and decided in speech the adjutants general were there because they always accompanied the emperor and lastly and chiefly pfuel was there because he had drawn up the plan of campaign against napoleon and having induced alexander to believe in the efficacy of that plan was directing the whole business of the war with pfuel was wolzogen who expressed thoughts in a more comprehensible way than pfuel himself who was a harsh bookish theorist to the point of despising everyone else was able to do 
 besides these russians and foreigners who propounded new and unexpected ideas every day especially the foreigners who did so with a boldness characteristic of people employed in a country not their own there were many secondary personages accompanying the army because their principals were there 
 among the opinions and voices in this immense restless brilliant and proud sphere prince andrew noticed the following sharply defined subdivisions of and parties 
 the first party consisted of pfuel and his adherents military theorists who believed in a science of war with immutable laws laws of oblique movements outflankings and so forth pfuel and his adherents demanded a retirement into the depths of the country in accordance with precise laws defined by a of war and they saw only barbarism ignorance or evil intention in every deviation from that theory to this party belonged the foreign nobles wolzogen wintzingerode and others chiefly germans 
 the second party was directly opposed to the first one extreme as always happens was met by representatives of the other the members of this party were those who had demanded an advance from vilna into poland and freedom from all prearranged plans besides being advocates of bold action this section also represented nationalism which made them still more in the dispute they were russians bagration ermolov who was beginning to come to the front and others at that time a famous joke of was being circulated that as a great favor he had petitioned the emperor to make him a german the men of that party remembering suvorov said that what one had to do was not to reason or stick pins into maps but to fight beat the enemy keep him out of russia and not let the army get discouraged 
 to the third party in which the emperor had most confidence belonged the courtiers who tried to arrange compromises between the other two the members of this party chiefly civilians and to whom arakcheev belonged thought and said what men who have no convictions but wish to seem to have some generally say they said that undoubtedly war particularly against such a genius as bonaparte they called him bonaparte now needs most deeply devised plans and profound scientific knowledge and in that respect pfuel was a genius but at the same time it had to be acknowledged that the theorists are often one sided and therefore one should not trust them absolutely but should also listen to what opponents and practical men of experience in warfare had to say and then choose a middle course they insisted on the retention of the camp at drissa according to plan but on changing the movements of the other armies though by this course neither one aim nor the other could be attained yet it seemed best to the adherents of this third party 
 of a fourth opinion the most conspicuous representative was the tsarevich who could not forget his disillusionment at austerlitz where he had ridden out at the head of the guards in his casque and cavalry uniform as to a review expecting to crush the french gallantly but unexpectedly finding himself in the front line had narrowly escaped amid the general confusion the men of this party had both the quality and the defect of frankness in their opinions they feared napoleon recognized his strength and their own weakness and frankly said so they said nothing but sorrow shame and ruin will come of all this we have abandoned vilna and vitebsk and shall abandon drissa the only reasonable thing left to do is to conclude peace as soon as possible before we are turned out of petersburg 
 this view was very general in the upper army circles and found support also in petersburg and from the chancellor rumyantsev who for other reasons of state was in favor of peace 
 the fifth party consisted of those who were adherents of barclay de tolly not so much as a man but as minister of war and commander in chief be he what he may they always began like that he is an honest practical man and we have nobody better give him real power for war cannot be conducted successfully without unity of command and he will show what he can do as he did in finland if our army is well organized and strong and has withdrawn to drissa without suffering any defeats we owe this entirely to barclay if barclay is now to be superseded by bennigsen all will be lost for bennigsen showed his incapacity already in 
 the sixth party the bennigsenites said on the contrary that at any rate there was no one more active and experienced than bennigsen and twist about as you may you will have to come to bennigsen eventually let the others make mistakes now said they arguing that our retirement to drissa was a most shameful reverse and an unbroken series of blunders the more mistakes that are made the better it will at any rate be understood all the sooner that things cannot go on like this what is wanted is not some barclay or other but a man like bennigsen who made his mark in and to whom napoleon himself did justice a man whose authority would be willingly recognized and bennigsen is the only such man 
 the seventh party consisted of the sort of people who are always to be found especially around young sovereigns and of whom there were particularly many round alexander generals and imperial passionately devoted to the emperor not merely as a monarch but as a man adoring him sincerely and disinterestedly as rostov had done in and who saw in him not only all the virtues but all human capabilities as well these men though enchanted with the sovereign for refusing the command of the army yet blamed him for such excessive modesty and only desired and insisted that their adored sovereign should abandon his diffidence and openly announce that he would place himself at the head of the army gather round him a commander in staff and consulting experienced theoreticians and practical men where necessary would himself lead the troops whose spirits would thereby be raised to the highest pitch 
 the eighth and largest group which in its enormous numbers was to the others as to one consisted of men who desired neither peace nor war neither an advance nor a defensive camp at the drissa or anywhere else neither barclay nor the emperor neither pfuel nor bennigsen but only the one most essential thing as much advantage and pleasure for themselves as possible in the troubled waters of conflicting and intersecting intrigues that eddied about the headquarters it was possible to succeed in many ways unthinkable at other times a man who simply wished to retain his lucrative post would today agree with pfuel tomorrow with his opponent and the day after merely to avoid responsibility or to please the emperor would declare that he had no opinion at all on the matter another who wished to gain some advantage would attract the attention by loudly advocating the very thing the emperor had hinted at the day before and would dispute and shout at the council beating his breast and challenging those who did not agree with him to duels thereby proving that he was prepared to sacrifice himself for the common good a third in the absence of opponents between two councils would simply solicit a special gratuity for his faithful services well knowing that at that moment people would be too busy to refuse him a fourth while seemingly overwhelmed with work would often come accidentally under the eye a fifth to achieve his aim of dining with the emperor would stubbornly insist on the correctness or falsity of some newly emerging opinion and for this object would produce arguments more or less forcible and correct 
 all the men of this party were fishing for rubles decorations and promotions and in this pursuit watched only the weathercock of imperial favor and directly they noticed it turning in any direction this whole drone population of the army began blowing hard that way so that it was all the harder for the emperor to turn it elsewhere amid the uncertainties of the position with the menace of serious danger giving a peculiarly threatening character to everything amid this vortex of intrigue egotism conflict of views and feelings and the diversity of race among these people this eighth and largest party of those preoccupied with personal interests imparted great confusion and obscurity to the common task whatever question arose a swarm of these drones without having finished their buzzing on a previous theme flew over to the new one and by their hum drowned and obscured the voices of those who were disputing honestly 
 from among all these parties just at the time prince andrew reached the army another a ninth party was being formed and was beginning to raise its voice this was the party of the elders reasonable men experienced and capable in state affairs who without sharing any of those conflicting opinions were able to take a detached view of what was going on at the staff at headquarters and to consider means of escape from this muddle indecision intricacy and weakness 
 the men of this party said and thought that what was wrong resulted chiefly from the presence in the army with his military court and from the consequent presence there of an indefinite conditional and unsteady fluctuation of relations which is in place at court but harmful in an army that a sovereign should reign but not command the army and that the only way out of the position would be for the emperor and his court to leave the army that the mere presence of the emperor paralyzed the action of fifty thousand men required to secure his personal safety and that the worst commander in chief if independent would be better than the very best one trammeled by the presence and authority of the monarch 
 just at the time prince andrew was living unoccupied at drissa shishkov the secretary of state and one of the chief representatives of this party wrote a letter to the emperor which arakcheev and balashev agreed to sign in this letter availing himself of permission given him by the emperor to discuss the general course of affairs he respectfully suggested on the plea that it was necessary for the sovereign to arouse a warlike spirit in the people of the capital that the emperor should leave the army 
 that arousing of the people by their sovereign and his call to them to defend their country the very incitement which was the chief cause of triumph in so far as it was produced by the personal presence in moscow was suggested to the emperor and accepted by him as a pretext for quitting the army

 marble against granite 
 it was hither that marius had come on the first occasion of his absenting himself from paris 
 it was hither that he had come every time that m gillenormand had said 
 he is sleeping out 
 lieutenant theodule was absolutely put out of countenance by this unexpected encounter with a sepulchre he experienced a singular and disagreeable sensation which he was incapable of analyzing and which was composed of respect for the tomb mingled with respect for the colonel 
 he retreated leaving marius alone in the cemetery and there was discipline in this retreat 
 death appeared to him with large epaulets and he almost made the military salute to him not knowing what to write to his aunt he decided not to write at all and it is probable that nothing would have resulted from the discovery made by theodule as to the love affairs of marius if by one of those mysterious arrangements which are so frequent in chance the scene at vernon had not had an almost immediate at paris 
 marius returned from vernon on the third day in the middle of the morning descended at his door and wearied by the two nights spent in the diligence and feeling the need of repairing his loss of sleep by an hour at the he mounted rapidly to his chamber took merely time enough to throw off his and the black ribbon which he wore round his neck and went off to the bath 
 who had risen betimes like all old men in good health had heard his entrance and had made haste to climb as quickly as his old legs permitted the stairs to the upper story where marius lived in order to embrace him and to question him while so doing and to find out where he had been 
 but the youth had taken less time to descend than the old man had to ascend and when father gillenormand entered the attic marius was no longer there 
 the bed had not been disturbed and on the bed lay outspread but not defiantly the and the black ribbon 
 i like this better said m gillenormand 
 and a moment later he made his entrance into the salon where mademoiselle gillenormand was already seated busily embroidering her 
 the entrance was a triumphant one 
 m gillenormand held in one hand the and in the other the and exclaimed 
 victory 
 we are about to penetrate the mystery 
 we are going to learn the most minute details we are going to lay our finger on the debaucheries of our sly friend 
 here we have the romance itself i have the portrait 
 in fact a case of black shagreen resembling a medallion portrait was suspended from the ribbon 
 the old man took this case and gazed at it for some time without opening it with that air of enjoyment rapture and wrath with which a poor hungry fellow beholds an admirable dinner which is not for him pass under his very nose 
 for this evidently is a portrait 
 i know all about such things that is worn tenderly on the heart 
 how stupid they are some abominable fright that will make us shudder probably 
 young men have such bad taste nowadays 
 let us see father said the old spinster 
 the case opened by the pressure of a spring 
 they found in it nothing but a carefully folded paper 
 from the same to the same said m gillenormand bursting with laughter 
 i know what it is 
 a 
 ah let us read it said the aunt 
 and she put on her spectacles 
 they unfolded the paper and read as follows 
 for my emperor made me a baron on the battlefield of waterloo 
 since the restoration disputes my right to this title which i purchased with my blood my son shall take it and bear it that he will be worthy of it is a matter of course 
 the feelings of father and daughter cannot be described 
 they felt chilled as by the breath of a they did not exchange a word 
 only m gillenormand said in a low voice and as though speaking to himself 
 it is the handwriting 
 the aunt examined the paper turned it about in all directions then put it back in its case 
 at the same moment a little oblong packet enveloped in blue paper fell from one of the pockets of the mademoiselle gillenormand picked it up and unfolded the blue paper 
 it contained marius hundred cards 
 she handed one of them to m gillenormand who read 
 le baron marius pontmercy 
 the old man rang the bell 
 nicolette came 
 m gillenormand took the ribbon the case and the coat flung them all on the floor in the middle of the room and said 
 carry those duds away 
 a full hour passed in the most profound silence 
 the old man and the old spinster had seated themselves with their backs to each other and were thinking each on his own account the same things in all probability 
 at the expiration of this hour aunt gillenormand pretty state of things 
 a few moments later marius made his appearance 
 he entered even before he had crossed the threshold he saw his grandfather holding one of his own cards in his hand and on catching sight of him the latter exclaimed with his air of bourgeois and grinning superiority which was something crushing 
 well well well well well so you are a baron now 
 i present you my compliments 
 what is the meaning of this 
 marius reddened slightly and replied 
 it means that i am the son of my father 
 m gillenormand ceased to laugh and said harshly 
 i am your father 
 my father retorted marius with downcast eyes and a severe air was a humble and heroic man who served the republic and france gloriously who was great in the greatest history that men have ever made who lived in the bivouac for a quarter of a century beneath and bullets in snow and mud by day beneath rain at night who captured two flags who received twenty wounds who died forgotten and abandoned and who never committed but one mistake which was to love too fondly two ingrates his country and myself 
 this was more than m gillenormand could bear to hear 
 at the word republic he rose or to speak more correctly he sprang to his feet 
 every word that marius had just uttered produced on the visage of the old royalist the effect of the puffs of air from a forge upon a blazing brand 
 from a dull hue he had turned red from red purple and from purple 
 marius he cried 
 abominable child 
 i do not know what your father was 
 i do not wish to know 
 i know nothing about that and i do not know him 
 but what i do know is that there never was anything but scoundrels among those men 
 they were all rascals assassins thieves 
 i say all 
 i say all i know not one 
 i say all 
 do you hear me marius 
 see here you are no more a baron than my slipper is 
 they were all bandits in the service of robespierre 
 all who served were brigands 
 they were all traitors who betrayed betrayed betrayed their legitimate king 
 all cowards who fled before the prussians and the english at waterloo 
 that is what i do know whether monsieur your father comes in that category i do not know i am sorry for it so much the worse your humble servant 
 in his turn it was marius who was the firebrand and m gillenormand who was the bellows 
 marius quivered in every limb he did not know what would happen next his brain was on fire 
 he was the priest who beholds all his sacred wafers cast to the winds the fakir who beholds a spit upon his idol 
 it could not be that such things had been uttered in his presence what was he to do 
 his father had just been trampled under foot and stamped upon in his presence but by whom 
 by his grandfather how was he to avenge the one without outraging the other it was impossible for him to insult his grandfather and it was equally impossible for him to leave his father unavenged on the one hand was a sacred grave on the other hoary locks 
 he stood there for several moments staggering as though intoxicated with all this whirlwind dashing through his head then he raised his eyes gazed fixedly at his grandfather and cried in a voice of thunder 
 down with the bourbons and that great hog of a louis xviii 
 louis xviii 
 had been dead for four years but it was all the same to him 
 the old man who had been crimson turned whiter than his hair he wheeled round towards a bust of m le duc de berry which stood on the and made a profound bow with a sort of peculiar majesty 
 then he paced twice slowly and in silence from the fireplace to the window and from the window to the fireplace traversing the whole length of the room and making the polished floor creak as though he had been a stone statue walking 
 on his second turn he bent over his daughter who was watching this encounter with the stupefied air of an antiquated lamb and said to her with a smile that was almost calm 
 a baron like this gentleman and a bourgeois like myself cannot remain under the same roof 
 and drawing himself up all at once pallid trembling terrible with his brow rendered more lofty by the terrible radiance of wrath he extended his arm towards marius and shouted to him 
 be off 
 marius left the house 
 on the following day m gillenormand said to his daughter 
 you will send sixty pistoles every six months to that and you will never mention his name to me 
 having an immense reserve fund of wrath to get rid of and not knowing what to do with it he continued to address his daughter as you instead of thou for the next three months 
 marius on his side had gone forth in indignation 
 there was one circumstance which it must be admitted aggravated his exasperation there are always petty fatalities of the sort which complicate domestic dramas 
 they augment the grievances in such cases although in reality the wrongs are not increased by them while carrying marius duds precipitately to his chamber at his command nicolette had inadvertently let fall probably on the attic staircase which was dark that medallion of black shagreen which contained the paper penned by the colonel neither paper nor case could afterwards be found 
 marius was convinced that monsieur that day forth he never alluded to him flung his testament in the fire 
 he knew by heart the few lines which the colonel had written and consequently nothing was lost 
 but the paper the writing that sacred that was his very heart what had been done with it 
 marius had taken his departure without saying whither he was going and without knowing where with thirty francs his watch and a few clothes in a he had entered a had engaged it by the hour and had directed his course at towards the latin quarter 
 what was to become of marius

 book nine 
 chapter x 
 
 this letter had not yet been presented to the emperor when barclay one day at dinner informed bolkonski that the sovereign wished to see him personally to question him about turkey and that prince andrew was to present himself at quarters at six that evening 
 news was received at the quarters that very day of a fresh movement by napoleon which might endanger the army news subsequently found to be false and that morning colonel michaud had ridden round the drissa fortifications with the emperor and had pointed out to him that this fortified camp constructed by pfuel and till then considered a of tactical science which would ensure destruction was an absurdity threatening the destruction of the russian army 
 prince andrew arrived at quarters a country house of moderate size situated on the very banks of the river neither bennigsen nor the emperor was there but chernyshev the received bolkonski and informed him that the emperor accompanied by general bennigsen and marquis paulucci had gone a second time that day to inspect the fortifications of the drissa camp of the suitability of which serious doubts were beginning to be felt 
 chernyshev was sitting at a window in the first room with a french novel in his hand this room had probably been a music room there was still an organ in it on which some rugs were piled and in one corner stood the folding bedstead of adjutant this adjutant was also there and sat dozing on the bedding evidently exhausted by work or by feasting two doors led from the room one straight on into what had been the drawing room and another on the right to the study through the first door came the sound of voices conversing in german and occasionally in french in that drawing room were gathered by the wish not a military council the emperor preferred indefiniteness but certain persons whose opinions he wished to know in view of the impending difficulties it was not a council of war but as it were a council to elucidate certain questions for the emperor personally to this semicouncil had been invited the swedish general armfeldt adjutant general wolzogen wintzingerode whom napoleon had referred to as a renegade french subject michaud toll count stein who was not a military man at all and pfuel himself who as prince andrew had heard was the mainspring of the whole affair prince andrew had an opportunity of getting a good look at him for pfuel arrived soon after himself and in passing through to the drawing room stopped a minute to speak to chernyshev 
 at first sight pfuel in his uniform of a russian general which fitted him badly like a fancy costume seemed familiar to prince andrew though he saw him now for the first time there was about him something of weyrother mack and schmidt and many other german whom prince andrew had seen in but he was more typical than any of them prince andrew had never yet seen a german theorist in whom all the characteristics of those others were united to such an extent 
 pfuel was short and very thin but of coarse robust build broad in the hips and with prominent shoulder blades his face was much wrinkled and his eyes deep set his hair had evidently been hastily brushed smooth in front of the temples but stuck up behind in quaint little tufts he entered the room looking restlessly and angrily around as if afraid of everything in that large apartment awkwardly holding up his sword he addressed chernyshev and asked in german where the emperor was one could see that he wished to pass through the rooms as quickly as possible finish with the bows and greetings and sit down to business in front of a map where he would feel at home he nodded hurriedly in reply to chernyshev and smiled ironically on hearing that the sovereign was inspecting the fortifications that he pfuel had planned in accord with his theory he muttered something to himself abruptly and in a bass voice as germans do it might have been stupid fellow or the whole affair will be ruined or something absurd will come of it prince andrew did not catch what he said and would have passed on but chernyshev introduced him to pfuel remarking that prince andrew was just back from turkey where the war had terminated so fortunately pfuel barely glanced not so much at prince andrew as past him and said with a laugh that must have been a fine tactical war and laughing contemptuously went on into the room from which the sound of voices was heard 
 pfuel always inclined to be irritably sarcastic was particularly disturbed that day evidently by the fact that they had dared to inspect and criticize his camp in his absence from this short interview with pfuel prince andrew thanks to his austerlitz experiences was able to form a clear conception of the man pfuel was one of those hopelessly and immutably men to the point of martyrdom as only germans are because only germans are on the basis of an abstract notion science that is the supposed knowledge of absolute truth a frenchman is because he regards himself personally both in mind and body as irresistibly attractive to men and women an englishman is as being a citizen of the state in the world and therefore as an englishman always knows what he should do and knows that all he does as an englishman is undoubtedly correct an italian is because he is excitable and easily forgets himself and other people a russian is just because he knows nothing does not want to know anything since he does not believe that anything can be known the is worst of all stronger and more repulsive than any other because he imagines that he knows the truth science which he himself has invented but which is for him the absolute truth 
 pfuel was evidently of that sort he had a science the theory of oblique movements deduced by him from the history of frederick the wars and all he came across in the history of more recent warfare seemed to him absurd and barbarous monstrous collisions in which so many blunders were committed by both sides that these wars could not be called wars they did not accord with the theory and therefore could not serve as material for science 
 in pfuel had been one of those responsible for the plan of campaign that ended in jena and auerstadt but he did not see the least proof of the fallibility of his theory in the disasters of that war on the contrary the deviations made from his theory were in his opinion the sole cause of the whole disaster and with characteristically gleeful sarcasm he would remark there i said the whole affair would go to the devil pfuel was one of those theoreticians who so love their theory that they lose sight of the object its practical application his love of theory made him hate everything practical and he would not listen to it he was even pleased by failures for failures resulting from deviations in practice from the theory only proved to him the accuracy of his theory 
 he said a few words to prince andrew and chernyshev about the present war with the air of a man who knows beforehand that all will go wrong and who is not displeased that it should be so the unbrushed tufts of hair sticking up behind and the hastily brushed hair on his temples expressed this most eloquently 
 he passed into the next room and the deep querulous sounds of his voice were at once heard from there

 a group which barely missed becoming historic 
 at that epoch which was to all appearances indifferent a certain revolutionary quiver was vaguely current 
 breaths which had started forth from the depths of and were in the air 
 youth was on the point may the reader pardon us the word of moulting people were undergoing a transformation almost without being conscious of it through the movement of the age 
 the needle which moves round the compass also moves in souls 
 each person was taking that step in advance which he was bound to take the royalists were becoming liberals liberals were turning democrats it was a flood tide complicated with a thousand ebb movements the peculiarity of ebbs is to create intermixtures hence the combination of very singular ideas people adored both napoleon and liberty we are making history here 
 these were the mirages of that period opinions traverse phases 
 voltairian royalism a quaint variety had a no less singular sequel bonapartist liberalism 
 other groups of minds were more serious 
 in that direction they sounded principles they attached themselves to the right they grew enthusiastic for the absolute they caught glimpses of infinite realizations the absolute by its very rigidity urges spirits towards the sky and causes them to float in illimitable space there is nothing like dogma for bringing forth dreams

 here are the names of the principal ones 
 they belong in a certain measure to history 
 enjolras combeferre jean prouvaire feuilly courfeyrac bahorel lesgle or laigle joly grantaire 
 these young men formed a sort of family through the bond of friendship 
 all with the exception of laigle were from the south 
 this was a remarkable group 
 it vanished in the invisible depths which lie behind us 
 at the point of this drama which we have now reached it will not perhaps be superfluous to throw a ray of light upon these youthful heads before the reader beholds them plunging into the shadow of a tragic adventure 
 enjolras whose name we have mentioned first of reader shall see why later an only son and wealthy 
 enjolras was a charming young man who was capable of being terrible he was angelically handsome 
 he was a savage antinous 
 one would have said to see the pensive thoughtfulness of his glance that he had already in some previous state of existence traversed the revolutionary apocalypse 
 he possessed the tradition of it as though he had been a witness 
 he was acquainted with all the minute details of the great affair 
 a pontifical and warlike nature a singular thing in a youth 
 he was an officiating priest and a man of war from the immediate point of view a soldier of the democracy above the contemporary movement the priest of the ideal 
 his eyes were deep his lids a little red his lower lip was thick and easily became disdainful his brow was lofty 
 a great deal of brow in a face is like a great deal of horizon in a view 
 like certain young men at the beginning of this century and the end of the last who became illustrious at an early age he was endowed with excessive youth and was as rosy as a young girl although subject to hours of pallor already a man he still seemed a child 
 his two and twenty years appeared to be but seventeen he was serious it did not seem as though he were aware there was on earth a thing called woman he had but one right but one overthrow the obstacle 
 on mount aventine he would have been gracchus in the convention he would have been he hardly saw the roses he ignored spring he did not hear the carolling of the birds the bare throat of evadne would have moved him no more than it would have moved aristogeiton he like harmodius thought flowers good for nothing except to conceal the sword he was severe in his enjoyments 
 he chastely dropped his eyes before everything which was not the republic 
 he was the marble lover of liberty 
 his speech was harshly inspired and had the thrill of a hymn 
 he was subject to unexpected outbursts of soul woe to the which should have risked itself beside him if any grisette of the place cambrai or the rue seeing that face of a youth escaped from college that mien those long golden lashes those blue eyes that hair billowing in the wind those rosy cheeks those fresh lips those exquisite teeth had conceived an appetite for that complete aurora and had tried her beauty on enjolras an astounding and terrible glance would have promptly shown her the abyss and would have taught her not to confound the mighty cherub of ezekiel with the gallant cherubino of beaumarchais 
 by the side of enjolras who represented the logic of the revolution combeferre represented its philosophy 
 between the logic of the revolution and its philosophy there exists this its logic may end in war whereas its philosophy can end only in peace combeferre complemented and rectified enjolras 
 he was less lofty but broader 
 he desired to pour into all minds the extensive principles of general ideas 
 he said 
 revolution but civilization and around the mountain peak he opened out a vast view of the blue sky the revolution was more adapted for breathing with combeferre than with enjolras 
 enjolras expressed its divine right and combeferre its natural right 
 the first attached himself to robespierre the second confined himself to condorcet 
 combeferre lived the life of all the rest of the world more than did enjolras if it had been granted to these two young men to attain to history the one would have been the just the other the wise man enjolras was the more virile combeferre the more humane 
 homo and vir that was the exact effect of their different shades 
 combeferre was as gentle as enjolras was severe through natural whiteness he loved the word citizen but he preferred the word man 
 he would gladly have said 
 hombre like the spanish 
 he read everything went to the theatres attended the courses of public lecturers learned the polarization of light from arago grew enthusiastic over a lesson in which geoffrey explained the double function of the external carotid artery and the internal the one which makes the face and the one which makes the brain he kept up with what was going on followed science step by step compared with fourier deciphered hieroglyphics broke the pebble which he found and reasoned on geology drew from memory a silkworm moth pointed out the faulty french in the dictionary of the academy studied puysegur and deleuze affirmed nothing not even miracles denied nothing not even ghosts turned over the files of the moniteur reflected 
 he declared that the future lies in the hand of the schoolmaster and busied himself with educational questions 
 he desired that society should labor without relaxation at the elevation of the moral and intellectual level at coining science at putting ideas into circulation at increasing the mind in youthful persons and he feared lest the present poverty of method the paltriness from a literary point of view confined to two or three centuries called classic the tyrannical dogmatism of official pedants scholastic prejudices and routines should end by converting our colleges into artificial oyster beds 
 he was learned a purist exact a graduate of the polytechnic a close student and at the same time thoughtful even to chimaeras so his friends said he believed in all dreams railroads the suppression of suffering in chirurgical operations the fixing of images in the dark chamber the electric telegraph the steering of balloons 
 moreover he was not much alarmed by the citadels erected against the human mind in every direction by superstition despotism and prejudice he was one of those who think that science will eventually turn the position 
 enjolras was a chief combeferre was a guide one would have liked to fight under the one and to march behind the other 
 it is not that combeferre was not capable of fighting he did not refuse a combat with the obstacle and to attack it by main force and explosively but it suited him better to bring the human race into accord with its destiny gradually by means of education the inculcation of axioms the promulgation of positive laws and between two lights his preference was rather for illumination than for conflagration a conflagration can create an aurora no doubt but why not await the dawn 
 a volcano illuminates but daybreak furnishes a still better illumination 
 possibly combeferre preferred the whiteness of the beautiful to the blaze of the sublime 
 a light troubled by smoke progress purchased at the expense of violence only half satisfied this tender and serious spirit 
 the headlong precipitation of a people into the truth a terrified him nevertheless stagnation was still more repulsive to him in it he detected putrefaction and death on the whole he preferred scum to miasma and he preferred the torrent to the cesspool and the falls of niagara to the lake of montfaucon 
 in short he desired neither halt nor haste 
 while his tumultuous friends captivated by the absolute adored and invoked splendid revolutionary adventures combeferre was inclined to let progress good progress take its own course he may have been cold but he was pure methodical but irreproachable phlegmatic but imperturbable 
 combeferre would have knelt and clasped his hands to enable the future to arrive in all its candor and that nothing might disturb the immense and virtuous evolution of the races 
 the good must be innocent he repeated incessantly and in fact if the grandeur of the revolution consists in keeping the dazzling ideal fixedly in view and of soaring thither athwart the lightnings with fire and blood in its talons the beauty of progress lies in being spotless and there exists between washington who represents the one and danton who incarnates the other that difference which separates the swan from the angel with the wings of an eagle 
 jean prouvaire was a still softer shade than combeferre 
 his name was jehan owing to that petty momentary freak which mingled with the powerful and profound movement whence sprang the very essential study of the middle ages 
 jean prouvaire was in love he cultivated a pot of flowers played on the flute made verses loved the people pitied woman wept over the child confounded god and the future in the same confidence and blamed the revolution for having caused the fall of a royal head that of andre chenier his voice was ordinarily delicate but suddenly grew manly he was learned even to erudition and almost an orientalist above all he was good and a very simple thing to those who know how nearly goodness borders on grandeur in the matter of poetry he preferred the immense 
 he knew italian latin greek and hebrew and these served him only for the perusal of four poets dante juvenal aeschylus and isaiah 
 in french he preferred corneille to racine and agrippa to corneille he loved to saunter through fields of wild oats and and busied himself with clouds nearly as much as with events his mind had two attitudes one on the side towards man the other on that towards god he studied or he contemplated 
 all day long he buried himself in social questions salary capital credit marriage religion liberty of thought education penal servitude poverty association property production and sharing the enigma of this lower world which covers the human with darkness and at night he gazed upon the planets those enormous beings like enjolras he was wealthy and an only son 
 he spoke softly bowed his head lowered his eyes smiled with embarrassment dressed badly had an awkward air blushed at a mere nothing and was very timid 
 yet he was intrepid 
 feuilly was a workingman a orphaned both of father and mother who earned with difficulty three francs a day and had but one thought to deliver the world 
 he had one other preoccupation to educate himself he called this also delivering himself he had taught himself to read and write everything that he knew he had learned by himself 
 feuilly had a generous heart 
 the range of his embrace was immense 
 this orphan had adopted the peoples as his mother had failed him he meditated on his country he brooded with the profound divination of the man of the people over what we now call the idea of the nationality had learned history with the express object of raging with full knowledge of the case in this club of young utopians occupied chiefly with france he represented the outside world 
 he had for his specialty greece poland hungary roumania italy 
 he uttered these names incessantly appropriately and inappropriately with the tenacity of right the violations of turkey on greece and thessaly of russia on warsaw of austria on venice enraged him 
 above all things the great violence of aroused him 
 there is no more sovereign eloquence than the true in indignation he was eloquent with that eloquence 
 he was inexhaustible on that infamous date of on the subject of that noble and valiant race suppressed by treason and that crime on that monstrous ambush the prototype and pattern of all those horrible suppressions of states which since that time have struck many a noble nation and have annulled their certificate of birth so to speak all contemporary social crimes have their origin in the partition of poland 
 the partition of poland is a theorem of which all present political outrages are the corollaries 
 there has not been a despot nor a traitor for nearly a century back who has not signed approved and copied ne variatur the partition of poland when the record of modern treasons was examined that was the first thing which made its appearance 
 the congress of vienna consulted that crime before consummating its own 
 sounded the onset was the death of the game 
 such was habitual text this poor workingman had constituted himself the tutor of justice and she recompensed him by rendering him great 
 the fact is that there is eternity in right 
 warsaw can no more be tartar than venice can be teuton 
 kings lose their pains and their honor in the attempt to make them so 
 sooner or later the submerged part floats to the surface and reappears 
 greece becomes greece again italy is once more italy 
 the protest of right against the deed persists forever 
 the theft of a nation cannot be allowed by prescription 
 these lofty deeds of rascality have no future a nation cannot have its mark extracted like a pocket handkerchief 
 courfeyrac had a father who was called m de courfeyrac 
 one of the false ideas of the bourgeoisie under the restoration as regards aristocracy and the nobility was to believe in the particle the particle as every one knows possesses no significance but the bourgeois of the epoch of la minerve estimated so highly that poor de that they thought themselves bound to abdicate it m de chauvelin had himself called m chauvelin m de caumartin m caumartin m de constant de robecque benjamin constant m de lafayette m lafayette 
 courfeyrac had not wished to remain behind the rest and called himself plain courfeyrac 
 we might almost so far as courfeyrac is concerned stop here and confine ourselves to saying with regard to what remains for courfeyrac see tholomyes 
 courfeyrac had in fact that animation of youth which may be called the beaute du diable of the mind 
 later on this disappears like the playfulness of the kitten and all this grace ends with the bourgeois on two legs and with the tomcat on four paws 
 this sort of wit is transmitted from generation to generation of the successive levies of youth who traverse the schools who pass it from hand to hand quasi cursores and is almost always exactly the same so that as we have just pointed out any one who had listened to courfeyrac in would have thought he heard tholomyes in 
 only courfeyrac was an honorable fellow beneath the apparent similarities of the exterior mind the difference between him and tholomyes was very great 
 the latent man which existed in the two was totally different in the first from what it was in the second 
 there was in tholomyes a district attorney and in courfeyrac a paladin 
 enjolras was the chief combeferre was the guide courfeyrac was the centre 
 the others gave more light he shed more warmth the truth is that he possessed all the qualities of a centre roundness and radiance 
 bahorel had figured in the bloody tumult of june on the occasion of the burial of young lallemand 
 bahorel was a mortal who kept bad company brave a spendthrift prodigal and to the verge of generosity talkative and at times eloquent bold to the verge of effrontery the best fellow possible he had daring waistcoats and scarlet opinions a wholesale blusterer that is to say loving nothing so much as a quarrel unless it were an uprising and nothing so much as an uprising unless it were a revolution always ready to smash a then to tear up the pavement then to demolish a government just to see the effect of it a student in his eleventh year he had nosed about the law but did not practise it 
 he had taken for his device 
 never a lawyer and for his armorial bearings a nightstand in which was visible a square cap 
 every time that he passed the which rarely happened he buttoned up his paletot had not yet been took hygienic precautions 
 of the school porter he said 
 what a fine old man and of the dean m delvincourt 
 what a monument in his lectures he espied subjects for ballads and in his professors occasions for caricature 
 he wasted a tolerably large allowance something like three thousand francs a year in doing nothing 
 he had peasant parents whom he had contrived to imbue with respect for their son 
 he said of them 
 they are peasants and not bourgeois that is the reason they are intelligent 
 bahorel a man of caprice was scattered over numerous cafes the others had habits he had none 
 he sauntered 
 to stray is human to saunter is parisian 
 in reality he had a penetrating mind and was more of a thinker than appeared to view 
 he served as a connecting link between the friends of the a b c and other still unorganized groups which were destined to take form later on 
 in this conclave of young heads there was one bald member 
 the marquis whom louis xviii 
 made a duke for having assisted him to enter a on the day when he emigrated was wont to relate that in on his return to france as the king was disembarking at calais a man handed him a petition 
 what is your request said the king 
 sire a 
 what is your name 
 
 the king frowned glanced at the signature of the petition and beheld the name written thus 
 lesgle 
 this orthography touched the king and he began to smile 
 sire resumed the man with the petition i had for ancestor a keeper of the hounds surnamed lesgueules 
 this surname furnished my name 
 i am called lesgueules by contraction lesgle and by corruption this caused the king to smile broadly 
 later on he gave the man the posting office of meaux either intentionally or accidentally 
 the bald member of the group was the son of this lesgle or legle and he signed himself legle de meaux as an abbreviation his companions called him bossuet 
 bossuet was a gay but unlucky fellow 
 his specialty was not to succeed in anything 
 as an offset he laughed at everything at five and twenty he was bald 
 his father had ended by owning a house and a field but he the son had made haste to lose that house and field in a bad speculation 
 he had nothing left he possessed knowledge and wit but all he did miscarried everything failed him and everybody deceived him what he was building tumbled down on top of him 
 if he were splitting wood he cut off a finger 
 if he had a mistress he speedily discovered that he had a friend also 
 some misfortune happened to him every moment hence his joviality 
 he said 
 i live under falling tiles he was not easily astonished because for him an accident was what he had foreseen he took his bad luck serenely and smiled at the teasing of fate like a person who is listening to pleasantries he was poor but his fund of good humor was inexhaustible he soon reached his last sou never his last burst of laughter when adversity entered his doors he saluted this old acquaintance cordially he tapped all catastrophes on the stomach he was familiar with fatality to the point of calling it by its nickname good day guignon he said to it 
 these persecutions of fate had rendered him inventive 
 he was full of resources 
 he had no money but he found means when it seemed good to him to indulge in unbridled extravagance 
 one night he went so far as to eat a hundred francs in a supper with a wench which inspired him to make this memorable remark in the midst of the orgy 
 pull off my boots you jade 
 bossuet was slowly directing his steps towards the profession of a lawyer he was pursuing his law studies after the manner of bahorel 
 bossuet had not much domicile sometimes none at all he lodged now with one now with another most often with joly joly was studying medicine 
 he was two years younger than bossuet 
 joly was the malade imaginaire junior 
 what he had won in medicine was to be more of an invalid than a doctor 
 at three and twenty he thought himself a valetudinarian and passed his life in inspecting his tongue in the mirror 
 he affirmed that man becomes magnetic like a needle and in his chamber he placed his bed with its head to the south and the foot to the north so that at night the circulation of his blood might not be interfered with by the great electric current of the globe 
 during thunder storms he felt his pulse 
 otherwise he was the gayest of them all all these young maniacal puny merry incoherences lived in harmony together and the result was an eccentric and agreeable being whom his comrades who were prodigal of winged consonants called jolllly you may fly away on the four jean prouvaire said to him 
 wing 
 joly had a trick of touching his nose with the tip of his cane which is an indication of a sagacious mind 
 all these young men who differed so greatly and who on the whole can only be discussed seriously held the same religion 
 progress 
 all were the direct sons of the french revolution 
 the most giddy of them became solemn when they pronounced that date 
 
 their fathers in the flesh had been either royalists doctrinaires it matters not what this confusion anterior to themselves who were young did not concern them at all the pure blood of principle ran in their veins 
 they attached themselves without intermediate shades to incorruptible right and absolute duty 
 affiliated and initiated they sketched out the ideal underground 
 among all these glowing hearts and thoroughly convinced minds there was one sceptic 
 how came he there 
 by juxtaposition this name was grantaire and he was in the habit of signing himself with this rebus 
 r grantaire was a man who took good care not to believe in anything 
 moreover he was one of the students who had learned the most during their course at paris he knew that the best coffee was to be had at the cafe lemblin and the best billiards at the cafe voltaire that good cakes and lasses were to be found at the ermitage on the boulevard du maine spatchcocked chickens at mother excellent matelotes at the barriere de la cunette and a certain thin white wine at the barriere du com pat 
 he knew the best place for everything in addition boxing and and some dances and he was a thorough player 
 he was a tremendous drinker to boot he was inordinately homely 
 the prettiest of that day irma boissy enraged with his homeliness pronounced sentence on him as follows 
 grantaire is impossible but fatuity was not to be disconcerted 
 he stared tenderly and fixedly at all women with the air of saying to them all 
 if i only chose and of trying to make his comrades believe that he was in general demand 
 all those words 
 rights of the people rights of man the social contract the french revolution the republic democracy humanity civilization religion progress came very near to signifying nothing whatever to grantaire 
 he smiled at them scepticism that caries of the intelligence had not left him a single whole idea 
 he lived with irony 
 this was his axiom there is but one certainty my full glass 
 he sneered at all devotion in all parties the father as well as the brother robespierre junior as well as loizerolles 
 they are greatly in advance to be dead he exclaimed 
 he said of the crucifix 
 there is a gibbet which has been a success 
 a rover a gambler a libertine often drunk he displeased these young dreamers by humming incessantly les filles et le bon vin 
 air 
 vive henri iv 
 however this sceptic had one fanaticism 
 this fanaticism was neither a dogma nor an idea nor an art nor a science it was a man 
 enjolras 
 grantaire admired loved and venerated enjolras to whom did this anarchical scoffer unite himself in this phalanx of absolute minds 
 to the most absolute 
 in what manner had enjolras subjugated him 
 by his ideas 
 no by his character a phenomenon which is often observable 
 a sceptic who adheres to a believer is as simple as the law of complementary colors 
 that which we lack attracts us 
 no one loves the light like the blind man the dwarf adores the the toad always has his eyes fixed on heaven 
 why 
 in order to watch the bird in its flight grantaire in whom writhed doubt loved to watch faith soar in enjolras he had need of enjolras 
 that chaste healthy firm upright hard candid nature charmed him without his being clearly aware of it and without the idea of explaining it to himself having occurred to him 
 he admired his opposite by instinct 
 his soft yielding dislocated sickly shapeless ideas attached themselves to enjolras as to a spinal column 
 his moral backbone leaned on that firmness grantaire in the presence of enjolras became some one once more he was himself moreover composed of two elements which were to all appearance incompatible 
 he was ironical and cordial his indifference loved 
 his mind could get along without belief but his heart could not get along without friendship a profound contradiction for an affection is a conviction his nature was thus constituted 
 there are men who seem to be born to be the reverse the obverse the wrong side 
 they are pollux patrocles nisus eudamidas ephestion pechmeja 
 they only exist on condition that they are backed up with another man their name is a sequel and is only written preceded by the conjunction and and their existence is not their own it is the other side of an existence which is not theirs 
 grantaire was one of these men he was the obverse of enjolras 
 one might almost say that affinities begin with the letters of the alphabet 
 in the series o and p are inseparable 
 you can at will pronounce o and p or orestes and pylades 
 grantaire enjolras true satellite inhabited this circle of young men he lived there he took no pleasure anywhere but there he followed them everywhere 
 his joy was to see these forms go and come through the fumes of wine 
 they tolerated him on account of his good humor 
 enjolras the believer disdained this sceptic and a sober man himself scorned this drunkard 
 he accorded him a little lofty pity 
 grantaire was an unaccepted pylades 
 always harshly treated by enjolras roughly repulsed rejected yet ever returning to the charge he said of enjolras 
 what fine marble 
 a group which barely missed becoming historic 
 at that epoch which was to all appearances indifferent a certain revolutionary quiver was vaguely current 
 breaths which had started forth from the depths of and were in the air 
 youth was on the point may the reader pardon us the word of moulting people were undergoing a transformation almost without being conscious of it through the movement of the age 
 the needle which moves round the compass also moves in souls 
 each person was taking that step in advance which he was bound to take the royalists were becoming liberals liberals were turning democrats it was a flood tide complicated with a thousand ebb movements the peculiarity of ebbs is to create intermixtures hence the combination of very singular ideas people adored both napoleon and liberty we are making history here 
 these were the mirages of that period opinions traverse phases 
 voltairian royalism a quaint variety had a no less singular sequel bonapartist liberalism 
 other groups of minds were more serious 
 in that direction they sounded principles they attached themselves to the right they grew enthusiastic for the absolute they caught glimpses of infinite realizations the absolute by its very rigidity urges spirits towards the sky and causes them to float in illimitable space there is nothing like dogma for bringing forth dreams 
 and there is nothing like dreams for engendering the future 
 utopia flesh and blood 
 these advanced opinions had a double foundation 
 a beginning of mystery menaced the established order of things which was suspicious and underhand 
 a sign which was revolutionary to the highest degree 
 the second thoughts of power meet the second thoughts of the populace in the mine 
 the incubation of insurrections gives the retort to the premeditation of coups 
 there did not as yet exist in france any of those vast underlying organizations like the german tugendbund and italian carbonarism but here and there there were dark underminings which were in process of throwing off shoots 
 the cougourde was being outlined at aix there existed at paris among other affiliations of that nature the society of the friends of the a b c 
 what were these friends of the a b c 
 a society which had for its object apparently the education of children in reality the elevation of man 
 they declared themselves the friends of the a b abaisse the is to say the people 
 they wished to elevate the people 
 it was a pun which we should do wrong to smile at puns are sometimes serious factors in politics witness the castratus ad castra which made a general of the army of narses witness barbari et barberini witness 
 tu es petrus et super hanc petram etc etc 
 the friends of the a b c were not numerous it was a secret society in the state of embryo we might almost say a coterie if coteries ended in heroes 
 they assembled in paris in two localities near the in a called corinthe of which more will be heard later on and near the pantheon in a little cafe in the rue called the cafe musain now torn down the first of these was close to the workingman the second to the students 
 the assemblies of the friends of the a b c were usually held in a back room of the cafe musain 
 this hall which was tolerably remote from the cafe with which it was connected by an extremely long corridor had two windows and an exit with a private stairway on the little rue des gres 
 there they smoked and drank and gambled and laughed 
 there they conversed in very loud tones about everything and in whispers of other things an old map of france under the republic was nailed to the wall a sign quite sufficient to excite the suspicion of a police agent 
 the greater part of the friends of the a b c were students who were on cordial terms with the working classes

 he desired that society should labor without relaxation at the elevation of the moral and intellectual level at coining science at putting ideas into circulation at increasing the mind in youthful persons and he feared lest the present poverty of method the paltriness from a literary point of view confined to two or three centuries called classic the tyrannical dogmatism of official pedants scholastic prejudices and routines should end by converting our colleges into artificial oyster beds 
 he was learned a purist exact a graduate of the polytechnic a close student and at the same time thoughtful even to chimaeras so his friends said he believed in all dreams railroads the suppression of suffering in chirurgical operations the fixing of images in the dark chamber the electric telegraph the steering of balloons 
 moreover he was not much alarmed by the citadels erected against the human mind in every direction by superstition despotism and prejudice he was one of those who think that science will eventually turn the position 
 enjolras was a chief combeferre was a guide one would have liked to fight under the one and to march behind the other 
 it is not that combeferre was not capable of fighting he did not refuse a combat with the obstacle and to attack it by main force and explosively but it suited him better to bring the human race into accord with its destiny gradually by means of education the inculcation of axioms the promulgation of positive laws and between two lights his preference was rather for illumination than for conflagration a conflagration can create an aurora no doubt but why not await the dawn 
 a volcano illuminates but daybreak furnishes a still better illumination 
 possibly combeferre preferred the whiteness of the beautiful to the blaze of the sublime 
 a light troubled by smoke progress purchased at the expense of violence only half satisfied this tender and serious spirit 
 the headlong precipitation of a people into the truth a terrified him nevertheless stagnation was still more repulsive to him in it he detected putrefaction and death on the whole he preferred scum to miasma and he preferred the torrent to the cesspool and the falls of niagara to the lake of montfaucon 
 in short he desired neither halt nor haste 
 while his tumultuous friends captivated by the absolute adored and invoked splendid revolutionary adventures combeferre was inclined to let progress good progress take its own course he may have been cold but he was pure methodical but irreproachable phlegmatic but imperturbable 
 combeferre would have knelt and clasped his hands to enable the future to arrive in all its candor and that nothing might disturb the immense and virtuous evolution of the races 
 the good must be innocent he repeated incessantly and in fact if the grandeur of the revolution consists in keeping the dazzling ideal fixedly in view and of soaring thither athwart the lightnings with fire and blood in its talons the beauty of progress lies in being spotless and there exists between washington who represents the one and danton who incarnates the other that difference which separates the swan from the angel with the wings of an eagle 
 jean prouvaire was a still softer shade than combeferre 
 his name was jehan owing to that petty momentary freak which mingled with the powerful and profound movement whence sprang the very essential study of the middle ages 
 jean prouvaire was in love he cultivated a pot of flowers played on the flute made verses loved the people pitied woman wept over the child confounded god and the future in the same confidence and blamed the revolution for having caused the fall of a royal head that of andre chenier his voice was ordinarily delicate but suddenly grew manly he was learned even to erudition and almost an orientalist above all he was good and a very simple thing to those who know how nearly goodness borders on grandeur in the matter of poetry he preferred the immense 
 he knew italian latin greek and hebrew and these served him only for the perusal of four poets dante juvenal aeschylus and isaiah 
 in french he preferred corneille to racine and agrippa to corneille he loved to saunter through fields of wild oats and and busied himself with clouds nearly as much as with events his mind had two attitudes one on the side towards man the other on that towards god he studied or he contemplated 
 all day long he buried himself in social questions salary capital credit marriage religion liberty of thought education penal servitude poverty association property production and sharing the enigma of this lower world which covers the human with darkness and at night he gazed upon the planets those enormous beings like enjolras he was wealthy and an only son 
 he spoke softly bowed his head lowered his eyes smiled with embarrassment dressed badly had an awkward air blushed at a mere nothing and was very timid 
 yet he was intrepid 
 feuilly was a workingman a orphaned both of father and mother who earned with difficulty three francs a day and had but one thought to deliver the world 
 he had one other preoccupation to educate himself he called this also delivering himself he had taught himself to read and write everything that he knew he had learned by himself 
 feuilly had a generous heart 
 the range of his embrace was immense 
 this orphan had adopted the peoples as his mother had failed him he meditated on his country he brooded with the profound divination of the man of the people over what we now call the idea of the nationality had learned history with the express object of raging with full knowledge of the case in this club of young utopians occupied chiefly with france he represented the outside world 
 he had for his specialty greece poland hungary roumania italy 
 he uttered these names incessantly appropriately and inappropriately with the tenacity of right the violations of turkey on greece and thessaly of russia on warsaw of austria on venice enraged him 
 above all things the great violence of aroused him 
 there is no more sovereign eloquence than the true in indignation he was eloquent with that eloquence 
 he was inexhaustible on that infamous date of on the subject of that noble and valiant race suppressed by treason and that crime on that monstrous ambush the prototype and pattern of all those horrible suppressions of states which since that time have struck many a noble nation and have annulled their certificate of birth so to speak all contemporary social crimes have their origin in the partition of poland 
 the partition of poland is a theorem of which all present political outrages are the corollaries 
 there has not been a despot nor a traitor for nearly a century back who has not signed approved and copied ne variatur the partition of poland when the record of modern treasons was examined that was the first thing which made its appearance 
 the congress of vienna consulted that crime before consummating its own 
 sounded the onset was the death of the game 
 such was habitual text this poor workingman had constituted himself the tutor of justice and she recompensed him by rendering him great 
 the fact is that there is eternity in right 
 warsaw can no more be tartar than venice can be teuton 
 kings lose their pains and their honor in the attempt to make them so 
 sooner or later the submerged part floats to the surface and reappears 
 greece becomes greece again italy is once more italy 
 the protest of right against the deed persists forever 
 the theft of a nation cannot be allowed by prescription 
 these lofty deeds of rascality have no future a nation cannot have its mark extracted like a pocket handkerchief 
 courfeyrac had a father who was called m de courfeyrac 
 one of the false ideas of the bourgeoisie under the restoration as regards aristocracy and the nobility was to believe in the particle the particle as every one knows possesses no significance but the bourgeois of the epoch of la minerve estimated so highly that poor de that they thought themselves bound to abdicate it m de chauvelin had himself called m chauvelin m de caumartin m caumartin m de constant de robecque benjamin constant m de lafayette m lafayette 
 courfeyrac had not wished to remain behind the rest and called himself plain courfeyrac 
 we might almost so far as courfeyrac is concerned stop here and confine ourselves to saying with regard to what remains for courfeyrac see tholomyes 
 courfeyrac had in fact that animation of youth which may be called the beaute du diable of the mind 
 later on this disappears like the playfulness of the kitten and all this grace ends with the bourgeois on two legs and with the tomcat on four paws 
 this sort of wit is transmitted from generation to generation of the successive levies of youth who traverse the schools who pass it from hand to hand quasi cursores and is almost always exactly the same so that as we have just pointed out any one who had listened to courfeyrac in would have thought he heard tholomyes in 
 only courfeyrac was an honorable fellow beneath the apparent similarities of the exterior mind the difference between him and tholomyes was very great 
 the latent man which existed in the two was totally different in the first from what it was in the second 
 there was in tholomyes a district attorney and in courfeyrac a paladin 
 enjolras was the chief combeferre was the guide courfeyrac was the centre 
 the others gave more light he shed more warmth the truth is that he possessed all the qualities of a centre roundness and radiance 
 bahorel had figured in the bloody tumult of june on the occasion of the burial of young lallemand 
 bahorel was a mortal who kept bad company brave a spendthrift prodigal and to the verge of generosity talkative and at times eloquent bold to the verge of effrontery the best fellow possible he had daring waistcoats and scarlet opinions a wholesale blusterer that is to say loving nothing so much as a quarrel unless it were an uprising and nothing so much as an uprising unless it were a revolution always ready to smash a then to tear up the pavement then to demolish a government just to see the effect of it a student in his eleventh year he had nosed about the law but did not practise it 
 he had taken for his device 
 never a lawyer and for his armorial bearings a nightstand in which was visible a square cap 
 every time that he passed the which rarely happened he buttoned up his paletot had not yet been took hygienic precautions 
 of the school porter he said 
 what a fine old man and of the dean m delvincourt 
 what a monument in his lectures he espied subjects for ballads and in his professors occasions for caricature 
 he wasted a tolerably large allowance something like three thousand francs a year in doing nothing 
 he had peasant parents whom he had contrived to imbue with respect for their son 
 he said of them 
 they are peasants and not bourgeois that is the reason they are intelligent 
 bahorel a man of caprice was scattered over numerous cafes the others had habits he had none 
 he sauntered 
 to stray is human to saunter is parisian 
 in reality he had a penetrating mind and was more of a thinker than appeared to view 
 he served as a connecting link between the friends of the a b c and other still unorganized groups which were destined to take form later on 
 in this conclave of young heads there was one bald member 
 the marquis whom louis xviii 
 made a duke for having assisted him to enter a on the day when he emigrated was wont to relate that in on his return to france as the king was disembarking at calais a man handed him a petition 
 what is your request said the king 
 sire a 
 what is your name 
 
 the king frowned glanced at the signature of the petition and beheld the name written thus 
 lesgle 
 this orthography touched the king and he began to smile 
 sire resumed the man with the petition i had for ancestor a keeper of the hounds surnamed lesgueules 
 this surname furnished my name 
 i am called lesgueules by contraction lesgle and by corruption this caused the king to smile broadly 
 later on he gave the man the posting office of meaux either intentionally or accidentally 
 the bald member of the group was the son of this lesgle or legle and he signed himself legle de meaux as an abbreviation his companions called him bossuet 
 bossuet was a gay but unlucky fellow 
 his specialty was not to succeed in anything 
 as an offset he laughed at everything at five and twenty he was bald 
 his father had ended by owning a house and a field but he the son had made haste to lose that house and field in a bad speculation 
 he had nothing left he possessed knowledge and wit but all he did miscarried everything failed him and everybody deceived him what he was building tumbled down on top of him 
 if he were splitting wood he cut off a finger 
 if he had a mistress he speedily discovered that he had a friend also 
 some misfortune happened to him every moment hence his joviality 
 he said 
 i live under falling tiles he was not easily astonished because for him an accident was what he had foreseen he took his bad luck serenely and smiled at the teasing of fate like a person who is listening to pleasantries he was poor but his fund of good humor was inexhaustible he soon reached his last sou never his last burst of laughter when adversity entered his doors he saluted this old acquaintance cordially he tapped all catastrophes on the stomach he was familiar with fatality to the point of calling it by its nickname good day guignon he said to it 
 these persecutions of fate had rendered him inventive 
 he was full of resources 
 he had no money but he found means when it seemed good to him to indulge in unbridled extravagance 
 one night he went so far as to eat a hundred francs in a supper with a wench which inspired him to make this memorable remark in the midst of the orgy 
 pull off my boots you jade 
 bossuet was slowly directing his steps towards the profession of a lawyer he was pursuing his law studies after the manner of bahorel 
 bossuet had not much domicile sometimes none at all he lodged now with one now with another most often with joly joly was studying medicine 
 he was two years younger than bossuet 
 joly was the malade imaginaire junior 
 what he had won in medicine was to be more of an invalid than a doctor 
 at three and twenty he thought himself a valetudinarian and passed his life in inspecting his tongue in the mirror 
 he affirmed that man becomes magnetic like a needle and in his chamber he placed his bed with its head to the south and the foot to the north so that at night the circulation of his blood might not be interfered with by the great electric current of the globe 
 during thunder storms he felt his pulse 
 otherwise he was the gayest of them all all these young maniacal puny merry incoherences lived in harmony together and the result was an eccentric and agreeable being whom his comrades who were prodigal of winged consonants called jolllly you may fly away on the four jean prouvaire said to him 
 wing 
 joly had a trick of touching his nose with the tip of his cane which is an indication of a sagacious mind 
 all these young men who differed so greatly and who on the whole can only be discussed seriously held the same religion 
 progress 
 all were the direct sons of the french revolution 
 the most giddy of them became solemn when they pronounced that date 
 
 their fathers in the flesh had been either royalists doctrinaires it matters not what this confusion anterior to themselves who were young did not concern them at all the pure blood of principle ran in their veins 
 they attached themselves without intermediate shades to incorruptible right and absolute duty 
 affiliated and initiated they sketched out the ideal underground 
 among all these glowing hearts and thoroughly convinced minds there was one sceptic 
 how came he there 
 by juxtaposition this name was grantaire and he was in the habit of signing himself with this rebus 
 r grantaire was a man who took good care not to believe in anything 
 moreover he was one of the students who had learned the most during their course at paris he knew that the best coffee was to be had at the cafe lemblin and the best billiards at the cafe voltaire that good cakes and lasses were to be found at the ermitage on the boulevard du maine spatchcocked chickens at mother excellent matelotes at the barriere de la cunette and a certain thin white wine at the barriere du com pat 
 he knew the best place for everything in addition boxing and and some dances and he was a thorough player 
 he was a tremendous drinker to boot he was inordinately homely 
 the prettiest of that day irma boissy enraged with his homeliness pronounced sentence on him as follows 
 grantaire is impossible but fatuity was not to be disconcerted 
 he stared tenderly and fixedly at all women with the air of saying to them all 
 if i only chose and of trying to make his comrades believe that he was in general demand 
 all those words 
 rights of the people rights of man the social contract the french revolution the republic democracy humanity civilization religion progress came very near to signifying nothing whatever to grantaire 
 he smiled at them scepticism that caries of the intelligence had not left him a single whole idea 
 he lived with irony 
 this was his axiom there is but one certainty my full glass 
 he sneered at all devotion in all parties the father as well as the brother robespierre junior as well as loizerolles 
 they are greatly in advance to be dead he exclaimed 
 he said of the crucifix 
 there is a gibbet which has been a success 
 a rover a gambler a libertine often drunk he displeased these young dreamers by humming incessantly les filles et le bon vin 
 air 
 vive henri iv 
 however this sceptic had one fanaticism 
 this fanaticism was neither a dogma nor an idea nor an art nor a science it was a man 
 enjolras 
 grantaire admired loved and venerated enjolras to whom did this anarchical scoffer unite himself in this phalanx of absolute minds 
 to the most absolute 
 in what manner had enjolras subjugated him 
 by his ideas 
 no by his character a phenomenon which is often observable 
 a sceptic who adheres to a believer is as simple as the law of complementary colors 
 that which we lack attracts us 
 no one loves the light like the blind man the dwarf adores the the toad always has his eyes fixed on heaven 
 why 
 in order to watch the bird in its flight grantaire in whom writhed doubt loved to watch faith soar in enjolras he had need of enjolras 
 that chaste healthy firm upright hard candid nature charmed him without his being clearly aware of it and without the idea of explaining it to himself having occurred to him 
 he admired his opposite by instinct 
 his soft yielding dislocated sickly shapeless ideas attached themselves to enjolras as to a spinal column 
 his moral backbone leaned on that firmness grantaire in the presence of enjolras became some one once more he was himself moreover composed of two elements which were to all appearance incompatible 
 he was ironical and cordial his indifference loved 
 his mind could get along without belief but his heart could not get along without friendship a profound contradiction for an affection is a conviction his nature was thus constituted 
 there are men who seem to be born to be the reverse the obverse the wrong side 
 they are pollux patrocles nisus eudamidas ephestion pechmeja 
 they only exist on condition that they are backed up with another man their name is a sequel and is only written preceded by the conjunction and and their existence is not their own it is the other side of an existence which is not theirs 
 grantaire was one of these men he was the obverse of enjolras 
 one might almost say that affinities begin with the letters of the alphabet 
 in the series o and p are inseparable 
 you can at will pronounce o and p or orestes and pylades 
 grantaire enjolras true satellite inhabited this circle of young men he lived there he took no pleasure anywhere but there he followed them everywhere 
 his joy was to see these forms go and come through the fumes of wine 
 they tolerated him on account of his good humor 
 enjolras the believer disdained this sceptic and a sober man himself scorned this drunkard 
 he accorded him a little lofty pity 
 grantaire was an unaccepted pylades 
 always harshly treated by enjolras roughly repulsed rejected yet ever returning to the charge he said of enjolras 
 what fine marble

 book nine 
 chapter xi 
 
 prince eyes were still following pfuel out of the room when count bennigsen entered hurriedly and nodding to bolkonski but not pausing went into the study giving instructions to his adjutant as he went the emperor was following him and bennigsen had hastened on to make some preparations and to be ready to receive the sovereign chernyshev and prince andrew went out into the porch where the emperor who looked fatigued was dismounting marquis paulucci was talking to him with particular warmth and the emperor with his head bent to the left was listening with a dissatisfied air the emperor moved forward evidently wishing to end the conversation but the flushed and excited italian oblivious of decorum followed him and continued to speak 
 and as for the man who advised forming this camp the drissa camp said paulucci as the emperor mounted the steps and noticing prince andrew scanned his unfamiliar face as to that person sire continued paulucci desperately apparently unable to restrain himself the man who advised the drissa camp i see no alternative but the lunatic asylum or the gallows 
 without heeding the end of the remarks and as though not hearing them the emperor recognizing bolkonski addressed him graciously 
 i am very glad to see you go in there where they are meeting and wait for me 
 the emperor went into the study he was followed by prince peter mikhaylovich volkonski and baron stein and the door closed behind them prince andrew taking advantage of the permission accompanied paulucci whom he had known in turkey into the drawing room where the council was assembled 
 prince peter mikhaylovich volkonski occupied the position as it were of chief of the staff he came out of the study into the drawing room with some maps which he spread on a table and put questions on which he wished to hear the opinion of the gentlemen present what had happened was that news which afterwards proved to be false had been received during the night of a movement by the french to outflank the drissa camp 
 the first to speak was general armfeldt who to meet the difficulty that presented itself unexpectedly proposed a perfectly new position away from the petersburg and moscow roads the reason for this was inexplicable unless he wished to show that he too could have an opinion but he urged that at this point the army should unite and there await the enemy it was plain that armfeldt had thought out that plan long ago and now expounded it not so much to answer the questions put which in fact his plan did not answer as to avail himself of the opportunity to air it it was one of the millions of proposals one as good as another that could be made as long as it was quite unknown what character the war would take some disputed his arguments others defended them young count toll objected to the swedish views more warmly than anyone else and in the course of the dispute drew from his side pocket a notebook which he asked permission to read to them in these voluminous notes toll suggested another scheme totally different from or plan of campaign in answer to toll paulucci suggested an advance and an attack which he urged could alone extricate us from the present uncertainty and from the trap as he called the drissa camp in which we were situated 
 during all these discussions pfuel and his interpreter wolzogen his bridge in court relations were silent pfuel only snorted contemptuously and turned away to show that he would never demean himself by replying to such nonsense as he was now hearing so when prince volkonski who was in the chair called on him to give his opinion he merely said 
 why ask me general armfeldt has proposed a splendid position with an exposed rear or why not this italian attack very fine or a retreat also good why ask me said he why you yourselves know everything better than i do 
 but when volkonski said with a frown that it was in the name that he asked his opinion pfuel rose and suddenly growing animated began to speak 
 everything has been spoiled everything muddled everybody thought they knew better than i did and now you come to me how mend matters there is nothing to mend the principles laid down by me must be strictly adhered to said he drumming on the table with his bony fingers what is the difficulty nonsense childishness 
 he went up to the map and speaking rapidly began proving that no eventuality could alter the efficiency of the drissa camp that everything had been foreseen and that if the enemy were really going to outflank it the enemy would inevitably be destroyed 
 paulucci who did not know german began questioning him in french wolzogen came to the assistance of his chief who spoke french badly and began translating for him hardly able to keep pace with pfuel who was rapidly demonstrating that not only all that had happened but all that could happen had been foreseen in his scheme and that if there were now any difficulties the whole fault lay in the fact that his plan had not been precisely executed he kept laughing sarcastically he demonstrated and at last contemptuously ceased to demonstrate like a mathematician who ceases to prove in various ways the accuracy of a problem that has already been proved wolzogen took his place and continued to explain his views in french every now and then turning to pfuel and saying is it not so your excellency but pfuel like a man heated in a fight who strikes those on his own side shouted angrily at his own supporter wolzogen 
 well of course what more is there to explain 
 paulucci and michaud both attacked wolzogen simultaneously in french armfeldt addressed pfuel in german toll explained to volkonski in russian prince andrew listened and observed in silence 
 of all these men prince andrew sympathized most with pfuel angry determined and absurdly as he was of all those present evidently he alone was not seeking anything for himself nursed no hatred against anyone and only desired that the plan formed on a theory arrived at by years of toil should be carried out he was ridiculous and unpleasantly sarcastic but yet he inspired involuntary respect by his boundless devotion to an idea besides this the remarks of all except pfuel had one common trait that had not been noticeable at the council of war in there was now a panic fear of genius which though concealed was noticeable in every rejoinder everything was assumed to be possible for napoleon they expected him from every side and invoked his terrible name to shatter each proposals pfuel alone seemed to consider napoleon a barbarian like everyone else who opposed his theory but besides this feeling of respect pfuel evoked pity in prince andrew from the tone in which the courtiers addressed him and the way paulucci had allowed himself to speak of him to the emperor but above all from a certain desperation in own expressions it was clear that the others knew and pfuel himself felt that his fall was at hand and despite his and grumpy german sarcasm he was pitiable with his hair smoothly brushed on the temples and sticking up in tufts behind though he concealed the fact under a show of irritation and contempt he was evidently in despair that the sole remaining chance of verifying his theory by a huge experiment and proving its soundness to the whole world was slipping away from him 
 the discussions continued a long time and the longer they lasted the more heated became the disputes culminating in shouts and personalities and the less was it possible to arrive at any general conclusion from all that had been said prince andrew listening to this polyglot talk and to these surmises plans refutations and shouts felt nothing but amazement at what they were saying a thought that had long since and often occurred to him during his military activities the idea that there is not and cannot be any science of war and that therefore there can be no such thing as a military genius now appeared to him an obvious truth what theory and science is possible about a matter the conditions and circumstances of which are unknown and cannot be defined especially when the strength of the acting forces cannot be ascertained no one was or is able to foresee in what condition our or the armies will be in a time and no one can gauge the force of this or that detachment sometimes when there is not a coward at the front to shout we are cut off and start running but a brave and jolly lad who shouts hurrah a detachment of five thousand is worth thirty thousand as at schon grabern while at times fifty thousand run from eight thousand as at austerlitz what science can there be in a matter in which as in all practical matters nothing can be defined and everything depends on innumerable conditions the significance of which is determined at a particular moment which arrives no one knows when armfeldt says our army is cut in half and paulucci says we have got the french army between two fires michaud says that the worthlessness of the drissa camp lies in having the river behind it and pfuel says that is what constitutes its strength toll proposes one plan armfeldt another and they are all good and all bad and the advantages of any suggestions can be seen only at the moment of trial and why do they all speak of a military genius is a man a genius who can order bread to be brought up at the right time and say who is to go to the right and who to the left it is only because military men are invested with pomp and power and crowds of sychophants flatter power attributing to it qualities of genius it does not possess the best generals i have known were on the contrary stupid or men bagration was the best napoleon himself admitted that and of bonaparte himself i remember his limited face on the field of austerlitz not only does a good army commander not need any special qualities on the contrary he needs the absence of the highest and best human attributes love poetry tenderness and philosophic inquiring doubt he should be limited firmly convinced that what he is doing is very important otherwise he will not have sufficient patience and only then will he be a brave leader god forbid that he should be humane should love or pity or think of what is just and unjust it is understandable that a theory of their genius was invented for them long ago because they have power the success of a military action depends not on them but on the man in the ranks who shouts we are lost or who shouts hurrah and only in the ranks can one serve with assurance of being useful 
 so thought prince andrew as he listened to the talking and he roused himself only when paulucci called him and everyone was leaving 
 at the review next day the emperor asked prince andrew where he would like to serve and prince andrew lost his standing in court circles forever by not asking to remain attached to the person but for permission to serve in the army

 funeral oration by bossuet 
 on a certain afternoon which had as will be seen hereafter some coincidence with the events heretofore related laigle de meaux was to be seen leaning in a sensual manner against the doorpost of the cafe musain 
 he had the air of a caryatid on a vacation he carried nothing but his revery however 
 he was staring at the place to lean back against a thing is equivalent to lying down while standing erect which attitude is not hated by thinkers 
 laigle de meaux was pondering without melancholy over a little misadventure which had befallen him two days previously at the and which had modified his personal plans for the future plans which were rather indistinct in any case 
 revery does not prevent a cab from passing by nor the dreamer from taking note of that cab 
 laigle de meaux whose eyes were straying about in a sort of diffuse lounging perceived athwart his somnambulism a vehicle proceeding through the place at a foot pace and apparently in indecision for whom was this cabriolet 
 why was it driving at a walk laigle took a survey 
 in it beside the coachman sat a young man and in front of the young man lay a rather bulky the bag displayed to the following name inscribed in large black letters on a card which was sewn to the stuff 
 marius pontmercy 
 this name caused laigle to change his attitude 
 he drew himself up and hurled this apostrophe at the young man in the cabriolet 
 monsieur marius pontmercy 
 the cabriolet thus addressed came to a halt 
 the young man who also seemed deeply buried in thought raised his eyes 
 hey said he 
 you are m marius pontmercy 
 certainly 
 i was looking for you resumed laigle de meaux 
 how so demanded marius for it was he 
 in fact he had just quitted his and had before him a face which he now beheld for the first time 
 i do not know you 
 neither do i know you responded laigle 
 marius thought he had encountered a wag the beginning of a mystification in the open street 
 he was not in a very good humor at the moment he frowned 
 laigle de meaux went on imperturbably 
 you were not at the school day before yesterday 
 that is possible 
 that is certain 
 you are a student demanded marius 
 yes sir 
 like yourself 
 day before yesterday i entered the school by chance 
 you know one does have such freaks sometimes the professor was just calling the roll 
 you are not unaware that they are very ridiculous on such occasions 
 at the third call unanswered your name is erased from the list 
 sixty francs in the gulf 
 marius began to listen 
 it was blondeau who was making the call 
 you know blondeau he has a very pointed and very malicious nose and he delights to scent out the absent 
 he slyly began with the letter p i was not listening not being compromised by that letter 
 the call was not going badly no erasures the universe was present 
 blondeau was grieved i said to myself 
 blondeau my love you will not get the very smallest sort of an execution all at once blondeau calls marius pontmercy 
 no one answers 
 blondeau filled with hope repeats more loudly 
 marius pontmercy 
 and he takes his pen monsieur i have bowels of compassion 
 i said to myself hastily a brave fellow who is going to get scratched out 
 attention here is a veritable mortal who is not exact 
 not a good student here is none of your a student who studies a greenhorn pedant strong on letters theology science and sapience one of those dull wits cut by the square a pin by profession he is an honorable idler who lounges who practises country jaunts who cultivates the grisette who pays court to the fair sex who is at this very moment perhaps with my mistress 
 let us save him 
 death to blondeau 
 at that moment blondeau dipped his pen in all black with erasures in the ink cast his yellow eyes round the audience room and repeated for the third time marius pontmercy 
 i replied 
 present this is why you were not crossed off 
 monsieur said marius 
 and why i was added laigle de meaux 
 i do not understand you said marius 
 laigle resumed 
 nothing is more simple 
 i was close to the desk to reply and close to the door for the purpose of flight 
 the professor gazed at me with a certain intensity 
 all of a sudden blondeau who must be the malicious nose alluded to by boileau skipped to the letter l l is my letter 
 i am from meaux and my name is lesgle 
 interrupted marius what fine name 
 monsieur blondeau came to this fine name and called laigle i reply 
 present then blondeau gazes at me with the gentleness of a tiger and says to me 
 lf you are pontmercy you are not laigle 
 a phrase which has a disobliging air for you but which was lugubrious only for me 
 that said he crossed me off 
 marius exclaimed 
 i am mortified sir 
 first of all interposed laigle i demand permission to embalm blondeau in a few phrases of deeply felt eulogium 
 i will assume that he is dead 
 there will be no great change required in his gauntness in his pallor in his coldness and in his smell and i say 
 erudimini qui judicatis terram 
 here lies blondeau blondeau the nose blondeau nasica the ox of discipline bos disciplinae the bloodhound of the password the angel of the who was upright square exact rigid honest and hideous god crossed him off as he crossed me off 
 marius resumed 
 i am very sorry 
 young man said laigle de meaux let this serve you as a lesson in future be exact 
 i really beg you a thousand pardons

 book nine 
 chapter xii 
 
 before the beginning of the campaign rostov had received a letter from his parents in which they told him briefly of illness and the breaking off of her engagement to prince andrew which they explained by having rejected him and again asked nicholas to retire from the army and return home on receiving this letter nicholas did not even make any attempt to get leave of absence or to retire from the army but wrote to his parents that he was sorry natasha was ill and her engagement broken off and that he would do all he could to meet their wishes to sonya he wrote separately 
 adored friend of my soul he wrote nothing but honor could keep me from returning to the country but now at the commencement of the campaign i should feel dishonored not only in my comrades eyes but in my own if i preferred my own happiness to my love and duty to the fatherland but this shall be our last separation believe me directly the war is over if i am still alive and still loved by you i will throw up everything and fly to you to press you forever to my ardent breast 
 it was in fact only the commencement of the campaign that prevented rostov from returning home as he had promised and marrying sonya the autumn in otradnoe with the hunting and the winter with the christmas holidays and love had opened out to him a vista of tranquil rural joys and peace such as he had never known before and which now allured him a splendid wife children a good pack of hounds a dozen leashes of smart borzois agriculture neighbors service by election thought he but now the campaign was beginning and he had to remain with his regiment and since it had to be so nicholas rostov as was natural to him felt contented with the life he led in the regiment and was able to find pleasure in that life 
 on his return from his furlough nicholas having been joyfully welcomed by his comrades was sent to obtain remounts and brought back from the ukraine excellent horses which pleased him and earned him commendation from his commanders during his absence he had been promoted captain and when the regiment was put on war footing with an increase in numbers he was again allotted his old squadron 
 the campaign began the regiment was moved into poland on double pay new officers arrived new men and horses and above all everybody was infected with the merrily excited mood that goes with the commencement of a war and rostov conscious of his advantageous position in the regiment devoted himself entirely to the pleasures and interests of military service though he knew that sooner or later he would have to relinquish them 
 the troops retired from vilna for various complicated reasons of state political and strategic each step of the retreat was accompanied by a complicated interplay of interests arguments and passions at headquarters for the pavlograd hussars however the whole of this retreat during the finest period of summer and with sufficient supplies was a very simple and agreeable business 
 it was only at headquarters that there was depression uneasiness and intriguing in the body of the army they did not ask themselves where they were going or why if they regretted having to retreat it was only because they had to leave billets they had grown accustomed to or some pretty young polish lady if the thought that things looked bad chanced to enter head he tried to be as cheerful as befits a good soldier and not to think of the general trend of affairs but only of the task nearest to hand first they camped gaily before vilna making acquaintance with the polish landowners preparing for reviews and being reviewed by the emperor and other high commanders then came an order to retreat to sventsyani and destroy any provisions they could not carry away with them sventsyani was remembered by the hussars only as the drunken camp a name the whole army gave to their encampment there and because many complaints were made against the troops who taking advantage of the order to collect provisions took also horses carriages and carpets from the polish proprietors rostov remembered sventsyani because on the first day of their arrival at that small town he changed his sergeant major and was unable to manage all the drunken men of his squadron who unknown to him had appropriated five barrels of old beer from sventsyani they retired farther and farther to drissa and thence again beyond drissa drawing near to the frontier of russia proper 
 on the thirteenth of july the pavlograds took part in a serious action for the first time 
 on the twelfth of july on the eve of that action there was a heavy storm of rain and hail in general the summer of l was remarkable for its storms 
 the two pavlograd squadrons were bivouacking on a field of rye which was already in ear but had been completely trodden down by cattle and horses the rain was descending in torrents and rostov with a young officer named ilyin his protege was sitting in a hastily constructed shelter an officer of their regiment with long mustaches extending onto his cheeks who after riding to the staff had been overtaken by the rain entered shelter 
 i have come from the staff count have you heard of exploit 
 and the officer gave them details of the saltanov battle which he had heard at the staff 
 rostov smoking his pipe and turning his head about as the water trickled down his neck listened inattentively with an occasional glance at ilyin who was pressing close to him this officer a lad of sixteen who had recently joined the regiment was now in the same relation to nicholas that nicholas had been to denisov seven years before ilyin tried to imitate rostov in everything and adored him as a girl might have done 
 zdrzhinski the officer with the long mustache spoke grandiloquently of the saltanov dam being a russian thermopylae and of how a deed worthy of antiquity had been performed by general raevski he recounted how raevski had led his two sons onto the dam under terrific fire and had charged with them beside him rostov heard the story and not only said nothing to encourage enthusiasm but on the contrary looked like a man ashamed of what he was hearing though with no intention of contradicting it since the campaigns of austerlitz and of rostov knew by experience that men always lie when describing military exploits as he himself had done when recounting them besides that he had experience enough to know that nothing happens in war at all as we can imagine or relate it and so he did not like tale nor did he like zdrzhinski himself who with his mustaches extending over his cheeks bent low over the face of his hearer as was his habit and crowded rostov in the narrow shanty rostov looked at him in silence in the first place there must have been such a confusion and crowding on the dam that was being attacked that if raevski did lead his sons there it could have had no effect except perhaps on some dozen men nearest to him thought he the rest could not have seen how or with whom raevski came onto the dam and even those who did see it would not have been much stimulated by it for what had they to do with tender paternal feelings when their own skins were in danger and besides the fate of the fatherland did not depend on whether they took the saltanov dam or not as we are told was the case at thermopylae so why should he have made such a sacrifice and why expose his own children in the battle i would not have taken my brother petya there or even ilyin a stranger to me but a nice lad but would have tried to put them somewhere under cover nicholas continued to think as he listened to zdrzhinski but he did not express his thoughts for in such matters too he had gained experience he knew that this tale redounded to the glory of our arms and so one had to pretend not to doubt it and he acted accordingly 
 i stand this any more said ilyin noticing that rostov did not relish conversation my stockings and shirt and the water is running on my seat go and look for shelter the rain seems less heavy 
 ilyin went out and zdrzhinski rode away 
 five minutes later ilyin splashing through the mud came running back to the shanty 
 hurrah rostov come quick found it about two hundred yards away a tavern where ours have already gathered we can at least get dry there and mary there 
 mary hendrikhovna was the wife of the regimental doctor a pretty young german woman he had married in poland the doctor whether from lack of means or because he did not like to part from his young wife in the early days of their marriage took her about with him wherever the hussar regiment went and his jealousy had become a standing joke among the hussar officers 
 rostov threw his cloak over his shoulders shouted to lavrushka to follow with the things and now slipping in the mud now splashing right through it set off with ilyin in the lessening rain and the darkness that was occasionally rent by distant lightning 
 rostov where are you 
 here what lightning they called to one another

 of superstition 
 it were better to have no opinion of god at all than such an opinion as is unworthy of him for the one is unbelief the other is contumely 
 and certainly superstition is the reproach of the deity plutarch saith well to that 
 purpose 
 surely saith he i had rather a great deal men should say there was no 
 such man at all as plutarch than that they should say that there was one plutarch that would eat his children as soon as they were born as the poets speak of saturn 
 and as the contumely is greater towards god so the danger is greater towards men atheism leaves a man to sense to philosophy to natural piety 
 to laws to reputation all which may be guides to an outward moral virtue though religion were not but superstition dismounts all these and erecteth an absolute monarchy in the minds of men 
 therefore atheism did never perturb states for it makes men wary of themselves as looking no further and we see the times inclined to atheism 
 as the time of augustus caesar were civil times but superstition halh been the 
 conclusion of many states and bringeth in a new primum mobile that ravisheth all the spheres of government the master of superstition is the people and in all 
 superstition wise men follow fools and arguments are fitted to practice in a 
 reversed order it was gravely said by some of the prelates in the council of trent where the doctrine of the schoolmen bare great sway that the schoolmen were like astronomers which did feign eccentrics and epicycles and such engines of orbs to save me phenomena though they knew there were no such things and in like manner that the schoolmen had framed a number of subtle and intricate axioms and theorems to save the practice of the church 
 the causes of superstition are pleasing and sensual rites and ceremonies excess of outward and pharisaical holiness reverence of traditions which cannot but load the church the stratagems of prelates for ambition and lucre the favouring too much of good intentions which openeth the gate to conceits and novelties the taking an aim at divine matters by human which cannot but breed mixture of imaginations and lastly barbarous times 
 especially joined with calamities and disasters superstition without a veil is 
 a deformed thing for as it addeth deformity to an ape to be so like a man so the similitude of superstition to religion makes it the more deformed and as wholesome meat corrupteth to little worms so good forms and orders corrupt into a number of petty observances 
 there is a superstition in avoiding superstition when men think to do best if they go furthest from the superstition formerly received therefore care would be had that as it fareth in ill purgings the good be not taken away with the bad which commonly is done when he people is the reformer

 book fall 
 chapter ii 
 
 prudence counselled to wisdom 
 that evening the bishop of d after his promenade through the town remained shut up rather late in his room 
 he was busy over a great work on duties which was never completed unfortunately 
 he was carefully compiling everything that the fathers and the doctors have said on this important subject 
 his book was divided into two parts 
 firstly the duties of all secondly the duties of each individual according to the class to which he belongs the duties of all are the great duties 
 there are four of these saint matthew points them out 
 duties towards god matt vi duties towards self matt v duties towards neighbor matt vii duties towards animals matt vi as for the other duties the bishop found them pointed out and prescribed elsewhere 
 to sovereigns and subjects in the epistle to the romans to magistrates to wives to mothers to young men by saint peter to husbands fathers children and servants in the epistle to the ephesians to the faithful in the epistle to the hebrews to virgins in the epistle to the corinthians out of these precepts he was laboriously constructing a harmonious whole which he desired to present to souls 
 at eight he was still at work writing with a good deal of inconvenience upon little squares of paper with a big book open on his knees when madame magloire entered according to her wont to get the from the cupboard near his bed 
 a moment later the bishop knowing that the table was set and that his sister was probably waiting for him shut his book rose from his table and entered the 
 the was an oblong apartment with a fireplace which had a door opening on the street as we have said and a window opening on the garden 
 madame magloire was in fact just putting the last touches to the table 
 as she performed this service she was conversing with mademoiselle baptistine 
 a lamp stood on the table the table was near the fireplace a wood fire was burning there 
 one can easily picture to self these two women both of whom were over sixty years of age 
 madame magloire small plump vivacious mademoiselle baptistine gentle slender frail somewhat taller than her brother dressed in a gown of silk of the fashion of which she had purchased at that date in paris and which had lasted ever since 
 to borrow vulgar phrases which possess the merit of giving utterance in a single word to an idea which a whole page would hardly suffice to express madame magloire had the air of a peasant and mademoiselle baptistine that of a lady madame magloire wore a white quilted cap a gold jeannette cross on a velvet ribbon upon her neck the only bit of feminine jewelry that there was in the house a very white fichu puffing out from a gown of coarse black woollen stuff with large short sleeves an apron of cotton cloth in red and green checks knotted round the waist with a green ribbon with a stomacher of the same attached by two pins at the upper corners coarse shoes on her feet and yellow stockings like the women of marseilles 
 mademoiselle gown was cut on the patterns of with a short waist a narrow skirt puffed sleeves with flaps and buttons she concealed her gray hair under a frizzed wig known as the baby wig madame magloire had an intelligent vivacious and kindly air the two corners of her mouth unequally raised and her upper lip which was larger than the lower imparted to her a rather crabbed and imperious look 
 so long as monseigneur held his peace she talked to him resolutely with a mixture of respect and freedom but as soon as monseigneur began to speak as we have seen she obeyed passively like her mistress 
 mademoiselle baptistine did not even speak 
 she confined herself to obeying and pleasing him she had never been pretty even when she was young she had large blue prominent eyes and a long arched nose but her whole visage her whole person breathed forth an ineffable goodness as we stated in the beginning 
 she had always been predestined to gentleness but faith charity hope those three virtues which mildly warm the soul had gradually elevated that gentleness to sanctity 
 nature had made her a lamb religion had made her an angel 
 poor sainted virgin sweet memory which has vanished 
 mademoiselle baptistine has so often narrated what passed at the episcopal residence that evening that there are many people now living who still recall the most minute details 
 at the moment when the bishop entered madame magloire was talking with considerable vivacity 
 she was haranguing mademoiselle baptistine on a subject which was familiar to her and to which the bishop was also accustomed 
 the question concerned the lock upon the entrance door 
 it appears that while procuring some provisions for supper madame magloire had heard things in divers places 
 people had spoken of a prowler of evil appearance a suspicious vagabond had arrived who must be somewhere about the town and those who should take it into their heads to return home late that night might be subjected to unpleasant encounters 
 the police was very badly organized moreover because there was no love lost between the prefect and the mayor who sought to injure each other by making things happen it behooved wise people to play the part of their own police and to guard themselves well and care must be taken to duly close bar and barricade their houses and to fasten the doors well 
 madame magloire emphasized these last words but the bishop had just come from his room where it was rather cold 
 he seated himself in front of the fire and warmed himself and then fell to thinking of other things 
 he did not take up the remark dropped with design by madame magloire 
 she repeated it 
 then mademoiselle baptistine desirous of satisfying madame magloire without displeasing her brother ventured to say timidly 
 did you hear what madame magloire is saying brother 
 i have heard something of it in a vague way replied the bishop then in his chair placing his hands on his knees and raising towards the old servant woman his cordial face which so easily grew joyous and which was illuminated from below by the what is the matter 
 what is the matter are we in any great danger 
 then madame magloire began the whole story afresh exaggerating it a little without being aware of the fact 
 it appeared that a bohemian a vagabond a sort of dangerous mendicant was at that moment in the town 
 he had presented himself at jacquin to obtain lodgings but the latter had not been willing to take him in 
 he had been seen to arrive by the way of the boulevard gassendi and roam about the streets in the gloaming a with a terrible face 
 really said the bishop 
 this willingness to interrogate encouraged madame magloire it seemed to her to indicate that the bishop was on the point of becoming alarmed she pursued triumphantly 
 yes monseigneur 
 that is how it is 
 there will be some sort of catastrophe in this town every one says so 
 and withal the police is so badly regulated a useful repetition the idea of living in a mountainous country and not even having lights in the streets at night 
 one goes out 
 black as ovens indeed and i say monseigneur and mademoiselle there says with me 
 i interrupted his sister say nothing 
 what my brother does is well done 
 madame magloire continued as though there had been no protest 
 we say that this house is not safe at all that if monseigneur will permit i will go and tell paulin musebois the locksmith to come and replace the ancient locks on the doors we have them and it is only the work of a moment for i say that nothing is more terrible than a door which can be opened from the outside with a latch by the first and i say that we need bolts monseigneur if only for this night moreover monseigneur has the habit of always saying come in and besides even in the middle of the night o mon dieu there is no need to ask permission 
 at that moment there came a tolerably violent knock on the door 
 come in said the bishop

 the empire strikes back 
 iii 
 
 stood just outside the entrance to the secret rebel ice hangar dustedwith a layer of snow that had settled over his body his inner timingmechanisms knew he had waited here a long time and his optical sensor told him thatthe sky was dark 
 but the r unit was concerned only with his that were stillsending signals across the ice fields his long and earnest for themissing luke skywalker and han solo had not turned up a thing 
 the stout droid began beeping nervously when threepio approached stiffly through the snow 
 artoo the robot inclined the upper half of his form at the hipjoints nothing more you can do you must come inside threepiostraightened to his full height again simulating a human shiver as the night windshowled past his gleaming hull artoo my joints are freezing up will youhurryplease but before he could finish his own sentence threepio washurrying back toward the hangar entrance 
 sky was then entirely black with night and princess leia organa stoodinside the rebel base entrance maintaining a worried vigil she shivered in thenight wind as she tried to see into the hoth darkness waiting near a deeplyconcerned major derlin her mind was somewhere out on the ice fields 
 the giant wookiee sat nearby his maned head lifting quickly from his hairyhands as the two droids threepio and artoo reentered the hangar 
 threepio was humanly distraught artoo has not been able to pick up anysignals he reported fretting although he feels his range is probably too limited tocause us to give up hope still very little confidence could be detected artificial voice 
 leia gave the taller droid a nod of acknowledgment but did not speak herthoughts were occupied with the pair of missing heroes most disturbing to her wasthat she found her mind focused on one of the two a corellian whosewords were not always to be taken literally 
 as the princess kept watch major derlin turned to acknowledge a rebellieutenant reporting in all patrols are now in except solo and skywalker sir 
 the major looked over at princess leia your highness he said his voiceweighty with regret nothing more can be done tonight the temperature isdropping fast the shield doors must be closed sorry derlin waited amoment then addressed the lieutenant close the doors 
 the rebel officer turned to carry out order and immediately thechamber of ice seemed to drop even more in temperature as the mournful wookieehowled his grief 
 the speeders should be ready in the morning the major said to make the search easier 
 not really expecting an affirmative reply leia asked is there any chance oftheir surviving until the morning 
 slim major derlin answered with grim honesty but yes a chance 
 in response to the words artoo began to operate the miniaturecomputers inside his metal body taking only moments to juggle numeroussets of mathematical computations and climaxing his figurings with a series oftriumphant beeps 
 threepio interpreted artoo says the chances against survival areseven hundred to one then tilting toward the shorter robot theprotocol droid grumbled actually i think we needed to know that 
 no one responded to translation for several prolonged momentsthere was a solemn silence broken only by the echoing clang of metal slammingagainst metal the huge doors of the rebel base were closed for the night it was asif some heartless deity had officially severed the assembled group from the two menout on the ice plains and had with a metallic bang announced their deaths 
 chewbacca led out another suffering howl 
 and a silent prayer often spoken on an erstwhile world called alderaan creptinto thoughts 
 the sun that was creeping over northern horizon was relatively dim butits light was enough to shed some warmth on the icy surface the lightcrawled across the rolling hills of snow fought to reach the darker recesses of the icygorges then finally came to rest on what must have been the only perfect whitemound on the entire world 
 so perfect was the mound that it must have owed its existence tosome power other than nature then as the sky grew steadily brighter this moundbegan to hum anyone observing the mound now would have been startled as thesnow dome seemed to erupt sending its snowy outer covering skyward in a greatburst of white particles a droning machine began pulling back its retractable sensorarms and its awesome bulks slowly rose from its frozen white bed 
 the probe robot paused briefly in the windy air then continued on its morningmission across the plains 
 something else had invaded the morning air of the ice relatively craft with dark cockpit windows and laser guns mounted on each rebel snowspeeder was heavily armored and designed for warfare near surface but this morning the small craft was on a reconnaissance above the expansive white landscape and arcing over the contours of thesnowdrifts 
 although the snowspeeder was designed for a crew zev was the occupant his eyes took in a panoramic scan of the desolate stretches he prayed that he would find the objects of his search before he went 
 presently he heard a low beeping signal 
 echo base he shouted jubilantly into his cockpit comlink got much but it could be a sign of life sector by closing in 
 frantically working the controls of his ship zev reduced its speed slightly andbanked the craft over a snowdrift he welcomed the sudden pressing himagainst his seat and headed the snowspeeder in the direction of the faint signal 
 as the white infinity of terrain streaked under him the rebel pilotswitched his comlink to a new frequency echo three this is rogue two doyou copy commander skywalker this is rogue two 
 the only reply that came through his comlink receiver was static 
 but then he heard a voice a very voice fighting its waythrough the crackling noise nice of you guys to drop by hope we get youup too early 
 zev welcomed the characteristic cynicism in han voice he switched histransmitter back to the hidden rebel base echo base this is rogue two hereported his voice suddenly rising in pitch i found them repeat 
 as he spoke the pilot pulled in a fix on the signals winking on hiscockpit monitor screens then he further reduced the speed of his craft bringing itdown close enough to the surface so that he could better see a small objectstanding out against the fleecy plains 
 the object a portable shelter sat atop a snowdrift on the side was a layer of white and resting gingerly against theupper part of the snowdrift was a makeshift radio antenna 
 but a more welcome sight than any of this was the familiar human figurestanding in front of the snow shelter frantically waving his arms at the snowspeeder 
 as zev dipped his craft for a landing he felt overwhelmingly grateful that atleast one of the warriors he had been sent out to find was still alive 
 only a thick glass window separated the battered body of lukeskywalker from four of his watchful friends 
 han solo who appreciated the relative warmth of the rebel medical center wasstanding beside leia his wookiee copilot and hanexhaled with relief he knew that despite the grim atmosphere of the chamberenclosing him the young commander was finally out of danger and in the best ofmechanical hands 
 clad only in white shorts luke hung in a vertical position inside a transparentcylinder with a combination breath mask and microphone covering his nose andmouth the surgeon droid was attending to the youth with the skill ofthe finest humanoid doctors he was aided by his medical assistant droid looked like nothing more than a set of cylinders wires andappendages gracefully the surgeon droid worked a switch that brought a gelatinousred fluid pouring down over his human patient this bacta han knew could workmiracles even with patients in such dire shape as luke 
 as the bubbling slime encapsulated his body luke began to thrash about andrave deliriously watch out he moaned snow to yodaonly hope 
 han had not the slightest idea what his friend was raving about perplexed by the babbling expressed himself with an interrogativewookiee bark 
 he make sense to me either chewie han replied 
 threepio commented hopefully i do hope all there if you take mymeaning it would be most unfortunate if master luke were to develop a shortcircuit 
 the kid ran into something han observed and it justthe cold 
 those creatures he keeps talking about leia said looking at the grimlystaring solo doubled the security han she began tentatively trying tothank him i know how 
 forget it he said brusquely right now he was concerned only with hisfriend in the red bacta fluid 
 body sloshed through the brightly colored substance the healingproperties by now taking effect for a while it appeared as if luke were trying toresist the curative flow of the translucent muck then at last he gave up hismumbling and relaxed succumbing to the powers 
 turned away from the human who had been entrusted to his angled his head to gaze at han and the others through the skywalker has been in but is responding well to thebacta the robot announced his commanding authoritative voice heard distinctlythough the glass he is now out of danger 
 the surgeon words immediately wiped away the tension that had seizedthe group on the other side of the window leia sighed in relief and chewbaccagrunted his approval of treatment 
 luke had no way of estimating how long he had been delirious but now hewas in full command of his mind and senses he sat up on his bed in the rebelmedical center what a relief he thought to be breathing real air again howevercold it might be 
 a medical droid was removing the protective pad from his healing face hiseyes were uncovered and he was beginning to perceive the face of someone standingby his bed gradually threepio smiling image of princess leia came into gracefully moved toward him and gently brushed his hair out of his eyes 
 the bacta are growing well she said as she looked at his healing scars should be gone in a day or so does it still hurt you 
 across the room the door banged open artoo beeped in a cheerful greeting ashe rolled toward luke and threepio clanked noisily toward bed masterluke good to see you functional again 
 thanks threepio 
 artoo emitted a series of happy beeps and whistles 
 artoo expresses his relief also threepio translated helpfully 
 luke was certainly grateful for the robots concern but before he could replyto either of the droids he met with yet another interruption 
 hi kid han solo greeted him boisterously as he and chewbacca burst into themedical center 
 the wookiee growled a friendly greeting 
 you look strong enough to wrestle a gundark han observed 
 luke felt that strong and felt grateful to his friend thanks to you 
 two you owe me junior han gave the princess a wide devilish your worship he said mockingly it looks like you arranged to keep meclose by for a while longer 
 i had nothing to do with it leia said hotly annoyed at rieekan thinks dangerous for any ships to leave the system until thegenerators are operational 
 that makes a good story but i think you just bear to let me out of yoursight 
 i know where you get your delusions laser brains she retorted 
 chewbacca amused by this verbal battle between two of the strongest humanwills he had ever encountered let out a roaring wookiee laugh 
 laugh it up fuzz ball han said you see us alone inthe south passage 
 until now luke had scarcely listened to this lively exchange han and theprincess had argued frequently enough in the past but that reference to the southpassage sparked his curiosity and he looked at leia for an explanation 
 she expressed her true feeling for me han continued delighting in the rosyflush that appeared on the cheeks come on your highness forgotten 
 why you shesputtered in fury 
 he grinned i tell ya sweetheart i hitpretty close to the mark to get you hoppin like this it look that way to 
 yeah he said staring at the princess incredulously it doeskind of 
 leia looked over at luke with a strange mixture of emotions showing on herflushed face something vulnerable almost childlike was reflected in her eyes for amoment and then the tough mask fell again 
 oh it does does it she said well i guess you understand everythingabout women do you 
 luke agreed silently he agreed even more when in the next moment leialeaned over and kissed him firmly on the lips then she turned on her heel andmarched across the room slamming the door behind her everyone in wookiee and at one another speechless 
 in the distance a warning alarm blared through the subterranean corridors 
 general rieekan and his head controller were conferring in the revel commandcenter when han solo and chewbacca burst into the room princess leia andthreepio who had been listening to the general and his officer turned in anticipationat their approach 
 a warning signal blared across the chamber from the huge console locatedbehind rieekan and monitored by rebel control officers 
 general the sensor controller called 
 grimly attentive general rieekan watched the console screens suddenly hesaw a flashing signal that had not been there a moment before princess he think we have a visitor 
 leia han chewbacca and threepio gathered around the general and watchedthe beeping monitor screens 
 picked up something outside the base in zone twelve movingeast said rieekan 
 whatever it is metal the sensor controller observed 
 eyes widened in surprise then it be one of those creatures thatattacked luke 
 could it be ours han asked a speeder 
 the sensor controller shook his head no no signal then came asound from another monitor wait something very weak 
 walking as rapidly as his stiff joints allowed threepio approached the auditory sensors turned in the strange signals i must say sir fluent in oversixty million forms of communication but this is something new must be in a codeor 
 just then the voice of a rebel trooper cut in through the comlinkspeaker this is echo station unidentified object is in our just over the ridge we should have visual contact in about withoutwarning the voice filled with fear what the oh no 
 a burst of radio static followed then the transmission broke off completely 
 han frowned whatever it is he said it friendly have a on chewie 
 even before han and chewbacca were out of the chamber general rieekan haddispatched rogues ten and eleven to station 
 the mammoth imperial star destroyer occupied a position of deadly prominencein the fleet the sleekly elongated ship was larger and even moreominous than the five imperial star destroyers guarding it togetherthese six cruisers were the most dreaded and devastating warships in the of reducing to cosmic scrap anything that stayed too close to their weapons 
 flanking the star destroyers were a number of smaller fighter ships and dartingabout this great space armada were the infamous tie fighters 
 supreme confidence reigned in the heart of every crew member in this imperialdeath squadron especially among the personnel on the monstrous central stardestroyer but something also blazed within their souls of merely thesound of the familiar heavy footsteps as they echoed through the enormous members dreaded these footfalls and shuddered whenever they were heardapproaching brining their much feared but much respected leader 
 towering above them in his black cloak and concealing black headgear darthvader dark lord of sith entered the main control deck and the men around him fellsilent in what seemed to be an endless moment no sound except those from control boards and the loud wheezes coming from the ebony metalbreath screen were to be heard 
 as darth vader watched the endless array of stars captain piett rushed acrossthe wide bridge of the ship carrying a message for the squat admiralozzel who was stationed on the bridge i think found something announced nervously looking from ozzel to the dark lord 
 yes captain the admiral was a supremely confident man who felt relaxedin the presence of his cloaked superior 
 the report we have is only a fragment from a probe droid in the hoth the best lead had in 
 we have had thousands of probe droids searching the galaxy ozzel broke inangrily i want proof not leads i intend to continue to chase around fromone side of 
 abruptly the figure in black approached the two and interrupted you foundsomething he asked his voice somewhat distorted by the breath mask 
 captain piett respectfully gazed at his master who loomed above him like omnipotent god yes sir piett said slowly choosing his words withcaution we have visuals the system is supposed to be devoid of humanforms 
 but vader was no longer listening to the captain his masked face turnedtoward an image beamed on one of the image of a small squadron ofrebel snowspeeders streaking above the white fields

 after anna mikhaylovna had driven off with her son to visit count cyril vladimirovich bezukhov countess rostova sat for a long time all alone applying her handkerchief to her eyes at last she rang 
 what is the matter with you my dear she said crossly to the maid who kept her waiting some minutes you wish to serve me then find you another place 
 the countess was upset by her sorrow and humiliating poverty and was therefore out of sorts a state of mind which with her always found expression in calling her maid my dear and speaking to her with exaggerated politeness 
 i am very sorry answered the maid 
 ask the count to come to me 
 the count came waddling in to see his wife with a rather guilty look as usual 
 well little countess what a saute of game au madere we are to have my dear i tasted it the thousand rubles i paid for taras were not he is worth it 
 he sat down by his wife his elbows on his knees and his hands ruffling his gray hair 
 what are your commands little countess 
 you see my dear that mess she said pointing to his waistcoat the saute most likely she added with a smile well you see count i want some money 
 her face became sad 
 oh little countess and the count began bustling to get out his pocketbook 
 i want a great deal count i want five hundred rubles and taking out her cambric handkerchief she began wiping her waistcoat 
 yes immediately immediately hey there he called out in a tone only used by persons who are certain that those they call will rush to obey the summons send dmitri to me 
 dmitri a man of good family who had been brought up in the house and now managed all his affairs stepped softly into the room 
 this is what i want my dear fellow said the count to the deferential young man who had entered bring me he reflected a moment yes bring me seven hundred rubles yes but mind bring me such tattered and dirty notes as last time but nice clean ones for the countess 
 yes dmitri clean ones please said the countess sighing deeply 
 when would you like them your excellency asked dmitri allow me to inform you but be uneasy he added noticing that the count was beginning to breathe heavily and quickly which was always a sign of approaching anger i was forgetting do you wish it brought at once 
 yes yes just so bring it give it to the countess 
 what a treasure that dmitri is added the count with a smile when the young man had departed there is never any impossible with him a thing i hate everything is possible 
 ah money count money how much sorrow it causes in the world said the countess but i am in great need of this sum 
 you my little countess are a notorious spendthrift said the count and having kissed his hand he went back to his study 
 when anna mikhaylovna returned from count the money all in clean notes was lying ready under a handkerchief on the countess little table and anna mikhaylovna noticed that something was agitating her 
 well my dear asked the countess 
 oh what a terrible state he is in one would not know him he is so ill i was only there a few moments and hardly said a word 
 annette for sake refuse me the countess began with a blush that looked very strange on her thin dignified elderly face and she took the money from under the handkerchief 
 anna mikhaylovna instantly guessed her intention and stooped to be ready to embrace the countess at the appropriate moment 
 this is for boris from me for his outfit 
 anna mikhaylovna was already embracing her and weeping the countess wept too they wept because they were friends and because they were kindhearted and because they friends from childhood had to think about such a base thing as money and because their youth was over but those tears were pleasant to them both

 chapter 
 
 that friday made the last of our fine days for a month in the evening the weather broke the wind shifted from south to northeast and brought rain first and then sleet and snow on the morrow one could hardly imagine that there had been three weeks of summer the primroses and crocuses were hidden under wintry drifts the larks were silent the young leaves of the early trees smitten and blackened and dreary and chill and dismal that morrow did creep over my master kept his room i took possession of the lonely parlour converting it into a nursery and there i was sitting with the moaning doll of a child laid on my knee rocking it to and fro and watching meanwhile the still driving flakes build up the uncurtained window when the door opened and some person entered out of breath and laughing my anger was greater than my astonishment for a minute i supposed it one of the maids and i cried 
 have done how dare you show your giddiness here what would mr linton say if he heard you 
 excuse me answered a familiar voice but i know edgar is in bed and i cannot stop myself 
 with that the speaker came forward to the fire panting and holding her hand to her side 
 i have run the whole way from wuthering heights she continued after a pause except where flown i count the number of falls had oh aching all over be alarmed there shall be an explanation as soon as i can give it only just have the goodness to step out and order the carriage to take me on to gimmerton and tell a servant to seek up a few clothes in my wardrobe 
 the intruder was mrs heathcliff she certainly seemed in no laughing predicament her hair streamed on her shoulders dripping with snow and water she was dressed in the girlish dress she commonly wore befitting her age more than her position a low frock with short sleeves and nothing on either head or neck the frock was of light silk and clung to her with wet and her feet were protected merely by thin slippers add to this a deep cut under one ear which only the cold prevented from bleeding profusely a white face scratched and bruised and a frame hardly able to support itself through fatigue and you may fancy my first fright was not much allayed when i had had leisure to examine her 
 my dear young lady i exclaimed stir nowhere and hear nothing till you have removed every article of your clothes and put on dry things and certainly you shall not go to gimmerton tonight so it is needless to order the carriage 
 certainly i shall she said walking or riding yet no objection to dress myself decently see how it flows down my neck now the fire does make it smart 
 she insisted on my fulfilling her directions before she would let me touch her and not till after the coachman had been instructed to get ready and a maid set to pack up some necessary attire did i obtain her consent for binding the wound and helping to change her garments 
 now ellen she said when my task was finished and she was seated in an easy chair on the hearth with a cup of tea before her you sit down opposite me and put poor baby away i like to see it you think i care little for catherine because i behaved so foolishly on entering cried too more than anyone else has reason to cry we parted unreconciled you remember and i forgive myself but for all that i was not going to sympathize with brute beast oh give me the poker this is the last thing of his i have about me she slipped the gold ring from her third finger and threw it on the floor smash it she continued striking it with childish spite and then burn it and she took and dropped the misused article among the coals there he shall buy another if he gets me back again be capable of coming to seek me to tease edgar i dare not stay lest that notion should possess his wicked head and besides edgar has not been kind has he and i come suing for his assistance nor will i bring him into more trouble necessity compelled me to seek shelter here though if i had not learned he was out of the way have halted at the kitchen washed my face warmed myself got you to bring what i wanted and departed again to anywhere out of the reach of my that incarnate goblin ah he was in such a fury if he had caught me a pity earnshaw is not his match in strength i have run till seen him all but demolished had hindley been able to do it 
 well talk so fast miss i interrupted disorder the handkerchief i have tied round your face and make the cut bleed again drink your tea and take breath and give over laughing laughter is sadly out of place under this roof and in your condition 
 an undeniable truth she replied listen to that child it maintains a constant it out of my hearing for an hour i stay any longer 
 i rang the bell and committed it to a care and then i inquired what had urged her to escape from wuthering heights in such an unlikely plight and where she meant to go as she refused remaining with us 
 i ought and i wish to remain answered she to cheer edgar and take care of the baby for two things and because the grange is my right home but i bell you he let me do you think he could bear to see me grow fat and merry and could bear to think that we were tranquil and not resolve on poisoning our comfort now i have the satisfaction of being sure that he detests me to the point of its annoying him seriously to have me within earshot or eyesight i notice when i enter his presence the muscles of his countenance are involuntarily distorted into an expression of hatred partly arising from his knowledge of the good causes i have to feel that sentiment for him and partly from original aversion it is strong enough to make me feel pretty certain that he would not chase me over england supposing i contrived a clear escape and therefore i must get quite away recovered from my first desire to be killed by him rather kill himself he has extinguished my love effectually and so at my ease i can recollect yet how i loved him and can dimly imagine that i could still be loving him no even if he had doted on me the devilish nature would have revealed its existence somehow catherine had an awfully perverted taste to esteem him so dearly knowing him so well monster would that he could be blotted out of creation and out of my memory 
 hush hush a human being i said be more charitable there are worse men than he is yet 
 not a human being she retorted and he has no claim on my charity i gave him my heart and he took and pinched it to death and flung it back to me people feel with their hearts ellen and since he has destroyed mine i have not power to feel for him and i would not though he groaned from this to his dying day and wept tears of blood for catherine no indeed indeed i and here isabella began to cry but immediately dashing the water from her lashes she recommenced you asked what has driven me to flight at last i was compelled to attempt it because i had succeeded in rousing his rage a pitch above his malignity pulling out the nerves with pincers requires more coolness than knocking on the head he was worked up to forget the fiendish prudence he boasted of and proceeded to murderous violence i experienced pleasure in being able to exasperate him the sense of pleasure woke my instinct of so i fairly broke free and if ever i come into his hands again he is welcome to a signal revenge 
 yesterday you know mr earnshaw should have been at the funeral he kept himself sober for the sober not going to bed mad at six and getting up drunk at twelve consequently he rose in suicidal low spirits as fit for the church as for a dance and instead he sat down by the fire and swallowed gin or brandy by tumblerfuls 
 shudder to name him has been a stranger in the house from last sunday till today whether the angels have fed him or his kin beneath i cannot tell but he has not eaten a meal with us for nearly a week he has just come home at dawn and gone upstairs to his chamber locking himself if anybody dreamt of coveting his company there he has continued praying like a methodist only the deity he implored in senseless dust and ashes and god when addressed was curiously confounded with his own black father after concluding these precious they lasted generally till he grew hoarse and his voice was strangled in his would be off again always straight down to the grange edgar did not send for a constable and give him into custody for me grieved as i was about catherine it was impossible to avoid regarding this season of deliverance from degrading oppression as a holiday 
 i recovered spirits sufficient to hear eternal lectures without weeping and to move up and down the house less with the foot of a frightened thief than formerly you think that i should cry at anything joseph could say but he and hareton are detestable companions rather sit with hindley and hear his awful talk than with t little maister and his staunch supporter that odious old man when heathcliff is in often obliged to seek the kitchen and their society or starve among the damp uninhabited chambers when he is not as was the case this week i establish a table and chair at one comer of the house fire and never mind how mr earnshaw may occupy himself and he does not interfere with my arrangements he is quieter now than he used to be if no one provokes him more sullen and depressed and less furious joseph affirms sure an altered man that the lord has touched his heart and he is saved so as by fire puzzled to detect signs of the favourable change but it is not my business 
 i sat in my nook reading some old books till late on towards twelve it seemed so dismal to go upstairs with the wild snow blowing outside and my thoughts continually reverting to the kirkyard and the grave i dared hardly lift my eyes from the page before me that melancholy scene so instantly usurped its place hindley sat opposite his head leant on his hand perhaps meditating on the same subject he had ceased drinking at a point below irrationality and had neither stirred nor spoken during two or three hours there was no sound through the house but the moaning wind which shook the windows every now and then the faint crackling of the coals and the click of my snuffers as i removed at intervals the long wick of the candle hareton and joseph were probably fast asleep in bed it was very very sad and while i read i sighed for it seemed as if all joy had vanished from the world never to be restored 
 the doleful silence was broken at length by the sound of the kitchen latch heathcliff had returned from his watch earlier than usual owing i suppose to the sudden storm that entrance was fastened and we beard him coming round to get in by the other i rose with an irrepressible expression of what i felt on my lips which induced my companion who had been staring towards the door to turn and look at me 
 keep him out five minutes he exclaimed you object 
 no you may keep him out the whole night for me i answered do put the key in the lock and draw the bolts 
 earnshaw accomplished this ere his guest reached the front he then came and brought his chair to the other side of my table leaning over it and searching in my eyes a sympathy with the burning hate that gleamed from his as he both looked and felt like an assassin he exactly find that but he discovered enough to encourage him to speak 
 you and i he said have each a great debt to settle with the man out yonder if we were neither of us cowards we might combine to discharge it are you as soft as your brother are you willing to endure to the last and not once attempt a repayment 
 weary of enduring now i replied and be glad of a retaliation that recoil on myself but treachery and violence are spears pointed at both ends they wound those who resort to them worse than their enemies 
 treachery and violence are a just return for treachery and violence cried hindley mrs heathcliff ask you to do nothing but sit still and be dumb tell me now can you sure you would have as much pleasure as i in witnessing the conclusion of the existence be your death unless you overreach him and be my ruin damn the hellish villain he knocks at the door as if he were master here already promise to hold your tongue and before that clock wants three minutes of a free woman 
 he took the implements which i described to you in my letter from his breast and would have turned down the candle i snatched it away however and seized his arm 
 not hold my tongue i said you touch him let the door remain shut and be quiet 
 no formed my resolution and by god execute it cried the desperate being do you a kindness in spite of yourself and hareton justice and you trouble your head to screen me catherine is gone nobody alive would regret me or be ashamed though i cut my throat this time to make an end 
 i might as well have struggled with a bear or reasoned with a lunatic the only resource left me was to run to a lattice and warn his intended victim of the fate which awaited him 
 better seek shelter somewhere else tonight i exclaimed in a rather triumphant tone mr earnshaw has a mind to shoot you if you persist in endeavouring to enter 
 better open the door answered addressing me by some elegant term that i care to repeat 
 i shall not meddle in the matter i retorted again come in and get shot if you please done my duty 
 with that i shut the window and returned to my place by the fire having too small a stock of hypocrisy at my command to pretend any anxiety for the danger that menaced him earnshaw swore passionately at me affirming that i loved the villain yet and calling me all sorts of names for the base spirit i evinced and i in my secret heart and conscience never reproached me thought what a blessing it would be for him should heathcliff put him out of misery and what a blessing for me should he send heathcliff to his right abode as i sat nursing these reflections the casement behind me was banged on to the floor by a blow from the latter individual and his black countenance liked blightingly through the stanchions stood too close to suffer his shoulders to follow and i smiled exulting in my fancied security his hair and clothes were whitened with snow and his sharp cannibal teeth revealed by cold and wrath gleamed through the dark 
 isabella let me in or make you repent he girned as joseph calls it 
 i cannot commit murder i replied mr hindley stands sentinel with a knife and loaded pistol 
 let me in by the kitchen door he said 
 hindley will be there before you i answered and a poor love of yours that cannot bear a shower of snow we were left at peace on our beds as long as the summer moon shone but the moment a blast of winter returns you must run for shelter heathcliff if i were you go stretch myself over her grave and die like a faithful dog the world is surely not worth living in now is it you had distinctly impressed on me the idea that catherine was the whole joy of your life i imagine how you think of surviving her loss 
 there is he exclaimed my companion rushing to the gap if i can get my arm out i can hit him 
 afraid ellen set me down as really wicked but you know all so judge i have aided or abetted an attempt on even his life for anything wish that he were dead i must and therefore i was fearfully disappointed and unnerved by terror for the consequences of my taunting speech when he flung himself on weapon and wrenched it from his grasp 
 the and the knife in springing back closed into its owners wrist heathcliff pulled it away by main force slitting up the flesh as it passed on and thrust it dripping into his pocket he then took a stone struck down the division between two windows and sprang in his adversary had fallen senseless with excessive pain and the flow of blood that gushed from an artery or a large vein the ruffian kicked and trampled on him and dashed his head repeatedly against the flags holding me with one hand meantime to prevent me summoning joseph he exerted preterhuman in abstaining from finishing him completely but getting out of breath he finally desisted and dragged the apparently inanimate body on to the settle there he tore off the sleeve of coat and bound up the wound with brutal roughness spitting and cursing during the operation as energetically as he had kicked before being at liberty i lost no time in seeking the old servant who having gathered by degrees the purport of my hasty tale hurried below gasping as he descended the steps two at once 
 what is there to do now what is there to do now 
 this to do thundered heathcliff that your mad and should he last another month have him to an asylum and how the devil did you come to fasten me out you toothless hound stand muttering and mumbling there come not going to nurse him wash that stuff away and mind the sparks of your is more than half brandy 
 and so been murthering on him exclaimed joseph lifting his hands and eyes in horror if iver i seed a seeght loike this may the lord 
 heathcliff gave him a push on to his knees in the middle of the blood and flung a towel to him but instead of proceeding to dry it up he joined his hands and began a prayer which excited my laughter from its odd phraseology i was in the condition of mind to be shocked at nothing in fact i was as reckless as some malefactors show themselves at the foot of the gallows 
 oh i forgot you said the tyrant you shall do that down with you and you conspire with him against me do you viper there that is work fit for you 
 he shook me till my teeth rattled and pitched me beside joseph who steadily concluded his supplications and then rose vowing he would set off for the grange directly mr linton was a magistrate and though he had fifty wives dead he should inquire into this he was so obstinate in his resolution that heathcliff deemed it expedient to compel from my lips a recapitulation of what had taken place standing over me heaving with malevolence as i reluctantly delivered the account in answer to his questions it required a great deal of labour to satisfy the old man that heathcliff was not the aggressor especially with my hardly wrung replies however mr earnshaw soon convinced him that he was alive still joseph hastened to administer a dose of spirits and by their succour his master presently regained motion and consciousness heathcliff aware that his opponent was ignorant of the treatment received while insensible called him deliriously intoxicated and said he should not notice his atrocious conduct further but advised him to get to bed to my joy he left us after giving this judicious counsel and hindley stretched himself on the hearthstone i departed to my own room marvelling that i had escaped so easily 
 this morning when i came down about half an hour before noon mr earnshaw was sitting by the fire deadly sick his evil genius almost as gaunt and ghastly leant against the chimney neither appeared inclined to dine and having waited till all was cold on the table i commenced alone nothing hindered me from eating heartily and i experienced a certain sense of satisfaction and superiority as at intervals i cast a look towards my silent companions and felt the comfort of a quiet conscience within me after i had done i ventured on the unusual liberty of drawing near the fire going round seat and kneeling in the corner beside him 
 heathcliff did not glance my way and i gazed up and contemplated his features almost as confidently as if they had been turned to stone his forehead that i once thought so manly and that i now think so diabolical was shaded with a heavy cloud his basilisk eyes were nearly quenched by sleeplessness and weeping perhaps for the lashes were wet then his lips devoid of their ferocious sneer and sealed in an expression of unspeakable sadness had it been another i would have covered my face in the presence of such grief in his case i was gratified and ignoble as it seems to insult a fallen enemy i miss this chance of sticking in a dart his weakness was the only time when i could taste the delight of paying wrong for wrong 
 fie fie miss i interrupted one might suppose you had never opened a bible in your life if god afflict your enemies surely that ought to suffice you it is both mean and presumptuous to add your torture to his 
 in general allow that it would be ellen she continued but what misery laid on heathcliff could content me unless i have a hand in it rather he suffered less if i might cause his sufferings and he might know that i was the cause o i owe him so much on only one condition can i hope to forgive him it is if i may take an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth for every wrench of agony return a wrench reduce him to my level as he was the first to injure make him the first to implore pardon and then ellen i might show you some generosity but it is utterly impossible i can ever be revenged and therefore i cannot forgive him hindley wanted some water and i handed him a glass and asked him how he was 
 not as ill as i wish he replied but leaving out my arm every inch of me is as sore as if i had been fighting with a legion of imps 
 yes no wonder was my next remark catherine used to boast that she stood between you and bodily harm she meant that certain persons would not hurt you for fear of offending her well people really rise from their grave or last night she might have witnessed a repulsive scene are not you bruised and cut over your chest and shoulders 
 i say he answered but what do you mean did he dare to strike me when i was down 
 he trampled on you and kicked you and dashed you on the ground i whispered and his mouth watered to tear you with his teeth because only half a so much 
 mr earnshaw looked up like me to the countenance of our mutual foe who absorbed in his anguish seemed insensible to anything around him the longer he stood the plainer his reflections revealed their blackness through his features 
 oh if god would but give me strength to strangle him in my last agony go to hell with joy groaned the impatient man writhing to rise and sinking back in despair convinced of his inadequacy for the struggle 
 nay enough that he has murdered one of you i observed aloud at the grange everyone knows your sister would have been living now had it not been for mr heathcliff after all it is preferable to be hated than loved by him when i recollect how happy we happy catherine was before he fit to curse the day 
 most likely heathcliff noticed more the truth of what was said than the spirit of the person who said it his attention was roused i saw for his eyes rained down tears among the ashes and he drew his breath in suffocating sighs i stared full at him and laughed scornfully the clouded windows of hell flashed a moment towards me the fiend which usually looked out however was so dimmed and drowned that i did not fear to hazard another sound of derision 
 get up and begone out of my sight said the mourner 
 i guessed he uttered those words at least though his voice was hardly intelligible 
 i beg your pardon i replied but i loved catherine too and her brother requires attendance which for her sake i shall supply now that dead i see her in hindley hindley has exactly her eyes if you had not tried to gouge them out and made them black and red and her 
 get up wretched idiot before i stamp you to death he cried making a movement that caused me to make one also 
 but then i continued holding myself ready to flee if poor catherine had trusted you and assumed the ridiculous contemptible degrading title of mrs heathcliff she would soon have presented a similar picture she have borne your abominable behaviour quietly her detestation and disgust must have found voice 
 the back of the settle and person interposed between me and him so instead of endeavouring to reach me he snatched a dinner knife from the table and flung it at my head it struck beneath my ear and stopped the sentence i was uttering but pulling it out i sprang to the door and delivered another which i hope went a little deeper than his missile the last glimpse i caught of him was a furious rush on his part checked by the embrace of his host and both fell locked together on the hearth in my flight through the kitchen i bid joseph speed to his master i knocked over hareton who was hanging a litter of puppies from a chair back in the doorway and blest as a soul escaped from purgatory i bounded leaped and flew down the steep road then quitting its windings shot direct across the moor rolling over banks and wading through marshes precipitating myself in fact towards the beacon light of the grange and far rather would i be condemned to a perpetual dwelling in the infernal regions than even for one night abide beneath the roof of wuthering heights again 
 isabella ceased speaking and took a drink of tea then she rose and bidding me put on her bonnet and a great shawl i had brought and turning a deaf ear to my entreaties for her to remain another hour she stepped on to a chair kissed and portraits bestowed a similar salute on me and descended to the carriage accompanied by fanny who yelped wild with joy at recovering her mistress she was driven away never to revisit the neighbourhood but a regular correspondence was established between her and my master when things were more settled i believe her new abode was in the south near london there she had a son born a few months subsequent to her escape he was christened linton and from the first she reported him to be an ailing peevish creature 
 mr heathcliff meeting me one day in the village inquired where she lived i refused to tell he remarked that it was not of any moment only she must beware of coming to her brother she should not be with him if he had to keep her himself though i would give no information he discovered through some of the other servants both her place of residence and the existence of the child still he molest her for which forbearance she might thank his aversion i suppose he often asked about the infant when he saw me and on hearing its name smiled grimly and observed 
 they wish me to hate it too do they 
 i think they wish you to know anything about it i answered 
 but have it he said when i want it they may reckon on that 
 fortunately its mother died before the time arrived some thirteen years after the decease of catherine when linton was twelve or a little more 
 on the day succeeding unexpected visit i had no opportunity of speaking to my master he shunned conversation and was fit for discussing nothing when i could get him to listen i saw it pleased him that his sister had left her husband whom he abhorred with an intensity which the mildness of his nature would scarcely seem to allow so deep and sensitive was his aversion that he refrained from going anywhere where he was likely to see or hear of heathcliff grief and that together transformed him into a complete hermit he threw up his office of magistrate ceased even to attend church avoided the village on all occasions and spent a life of entire seclusion within the limits of his park and grounds only varied by solitary rambles on the moors and visits to the grave of his wife mostly at evening or early morning before other wanderers were abroad but he was too good to be thoroughly unhappy long he pray for soul to haunt him time brought resignation and a melancholy sweeter than common joy he recalled her memory with ardent tender love and hopeful aspiring to the better world where he doubted not she was gone 
 and he had earthly consolation and affections also for a few days i said he seemed regardless of the puny successor to the departed the coldness melted as fast as snow in april and ere the tiny thing could stammer a word or totter a step it wielded a sceptre in his heart it was named catherine but he never called it the name in full as he had never called the first catherine short probably because heathcliff had a habit of doing so the little one was always cathy it formed to him a distinction from the mother and yet a connection with her and his attachment sprang from its relation to her far more than from its being his own 
 i used to draw a comparison between him and hindley earnshaw and perplex myself to explain satisfactorily why their conduct was so opposite in similar circumstances they had both been fond husbands and were both attached to their children and i could not see how they both have taken the same road for good or evil but i thought in my mind hindley with apparently the stronger head has shown himself sadly the worse and the weaker man when his ship struck the captain abandoned his post and the crew instead of trying to save her rushed into riot and confusion leaving no hope for their luckless vessel linton on the contrary displayed the true courage of a loyal and faithful soul he trusted god and god comforted him one hoped and the other despaired they chose their own lots and were righteously doomed to endure them but not want to hear my moralizing mr lockwood judge as well as i can all these things at least think you will and the same the end of earnshaw was what might have been expected it followed fast on his there was scarcely six months between them we at the grange never got a very succinct account of his state preceding it all that i did learn was on occasion of going to aid in the preparations for the funeral mr kenneth came to announce the event to my master 
 well nelly said he riding into the yard one morning too early not to alarm me with an instant presentiment of bad news yours and my turn to go into mourning at present given us the slip now do you think 
 who i asked in a flurry 
 why guess he returned dismounting and slinging his bridle on a hook by the door and nip up the corner of your apron certain need it 
 not mr heathcliff surely i exclaimed 
 what would you have tears for him said the doctor no a tough young fellow he looks blooming today just seen him rapidly regaining flesh since he lost his better half 
 who is it then mr kenneth i repeated impatiently 
 hindley earnshaw your old friend hindley he replied and my wicked gossip though been too wild for me this long while there i said we should draw water but cheer up he died true to his character drunk as a lord poor lad sorry too one help missing an old companion though he had the worst tricks with him that ever man imagined and has done me many a rascally turn barely it seems your own age who would have thought you were born in one year 
 i confess this blow was greater to me than the shock of mrs death ancient associations lingered round my heart i sat down in the porch and wept as for a blood relation desiring kenneth to get another servant to introduce him to the master i could not hinder myself from pondering on the he had fair play whatever i did that idea would bother me it was so tiresomely pertinacious that i resolved on requesting leave to go to wuthering heights and assist in the last duties to the dead mr linton was extremely reluctant to consent but i pleaded eloquently for the friendless condition in which he lay and i said my old master and had a claim on my services as strong as his own besides i reminded him that the child hareton was his nephew and in the absence of nearer kin he ought to act as its guardian and he ought to and must inquire how the property was left and look over the concerns of his he was unfit for attending to such matters then but he bid me speak to his lawyer and at length permitted me to go his lawyer had been also i called at the village and asked him to accompany me he shook his head and advised that heathcliff should be let alone affirming if the truth were known hareton would be found little else than a beggar 
 his father died in debt he said the whole property is mortgaged and the sole chance for the natural heir is to allow him an opportunity of creating some interest in the heart that he may be inclined to deal leniently towards him 
 when i reached the heights i explained that i had come to see everything carried on decently and joseph who appeared in sufficient distress expressed satisfaction at my presence mr heathcliff said he did not perceive that i was wanted but i might stay and order the arrangements for the funeral if i chose 
 correctly he remarked that body should be buried at the crossroads without ceremony of any kind i happened to leave him ten minutes yesterday afternoon and in that interval he fastened the two doors of the house against me and he has spent the night in drinking himself to death deliberately we broke in this morning for we heard him snorting like a horse and there he was laid over the settle flaying and scalping would not have wakened him i sent for kenneth and he came but not till the beast had changed into carrion he was both dead and cold and stark and so allow it was useless making more stir about him 
 the old servant confirmed this statement but muttered 
 rayther goan hisseln fur t doctor aw sud uh taen tent uh t maister better nur he deead when aw left nowt uh t soart 
 i insisted on the funeral being respectable mr heathcliff said i might have my own way there too only he desired me to remember that the money for the whole affair came out of his pocket he maintained a hard careless deportment indicative of neither joy nor sorrow if anything it expressed a flinty gratification at a piece of difficult work successfully executed i observed once indeed something like exultation in his aspect it was just when the people were bearing the coffin from the house he had the hypocrisy to represent a mourner and previous to following with hareton he lifted the unfortunate child on to the table and muttered with peculiar gusto now my bonny lad you are mine and see if one tree grow as crooked as another with the same wind to twist it the unsuspecting thing was pleased at this speech he played with whiskers and stroked his cheek but i divined its meaning and observed tartly that boy must go back with me to thrushcross grange sir there is nothing in the world less yours than he is 
 does linton say so he demanded 
 of has ordered me to take him i replied 
 well said the scoundrel not argue the subject now but i have a fancy to try my hand at rearing a young one so intimate to your master that i must supply the place of this with my own if he attempt to remove it i engage to let hareton go undisputed but be pretty sure to make the other come remember to tell him 
 this hint was enough to bind our hands i repeated its substance on my return and edgar linton little interested at the commencement spoke no more of interfering not aware that he could have done it to any purpose had he been ever so willing 
 the guest was now the master of wuthering heights he held firm possession and proved to the in his turn proved it to mr earnshaw had mortgaged every yard of land he owned for cash to supply his mania for gaming and he heathcliff was the mortgagee in that manner hareton who should now be the first gentleman in the neighbourhood was reduced to a state of complete dependence on his inveterate enemy and lives in his own house as a servant deprived of the advantage of wages and quite unable to right himself because of his friendlessness and his ignorance that he has been wronged

 chapter seventeen 
 
 for a week the amount of virtue in the old house would have supplied the neighborhood it was really amazing for everyone seemed in a heavenly frame of mind and was all the fashion relieved of their first anxiety about their father girls insensibly relaxed their praiseworthy efforts a little and began to fall back into old ways they did not forget their motto but hoping and keeping busy seemed to grow easier and after such tremendous exertions they felt that endeavor deserved a holiday and gave it a good many 
 jo caught a bad cold through neglect to cover the shorn head enough and was ordered to stay at home till she was better for aunt march like to hear people read with colds in their heads jo liked this and after an energetic rummage from garret to cellar subsided on the sofa to nurse her cold with arsenicum and books amy found that housework and art did not go well together and returned to her mud pies meg went daily to her pupils and sewed or thought she did at home but much time was spent in writing long letters to her mother or reading the washington dispatches over and over beth kept on with only slight relapses into idleness or grieving 
 all the little duties were faithfully done each day and many of her sisters also for they were forgetful and the house seemed like a clock whose pendulum was gone when her heart got heavy with longings for mother or fears for father she went away into a certain closet hid her face in the folds of a dear old gown and made her little moan and prayed her little prayer quietly by herself nobody knew what cheered her up after a sober fit but everyone felt how sweet and helpful beth was and fell into a way of going to her for comfort or advice in their small affairs 
 all were unconscious that this experience was a test of character and when the first excitement was over felt that they had done well and deserved praise so they did but their mistake was in ceasing to do well and they learned this lesson through much anxiety and regret 
 meg i wish go and see the hummels you know mother told us not to forget them said beth ten days after mrs departure 
 too tired to go this afternoon meg rocking comfortably as she sewed 
 you jo asked beth 
 too stormy for me with my cold 
 i thought it was almost well 
 well enough for me to go out with laurie but not well enough to go to the hummels said jo laughing but looking a little ashamed of her inconsistency 
 why you go yourself asked meg 
 i have been every day but the baby is sick and i know what to do for it mrs hummel goes away to work and lottchen takes care of it but it gets sicker and sicker and i think you or hannah ought to go 
 beth spoke earnestly and meg promised she would go tomorrow 
 ask hannah for some nice little mess and take it round beth the air will do you good said jo adding apologetically go but i want to finish my writing 
 my head aches and tired so i thought maybe some of you would go said beth 
 amy will be in presently and she will run down for us suggested meg 
 so beth lay down on the sofa the others returned to their work and the hummels were forgotten an hour passed amy did not come meg went to her room to try on a new dress jo was absorbed in her story and hannah was sound asleep before the kitchen fire when beth quietly put on her hood filled her basket with odds and ends for the poor children and went out into the chilly air with a heavy head and a grieved look in her patient eyes it was late when she came back and no one saw her creep upstairs and shut herself into her room half an hour after jo went to closet for something and there found little beth sitting on the medicine chest looking very grave with red eyes and a camphor bottle in her hand 
 christopher columbus the matter cried jo as beth put out her hand as if to warn her off and asked quickly had the scarlet fever you 
 years ago when meg did why 
 then tell you oh jo the dead 
 what baby 
 mrs it died in my lap before she got home cried beth with a sob 
 my poor dear how dreadful for you i ought to have gone said jo taking her sister in her arms as she sat down in her bit chair with a remorseful face 
 it dreadful jo only so sad i saw in a minute it was sicker but lottchen said her mother had gone for a doctor so i took baby and let lotty rest it seemed asleep but all of a sudden if gave a little cry and trembled and then lay very still i tried to warm its feet and lotty gave it some milk but it stir and i knew it was dead 
 cry dear what did you do 
 i just sat and held it softly till mrs hummel came with the doctor he said it was dead and looked at heinrich and minna who have sore throats scarlet fever ought to have called me before he said crossly mrs hummel told him she was poor and had tried to cure baby herself but now it was too late and she could only ask him to help the others and trust to charity for his pay he smiled then and was kinder but it was very sad and i cried with them till he turned round all of a sudden and told me to go home and take belladonna right away or have the fever 
 no you cried jo hugging her close with a frightened look oh beth if you should be sick i never could forgive myself what shall we do 
 be frightened i guess i have it badly i looked in book and saw that it begins with headache sore throat and queer feelings like mine so i did take some belladonna and i feel better said beth laying her cold hands on her hot forehead and trying to look well 
 if mother was only at home exclaimed jo seizing the book and feeling that washington was an immense way off she read a page looked at beth felt her head peeped into her throat and then said gravely been over the baby every day for more than a week and among the others who are going to have it so afraid you are going to have it beth call hannah she knows all about sickness 
 let amy come she never had it and i should hate to give it to her you and meg have it over again asked beth anxiously 
 i guess not care if i do serve me right selfish pig to let you go and stay writing rubbish myself muttered jo as she went to consult hannah 
 the good soul was wide awake in a minute and took the lead at once assuring that there was no need to worry every one had scarlet fever and if rightly treated nobody died all of which jo believed and felt much relieved as they went up to call meg 
 now tell you what do said hannah when she had examined and questioned beth we will have dr bangs just to take a look at you dear and see that we start right then send amy off to aunt for a spell to keep her out of way and one of you girls can stay at home and amuse beth for a day or two 
 i shall stay of course oldest began meg looking anxious and 
 i shall because my fault she is sick i told mother do the errands and i said jo decidedly 
 which will you have beth there no need of but one aid hannah 
 jo please and beth leaned her head against her sister with a contented look which effectually settled that point 
 go and tell amy said meg feeling a little hurt yet rather relieved on the whole for she did not like nursing and jo did 
 amy rebelled outright and passionately declared that she had rather have the fever than go to aunt march meg reasoned pleaded and commanded all in vain amy protested that she would not go and meg left her in despair to ask hannah what should be done before she came back laurie walked into the parlor to find amy sobbing with her head in the sofa cushions she told her story expecting to be consoled but laurie only put his hands in his pockets and walked about the room whistling softly as he knit his brows in deep thought presently he sat down beside her and said in his most wheedlesome tone now be a sensible little woman and do as they say no cry but hear what a jolly plan got you go to aunt and come and take you out every day driving or walking and have capital times that be better than moping here 
 i wish to be sent off as if i was in the way began amy in an injured voice 
 bless your heart child to keep you well you want to be sick do you 
 no sure i but i dare say i shall be for been with beth all the time 
 the very reason you ought to go away at once so that you may escape it change of air and care will keep you well i dare say or if it does not entirely you will have the fever more lightly i advise you to be off as soon as you can for scarlet fever is no joke miss 
 but dull at aunt and she is so cross said amy looking rather frightened 
 it be dull with me popping in every day to tell you how beth is and take you out gallivanting the old lady likes me and be as sweet as possible to her so she peck at us whatever we do 
 will you take me out in the trotting wagon with puck 
 on my honor as a gentleman 
 and come every single day 
 see if i 
 and bring me back the minute beth is well 
 the identical minute 
 and go to the theater truly 
 a dozen theaters if we may 
 guess i will said amy slowly 
 good girl call meg and tell her give in said laurie with an approving pat which annoyed amy more than in 
 meg and jo came running down to behold the miracle which had been wrought and amy feeling very precious and promised to go if the doctor said beth was going to be ill 
 how is the little dear asked laurie for beth was his especial pet and he felt more anxious about her than he liked to show 
 she is lying down on bed and feels better the death troubled her but i dare say she has only got cold hannah says she thinks so but she looks worried and that makes me fidgety answered meg 
 what a trying world it is said jo rumpling up her hair in a fretful way no sooner do we get out of one trouble than down comes another there seem to be anything to hold on to when gone so all at sea 
 well make a porcupine of yourself it becoming settle your wig jo and tell me if i shall telegraph to your mother or do anything asked laurie who never had been reconciled to the loss of his one beauty 
 that is what troubles me said meg i think we ought to tell her if beth is really ill but hannah says we for mother leave father and it will only make them anxious beth be sick long and hannah knows just what to do and mother said we were to mind her so i suppose we must but it seem quite right to me 
 hum well i say suppose you ask grandfather after the doctor has been 
 we will jo go and get dr bangs at once commanded meg 
 we decide anything till he has been 
 stay where you are jo errand boy to this establishment said laurie taking up his cap 
 afraid you are busy began meg 
 no done my lessons for the day 
 do you study in vacation time asked jo 
 i follow the good example my neighbors set me was answer as he swung himself out of the room 
 i have great hopes for my boy observed jo watching him fly over the fence with an approving smile 
 he does very well for a boy was somewhat ungracious answer for the subject did not interest her 
 dr bangs came said beth had symptoms of the fever but he thought she would have it lightly though he looked sober over the hummel story amy was ordered off at once and provided with something to ward off danger she departed in great state with jo and laurie as escort 
 aunt march received them with her usual hospitality 
 what do you want now she asked looking sharply over her spectacles while the parrot sitting on the back of her chair called out 
 go away no boys allowed here 
 laurie retired to the window and jo told her story 
 no more than i expected if you are allowed to go poking about among poor folks amy can stay and make herself useful if she sick which no doubt she will be looks like it now cry child it worries me to hear people sniff amy was on the point of crying but laurie slyly pulled the tail which caused polly to utter an astonished croak and call out bless my boots in such a funny way that she laughed instead 
 what do you hear from your mother asked the old lady gruffly 
 father is much better replied jo trying to keep sober 
 oh is her well that last long i fancy march never had any stamina was the cheerful reply 
 ha ha never say die take a pinch of snuff goodbye goodbye squalled polly dancing on her perch and clawing at the old cap as laurie tweaked him in the rear 
 hold your tongue you disrespectful old bird and jo better go at once it proper to be gadding about so late with a rattlepated boy like 
 hold your tongue you disrespectful old bird cried polly tumbling off the chair with a bounce and running to peck the rattlepated boy who was shaking with laughter at the last speech 
 i think i can bear it but try thought amy as she was left alone with aunt march 
 get along you fright screamed polly and at that rude speech amy could not restrain a sniff

lionfish nov chapter seventeen the heir of slytherincontents prev chapter next chapter 
 he was standing at the end of a very long dimly lit chamber towering stone pillars entwined with more carved serpents rose to support a ceiling lost in darkness casting long black shadows through the odd greenish gloom that filled the place his heart beating very fast harry stood listening to the chill silence could the basilisk be lurking in a shadowy corner behind a pillar and where was ginny 
 
 he pulled out his wand and moved forward between the serpentine columns every careful footstep echoed loudly off the shadowy walls he kept his eyes narrowed ready to clamp them shut at the smallest sign of movement the hollow eye sockets of the stone snakes seemed to be following him more than once with a jolt of the stomach he thought he saw one stir 
 
 then as he drew level with the last pair of pillars a statue high as the chamber itself loomed into view standing against the back wall 
 
 harry had to crane his neck to look up into the giant face above it was ancient and monkeyish with a long thin beard that fell almost to the bottom of the sweeping stone robes where two enormous gray feet stood on the smooth chamber floor and between the feet facedown lay a small figure with hair 
 
 ginny harry muttered sprinting to her and dropping to his knees ginny be dead please be dead he flung his wand aside grabbed shoulders and turned her over her face was white as marble and as cold yet her eyes were closed so she petrified but then she must be 
 
 ginny please wake up harry muttered desperately shaking her head lolled hopelessly from side to side 
 
 she wake said a soft voice 
 
 harry jumped and spun around on his knees 
 
 a tall boy was leaning against the nearest pillar watching he was strangely blurred around the edges as though harry were looking at him through a misted window but there was no mistaking him 
 
 tom tom riddle 
 
 riddle nodded not taking his eyes off face 
 
 what mean she wake harry said desperately not not 
 
 still alive said riddle but only just 
 
 harry stared at him tom riddle had been at hogwarts fifty years ago yet here he stood a weird misty light shining about him not a day older than sixteen 
 
 are you a ghost harry said uncertainly 
 
 a memory said riddle quietly preserved in a diary for fifty years 
 
 he pointed toward the floor near the giant toes lying open there was the little black diary harry had found in moaning bathroom for a second harry wondered how it had got there but there were more pressing matters to deal with 
 
 got to help me tom harry said raising head again got to get her out of here a basilisk i know where it is but it could be along any moment please help me 
 
 riddle move harry sweating managed to hoist ginny half off the floor and bent to pick up his wand again 
 
 but his wand had gone 
 
 did you see 
 
 he looked up riddle was still watching him twirling wand between his long fingers 
 
 thanks said harry stretching out his hand for it 
 
 a smile curled the corners of mouth he continued to stare at harry twirling the wand idly 
 
 listen said harry urgently his knees sagging with dead weight got to go if the basilisk comes 
 
 it come until it is called said riddle calmly 
 
 harry lowered ginny back onto the floor unable to hold her up any longer 
 
 what mean he said look give me my wand i might need it 
 
 smile broadened 
 
 you be needing it he said 
 
 harry stared at him 
 
 what mean i be 
 
 waited a long time for this harry potter said riddle for the chance to see you to speak to you 
 
 look said harry losing patience i think you get it in the chamber of secrets we can talk later 
 
 going to talk now said riddle still smiling broadly and he pocketed wand 
 
 harry stared at him there was something very funny going on here 
 
 how did ginny get like this he asked slowly 
 
 well an interesting question said riddle pleasantly and quite a long story i suppose the real reason ginny like this is because she opened her heart and spilled all her secrets to an invisible stranger 
 
 what are you talking about said harry 
 
 the diary said riddle my diary little been writing in it for months and months telling me all her pitiful worries and woes how her brothers tease her how she had to come to school with secondhand robes and books how eyes glinted how she think famous good great harry potter would ever like her 
 
 all the time he spoke eyes never left face there was an almost hungry look in them 
 
 very boring having to listen to the silly little troubles of an girl he went on but i was patient i wrote back i was sympathetic i was kind ginny simply loved me no ever understood me like you tom so glad got this diary to confide in like having a friend i can carry around in my pocket 
 
 riddle laughed a high cold laugh that suit him it made the hairs stand up on the back of neck 
 
 if i say it myself harry always been able to charm the people i needed so ginny poured out her soul to me and her soul happened to be exactly what i wanted i grew stronger and stronger on a diet of her deepest fears her darkest secrets i grew powerful far more powerful than little miss weasley powerful enough to start feeding miss weasley a few of my secrets to start pouring a little of my soul back into her 
 
 what mean said harry whose mouth had gone very dry 
 
 you guessed yet harry potter said riddle softly ginny weasley opened the chamber of secrets she strangled the school roosters and daubed threatening messages on the walls she set the serpent of slytherin on four mudbloods and the cat 
 
 no harry whispered 
 
 yes said riddle calmly of course she know what she was doing at first it was very amusing i wish you could have seen her new diary entries far more interesting they became dear tom he recited watching horrified face i think losing my memory there are rooster feathers all over my robes and know how they got there dear tom l remember what i did on the night of halloween but a cat was attacked and got paint all down my front dear tom percy keeps telling me pale and not myself i think he suspects me there was another attack today and i know where i was tom what am i going to do i think going mad i think the one attacking everyone tom 
 
 fists were clenched the nails digging deep into his palms 
 
 it took a very long time for stupid little ginny to stop trusting her diary said riddle but she finally became suspicious and tried to dispose of it and where you came in harry you found it and i have been more delighted of all the people who could have picked it up it was you the very person i was most anxious to meet 
 
 and why did you want to meet me said harry anger was coursing through him and it was an effort to keep his voice steady 
 
 well you see ginny told me all about you harry said riddle your whole fascinating history his eyes roved over the lightning scar on forehead and their expression grew hungrier i knew i must find out more about you talk to you meet you if i could so i decided to show you my famous capture of that great oaf hagrid to gain your trust 
 
 my friend said harry his voice now shaking and you framed him you i thought you made a mistake but 
 
 riddle laughed his high laugh again 
 
 it was my word against harry well you can imagine how it looked to old armando dippet on the one hand tom riddle poor but brilliant parentless but so brave school prefect model student on the other hand big blundering hagrid in trouble every other week trying to raise werewolf cubs under his bed sneaking off to the forbidden forest to wrestle trolls but i admit even i was surprised how well the plan worked i thought someone must realize that hagrid possibly be the heir of slytherin it had taken me five whole years to find out everything i could about the chamber of secrets and discover the secret entrance as though hagrid had the brains or the power 
 
 only the transfiguration teacher dumbledore seemed to think hagrid was innocent he persuaded dippetto keep hagrid and train him as gamekeeper yes i think dumbledore might have guessed dumbledore never seemed to like me as much as the other teachers did 
 
 i bet dumbledore saw right through you said harry his teeth gritted 
 
 well he certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after hagrid was expelled said riddle carelessly i knew it be safe to open the chamber again while i was still at school but i going to waste those long years spent searching for it i decided to leave behind a diary preserving my self in its pages so that one day with luck i would be able to lead another in my footsteps and finish salazar noble work 
 
 well you finished it said harry triumphantly no died this time not even the cat in a few hours the mandrake draught will be ready and everyone who was petrified will be all right again 
 
 i already told you said riddle quietly that killing mudbloods matter to me anymore for many months now my new target has been you 
 
 harry stared at him 
 
 imagine how angry i was when the next time my diary was opened it was ginny who was writing to me not you she saw you with the diary you see and panicked what if you found out how to work it and i repeated all her secrets to you what if even worse i told you been strangling roosters so the foolish little brat waited until your dormitory was deserted and stole it back but i knew what i must do it was clear to me that you were on the trail of heir from everything ginny had told me about you i knew you would go to any lengths to solve the mystery particularly if one of your best friends was attacked and ginny had told me the whole school was buzzing because you could speak parseltongue 
 
 so i made ginny write her own farewell on the wall and come down here to wait she struggled and cried and became very boring but there much life left in her she put too much into the diary into me enough to let me leave its pages at last i have been waiting for you to appear since we arrived here i knew come i have many questions for you harry potter 
 
 like what harry spat fists still clenched 
 
 well said riddle smiling pleasantly how is it that you a skinny boy with no extraordinary magical talent managed to defeat the greatest wizard of all time how did you escape with nothing but a scar while lord powers were destroyed 
 
 there was an odd red gleam in his hungry eyes now 
 
 why do you care how i escaped said harry slowly voldemort was after your time 
 
 voldemort said riddle softly is my past present and future harry potter 
 
 he pulled wand from his pocket and began to trace it through the air writing three shimmering words 
 
 tom marvolo riddle 
 
 then he waved the wand once and the letters of his name rearranged themselves 
 
 i am lord voldemort 
 
 you see he whispered it was a name i was already using at hogwarts to my most intimate friends only of course you think i was going to use my filthy muggle name forever i in whose veins runs the blood of salazar slytherin himself through my side i keep the name of a foul common muggle who abandoned me even before i was born just because he found out his wife was a witch no harry i fashioned myself a new name a name i knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak when i had become the greatest sorcerer in the world 
 
 brain seemed to have jammed he stared numbly at riddle at the orphaned boy who had grown up to murder own parents and so many others at last he forced himself to speak 
 
 not he said his quiet voice full of hatred 
 
 not what snapped riddle 
 
 not the greatest sorcerer in the world said harry breathing fast sorry to disappoint you and all that but the greatest wizard in the world is albus dumbledore everyone says so even when you were strong you dare try and take over at hogwarts dumbledore saw through you when you were at school and he still frightens you now wherever hiding these days 
 
 the smile had gone from face to be replaced by a very ugly look 
 
 been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me he hissed 
 
 not as gone as you might think harry retorted he was speaking at random wanting to scare riddle wishing rather than believing it to be true 
 
 riddle opened his mouth but froze 
 
 music was coming from somewhere riddle whirled around to stare down the empty chamber the music was growing louder it was eerie unearthly it lifted the hair on scalp and made his heart feel as though it was swelling to twice its normal size then as the music reached such a pitch that harry felt it vibrating inside his own ribs flames erupted at the top of the nearest pillar 
 
 a crimson bird the size of a swan had appeared piping its weird music to the vaulted ceiling it had a glittering golden tail as long as a and gleaming golden talons which were gripping a ragged bundle 
 
 a second later the bird was flying straight at harry it dropped the ragged thing it was carrying at his feet then landed heavily on his shoulder as it folded its great wings harry looked up and saw it had a long sharp golden beak and a beady black eye 
 
 the bird stopped singing it sat still and warm next to cheek gazing steadily at riddle 
 
 a phoenix said riddle staring shrewdly back at it 
 
 fawkes harry breathed and he felt the golden claws squeeze his shoulder gently 
 
 and that said riddle now eyeing the ragged thing that fawkes had dropped the old school sorting hat 
 
 so it was patched frayed and dirty the hat lay motionless at feet 
 
 riddle began to laugh again he laughed so hard that the dark chamber rang with it as though ten riddles were laughing at once 
 
 this is what dumbledore sends his defender a songbird and an old hat do you feel brave harry potter do you feel safe now 
 
 harry answer he might not see what use fawkes or the sorting hat were but he was no longer alone and he waited for riddle to stop laughing with his courage mounting 
 
 to business harry said riddle still smiling broadly twice in your past in my future we have met and twice i failed to kill you how did you survive tell me everything the longer you talk he added softly the longer you stay alive 
 
 harry was thinking fast weighing his chances riddle had the wand he harry had fawkes and the sorting hat neither of which would be much good in a duel it looked bad all right but the longer riddle stood there the more life was dwindling out of ginny and in the meantime harry noticed suddenly outline was becoming clearer more solid if it had to be a fight between him and riddle better sooner than later 
 
 no one knows why you lost your powers when you attacked me said harry abruptly i know myself but i know why you kill me because my mother died to save me my common mother he added shaking with suppressed rage she stopped you killing me and seen the real you i saw you last year a wreck barely alive where all your power got you in hiding ugly foul 
 
 face contorted then he forced it into an awful smile so your mother died to save you yes a powerful countercharm i can see now there is nothing special about you after all i wondered you see there are strange likenesses between us after all even you must have noticed both orphans raised by muggles probably the only two parselmouths to come to hogwarts since the great slytherin himself we even look something alike but after all it was merely a lucky chance that saved you from me all i wanted to know 
 
 harry stood tense waiting for riddle to raise his wand but twisted smile was widening again 
 
 now harry going to teach you a little lesson match the powers of lord voldemort heir of salazar slytherin against famous harry potter and the best weapons dumbledore can give him 
 
 he cast an amused eye over fawkes and the sorting hat then walked away harry fear spreading up his numb legs watched riddle stop between the high pillars and look up into the stone face of slytherin high above him in the riddle opened his mouth wide and hissed but harry understood what he was saying 
 
 speak to me slytherin greatest of the hogwarts four 
 
 harry wheeled around to look up at the statue fawkes swaying on his shoulder 
 
 gigantic stone face was moving horrorstruck harry saw his mouth opening wider and wider to make a huge black hole 
 
 and something was stirring inside the mouth something was slithering up from its depths 
 
 harry backed away until he hit the dark chamber wall and as he shut his eyes tight he felt sweep his cheek as he took flight harry wanted to shout leave me but what chance did a phoenix have against the king of serpents 
 
 something huge hit the stone floor of the chamber harry felt it shudder he knew what was happening he could sense it could almost see the giant serpent uncoiling itself from mouth then he heard hissing voice 
 
 kill him 
 
 the basilisk was moving toward harry he could hear its heavy body slithering heavily across the dusty floor eyes still tightly shut harry began to run blindly sideways his hands outstretched feeling his way voldemort was laughing 
 
 harry tripped he fell hard onto the stone and tasted blood the serpent was barely feet from him he could hear it coming 
 
 there was a loud explosive spitting sound right above him and then something heavy hit harry so hard that he was smashed into the wall waiting for fangs to sink through his body he heard more mad hissing something thrashing wildly off the pillars 
 
 he help it he opened his eyes wide enough to squint at what was going on 
 
 the enormous serpent bright poisonous green thick as an oak trunk had raised itself high in the air and its great blunt head was weaving drunkenly between the pillars as harry trembled ready to close his eyes if it turned he saw what had distracted the snake 
 
 fawkes was soaring around its head and the basilisk was snapping furiously at him with fangs long and thin as sabers fawkes dived his long golden beak sank out of sight and a sudden shower of dark blood spattered the floor the tail thrashed narrowly missing harry and before harry could shut his eyes it turned harry looked straight into its face and saw that its eyes both its great bulbous yellow eyes had been punctured by the phoenix blood was streaming to the floor and the snake was spitting in agony 
 
 no harry heard riddle screaming leave the bird leave the bird the boy is behind you you can still smell him kill him 
 
 the blinded serpent swayed confused still deadly fawkes was circling its head piping his eerie song jabbing here and there at its scaly nose as the blood poured from its ruined eyes 
 
 help me help me harry muttered wildly someone anyone 
 
 the tail whipped across the floor again harry ducked something soft hit his face 
 
 the basilisk had swept the sorting hat into arms harry seized it it was all he had left his only chance he rammed it onto his head and threw himself flat onto the floor as the tail swung over him again 
 
 help me help me harry thought his eyes screwed tight under the hat please help me 
 
 there was no answering voice instead the hat contracted as though an invisible hand was squeezing it very tightly 
 
 something very hard and heavy thudded onto the top of head almost knocking him out stars winking in front of his eyes he grabbed the top of the hat to pull it off and felt something long and hard beneath it 
 
 a gleaming silver sword had appeared inside the hat its handle glittering with rubies the size of eggs 
 
 kill the boy leave the bird the boy is behind you sniff smell him 
 
 harry was on his feet ready the head was falling its body coiling around hitting pillars as it twisted to face him he could see the vast bloody eye sockets see the mouth stretching wide wide enough to swallow him whole lined with fangs long as his sword thin glittering venomous 
 
 it lunged blindly harry dodged and it hit the chamber wall it lunged again and its forked tongue lashed side he raised the sword in both his hands 
 
 the basilisk lunged again and this time its aim was true harry threw his whole weight behind the sword and drove it to the hilt into the roof of the mouth 
 
 but as warm blood drenched arms he felt a searing pain just above his elbow one long poisonous fang was sinking deeper and deeper into his arm and it splintered as the basilisk keeled over sideways and fell twitching to the floor 
 
 harry slid down the wall he gripped the fang that was spreading poison through his body and wrenched it out of his arm but he knew it was too late pain was spreading slowly and steadily from the wound even as he dropped the fang and watched his own blood soaking his robes his vision went foggy the chamber was dissolving in a whirl of dull color 
 
 a patch of scarlet swam past and harry heard a soft clatter of claws beside him 
 
 fawkes said harry thickly you were fantastic fawkes 
 
 he felt the bird lay its beautiful head on the spot where the fang had pierced him 
 
 he could hear echoing footsteps and then a dark shadow moved in front of him 
 
 dead harry potter said voice above him dead even bird knows it do you see what doing potter crying 
 
 harry blinked head slid in and out of focus thick pearly tears were trickling down the glossy feathers 
 
 going to sit here and watch you die harry potter take your time in no hurry 
 
 harry felt drowsy everything around him seemed to be spinning 
 
 so ends the famous harry potter said distant voice alone in the chamber of secrets forsaken by his friends defeated at last by the dark lord he so unwisely challenged be back with your dear mudblood mother soon harry she bought you twelve years of borrowed time but lord voldemort got you in the end as you knew he must 
 
 if this is dying thought harry not so bad 
 
 even the pain was leaving him 
 
 but was this dying instead of going black the chamber seemed to be coming back into focus harry gave his head a little shake and there was fawkes still resting his head on arm a pearly patch of tears was shining all around the wound except that there was no wound 
 
 get away bird said voice suddenly get away from him i said get away 
 
 harry raised his head riddle was pointing wand at fawkes there was a bang like a gun and fawkes took flight again in a whirl of gold and scarlet 
 
 phoenix tears said riddle quietly staring at arm of course healing powers i forgot 
 
 he looked into face but it makes no difference in fact i prefer it this way just you and me harry potter you and me 
 
 he raised the wand 
 
 then in a rush of wings fawkes had soared back overhead and something fell into lap the diary 
 
 for a split second both harry and riddle wand still raised stared at it then without thinking without considering as though he had meant to do it all along harry seized the basilisk fang on the floor next to him and plunged it straight into the heart of the book 
 
 there was a long dreadful piercing scream ink spurted out of the diary in torrents streaming over hands flooding the floor riddle was writhing and twisting screaming and flailing and then 
 
 he had gone wand fell to the floor with a clatter and there was silence silence except for the steady drip drip of ink still oozing from the diary the basilisk venom had burned a sizzling hole right through it 
 
 shaking all over harry pulled himself up his head was spinning as though just traveled miles by floo powder slowly he gathered together his wand and the sorting hat and with a huge tug retrieved the glittering sword from the roof of the mouth 
 
 then came a faint moan from the end of the chamber ginny was stirring as harry hurried toward her she sat up her bemused eyes traveled from the huge form of the dead basilisk over harry in his robes then to the diary in his hand she drew a great shuddering gasp and tears began to pour down her face 
 
 harry oh harry i tried to tell you at but i say it in front of percy it was me harry but i i i mean to made me he me over and how did you kill that that thing riddle the last thing i is him coming out of the diary 
 
 all right said harry holding up the diary and showing ginny the fang hole finished look him and the basilisk ginny get out of here 
 
 going to be expelled ginny wept as harry helped her awkwardly to her feet looked forward to coming to hogwarts ever since came and have to leave and mum and dad say 
 
 fawkes was waiting for them hovering in the chamber entrance harry urged ginny forward they stepped over the motionless coils of the dead basilisk through the echoing gloom and back into the tunnel harry heard the stone doors close behind them with a soft hiss 
 
 after a few up the dark tunnel a distant sound of slowly shifting rock reached ears 
 
 ron harry yelled speeding up okay got her 
 
 he heard ron give a strangled cheer and they turned the next bend to see his eager face staring through the sizable gap he had managed to make in the rock fall 
 
 ginny ron thrust an arm through the gap in the rock to pull her through first alive i believe it what happened how what where did that bird come from 
 
 fawkes had swooped through the gap after ginny 
 
 said harry squeezing through himself 
 
 how come got a sword said ron gaping at the glittering weapon in hand 
 
 explain when we get out of here said harry with a sideways glance at ginny who was crying harder than ever 
 
 but 
 
 later harry said shortly he think it was a good idea to tell ron yet been opening the chamber not in front of ginny anyway lockhart 
 
 back there said ron still looking puzzled but jerking his head up the tunnel toward the pipe in a bad way come and see 
 
 led by fawkes whose wide scarlet wings emitted a soft golden glow in the darkness they walked all the way back to the mouth of the pipe gilderoy lockhart was sitting there humming placidly to himself 
 
 his gone said ron the memory charm backfired hit him instead of us got a clue who he is or where he is or who we are i told him to come and wait here a danger to himself 
 
 lockhart peered up at them all 
 
 hello he said odd sort of place this it do you live here 
 
 no said ron raising his eyebrows at harry 
 
 harry bent down and looked up the long dark pipe 
 
 have you thought how going to get back up this he said to ron 
 
 ron shook his head but fawkes the phoenix had swooped past harry and was now fluttering in front of him his beady eyes bright in the dark he was waving his long golden tail feathers harry looked uncertainly at him 
 
 he looks like he wants you to grab hold said ron looking perplexed but much too heavy for a bird to pull up there 
 
 fawkes said harry an ordinary bird he turned quickly to the others got to hold on to each other ginny grab hand professor lockhart 
 
 he means you said ron sharply to lockhart 
 
 you hold other hand 
 
 harry tucked the sword and the sorting hat into his belt ron took hold of the back of robes and harry reached out and took hold of strangely hot tail feathers 
 
 an extraordinary lightness seemed to spread through his whole body and the next second in a rush of wings they were flying upward through the pipe harry could hear lockhart dangling below him saying amazing amazing this is just like magic the chill air was whipping through hair and before stopped enjoying the ride it was over all four of them were hitting the wet floor of moaning bathroom and as lockhart straightened his hat the sink that hid the pipe was sliding back into place 
 
 myrtle goggled at them 
 
 alive she said blankly to harry 
 
 no need to sound so disappointed he said grimly wiping flecks of blood and slime off his glasses 
 
 oh well just been thinking if you had died have been welcome to share my toilet said myrtle blushing silver 
 
 urgh said ron as they left the bathroom for the dark deserted corridor outside harry i think grown fond of you got competition ginny 
 
 but tears were still flooding silently down face 
 
 where now said ron with an anxious look at ginny harry pointed 
 
 fawkes was leading the way glowing gold along the corridor they strode after him and moments later found themselves outside professor office 
 
 harry knocked and pushed the door open 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the chamber of secrets 
 

lionfish nov chapter seventeen cat rat and dogcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 mind had gone blank with shock the three of them stood transfixed with horror under the invisibility cloak the very last rays of the setting sun were casting a bloody light over the grounds then behind them they heard a wild howling 
 
 hagrid harry muttered without thinking about what he was doing he made to turn back but both ron and hermione seized his arms 
 
 we said ron who was be in worse trouble if they know been to see him 
 
 breathing was shallow and uneven 
 
 how could they she choked how could they 
 
 come on said ron whose teeth seemed to be chattering 
 
 they set off back toward the castle walking slowly to keep themselves hidden under the cloak the light was fading fast now 
 
 by the time they reached open ground darkness was settling like a spell around them 
 
 scabbers keep still ron hissed clamping his hand over his chest the rat was wriggling madly ron came to a sudden halt trying to force scabbers deeper into his pocket the matter with you you stupid rat stay still ouch he bit me 
 
 ron be quiet hermione whispered urgently be out here in a minute 
 
 he stay put 
 
 scabbers was plainly terrified he was writhing with all his might trying to break free of grip 
 
 the matter with him 
 
 but harry had just seen stinking toward them his body low to the ground wide yellow eyes glinting eerily in the darkness crookshanks whether he could see them or was following the sound of squeaks harry tell 
 
 crookshanks hermione moaned no go away crookshanks go away 
 
 but the cat was getting nearer 
 
 scabbers no 
 
 too late the rat had slipped between clutching fingers hit the ground and scampered away in one bound crookshanks sprang after him and before harry or hermione could stop him ron had thrown the invisibility cloak off himself and pelted away into the darkness 
 
 ron hermione moaned 
 
 she and harry looked at each other then followed at a sprint it was impossible to run full out under the cloak they pulled it off and it streamed behind them like a banner as they hurtled after ron they could hear his feet thundering along ahead and his shouts at crookshanks 
 
 get away from him get away scabbers come here 
 
 there was a loud thud 
 
 gotcha get off you stinking cat 
 
 harry and hermione almost fell over ron they skidded to a stop right in front of him he was sprawled on the ground but scabbers was back in his pocket he had both hands held tight over the quivering lump 
 
 ron come on back under the cloak hermione panted dumbledore the minister be coming back out in a minute 
 
 but before they could cover themselves again before they could even catch their breath they heard the soft pounding of gigantic paws something was bounding toward them quiet as a shadow an enormous dog 
 
 harry reached for his wand but too late the dog had made an enormous leap and the front paws hit him on the chest he keeled over backward in a whirl of hair he felt its hot breath saw teeth 
 
 but the force of its leap had carried it too far it rolled off him dazed feeling as though his ribs were broken harry tried to stand up he could hear it growling as it skidded around for a new attack 
 
 ron was on his feet as the dog sprang back toward them he pushed harry aside the jaws fastened instead around outstretched arm harry lunged forward he seized a handful of the hair but it was dragging ron away as easily as though he were a rag doll 
 
 then out of nowhere something hit harry so hard across the face he was knocked off his feet again he heard hermione shriek with pain and fall too 
 
 harry groped for his wand blinking blood out of his eyes 
 
 lumos he whispered 
 
 the wandlight showed him the trunk of a thick tree they had chased scabbers into the shadow of the whomping willow and its branches were creaking as though in a high wind whipping backward and forward to stop them going nearer 
 
 and there at the base of the trunk was the dog dragging ron backward into a large gap in the roots ron was fighting furiously but his head and torso were slipping out of sight 
 
 ron harry shouted trying to follow but a heavy branch whipped lethally through the air and he was forced backward again 
 
 all they could see now was one of legs which he had hooked around a root in an effort to stop the dog from pulling him farther underground but a horrible crack cut the air like a gunshot leg had broken and a moment later his foot vanished from sight 
 
 harry got to go for help hermione gasped she was bleeding too the willow had cut her across the shoulder 
 
 no that big enough to eat him we got time 
 
 harry never going to get through without help 
 
 another branch whipped down at them twigs clenched like knuckles 
 
 if that dog can get in we can harry panted darting here and there trying to find a way through the vicious swishing branches but he get an inch nearer to the tree roots without being in range of the blows 
 
 oh help help hermione whispered frantically dancing uncertainly on the spot please 
 
 crookshanks darted forward he slithered between the battering branches like a snake and placed his front paws upon a knot on the trunk 
 
 abruptly as though the tree had been turned to marble it stopped moving not a leaf twitched or shook 
 
 crookshanks hermione whispered uncertainly she now grasped arm painfully hard how did he know 
 
 friends with that dog said harry grimly seen them together come on and keep your wand out 
 
 they covered the distance to the trunk in seconds but before they had reached the gap in the roots crookshanks had slid into it with a flick of his bottlebrush tail harry went next he crawled forward headfirst and slid down an earthy slope to the bottom of a very low tunnel crookshanks was a little way along his eyes flashing in the light from wand seconds later hermione slithered down beside him 
 
 ron she whispered in a terrified voice 
 
 this way said harry setting off after crookshanks 
 
 where does this tunnel come out hermione asked breathlessly from behind him 
 
 i marked on the map but fred and george said no ever gotten into itit goes off the edge of the map but it looked like it was heading for hogsmeade 
 
 they moved as fast as they could bent almost double ahead of them tail bobbed in and out of view on and on went the passage it felt at least as long as the one to honeydukes all harry could think of was ron and what the enormous dog might be doing to himhe was drawing breath in sharp painful gasps running at a crouch 
 
 and then the tunnel began to rise moments later it twisted and crookshanks had gone ahead harry could see a patch of dim light through a small opening 
 
 he and hermione paused gasping for breath edging forward both raised their wands to see what lay beyond 
 
 it was a room a very disordered dusty room paper was peeling from the walls there were stains all over the floor every piece of furniture was broken as though somebody had smashed it the windows were all boarded up 
 
 harry glanced at hermione who looked very frightened but nodded 
 
 harry pulled himself out of the hole staring around the room was deserted but a door to their right stood open leading to a shadowy hallway hermione suddenly grabbed arm again her wide eyes were traveling around the boarded windows 
 
 harry she whispered i think in the shrieking shack 
 
 harry looked around his eyes fell on a wooden chair near them large chunks had been torn out of it one of the legs had been ripped off entirely 
 
 ghosts do that he said slowly 
 
 at that moment there was a creak overhead something had moved upstairs both of them looked up at the ceiling grip on arm was so tight he was losing feeling in his fingers he raised his eyebrows at her she nodded again and let go 
 
 quietly as they could they crept out into the hall and up the crumbling staircase everything was covered in a thick layer of dust except the floor where a wide shiny stripe had been made by something being dragged upstairs 
 
 they reached the dark landing 
 
 nox they whispered together and the lights at the end of their wands went out only one door was open as they crept toward it they heard movement from behind it a low moan and then a deep loud purring they exchanged a last look a last nod 
 
 wand held tightly before him harry kicked the door wide open 
 
 on a magnificent bed with dusty hangings lay crookshanks purring loudly at the sight of them on the floor beside him clutching his leg which stuck out at a strange angle was ron 
 
 harry and hermione dashed across to him 
 
 ron are you okay 
 
 the dog 
 
 not a dog ron moaned his teeth were gritted with pain harry a trap 
 
 what 
 
 the an animagus 
 
 ron was staring over shoulder harry wheeled around with a snap the man in the shadows closed the door behind them 
 
 a mass of filthy matted hair hung to his elbows if eyes been shining out of the deep dark sockets he might have been a corpse the waxy skin was stretched so tightly over the bones of his face it looked like a skull his yellow teeth were bared in a grin it was sirius black 
 
 expelliarmus he croaked pointing wand at them 
 
 and wands shot out of their hands high in the air and black caught them then he took a step closer his eyes were fixed on harry 
 
 i thought come and help your friend he said hoarsely 
 
 his voice sounded as though he had long since lost the habit of using it your father would have done the same for me brave of you not to run for a teacher gratefulit will make everything much easier 
 
 the taunt about his father rang in ears as though black had bellowed it a boiling hate erupted in chest leaving no place for fear for the first time in his life he wanted his wand back in his hand not to defend himself but to attackto kill without knowing what he was doing he started forward but there was a sudden movement on either side of him and two pairs of hands grabbed him and held him back no harry hermione gasped in a petrified whisper ron however spoke to black 
 
 if you want to kill harry have to kill us too he said fiercely though the effort of standing upright was draining him of still more color and he swayed slightly as he spoke 
 
 something flickered in shadowed eyes 
 
 lie down he said quietly to ron you will damage that leg even more 
 
 did you hear me ron said weakly though he was clinging painfully to harry to stay upright have to kill all three of us 
 
 be only one murder here tonight said black and his grin widened 
 
 that harry spat trying to wrench himself free of ron and hermione care last time did you mind slaughtering all those muggles to get at the matter gone soft in azkaban 
 
 harry hermione whimpered be quiet 
 
 he killed my mum and dad harry roared and with a huge effort he broke free of and restraint and lunged forward 
 
 he had forgotten about magic he had forgotten that he was short and skinny and thirteen whereas black was a tall man all harry knew was that he wanted to hurt black as badly as he could and that he care how much he got hurt in return 
 
 perhaps it was the shock of harry doing something so stupid but black raise the wands in time one of hands fastened over his wasted wrist forcing the wand tips away the knuckles of other hand collided with the side of head and they fell backward into the wall 
 
 hermione was screaming ron was yelling there was a blinding flash as the wands in hand sent a jet of sparks into the air that missed face by inches harry felt the shrunken arm under his fingers twisting madly but he clung on his other hand punching every part of black it could find 
 
 but free hand had found throat 
 
 no he hissed waited too long 
 
 the fingers tightened harry choked his glasses askew 
 
 then he saw foot swing out of nowhere black let go of harry with a grunt of pain ron had thrown himself on wand hand and harry heard a faint clatter 
 
 he fought free of the tangle of bodies and saw his own wand rolling across the floor he threw himself toward it but 
 
 argh 
 
 crookshanks had joined the fray both sets of front claws had sunk themselves deep into arm harry threw him off but crookshanks now darted toward wand 
 
 no you roared harry and he aimed a kick at crookshanks that made the cat leap aside spitting harry snatched up his wand and turned 
 
 get out of the way he shouted at ron and hermione 
 
 they need telling twice hermione gasping for breath her lip bleeding scrambled aside snatching up her and wands ron crawled to the and collapsed onto it panting his white face now tinged with green both hands clutching his broken leg 
 
 black was sprawled at the bottom of the wall his thin chest rose and fell rapidly as he watched harry walking slowly nearer his wand pointing straight at heart 
 
 going to kill me harry he whispered 
 
 harry stopped right above him his wand still pointing at chest looking down at him a livid bruise was rising around left eye and his nose was bleeding 
 
 you killed my parents said harry his voice shaking slightly but his wand hand quite steady 
 
 black stared up at him out of those sunken eyes 
 
 i deny it he said very quietly but if you knew the whole story 
 
 the whole story harry repeated a furious pounding in his ears you sold them to voldemort all i need to know 
 
 got to listen to me black said and there was a note of urgency in his voice now regret it if you understand 
 
 i understand a lot better than you think said harry and his voice shook more than ever you never heard her did you my mumtrying to stop voldemort killing meand you did thatyou did it 
 
 before either of them could say another word something ginger streaked past harry crookshanks leapt onto chest and settled himself there right over heart black blinked and looked down at the cat 
 
 get off he murmured trying to push crookshanks off him 
 
 but crookshanks sank his claws into robes and shift he turned his ugly squashed face to harry and looked up at him with those great yellow eyes to his right hermione gave a dry sob 
 
 harry stared down at black and crookshanks his grip tightening on the wand so what if he had to kill the cat too it was in league with blackif it was prepared to die trying to protect black that business if black wanted to save it that only proved he cared more for crookshanks than for parents 
 
 harry raised the wand now was the moment to do it now was the moment to avenge his mother and father he was going to kill black he had to kill black this was his chance 
 
 the seconds lengthened and still harry stood frozen there wand poised black staring up at him crookshanks on his chest ragged breathing came from near the bed hermione was quite silent 
 
 and then came a new sound 
 
 muffled footsteps were echoing up through the floor someone was moving downstairs 
 
 up here hermione screamed suddenly up here sirius black quick 
 
 black made a startled movement that almost dislodged crookshanks harry gripped his wand convulsively do it now said a voice in his head but the footsteps were thundering up the stairs and harry still done it 
 
 the door of the room burst open in a shower of red sparks and harry wheeled around as professor lupin came hurtling into the room his face bloodless his wand raised and ready his eyes flickered over ron lying on the floor over hermione cowering next to the door to harry standing there with his wand covering black and then to black himself crumpled and bleeding at feet 
 
 expelliarmus lupin shouted 
 
 wand flew once more out of his hand so did the two hermione was holding lupin caught them all deftly then moved into the room staring at black who still had crookshanks lying protectively across his chest 
 
 harry stood there feeling suddenly empty he done it his nerve had failed him black was going to be handed back to the dementors 
 
 then lupin spoke in a very tense voice 
 
 where is he sirius 
 
 harry looked quickly at lupin he understand what lupin meant who was lupin talking about he turned to look at black again 
 
 face was quite expressionless for a few seconds he move at all then very slowly he raised his empty hand and pointed straight at ron mystified harry glanced around at ron who looked bewildered 
 
 but then lupin muttered staring at black so intently it seemed he was trying to read his mind why he shown himself before now unless eyes suddenly widened as though he was seeing something beyond black something none of the rest could see unless he was the oneunless you switched without telling me 
 
 very slowly his sunken gaze never leaving face black nodded 
 
 professor harry interrupted loudly going on 
 
 but he never finished the question because what he saw made his voice die in his throat lupin was lowering his wand gazing fixed at black the professor walked to side seized his hand pulled him to his feet so that crookshanks fell to the floor and embraced black like a brother 
 
 harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach 
 
 i believe it hermione screamed 
 
 lupin let go of black and turned to her she had raised herself off the floor and was pointing at lupin you you 
 
 hermione 
 
 c you and him 
 
 hermione calm down 
 
 i tell anyone hermione shrieked been covering up for you 
 
 hermione listen to me please lupin shouted i can explain 
 
 harry could feel himself shaking not with fear but with a fresh wave of fury 
 
 i trusted you he shouted at lupin his voice wavering out of control and all the time been his friend 
 
 wrong said lupin i been friend but i am now let me explain 
 
 no hermione screamed harry trust him been helping black get into the castle he wants you dead too a werewolf 
 
 there was a ringing silence eyes were now on lupin who looked remarkably calm though rather pale 
 
 not at all up to your usual standard hermione he said only one out of three afraid i have not been helping sirius get into the castle and i certainly want harry dead an odd shiver passed over his face but i deny that i am a werewolf 
 
 ron made a valiant effort to get up again but fell back with a whimper of pain lupin made toward him looking concerned but ron gasped get away from me werewolf 
 
 lupin stopped dead then with an obvious effort he turned to hermione and said how long have you known 
 
 ages hermione whispered since i did professor essay 
 
 be delighted said lupin coolly he assigned that essay hoping someone would realize what my symptoms meant did you check the lunar chart and realize that i was always ill at the full moon or did you realize that the boggart changed into the moon when it saw me 
 
 both hermione said quietly 
 
 lupin forced a laugh 
 
 the cleverest witch of your age ever met hermione 
 
 not hermione whispered if been a bit cleverer have told everyone what you are 
 
 but they already know said lupin at least the staff do 
 
 dumbledore hired you when he knew you were a werewolf ron gasped is he mad 
 
 some of the staff thought so said lupin he had to work very hard to convince certain teachers that trustworthy 
 
 and he was wrong harry yelled been helping him all the time he was pointing at black who suddenly crossed to the bed and sank onto it his face hidden in one shaking hand crookshanks leapt up beside him and stepped onto his lap purring ron edged away from both of them dragging his leg 
 
 i have not been helping sirius said lupin if give me a chance explain look 
 
 he separated and wands and threw each back to its owner harry caught his stunned 
 
 there said lupin sticking his own wand back into his belt armed not now will you listen 
 
 harry know what to think was it a trick 
 
 if you been helping him he said with a furious glance at black how did you know he was here 
 
 the map said lupin the map i was in my office examining it 
 
 you know how to work it harry said suspiciously 
 
 of course i know how to work it said lupin waving his hand impatiently i helped write it moony that was my friends nickname for me at school 
 
 you wrote 
 
 the important thing is i was watching it carefully this evening because i had an idea that you ron and hermione might try and sneak out of the castle to visit hagrid before his hippogriff was executed and i was right i 
 
 he had started to pace up and down looking at them little patches of dust rose at his feet 
 
 you might have been wearing your old cloak harry 
 
 how know about the cloak 
 
 the number of times i saw james disappearing under it said lupin waving an impatient hand again the point is even if wearing an invisibility cloak you still show up on the map i watched you cross the grounds and enter hut twenty minutes later you left hagrid and set off back toward the castle but you were now accompanied by somebody else 
 
 what said harry no we 
 
 i believe my eyes said lupin still pacing and ignoring interruption i thought the map must be malfunctioning how could he be with you 
 
 no one was with us said harry 
 
 and then i saw another dot moving fast toward you labeled sirius blacki saw him collide with you i watched as he pulled two of you into the whomping willow 
 
 one of us ron said angrily 
 
 no ron said lupin two of you 
 
 he had stopped his pacing his eyes moving over ron 
 
 do you think i could have a look at the rat he said evenly 
 
 what said ron scabbers got to do with it 
 
 everything said lupin could i see him please 
 
 ron hesitated then put a hand inside his robes scabbers emerged thrashing desperately ron had to seize his long bald tail to stop him escaping crookshanks stood up on leg and made a soft hissing noise 
 
 lupin moved closer to ron he seemed to be holding his breath as he gazed intently at scabbers 
 
 what ron said again holding scabbers close to him looking scared my rat got to do with anything 
 
 not a rat croaked sirius black suddenly 
 
 what mean of course a rat 
 
 no not said lupin quietly a wizard 
 
 an animagus said black by the name of peter pettigrew 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the prisoner of azkaban 
 

lionfish nov chapter seventeen the four championscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry sat there aware that every head in the great hall had turned to look at him he was stunned he felt numb he was surely dreaming he had not heard correctly 
 
 there was no applause a buzzing as though of angry bees was starting to fill the hall some students were standing up to get a better look at harry as he sat frozen in his seat 
 
 up at the top table professor mcgonagall had got to her feet and swept past ludo bagman and professor karkaroff to whisper urgently to professor dumbledore who bent his ear toward her frowning slightly 
 
 harry turned to ron and hermione beyond them he saw the long gryffindor table all watching him openmouthed 
 
 i put my name in harry said blankly you know i 
 
 both of them stared just as blankly back 
 
 at the top table professor dumbledore had straightened up nodding to professor mcgonagall 
 
 harry potter he called again harry up here if you please 
 
 go on hermione whispered giving harry a slight push 
 
 harry got to his feet trod on the hem of his robes and stumbled slightly he set off up the gap between the gryffindor and hufflepuff tables it felt like an immensely long walk the top table seem to be getting any nearer at all and he could feel hundreds and hundreds of eyes upon him as though each were a searchlight the buzzing grew louder and louder after what seemed like an hour he was right in front of dumbledore feeling the stares of all the teachers upon him 
 
 wellthrough the door harry said dumbledore he smiling 
 
 harry moved off along the teachers table hagrid was seated right at the end he did not wink at harry or wave or give any of his usual signs of greeting he looked completely astonished and stared at harry as he passed like everyone else harry went through the door out of the great hall and found himself in a smaller room lined with paintings of witches and wizards a handsome fire was roaring in the fireplace opposite him 
 
 the faces in the portraits turned to look at him as he entered he saw a wizened witch flit out of the frame of her picture and into the one next to it which contained a wizard with a walrus mustache the wizened witch started whispering in his ear 
 
 viktor krum cedric diggory and fleur delacour were grouped around the fire they looked strangely impressive silhouetted against the flames krum and brooding was leaning against the mantelpiece slightly apart from the other two cedric was standing with his hands behind his back staring into the fire fleur delacour looked around when harry walked in and threw back her sheet of long silvery hair 
 
 what is it she said do zey want us back in ze hall 
 
 she thought he had come to deliver a message harry know how to explain what had just happened he just stood there looking at the three champions it struck him how very tall all of them were 
 
 there was a sound of scurrying feet behind him and ludo bagman entered the room he took harry by the arm and led him forward 
 
 extraordinary he muttered squeezing arm absolutely extraordinary gentlemenlady he added approaching the fireside and addressing the other three may i introduce incredible though it may seem the fourth triwizard champion 
 
 viktor krum straightened up his surly face darkened as he surveyed harry cedric looked nonplussed he looked from bagman to harry and back again as though sure he must have misheard what bagman had said fleur delacour however tossed her hair smiling and said oh vairy funny joke meester bagman 
 
 joke bagman repeated bewildered no no not at all name just came out of the goblet of fire 
 
 thick eyebrows contracted slightly cedric was still looking politely bewildered fleur frowned 
 
 but evidently zair as been a mistake she said contemptuously to bagman e cannot compete e is too young 
 
 wellit is amazing said bagman rubbing his smooth chin and smiling down at harry but as you know the age restriction was only imposed this year as an extra safety measure and as his come out of the gobleti mean i think there can be any ducking out at this down in the rules obligedharry will just have to do the best he 
 
 the door behind them opened again and a large group of people came in professor dumbledore followed closely by mr crouch professor karkaroff madame maxime professor mcgonagall and professor snape harry heard the buzzing of the hundreds of students on the other side of the wall before professor mcgonagall closed the door 
 
 madame maxime said fleur at once striding over to her headmistress zey are saying zat zis little boy is to compete also 
 
 somewhere under numb disbelief he felt a ripple of anger little boy 
 
 madame maxime had drawn herself up to her full and considerable height the top of her handsome head brushed the chandelier and her gigantic bosom swelled 
 
 what is ze meaning of zis she said imperiously 
 
 rather like to know that myself dumbledore said professor karkaroff he was wearing a steely smile and his blue eyes were like chips of ice two hogwarts champions i remember anyone telling me the host school is allowed two champions or have i not read the rules carefully enough 
 
 he gave a short and nasty laugh 
 
 impossible said madame maxime whose enormous hand with its many superb opals was resting upon shoulder ogwarts cannot ave two champions it is most injust 
 
 we were under the impression that your age line would keep out younger contestants dumbledore said karkaroff his steely smile still in place though his eyes were colder than ever otherwise we would of course have brought along a wider selection of candidates from our own schools 
 
 no fault but karkaroff said snape softly his black eyes were alight with malice go blaming dumbledore for determination to break rules he has been crossing lines ever since he arrived here 
 
 thank you severus said dumbledore firmly and snape went quiet though his eyes still glinted malevolently through his curtain of greasy black hair 
 
 professor dumbledore was now looking down at harry who looked right back at him trying to discern the expression of the eyes behind the spectacles 
 
 did you put your name into the goblet of fire harry he asked calmly 
 
 no said harry he was very aware of everybody watching him closely snape made a soft noise of impatient disbelief in the shadows 
 
 did you ask an older student to put it into the goblet of fire for you said professor dumbledore ignoring snape 
 
 no said harry vehemently 
 
 ah but of course e is lying cried madame maxime snape was now shaking his head his lip curling 
 
 he could not have crossed the age line said professor mcgonagall sharply i am sure we are all agreed on that 
 
 must ave made a mistake wiz ze line said madame maxime shrugging 
 
 it is possible of course said dumbledore politely 
 
 dumbledore you know perfectly well you did not make a mistake said professor mcgonagall angrily really what nonsense harry could not have crossed the line himself and as professor dumbledore believes that he did not persuade an older student to do it for him sure that should be good enough for everybody else 
 
 she shot a very angry look at professor snape 
 
 mr crouchmr bagman said karkaroff his voice unctuous once more you are our er objective judges surely you will agree that this is most irregular 
 
 bagman wiped his round boyish face with his handkerchief and looked at mr crouch who was standing outside the circle of the firelight his face half hidden in shadow he looked slightly eerie the half darkness making him look much older giving him an almost appearance when he spoke however it was in his usual curt voice 
 
 we must follow the rules and the rules state clearly that those people whose names come out of the goblet of fire are bound to compete in the tournament 
 
 well barty knows the rule book back to front said bagman beaming and turning back to karkaroff and madame maxime as though the matter was now closed 
 
 i insist upon resubmitting the names of the rest of my students said karkaroff he had dropped his unctuous tone and his smile now his face wore a very ugly look indeed you will set up the goblet of fire once more and we will continue adding names until each school has two champions only fair dumbledore 
 
 but karkaroff it work like that said bagman the goblet of just gone out it reignite until the start of the next tournament 
 
 in which durmstrang will most certainly not be competing exploded karkaroff after all our meetings and negotiations and compromises i little expected something of this nature to occur i have half a mind to leave now 
 
 empty threat karkaroff growled a voice from near the door you leave your champion now got to compete all got to compete binding magical contract like dumbledore said convenient eh 
 
 moody had just entered the room he limped toward the fire and with every right step he took there was a loud clunk 
 
 convenient said karkaroff afraid i understand you moody 
 
 harry could tell he was trying to sound disdainful as though what moody was saying was barely worth his notice but his hands gave him away they had balled themselves into fists 
 
 you said moody quietly very simple karkaroff someone put name in that goblet knowing have to compete if it came out 
 
 evidently someone oo wished to give ogwarts two bites at ze apple said madame maxime 
 
 i quite agree madame maxime said karkaroff bowing to her i shall be lodging complaints with the ministry of magic and the international confederation of wizards 
 
 if got reason to complain potter growled moody butfunny thingi hear him saying a word 
 
 why should e complain burst out fleur delacour stamping her foot e as ze chance to compete e we ave all been oping to be chosen for weeks and weeks ze honor for our schools a thousand galleons in prize money zis is a chance many would die for 
 
 maybe hoping potter is going to die for it said moody with the merest trace of a growl 
 
 an extremely tense silence followed these words ludo bagman who was looking very anxious indeed bounced nervously up and down on his feet and said moody old manwhat a thing to say 
 
 we all know professor moody considers the morning wasted if he discovered six plots to murder him before lunchtime said karkaroff loudly apparently he is now teaching his students to fear assassination too an odd quality in a defense against the dark arts teacher dumbledore but no doubt you had your reasons 
 
 imagining things am i growled moody seeing things eh it was a skilled witch or wizard who put the name in that goblet 
 
 ah what evidence is zere of zat said madame maxime throwing up her huge hands 
 
 because they hoodwinked a very powerful magical object said moody it would have needed an exceptionally strong confundus charm to bamboozle that goblet into forgetting that only three schools compete in the guessing they submitted name under a fourth school to make sure he was the only one in his category 
 
 you seem to have given this a great deal of thought moody said karkaroff coldly and a very ingenious theory it is though of course i heard you recently got it into your head that one of your birthday presents contained a cunningly disguised basilisk egg and smashed it to pieces before realizing it was a carriage clock so understand if we take you entirely seriously 
 
 there are those turn innocent occasions to their advantage moody retorted in a menacing voice my job to think the way dark wizards do karkaroff as you ought to remember 
 
 alastor said dumbledore warningly harry wondered for a moment whom he was speaking to but then realized could hardly be real first name moody fell silent though still surveying karkaroff with satisfaction face was burning 
 
 how this situation arose we do not know said dumbledore speaking to everyone gathered in the room it seems to me however that we have no choice but to accept it both cedric and harry have been chosen to compete in the tournament this therefore they will do 
 
 ah but 
 
 my dear madame maxime if you have an alternative i would be delighted to hear it 
 
 dumbledore waited but madame maxime did not speak she merely glared she the only one either snape looked furious karkaroff livid bagman however looked rather excited 
 
 well shall we crack on then he said rubbing his hands together and smiling around the room got to give our champions their instructions we barty want to do the honors 
 
 mr crouch seemed to come out of a deep reverie 
 
 yes he said instructions yesthe first task 
 
 he moved forward into the firelight close up harry thought he looked ill there were dark shadows beneath his eyes and a thin papery look about his wrinkled skin that had not been there at the quidditch world cup 
 
 the first task is designed to test your daring he told harry cedric fleur and viktor so we are not going to be telling you what it is courage in the face of the unknown is an important quality in a wizardvery important 
 
 the first task will take place on november the in front of the other students and the panel of judges 
 
 the champions are not permitted to ask for or accept help of any kind from their teachers to complete the tasks in the tournament the champions will face the first challenge armed only with their wands they will receive information about the second task when the first is over owing to the demanding and nature of the tournament the champions are exempted from tests 
 
 mr crouch turned to look at dumbledore 
 
 i think all is it albus 
 
 i think so said dumbledore who was looking at mr crouch with mild concern are you sure you like to stay at hogwarts tonight barty 
 
 no dumbledore i must get back to the ministry said mr crouch it is a very busy very difficult time at the left young weatherby in enthusiastica little overenthusiastic if truth be told 
 
 come and have a drink before you go at least said dumbledore 
 
 come on barry staying said bagman brightly all happening at hogwarts now you know much more exciting here than at the office 
 
 i think not ludo said crouch with a touch of his old impatience 
 
 professor karkaroff madame maxime a nightcap said dumbledore 
 
 but madame maxime had already put her arm around shoulders and was leading her swiftly out of the room harry could hear them both talking very fast in french as they went off into the great hall karkaroff beckoned to krum and they too exited though in silence 
 
 harry cedric i suggest you go up to bed said dumbledore smiling at both of them i am sure gryffindor and hufflepuff are waiting to celebrate with you and it would be a shame to deprive them of this excellent excuse to make a great deal of mess and noise 
 
 harry glanced at cedric who nodded and they left together 
 
 the great hall was deserted now the candles had burned low giving the jagged smiles of the pumpkins an eerie flickering quality 
 
 so said cedric with a slight smile playing against each other again 
 
 i said harry he really think of anything to say the inside of his head seemed to be in complete disarray as though his brain had been ransacked 
 
 sotell me said cedric as they reached the entrance hall which was now lit only by torches in the absence of the goblet of fire how did you get your name in 
 
 i said harry staring up at him i put it in i was telling the truth 
 
 ahokay said cedric harry could tell cedric believe him wellsee you then 
 
 instead of going up the marble staircase cedric headed for a door to its right harry stood listening to him going down the stone steps beyond it then slowly he started to climb the marble ones 
 
 was anyone except ron and hermione going to believe him or would they all think put himself in for the tournament yet how could anyone think that when he was facing competitors had three years more magical education than he had when he was now facing tasks that not only sounded very dangerous but which were to be performed in front of hundreds of people yes thought about fantasized about itbut it had been a joke really an idle sort of never really seriously considered entering 
 
 but someone else had considered itsomeone else had wanted him in the tournament and had made sure he was entered why to give him a treat he think so somehow 
 
 to see him make a fool of himself well they were likely to get their wish 
 
 but to get him killed 
 
 was moody just being his usual paranoid self someone have put name in the goblet as a trick a practical joke did anyone really want him dead 
 
 harry was able to answer that at once yes someone wanted him dead someone had wanted him dead ever since he had been a year oldlord voldemort but how could voldemort have ensured that name got into the goblet of fire voldemort was supposed to be far away in some distant country in hiding alonefeeble and powerless 
 
 yet in that dream he had had just before he had awoken with his scar hurting voldemort had not been alonehe had been talking to wormtailplotting murder 
 
 harry got a shock to find himself facing the fat lady already he had barely noticed where his feet were carrying him it was also a surprise to see that she was not alone in her frame the wizened witch who had flitted into her painting when he had joined the champions downstairs was now sitting smugly beside the fat lady she must have dashed through every picture lining seven staircases to reach here before him both she and the fat lady were looking down at him with the keenest interest 
 
 well well well said the fat lady just told me everything just been chosen as school champion then 
 
 balderdash said harry dully 
 
 it most certainly said the pale witch indignantly 
 
 no no vi the password said the fat lady soothingly and she swung forward on her hinges to let harry into the common room 
 
 the blast of noise that met ears when the portrait opened almost knocked him backward next thing he knew he was being wrenched inside the common room by about a dozen pairs of hands and was facing the whole of gryffindor house all of whom were screaming applauding and whistling 
 
 you told us entered bellowed fred he looked half annoyed half deeply impressed 
 
 how did you do it without getting a beard brilliant roared george 
 
 i harry said i know how 
 
 but angelina had now swooped down upon him oh if it be me at least a gryffindor 
 
 be able to pay back diggory for that last quidditch match harry shrieked katie bell another of the gryffindor chasers 
 
 got food harry come and have some 
 
 not hungry i had enough at the feast 
 
 but nobody wanted to hear that he hungry nobody wanted to hear that he put his name in the goblet not one single person seemed to have noticed that he at all in the mood to jordan had unearthed a gryffindor banner from somewhere and he insisted on draping it around harry like a cloak harry get away whenever he tried to sidle over to the staircase up to the dormitories the crowd around him closed ranks forcing another butterbeer on him stuffing crisps and peanuts into his wanted to know how he had done it how he had tricked age line and managed to get his name into the goblet 
 
 i he said over and over again i know how it happened 
 
 but for all the notice anyone took he might just as well not have answered at all 
 
 tired he bellowed finally after nearly half an hour no seriously george going to bed 
 
 he wanted more than anything to find ron and hermione to find a bit of sanity but neither of them seemed to be in the common room insisting that he needed to sleep and almost flattening the little creevey brothers as they attempted to waylay him at the foot of the stairs harry managed to shake everyone off and climb up to the dormitory as fast as he could 
 
 to his great relief he found ron was lying on his bed in the otherwise empty dormitory still fully dressed he looked up when harry slammed the door behind him 
 
 you been harry said 
 
 oh hello said ron 
 
 he was grinning but it was a very odd strained sort of grin harry suddenly became aware that he was still wearing the scarlet gryffindor banner that lee had tied around him he hastened to take it off but it was knotted very tightly ron lay on the bed without moving watching harry struggle to remove it 
 
 so he said when harry had finally removed the banner and thrown it into a corner congratulations 
 
 what mean congratulations said harry staring at ron there was definitely something wrong with the way ron was smiling it was more like a grimace 
 
 wellno one else got across the age line said ron not even fred and george what did you use the invisibility cloak 
 
 the invisibility cloak have got me over that line said harry slowly 
 
 oh right said ron i thought you told me if it was the cloakbecause it covered both of us it but you found another way did you 
 
 listen said harry i put my name in that goblet someone else done it 
 
 ron raised his eyebrows 
 
 what would they do that for 
 
 i dunno said harry he felt it would sound very melodramatic to say to kill me 
 
 eyebrows rose so high that they were in danger of disappearing into his hair 
 
 okay you know you can tell me the truth he said if you want everyone else to know fine but i know why bothering to lie you get into trouble for it did you that friend of the fat that violet already told us all letting you enter a thousand galleons prize money eh and you have to do tests either 
 
 i put my name in that goblet said harry starting to feel angry 
 
 yeah okay said ron in exactly the same sceptical tone as cedric only you said this morning have done it last night and no one seen not stupid you know 
 
 doing a really good impression of it harry snapped 
 
 yeah said ron and there was no trace of a grin forced or otherwise on his face now you want to get to bed harry i expect need to be up early tomorrow for a or something 
 
 he wrenched the hangings shut around his leaving harry standing there by the door staring at the dark red velvet curtains now hiding one of the few people he had been sure would believe him 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire 
 

lionfish nov chapter seventeen educational decree number prev chapter next chapter 
 harry felt happier for the rest of the weekend than he had done all term he and ron spent much of sunday catching up with all their homework again and although this could hardly be called fun the last burst of autumn sunshine persisted so rather than sitting hunched over tables in the common room they took their work outside and lounged in the shade of a large beech tree on the edge of the lake hermione who of course was up to date with all her work brought more wool outside with her and bewitched her knitting needles so that they flashed and clicked in midair beside her producing more hats and scarves 
 
 knowing they were doing something to resist umbridge and the ministry and that he was a key part of the rebellion gave harry a feeling of immense satisfaction he kept reliving saturdays meeting in his mind all those people coming to him to learn defence against the dark arts and the looks on their faces as they had heard some of the things he had done and cho praising his performance in the triwizard tournamentknowing all those people did not think him a lying weirdo but someone to be admired buoyed him up so much that he was still cheerful on monday morning despite the imminent prospect of all his least favourite classes 
 
 he and ron headed downstairs from their dormitory discussing idea that they were to work on a new move called the sloth grip roll during that nights quidditch practice and not until they were halfway across the sunlit common room did they notice the addition to the room that had already attracted the attention of a small group of people 
 
 a large sign had been affixed to the grffindor noticeboard so large it covered everything else on itthe lists of secondhand spellbooks for sale the regular reminders of school rules from argus filch the quidditch team training timetable the offers to barter certain chocolate frog cards for others the weasleys latest advertisement for testers the dates of the hogsmeade weekends and the lost and found notices the new sign was printed in large black letters and there was a highly seal at the bottom beside a neat and curly signature 
 
 by order of the high inquisitor of hogwarts

 henceforth disbanded

 number 
 
 
 
 signed dolores jane umbridge high inquisitor 
 
 harry and ron read the notice over the heads of some 
 
 does this mean going to shut down the gobstones club one of them asked his friend 
 
 i reckon be ok with gobstones ron said darkly making the jump i think going to be as lucky though do you he asked harry as the hurried away 
 
 harry was reading the notice through again the happiness that had filled him since saturday was gone his insides were pulsing with rage 
 
 this a coincidence he said his hands forming fists she knows 
 
 she said ron at once 
 
 there were people listening in that pub and face it we know how many of the people who turned up we can trust any of them could have run off and told umbridge 
 
 and he had thought they believed him thought they even admired him 
 
 zacharias smith said ron at once punching a fist into his hand ori thought that michael corner had a really shifty look too 
 
 i wonder if seen this yet harry said looking round at the door to the girls dormitories 
 
 go and tell her said ron he bounded forwards pulled open the door and set off up the spiral staircase 
 
 he was on the sixth stair when there was a loud wailing sound and the steps melted together to make a long smooth stone slide like a there was a brief moment when ron tried to keep running arms working madly like windmills then he toppled over backwards and shot down the newly created slide coming to rest on his back at feet 
 
 eri think allowed in the girls dormitories said harry pulling ron to his feet and trying not to laugh 
 
 two girls came zooming gleefully down the stone slide 
 
 oooh who tried to get upstairs they giggled happily leaping to their feet and ogling harry and ron 
 
 me said ron who was still rather dishevelled i realise that would happen not fair he added to harry as the girls headed off for the portrait hole still giggling madly allowed in our dormitory how come not allowed 
 
 well an rule said hermione who had just slid neatly on to a rug in front of them and was now getting to her feet but it says in hogwarts a history that the founders thought boys were less trustworthy than girls anyway why were you trying to get in there 
 
 to see youlook at this said ron dragging her over to the noticeboard 
 
 eyes slid rapidly down the notice her expression became stony 
 
 someone must have blabbed to her ron said angrily 
 
 they have done said hermione in a low voice 
 
 so naive said ron you think just because all honourable and trustworthy 
 
 no they have done because i put a jinx on that piece of parchment we all signed said hermione grimly believe me if run off and told umbridge know exactly who they are and they will really regret it 
 
 happen to them said ron eagerly 
 
 well put it this way said hermione make eloise acne look like a couple of cute freckles come on get down to breakfast and see what the others think i wonder whether this has been put up in all the houses 
 
 it was immediately apparent on entering the great hall that sign had not only appeared in gryffindor tower there was a peculiar intensity about the chatter and an extra measure of movement in the hall as people scurried up and down their tables conferring on what they had read harry ron and hermione had barely taken their seats when neville dean fred george and ginny descended upon them 
 
 did you see it 
 
 reckon she knows 
 
 what are we going to do 
 
 they were all looking at harry he glanced around to make sure there were no teachers near them 
 
 going to do it anyway of course he said quietly 
 
 knew say that said george beaming and thumping harry on the arm 
 
 the prefects as well said fred looking quizzically at ron and hermione 
 
 of course said hermione coolly 
 
 here come ernie and hannah abbott said ron looking over his shoulder and those ravenclaw blokes and smith and no one looks very spotty 
 
 hermione looked alarmed 
 
 never mind spots the idiots come over here now look really suspicioussit down she mouthed to ernie and hannah gesturing frantically to them to rejoin the hufflepuff table later 
 
 tell michael said ginny impatiently swinging herself off her bench the fool honestly 
 
 she hurried off towards the ravenclaw table harry watched her go cho was sitting not far away talking to the friend she had brought along to the head would notice scare her off meeting them again 
 
 but the full repercussions of the sign were not felt until they were leaving the great hall for history of magic 
 
 harry ron 
 
 it was angelina and she was hurrying towards them looking perfectly desperate 
 
 ok said harry quietly when she was near enough to hear him still going to 
 
 you realise including quidditch in this angelina said over him we have to go and ask permission to the gryffindor team 
 
 what said harry 
 
 no way said ron appalled 
 
 you read the sign it mentions teams too so listen harry i am saying this for the last time please please lose your temper with umbridge again or she might not let us play any more 
 
 ok ok said harry for angelina looked as though she was on the verge of tears worry behave myself 
 
 bet umbridge is in history of magic said ron grimly as they set off for lesson she inspected binns yet bet you anything there 
 
 but he was wrong the only teacher present when they entered was professor binns floating an inch or so above his chair as usual and preparing to continue his monotonous drone on giant wars harry did not even attempt to follow what he was saying today he doodled idly on his parchment ignoring frequent glares and nudges until a particularly painful poke in the ribs made him look up angrily 
 
 what 
 
 she pointed at the window harry looked round hedwig was perched on the narrow window ledge gazing through the thick glass at him a letter tied to her leg harry could not understand it they had just had breakfast why on earth she delivered the letter then as usual many of his classmates were pointing out hedwig to each other too 
 
 oh always loved that owl so beautiful harry heard lavender sigh to parvati 
 
 he glanced round at professor binns who continued to read his notes serenely unaware that the attention was even less focused upon him than usual harry slipped quietly off his chair crouched down and hurried along the row to the window where he slid the catch and opened it very slowly 
 
 he had expected hedwig to hold out her leg so that he could remove the letter and then fly off to the owlery but the moment the window was open wide enough she hopped inside hooting dolefully he closed the window with an anxious glance at professor binns crouched low again and sped back to his seat with hedwig on his shoulder he regained his seat transferred hedwig to his lap and made to remove the letter tied to her leg 
 
 only then did he realise that feathers were oddly ruffled some were bent the wrong way and she was holding one of her wings at an odd angle 
 
 hurt harry whispered bending his head low over her hermione and ron leaned in closer hermione even put down her quill something wrong with her wing 
 
 hedwig was quivering when harry made to touch the wing she gave a little jump all her feathers on end as though she was inflating herself and gazed at him reproachfully 
 
 professor binns said harry loudly and everyone in the class turned to look at him not feeling well 
 
 professor binns raised his eyes from his notes looking amazed as always to find the room in front of him full of people 
 
 not feeling well he repeated hazily 
 
 not at all well said harry firmly getting to his feet with hedwig concealed behind his back i think i need to go to the hospital wing 
 
 yes said professor binns clearly very much yes yes hospital wing well off you go then perkins 
 
 once outside the room harry returned hedwig to his shoulder and hurried off up the corridor pausing to think only when he was out of sight of door his first choice of somebody to cure hedwig would have been hagrid of course but as he had no idea where hagrid was his only remaining option was to find professor and hope she would help 
 
 he peered out of a window at the blustery overcast grounds there was no sign of her anywhere near cabin if she was not teaching she was probably in the staff room he set off downstairs hedwig hooting feebly as she swayed on his shoulder 
 
 two stone gargoyles flanked the door as harry approached one of them croaked you should be in class sonny jim 
 
 this is urgent said harry curtly 
 
 ooooh urgent is it said the other gargoyle in a voice well put us in our place it 
 
 harry knocked he heard footsteps then the door opened and he found himself face to face with professor mcgonagall 
 
 you been given another detention she said at once her square spectacles flashing alarmingly 
 
 no professor said harry hastily 
 
 well then why are you out of class 
 
 urgent apparently said the second gargoyle snidely 
 
 looking for professor harry explained my owl injured 
 
 injured owl did you say 
 
 professor appeared at professor shoulder smoking a pipe and holding a copy of the daily prophet 
 
 yes said harry lifting hedwig carefully off his shoulder she turned up after the other post owls and her all funny look 
 
 professor stuck her pipe firmly between her teeth and took hedwig from harry while professor mcgonagall watched 
 
 hmm said professor her pipe waggling slightly as she talked looks like attacked her think what would have done it though thestrals will sometimes go for birds of course but got the hogwarts thestrals not to touch owls 
 
 harry neither knew nor cared what thestrals were he just wanted to know that hedwig was going to be all right professor mcgonagall however looked sharply at harry and said do you know how far this travelled potter 
 
 er said harry from london i think 
 
 he met her eyes briefly and knew by the way her eyebrows had joined in the middle that she understood london to mean number twelve grimmauld place 
 
 professor pulled a monocle out of the inside of her robes and screwed it into her eye to examine wing closely i should be able to sort this out if you leave her with me potter she said she be flying long distances for a few days in any case 
 
 errightthanks said harry just as the bell rang for break 
 
 no problem said professor gruffly turning back into the staff room 
 
 just a moment wilhelmina said professor mcgonagall letter 
 
 oh yeah said harry who had momentarily forgotten the scroll tied to leg professor handed it over and then disappeared into the staff room carrying hedwig who was staring at harry as though unable to believe he would give her away like this feeling slightly guilty he turned to go but professor mcgonagall called him back 
 
 potter 
 
 yes professor 
 
 she glanced up and down the corridor there were students coming from both directions 
 
 bear in mind she said quickly and quietly her eyes on the scroll in his hand that channels of communication in and out of hogwarts may be being watched you 
 
 i said harry but the flood of students rolling along the corridor was almost upon him professor mcgonagall gave him a curt nod and retreated into the staff room leaving harry to be swept out into the courtyard with the crowd he spotted ron and hermione already standing in a sheltered corner their cloak collars turned up against the wind harry slit open the scroll as he hurried towards them and found five words in handwriting 
 
 today same time same place 
 
 is hedwig ok asked hermione anxiously the moment he was within earshot 
 
 where did you take her asked ron 
 
 to said harry and i met mcgonagall listen 
 
 and he told them what professor mcgonagall had said to his surprise neither of the others looked shocked on the contrary they exchanged significant looks 
 
 what said harry looking from ron to hermione and back again 
 
 well i was just saying to ron what if someone had tried to intercept hedwig i mean never been hurt on a flight before has she 
 
 the letter from anyway asked ron taking the note from harry 
 
 snuffles said harry quietly 
 
 same time same place does he mean the fire in the common room 
 
 obviously said hermione also reading the note she looked uneasy i just hope nobody else has read this 
 
 but it was still sealed and everything said harry trying to convince himself as much as her and nobody would understand what it meant if they know where spoken to him before would they 
 
 i know said hermione anxiously hitching her bag back over her shoulder as the bell rang again it be exactly difficult to the scroll by magic and if watching the floo network but i really see how we can warn him not to come without that being intercepted too 
 
 they trudged down the stone steps to the dungeons for potions all three of them lost in thought but as they reached the bottom of the steps they were recalled to themselves by the voice of draco malfoy who was standing just outside classroom door waving around an piece of parchment and talking much louder than was necessary so that they could hear every word 
 
 yeah umbridge gave the slytherin quidditch team permission to continue playing straightaway i went to ask her first thing this morning well it was pretty much automatic i mean she knows my father really well always popping in and out of the ministry be interesting to see whether gryffindor are allowed to keep playing it 
 
 rise hermione whispered imploringly to harry and ron who were both watching malfoy faces set and fists clenched what he wants 
 
 i mean said malfoy raising his voice a little more his grey eyes glittering malevolently in harry and direction if a question of influence with the ministry i think got much chance from what my father says been looking for an excuse to sack arthur weasley for years and as for potter my father says a matter of time before the ministry has him carted off to st apparently got a special ward for people whose brains have been addled by magic 
 
 malfoy made a grotesque face his mouth sagging open and his eyes rolling crabbe and goyle gave their usual grunts of laughter pansy parkinson shrieked with glee 
 
 something collided hard with shoulder knocking him sideways a split second later he realised that neville had just charged past him heading straight for malfoy 
 
 neville no 
 
 harry leapt forward and seized the back of robes neville struggled frantically his fists flailing trying desperately to get at malfoy who looked for a moment extremely shocked 
 
 help me harry flung at ron managing to get an arm around neck and dragging him backwards away from the slytherins crabbe and goyle were flexing their arms as they stepped in front of malfoy ready for the fight ron seized arms and together he and harry succeeded in dragging neville back into the gryffindor line nevilles face was scarlet the pressure harry was exerting on his throat rendered him quite incomprehensible but odd words spluttered from his mouth 
 
 not funny show him 
 
 the dungeon door opened snape appeared there his black eyes swept up the gryffindor line to the point where harry and ron were wrestling with neville 
 
 fighting potter weasley longbottom snape said in his cold sneering voice ten points from gryffindor release longbottom potter or it will be detention inside all of you 
 
 harry let go of neville who stood panting and glaring at him 
 
 i had to stop you harry gasped picking up his bag crabbe and goyle torn you apart 
 
 neville said nothing he merely snatched up his own bag and stalked off into the dungeon 
 
 what in the name of merlin said ron slowly as they followed neville was that about 
 
 harry did not answer he knew exactly why the subject of people who were in st because of magical damage to their brains was highly distressing to neville but he had sworn to dumbledore that he would not tell anyone secret even neville did not know harry knew 
 
 harry ron and hermione took their usual seats at the back of the class pulled out parchment quills and their copies of one thousand magical herbs and class around them was whispering about what neville had just done but when snape closed the dungeon door with an echoing bang everybody immediately fell silent 
 
 you will notice said snape in his low sneering voice that we have a guest with us today 
 
 he gestured towards the dim corner of the dungeon and harry saw professor umbridge sitting there clipboard on her knee he glanced sideways at ron and hermione his eyebrows raised snape and umbridge the two teachers he hated most it was hard to decide which one he wanted to triumph over the other 
 
 we are continuing with our strengthening solution today you will find your mixtures as you left them last lesson it correctly made they should have matured well over the weekendinstructions he waved his wand again on the board carry on 
 
 professor umbridge spent the first half hour of the lesson making notes in her corner harry was very interested in hearing her question snape so interested that he was becoming careless with his potion again 
 
 salamander blood harry hermione moaned grabbing his wrist to prevent him adding the wrong ingredient for the third time not pomegranate juice 
 
 right said harry vaguely putting down the bottle and continuing to watch the corner umbridge had just got to her feet ha he said softly as she strode between two lines of desks towards snape who was bending over dean cauldron 
 
 well the class seem fairly advanced for their level she said briskly to back though i would question whether it is advisable to teach them a potion like the strengthening solution i think the ministry would prefer it if that was removed from the syllabus 
 
 snape straightened up slowly and turned to look at her 
 
 now how long have you been teaching at hogwarts she asked her quill poised over her clipboard 
 
 fourteen years snape replied his expression was unfathomable harry watching him closely added a few drops to his potion it hissed menacingly and turned from turquoise to orange 
 
 you applied first for the defence against the dark arts post i believe professor umbridge asked snape 
 
 yes said snape quietly 
 
 but you were unsuccessful 
 
 lip curled 
 
 obviously 
 
 professor umbridge scribbled on her clipboard 
 
 and you have applied regularly for the defence against the dark arts post since you first joined the school i believe 
 
 yes said snape quietly barely moving his lips he looked very angry 
 
 do you have any idea why dumbledore has consistently refused to appoint you asked umbridge 
 
 i suggest you ask him said snape jerkily 
 
 oh i shall said professor umbridge with a sweet smile 
 
 i suppose this is relevant snape asked his black eyes narrowed 
 
 oh yes said professor umbridge yes the ministry wants a thorough understanding of 
 
 she turned away walked over to pansy parkinson and began questioning her about the lessons snape looked round at harry and their eyes met for a second harry hastily dropped his gaze to his potion which was now congealing foully and giving off a strong smell of burned rubber 
 
 no marks again then potter said snape maliciously emptying cauldron with a wave of his wand you will write me an essay on the correct composition of this potion indicating how and why you went wrong to be handed in next lesson do you understand 
 
 yes said harry furiously snape had already given them homework and he had quidditch practice this evening this would mean another couple of sleepless nights it did not seem possible that he had awoken that morning feeling very happy all he felt now was a fervent desire for this day to end 
 
 maybe skive off divination he said glumly as they stood in the courtyard after lunch the wind whipping at the hems of robes and brims of hats pretend to be ill and do essay instead then i have to stay up half the night 
 
 you skive off divination said hermione severely 
 
 hark talking you walked out of divination you hate trelawney said ron indignantly 
 
 i hate her said hermione loftily i just think an absolutely appalling teacher and a real old fraud but already missed history of magic and i think he ought to miss anything else today 
 
 there was too much truth in this to ignore so half an hour later harry took his seat in the hot overperfumed atmosphere of the divination classroom feeling angry at everybody professor trelawney was yet again handing out copies of the dream thought surely be much better employed doing punishment essay than sitting here trying to find meaning in a lot of dreams 
 
 it seemed however that he was not the only person in divination who was in a temper professor trelawney slammed a copy of the oracle down on the table between harry and ron and swept away her lips pursed she threw the next copy of the oracle at seamus and dean narrowly avoiding head and thrust the final one into chest with such force that he slipped off his pouffe 
 
 well carry on said professor trelawney loudly her voice and somewhat hysterical you know what to do or am i such a teacher that you have never learned how to open a book 
 
 the class stared perplexedly at her then at each other harry however thought he knew what was the matter as professor trelawney flounced back to the teachers chair her magnified eyes full of angry tears he leaned his head closer to and muttered i think got the results of her inspection back 
 
 professor said parvati patil in a hushed voice she and lavender had always rather admired professor trelawney professor is there anythingerwrong 
 
 wrong cried professor trelawney in a voice throbbing with emotion certainly not i have been insulted certainly insinuations have been made against me unfounded accusations levelled but no there is nothing wrong certainly not 
 
 she took a great shuddering breath and looked away from parvati angry tears spilling from under her glasses 
 
 i say nothing she choked of sixteen years of devoted service it has passed apparently unnoticed but i shall not be insulted no i shall not 
 
 but professor insulting you asked parvati timidly 
 
 the establishment said professor trelawney in a deep dramatic wavering voice yes those with eyes too clouded by the mundane to see as i see to know as i know of course we seers have always been feared always persecuted it isalasour fate 
 
 she gulped dabbed at her wet cheeks with the end of her shawl then she pulled a small embroidered handkerchief from her sleeve and blew her nose very hard with a sound like peeves blowing a raspberry 
 
 ron sniggered lavender shot him a disgusted look 
 
 professor said parvati do you mean is it something professor umbridge 
 
 do not speak to me about that woman cried professor trelawney leaping to her feet her beads rattling and her spectacles flashing kindly continue with your work 
 
 and she spent the rest of the lesson striding among them tears still leaking from behind her glasses muttering what sounded like threats under her breath 
 
 may well choose to leave the indignity of it on probation we shall see how she dares 
 
 you and umbridge have got something in common harry told hermione quietly when they met again in defence against the dark arts she obviously reckons an old fraud too looks like put her on probation 
 
 umbridge entered the room as he spoke wearing her black velvet bow and an expression of great smugness 
 
 good afternoon class 
 
 good afternoon professor umbridge they chanted dully 
 
 wands away please 
 
 but there was no answering flurry of movement this time nobody had bothered to take out their wands 
 
 please turn to page of defensive magical theory and read the third chapter entitled the case for responses to magical attack there will be 
 
 no need to talk harry ron and hermione said together under their breaths 
 
 no quidditch practice said angelina in hollow tones when harry ron and hermione entered the common room after dinner that night 
 
 but i kept my temper said harry horrified i say anything to her angelina i swear i 
 
 i know i know said angelina miserably she just said she needed a bit of time to consider 
 
 consider what said ron angrily given the slytherins permission why not us 
 
 but harry could imagine how much umbridge was enjoying holding the threat of no gryffindor quidditch team over their heads and could easily understand why she would not want to relinquish that weapon over them too soon 
 
 well said hermione look on the bright sideat least now have time to do essay 
 
 a bright side is it snapped harry while ron stared incredulously at hermione no quidditch practice and extra potions 
 
 harry slumped down into a chair dragged his potions essay reluctantly from his bag and set to work it was very hard to concentrate even though he knew sirius was not due in the fire until much later he could not help glancing into the flames every few minutes just in case there was also an incredible amount of noise in the room fred and george appeared finally to have perfected one type of skiving snackbox which they were taking turns to demonstrate to a cheering and whooping crowd 
 
 first fred would take a bite out of the orange end of a chew at which he would vomit spectacularly into a bucket they had placed in front of them then he would force down the purple end of the chew at which the vomiting would immediately cease lee jordan who was assisting the demonstration was lazily vanishing the vomit at regular intervals with the same vanishing spell snape kept using on potions 
 
 what with the regular sounds of retching cheering and the sound of fred and george taking advance orders from the crowd harry was finding it exceptionally difficult to focus on the correct method for strengthening solution hermione was not helping matters the cheers and the sound of vomit hitting the bottom of fred and bucket were punctuated by her loud and disapproving sniffs which harry found if anything more distracting 
 
 just go and stop them then he said irritably after crossing out the wrong weight of powdered griffin claw for the fourth time 
 
 i not technically doing anything wrong said hermione through gritted teeth quite within their rights to eat the foul things themselves and i find a rule that says the other idiots entitled to buy them not unless proven to be dangerous in some way and it look as though they are 
 
 she harry and ron watched george into the bucket gulp down the rest of the chew and straighten up beaming with his arms wide to protracted applause 
 
 you know i get why fred and george only got three owls each said harry watching as fred george and lee collected gold from the eager crowd they really know their stuff 
 
 oh they only know flashy stuff of no real use to anyone said hermione disparagingly 
 
 no real use said ron in a strained voice hermione made about galleons already 
 
 it was a long while before the crowd around the weasley twins dispersed then fred lee and george sat up counting their takings even longer so it was well past midnight when harry ron and hermione finally had the common room to themselves at long last fred had closed the doorway to the boys dormitories behind him rattling his box of galleons ostentatiously so that hermione scowled harry who was making very little progress with his potions essay decided to give it up for the night as he put his books away ron who was dozing lightly in an armchair gave a muffled grunt awoke and looked blearily into the fire 
 
 sirius he said 
 
 harry whipped round untidy dark head was sitting in the fire again 
 
 hi he said grinning 
 
 hi chorused harry ron and hermione all three kneeling down on the hearthrug crookshanks purred loudly and approached the fire trying despite the heat to put his face close to 
 
 things said sirius 
 
 not that good said harry as hermione pulled crookshanks back to stop him singeing his whiskers the forced through another decree which means not allowed to have quidditch teams 
 
 or secret defence against the dark arts groups said sirius 
 
 there was a short pause 
 
 how did you know about that harry demanded 
 
 you want to choose your meeting places more carefully said sirius grinning still more broadly the head i ask you 
 
 well it was better than the three broomsticks said hermione defensively always packed with people 
 
 which means have been harder to overhear said sirius got a lot to learn hermione 
 
 who overheard us harry demanded 
 
 mundungus of course said sirius and when they all looked puzzled he laughed he was the witch under the veil 
 
 that was mundungus harry said stunned what was he doing in the head 
 
 what do you think he was doing said sirius impatiently keeping an eye on you of course 
 
 still being followed asked harry angrily 
 
 yeah you are said sirius and just as well it if the first thing going to do on your weekend off is organise an illegal defence group 
 
 but he looked neither angry nor worried on the contrary he was looking at harry with distinct pride 
 
 why was dung hiding from us asked ron sounding disappointed liked seen him 
 
 he was banned from the head twenty years ago said sirius and that got a long memory we lost spare invisibility cloak when sturgis was arrested so been dressing as a witch a lot lately anyway first of all sworn to pass on a message from your mother 
 
 oh yeah said ron sounding apprehensive 
 
 she says on no account whatsoever are you to take part in an illegal secret defence against the dark arts group she says be expelled for sure and your future will be ruined she says there will be plenty of time to learn how to defend yourself later and that you are too young to be worrying about that right now she also eyes turned to the other two advises harry and hermione not to proceed with the group though she accepts that she has no authority over either of them and simply begs them to remember that she has their best interests at heart she would have written all this to you but if the owl had been intercepted all have been in real trouble and she say it for herself because on duty tonight 
 
 on duty doing what said ron quickly 
 
 never you mind just stuff for the order said sirius so fallen to me to be the messenger and make sure you tell her i passed it all on because i think she trusts me to 
 
 there was another pause in which crookshanks mewing attempted to paw head and ron fiddled with a hole in the hearthrug 
 
 so you want me to say not going to take part in the defence group he muttered finally 
 
 me certainly not said sirius looking surprised i think an excellent idea 
 
 you do said harry his heart lifting 
 
 of course i do said sirius think your father and i lain down and taken orders from an old hag like umbridge 
 
 butlast term all you did was tell me to be careful and not take risks 
 
 last year all the evidence was that someone inside hogwarts was trying to kill you harry said sirius impatiently this year we know someone outside hogwarts like to kill us all so i think learning to defend yourselves properly is a very good idea 
 
 and if we do get expelled hermione asked a quizzical look on her face 
 
 hermione this whole thing was your idea said harry staring at her 
 
 i know it was i just wondered what sirius thought she said shrugging 
 
 well better expelled and able to defend yourselves than sitting safely in school without a clue said sirius 
 
 hear hear said harry and ron enthusiastically 
 
 so said sirius how are you organising this group where are you meeting 
 
 well a bit of a problem now said harry dunno where going to be able to go 
 
 how about the shrieking shack suggested sirius 
 
 hey an idea said ron excitedly but hermione made a sceptical noise and all three of them looked at her head turning in the flames 
 
 well sirius just that there were only four of you meeting in the shrieking shack when you were at school said hermione and all of you could transform into animals and i suppose you could all have squeezed under a single invisibility cloak if wanted to but there are of us and none of us is an animagus so we need so much an invisibility cloak as an invisibility marquee 
 
 fair point said sirius looking slightly crestfallen well sure come up with somewhere there used to be a pretty roomy secret passageway behind that big mirror on the fourth floor you might have enough space to practise jinxes in there 
 
 fred and george told me blocked said harry shaking his head caved in or something 
 
 oh said sirius frowning well have a think and get back to 
 
 he broke off his face was suddenly tense alarmed he turned sideways apparently looking into the solid brick wall of the fireplace 
 
 sirius said harry anxiously 
 
 but he had vanished harry gaped at the flames for a moment then turned to look at ron and hermione 
 
 why did he 
 
 hermione gave a horrified gasp and leapt to her feet still staring at the fire 
 
 a hand had appeared amongst the flames groping as though to catch hold of something a stubby hand covered in ugly rings 
 
 the three of them ran for it at the door of the boys dormitory harry looked back hand was still making snatching movements amongst the flames as though she knew exactly where hair had been moments before and was determined to seize it 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter seventeen a sluggish memorycontents prev chapter next chapter 
 late in the afternoon a few days after new year harry ron and ginny lined up beside the kitchen fire to return to hogwarts the ministry had arranged this connection to the floo network to return students quickly and safely to the school only mrs weasley was there to say as mr weasley fred george bill and fleur were all at work mrs weasley dissolved into tears at the moment of parting admittedly it took very little to set her off lately she had been crying on and off ever since percy had stormed from the house on christmas day with his glasses splattered with mashed parsnip for which fred george and ginny all claimed credit 
 
 cry mum said ginny patting her on the back as mrs weasley sobbed into her shoulder okay 
 
 yeah worry about us said ron permitting his mother to plant a very wet kiss on his cheek or about percy such a prat not really a loss is it 
 
 mrs weasley sobbed harder than ever as she enfolded harry in her arms 
 
 promise me look after yourself stay out of trouble 
 
 i always do mrs weasley said harry i like a quiet life you know me 
 
 she gave a watery chuckle and stood back 
 
 be good then all of you 
 
 harry stepped into the emerald fire and shouted hogwarts he had one last fleeting view of the weasleys kitchen and mrs tearful face before the flames engulfed him spinning very fast he caught blurred glimpses of other wizarding rooms which were whipped out of sight before he could get a proper look then he was slowing down finally stopping squarely in the fireplace in professor office she barely glanced up from her work as he clambered out over the grate 
 
 evening potter try not to get too much ash on the carpet 
 
 no professor 
 
 harry straightened his glasses and flattened his hair as ron came spinning into view when ginny had arrived all three of them trooped out of office and off toward gryffindor tower harry glanced out of the corridor windows as they passed the sun was already sinking over grounds carpeted in deeper snow than had lain over the burrow garden in the distance he could see hagrid feeding buckbeak in front of his cabin 
 
 baubles said ron confidently when they reached the fat lady who was looking rather paler than usual and winced at his loud voice 
 
 no she said 
 
 what mean no 
 
 there is a new password she said and please shout 
 
 but been away we supposed to 
 
 harry ginny 
 
 hermione was hurrying toward them very and wearing a cloak hat and gloves 
 
 i got back a couple of hours ago just been down to visit hagrid and bucki mean witherwings she said breathlessly did you have a good christmas 
 
 yeah said ron at once pretty eventful rufus scrim 
 
 got something for you harry said hermione neither looking at ron nor giving any sign that she had heard him oh hang onpassword abstinence 
 
 precisely said the fat lady in a feeble voice and swung forward to reveal the portrait hole 
 
 up with her asked harry 
 
 overindulged over christmas apparently said hermione rolling her eyes as she led the way into the packed common room she and her friend violet drank their way through all the wine in that picture of drunk monks down by the charms corridor anyway 
 
 she rummaged in her pocket for a moment then pulled out a scroll of parchment with writing on it 
 
 great said harry unrolling it at once to discover that his next lesson with dumbledore was scheduled for the following night got loads to tell himand you sit down 
 
 but at that moment there was a loud squeal of and lavender brown came hurtling out of nowhere and flung herself into arms several onlookers sniggered hermione gave a tinkling laugh and said a table over here coming ginny 
 
 no thanks i said meet dean said ginny though harry could not help noticing that she did not sound very enthusiastic leaving ron and lavender locked in a kind of vertical wrestling match harry led hermione over to the spare table 
 
 so how was your christmas 
 
 oh fine she shrugged nothing special how was it at 
 
 tell you in a minute said harry look hermione you 
 
 no i she said flatly so even ask 
 
 i thought maybe you know over christmas 
 
 it was the fat lady who drank a vat of wine harry not me so what was this important news you wanted to tell me 
 
 she looked too fierce to argue with at that moment so harry dropped the subject of ron and recounted all that he had overheard between malfoy and snape 
 
 when he had finished hermione sat in thought for a moment and then said you think 
 
 he was pretending to offer help so that he could trick malfoy into telling him what doing 
 
 well yes said hermione 
 
 dad and lupin think so harry said grudgingly but this definitely proves planning something you deny that 
 
 no i she answered slowly 
 
 and acting on orders just like i said 
 
 hmm did either of them actually mention name 
 
 harry frowned trying to remember 
 
 not sure snape definitely said your master and who else would that be 
 
 i know said hermione biting her lip maybe his father 
 
 she stared across the room apparently lost in thought not even noticing lavender tickling ron lupin 
 
 not great said harry and he told her all about mission among the werewolves and the difficulties he was facing have you heard of this fenrir greyback 
 
 yes i have said hermione sounding startled and so have you harry 
 
 when history of magic you know full well i never listened 
 
 no no not history of magic malfoy threatened borgin with him said hermione back in knockturn alley you remember he told borgin that greyback was an old family friend and that be checking up on progress 
 
 harry gaped at her i forgot but this proves malfoy is a death eater how else could he be in contact with greyback and telling him what to do 
 
 it is pretty suspicious breathed hermione unless 
 
 oh come on said harry in exasperation you get round this one 
 
 well there is the possibility it was an empty threat 
 
 unbelievable you are said harry shaking his head see right be eating your words hermione just like the ministry oh yeah i had a row with rufus scrimgeour as well 
 
 and the rest of the evening passed amicably with both of them abusing the minister of magic for hermione like ron thought that after all the ministry had put harry through the previous year they had a great deal of nerve asking him for help now 
 
 the new term started next morning with a pleasant surprise for the a large sign had been pinned to the common room notice boards overnight 
 
 apparition lessons 
 
 if you are seventeen years of age or will turn seventeen on or before the st august next you are eligible for a course of apparition lessons from a ministry of magic apparition instructor 
 
 please sign below if you would like to participate 
 
 cost galleons 
 
 harry and ron joined the crowd that was jostling around the notice and taking it in turns to write their names at the bottom ron was just taking out his quill to sign after hermione when lavender crept up behind him slipped her hands over his eyes and trilled guess who harry turned to see hermione stalking off he caught up with her having no wish to stay behind with ron and lavender but to his surprise ron caught up with them only a little way beyond the portrait hole his ears bright red and his expression disgruntled without a word hermione sped up to walk with neville 
 
 soapparition said ron his tone making it perfectly plain that harry was not to mention what had just happened should be a laugh eh 
 
 i dunno said harry maybe better when you do it yourself i enjoy it much when dumbledore took me along for the ride 
 
 i forgot already done it better pass my test first time said ron looking anxious fred and george did 
 
 charlie failed though he 
 
 yeah but bigger than me ron held his arms out from his body as though he was a gorilla so fred and george go on about it much not to his face anyway 
 
 when can we take the actual test 
 
 soon as seventeen only march for me 
 
 yeah but you be able to apparate in here not in the castle 
 
 not the point is it everyone would know i could apparate if i wanted 
 
 ron was not the only one to be excited at the prospect of apparition all that day there was much talk about the forthcoming lessons a great deal of store was set by being able to vanish and reappear at will 
 
 how cool will it be when we can just seamus clicked his ringers to indicate disappearance me cousin fergus does it just to annoy me you wait till i can do it back never have another peaceful moment 
 
 lost in visions of this happy prospect he flicked his wand a little too enthusiastically so that instead of producing the fountain of pure water that was the object of charms lesson he let out a hoselike jet that ricocheted off the ceiling and knocked professor flitwick flat on his face 
 
 already apparated ron told a slightly abashed seamus after professor flitwick had dried himself off with a wave of his wand and set seamus lines i am a wizard not a baboon brandishing a stick dumersomeone took him you know 
 
 whoa whispered seamus and he dean and neville put their heads a little closer to hear what apparition felt like for the rest of the day harry was besieged with requests from the other sixth years to describe the sensation of apparition all of them seemed awed rather than put off when he told them how uncomfortable it was and he was still answering detailed questions at ten to eight that evening when he was forced to lie and say that he needed to return a book to the library so as to escape in time for his lesson with dumbledore 
 
 the lamps in office were lit the portraits of previous headmasters were snoring gently in their frames and the pensieve was ready upon the desk once more hands lay on either side of it the right one as blackened and as ever it did not seem to have healed at all and harry wondered for perhaps the hundredth time what had caused such a distinctive injury but did not ask dumbledore had said that he would know eventually and there was in any case another subject he wanted to discuss but before harry could say anything about snape and malfoy dumbledore spoke 
 
 i hear that you met the minister of magic over christmas 
 
 yes said harry not very happy with me 
 
 no sighed dumbledore he is not very happy with me either we must try not to sink beneath our anguish harry but battle on 
 
 harry grinned 
 
 he wanted me to tell the wizarding community that the doing a wonderful job 
 
 dumbledore smiled 
 
 it was idea originally you know during his last days in office when he was trying desperately to cling to his post he sought a meeting with you hoping that you would give him your support 
 
 after everything fudge did last year said harry angrily after umbridge 
 
 i told cornelius there was no chance of it but the idea did not die when he left office within hours of appointment we met and he demanded that i arrange a meeting with you 
 
 so why you argued harry blurted out it was in the daily prophet 
 
 the prophet is bound to report the truth occasionally said dumbledore if only accidentally yes that was why we argued well it appears that rufus found a way to corner you at last 
 
 he accused me of being man through and through 
 
 how very rude of him 
 
 i told him i was 
 
 dumbledore opened his mouth to speak and then closed it again behind harry fawkes the phoenix let out a low soft musical cry to intense embarrassment he suddenly realized that bright blue eyes looked rather watery and stared hastily at his own knees when dumbledore spoke however his voice was quite steady 
 
 i am very touched harry 
 
 scrimgeour wanted to know where you go when not at hogwarts said harry still looking fixedly at his knees 
 
 yes he is very nosy about that said dumbledore now sounding cheerful and harry thought it safe to look up again he has even attempted to have me followed amusing really he set dawlish to tail me it kind i have already been forced to jinx dawlish once i did it again with the greatest regret 
 
 so they still know where you go asked harry hoping for more information on this intriguing subject but dumbledore merely smiled over the top of his spectacles 
 
 no they and the time is not quite right for you to know either now i suggest we press on unless anything else 
 
 there is actually sir said harry about malfoy and snape 
 
 professor snape harry 
 
 yes sir i overheard them during professor party well i followed them actually 
 
 dumbledore listened to story with an impassive face when harry had finished he did not speak for a few moments then said thank you for telling me this harry but i suggest that you put it out of your mind i do not think that it is of great importance 
 
 not of great importance repeated harry incredulously professor did you understand 
 
 yes harry blessed as i am with extraordinary brainpower i understood everything you told me said dumbledore a little sharply i think you might even consider the possibility that i understood more than you did again i am glad that you have confided in me but let me reassure you that you have not told me anything that causes me disquiet 
 
 harry sat in seething silence glaring at dumbledore what was going on did this mean that dumbledore had indeed ordered snape to find out what malfoy was doing in which case he had already heard everything harry had just told him from snape or was he really worried by what he had heard but pretending not to be 
 
 so sir said harry in what he hoped was a polite calm voice you definitely still trust 
 
 i have been tolerant enough to answer that question already said dumbledore but he did not sound very tolerant anymore my answer has not changed 
 
 i should think not said a snide voice phineas nigellus was evidently only pretending to be asleep dumbledore ignored him 
 
 and now harry i must insist that we press on i have more important things to discuss with you this evening 
 
 harry sat there feeling mutinous how would it be if he refused to permit the change of subject if he insisted upon arguing the case against malfoy as though he had read mind dumbledore shook his head 
 
 ah harry how often this happens even between the best of friends each of us believes that what he has to say is much more important than anything the other might have to contribute 
 
 i think what got to say is unimportant sir said harry stiffly 
 
 well you are quite right because it is not said dumbledore briskly i have two more memories to show you this evening both obtained with enormous difficulty and the second of them is i think the most important i have collected 
 
 harry did not say anything to this he still felt angry at the reception his confidences had received but could not see what was to be gained by arguing further 
 
 so said dumbledore in a ringing voice we meet this evening to continue the tale of tom riddle whom we left last lesson poised on the threshold of his years at hogwarts you will remember how excited he was to hear that he was a wizard that he refused my company on a trip to diagon alley and that i in turn warned him against continued thievery when he arrived at school 
 
 well the start of the school year arrived and with it came tom riddle a quiet boy in his robes who lined up with the other first years to be sorted he was placed in slytherin house almost the moment that the sorting hat touched his head continued dumbledore waving his blackened hand toward the shelf over his head where the sorting hat sat ancient and unmoving how soon riddle learned that the famous founder of the house could talk to snakes i do not know perhaps that very evening the knowledge can only have excited him and increased his sense of 
 
 however if he was frightening or impressing fellow slytherins with displays of parseltongue in their common room no hint of it reached the staff he showed no sign of outward arrogance or aggression at all as an unusually talented and very orphan he naturally drew attention and sympathy from the staff almost from the moment of his arrival he seemed police quiet and thirsty for knowledge nearly all were most favorably impressed by him 
 
 you tell them sir what been like when you met him at the orphanage asked harry 
 
 no i did not though he had shown no hint of remorse it was possible that he felt sorry for how he had behaved before and was resolved to turn over a fresh leaf i chose to give him that chance 
 
 dumbledore paused and looked inquiringly at harry who had opened his mouth to speak here again was tendency to trust people in spite of overwhelming evidence that they did not deserve it but then harry remembered something 
 
 but you really trust him sir did you he told me the riddle who came out of that diary said dumbledore never seemed to like me as much as the other teachers did 
 
 let us say that i did not take it for granted that he was trustworthy said dumbledore i had as i have already indicated resolved to keep a close eye upon him and so i did i cannot pretend that i gleaned a great deal from my observations at first he was very guarded with me he felt i am sure that in the thrill of discovering his true identity he had told me a little too much he was careful never to reveal as much again but he could not take back what he had let slip in his excitement nor what mrs cole had confided in me however he had the sense never to try and charm me as he charmed so many of my colleagues 
 
 as he moved up the school he gathered about him a group of dedicated friends i call them that for want of a better term although as i have already indicated riddle undoubtedly felt no affection for any of them this group had a kind of dark glamour within the castle they were a motley collection a mixture of the weak seeking protection the ambitious seeking some shared glory and the thuggish gravitating toward a leader who could show them more refined forms of cruelty in other words they were the forerunners of the death eaters and indeed some of them became the first death eaters after leaving hogwarts 
 
 rigidly controlled by riddle they were never detected in open although their seven years at hogwarts were marked by a number of nasty incidents to which they were never satisfactorily linked the most serious of which was of course the opening of the chamber of secrets which resulted in the death of a girl as you know hagrid was wrongly accused of that crime 
 
 i have not been able to find many memories of riddle at hogwarts said dumbledore placing his withered hand on the pensieve few who knew him then are prepared to talk about him they are too terrified what i know i found out after he had left hogwarts after much painstaking effort after tracing those few who could be tricked into speaking after searching old records and questioning muggle and wizard witnesses alike 
 
 those whom i could persuade to talk told me that riddle was obsessed with his parentage this is understandable of course he had grown up in an orphanage and naturally wished to know how he came to be there it seems that he searched in vain for some trace of tom riddle senior on the shields in the trophy room on the lists of prefects in the old school records even in the books of wizarding history finally he was forced to accept that his father had never set foot in hogwarts i believe that it was then that he dropped the name forever assumed the identity of lord voldemort and began his investigations into his previously despised familythe woman whom you will remember he had thought could not be a witch if she had succumbed to the shameful human weakness of death 
 
 all he had to go upon was the single name marvolo which he knew from those who ran the orphanage had been his name finally after painstaking research through old books of wizarding families he discovered the existence of surviving line in the summer of his sixteenth year he left the orphanage to which he returned annually and set off to find his gaunt relatives and now harry if you will stand 
 
 dumbledore rose and harry saw that he was again holding a small crystal bottle filled with swirling pearly memory 
 
 i was very lucky to collect this he said as he poured the gleaming mass into the pensieve as you will understand when we have experienced it shall we 
 
 harry stepped up to the stone basin and bowed obediently until his face sank through the surface of the memory he felt the familiar sensation of falling through nothingness and then landed upon a dirty stone floor in almost total darkness 
 
 it took him several seconds to recognize the place by which time dumbledore had landed beside him the gaunts house was now more indescribably filthy than anywhere harry had ever seen the ceiling was thick with cobwebs the floor coated in grime moldy and rotting food lay upon the table amidst a mass of crusted pots the only light came from a single guttering candle placed at the feet of a man with hair and beard so overgrown harry could see neither eyes nor mouth he was slumped in an armchair by the fire and harry wondered for a moment whether he was dead but then there came a loud knock on the door and the man jerked awake raising a wand in his right hand and a short knife in his left 
 
 the door creaked open there on the threshold holding an lamp stood a boy harry recognized at once tall pale and handsomethe teenage voldemort 
 
 eyes moved slowly around the hovel and then found the man in the armchair for a few seconds they looked at each other then the man staggered upright the many empty bottles at his feet clattering and tinkling across the floor 
 
 you he bellowed you 
 
 and he hurtled drunkenly at riddle wand and knife held aloft 
 
 stop 
 
 riddle spoke in parseltongue the man skidded into the table sending moldy pots crashing to the floor he stared at riddle there was a long silence while they contemplated each other the man broke it 
 
 you speak it 
 
 yes i speak it said riddle he moved forward into the room allowing the door to swing shut behind him harry could not help but feel a resentful admiration for complete lack of fear his race merely expressed disgust and perhaps disappointment 
 
 where is marvolo he asked 
 
 dead said the other died years ago he 
 
 riddle frowned 
 
 who are you then 
 
 morfin i 
 
 son 
 
 course i am then 
 
 morfin pushed the hair out of his dirty face the better to see riddle and harry saw that he wore ring on his right hand 
 
 i thought you was that muggle whispered morfin you look mighty like that muggle 
 
 what muggle said riddle sharply 
 
 that muggle what my sister took a fancy to that muggle what lives in the big house over the way said morfin and he spat unexpectedly upon the floor between them you look right like him riddle but older now e you now i think on it 
 
 morfin looked slightly dazed and swayed a little still clutching the edge of the table for support 
 
 he come back see he added stupidly 
 
 voldemort was gazing at morfin as though appraising his possibilities now he moved a little closer and said riddle came back 
 
 ar he left her and serve her right marrying filth said morfin spitting on the floor again robbed us mind before she ran off the locket eh locket 
 
 voldemort did not answer morfin was working himself into a rage again he brandished his knife and shouted dishonored us she did that little slut and you coming here and asking questions about all that over innit over 
 
 he looked away staggering slightly and voldemort moved forward as he did so an unnatural darkness fell extinguishing lamp and candle extinguishing everything fingers closed tightly around arm and they were soaring back into the present again the soft golden light in office seemed to dazzle eyes after that impenetrable darkness 
 
 is that all said harry at once why did it go dark what happened 
 
 because morfin could not remember anything from that point onward said dumbledore gesturing harry back into his seat when he awoke next morning he was lying on the floor quite alone ring had gone 
 
 meanwhile in the village of little hangleton a maid was running along the high street screaming that there were three bodies lying in the drawing room of the big house tom riddle senior and his mother and father 
 
 the muggle authorities were perplexed as far as i am aware they do not know to this day how the riddles died for the avada kedavra curse does not usually leave any sign of damage the exception sits before me dumbledore added with a nod to scar the ministry on the other hand knew at once that this was a murder they also knew that a convicted lived across the valley from the riddle house a who had already been imprisoned once for attacking one of the murdered people 
 
 so the ministry called upon morfin they did not need to question him to use veritaserum or legilimency he admitted to the murder on the spot giving details only the murderer could know he was proud he said to have killed the muggles had been awaiting his chance all these years he handed over his wand which was proved at once to have been used to kill the riddles and he permitted himself to be led off to azkaban without a fight all that disturbed him was the fact that his fathers ring had disappeared kill me for losing it he told his captors over and over again kill me for losing his ring and that apparently was all he ever said again he lived out the remainder of his life in azkaban lamenting the loss of last heirloom and is buried beside the prison alongside the other poor souls who have expired within its walls 
 
 so voldemort stole wand and used it said harry sitting up straight 
 
 right said dumbledore we have no memories to show us this but i think we can be fairly sure what happened voldemort stupefied his uncle took his wand and proceeded across the valley to the big house over the way there he murdered the muggle man who had abandoned his witch mother and for good measure his muggle grandparents thus obliterating the last of the unworthy riddle line and revenging himself upon the father who never wanted him then he returned to the gaunt hovel performed the complex bit of magic that would implant a false memory in his mind laid wand beside its unconscious owner pocketed the ancient ring he wore and departed 
 
 and morfin never realized he done it 
 
 never said dumbledore he gave as i say a full and boastful confession 
 
 but he had this real memory in him all the time 
 
 yes but it took a great deal of skilled legilimency to coax it out of him said dumbledore and why should anybody delve further into mind when he had already confessed to the crime however i was able to secure a visit to morfin in the last weeks of his life by which time i was attempting to discover as much as i could about past i extracted this memory with difficulty when i saw what it contained i attempted to use it to secure release from azkaban before the ministry reached their decision however morfin had died 
 
 but how come the ministry realize that voldemort had done all that to morfin harry asked angrily he was underage at the time he i thought they could detect underage magic 
 
 you are quite rightthey can detect magic but not the perpetrator you will remember that you were blamed by the ministry for the hover charm that was in fact cast by 
 
 dobby growled harry this injustice still rankled so if underage and you do magic inside an adult witch or house the ministry know 
 
 they will certainly be unable to tell who performed the magic said dumbledore smiling slightly at the look of great indignation on face they rely on witch and wizard parents to enforce their obedience while within their walls 
 
 well rubbish snapped harry look what happened here look what happened to morfin 
 
 i agree said dumbledore whatever morfin was he did not deserve to die as he did blamed for murders he had not committed but it is getting late and i want you to see this other memory before we part 
 
 dumbledore took from an inside pocket another crystal phial and harry fell silent at once remembering that dumbledore had said it was the most important one he had collected harry noticed that the contents proved difficult to empty into the pensieve as though they had congealed slightly did memories go bad 
 
 this will not take long said dumbledore when he had finally emptied the phial we shall be back before you know it once more into the pensieve then 
 
 and harry fell again through the silver surface landing this time right in front of a man he recognized at once 
 
 it was a much younger horace slughorn harry was so used to him bald that he found the sight of slughorn with thick shiny hair quite disconcerting it looked as though he had had his head thatched though there was already a shiny bald patch on his crown his mustache less massive than it was these days was he was not quite as rotund as the slughorn harry knew though the golden buttons on his richly embroidered waistcoat were taking a fair amount of strain his little feet resting upon a velvet pouffe he was sitting well back in a comfortable winged armchair one hand grasping a small glass of wine the other searching through a box of crystalized pineapple 
 
 harry looked around as dumbledore appeared beside him and saw that they were standing in office half a dozen boys were sitting around slughorn all on harder or lower seats than his and all in their harry recognized voldemort at once his was the most handsome face and he looked the most relaxed of all the boys his right hand lay negligently upon the arm of his chair with a jolt harry saw that he was wearing ring he had already killed his father 
 
 sir is it true that professor merrythought is retiring he asked 
 
 tom tom if i knew i tell you said slughorn wagging a reproving finger at riddle though ruining the effect slightly by winking i must say like to know where you get your information boy more knowledgeable than half the staff you are 
 
 riddle smiled the other boys laughed and cast him admiring looks 
 
 what with your uncanny ability to know things you and your careful flattery of the people who matterthank you for the pineapple by the way quite right it is my favorite 
 
 as several of the boys tittered something very odd happened the whole room was suddenly filled with a thick white fog so that harry could see nothing but the face of dumbledore who was standing beside him then voice rang out through the mist unnaturally loudly go wrong boy mark my words 
 
 the fog cleared as suddenly as it had appeared and yet nobody made any allusion to it nor did anybody look as though anything unusual had just happened bewildered harry looked around as a small golden clock standing upon desk chimed eleven 
 
 good gracious is it that time already said slughorn better get going boys or all be in trouble lestrange i want your essay by tomorrow or detention same goes for you avery 
 
 slughorn pulled himself out of his armchair and carried his empty glass over to his desk as the boys filed out voldemort however stayed behind harry could tell he had dawdled deliberately wanting to be last in the room with slughorn 
 
 look sharp tom said slughorn turning around and finding him still present you want to be caught out of bed out of hours and you a prefect 
 
 sir i wanted to ask you something 
 
 ask away then ask away 
 
 sir i wondered what you know about about horcruxes 
 
 and it happened all over again the dense fog filled the room so that harry could not see slughorn or voldemort at all only dumbledore smiling serenely beside him then voice boomed out again just as it had done before 
 
 i know anything about horcruxes and i tell you if i did now get out of here at once and let me catch you mentioning them again 
 
 well that said dumbledore placidly beside harry time to go 
 
 and feet left the floor to fall seconds later back onto the rug in front of desk 
 
 all there is said harry blankly 
 
 dumbledore had said that this was the most important memory of all but he could not see what was so significant about it admittedly the fog and the fact that nobody seemed to have noticed it was odd but other than that nothing seemed to have happened except that voldemort had asked a question and failed to get an answer 
 
 as you might have noticed said dumbledore reseating himself behind his desk that memory has been tampered with 
 
 tampered with repeated harry sitting back down too 
 
 certainly said dumbledore professor slughorn has meddled with his own recollections 
 
 but why would he do that 
 
 because i think he is ashamed of what he remembers said dumbledore he has tried to rework the memory to show himself in a better light obliterating those parts which he does not wish me to see it is as you will have noticed very crudely done and that is all to the good for it shows that the true memory is still there beneath the alterations 
 
 and so for the first time i am giving you homework harry it will be your job to persuade professor slughorn to divulge the real memory which will undoubtedly be our most crucial piece of information of all 
 
 harry stared at him 
 
 but surely sir he said keeping his voice as respectful as possible you need meyou could use legilimency or veritaserum 
 
 professor slughorn is an extremely able wizard who will be expecting both said dumbledore he is much more accomplished at occlumency than poor morfin gaunt and i would be astonished if he has not carried an antidote to veritaserum with him ever since i coerced him into giving me this travesty of a recollection 
 
 no i think it would be foolish to attempt to wrest the truth from professor slughorn by force and might do much more harm than good i do not wish him to leave hogwarts however he has his weaknesses like the rest of us and i believe that you are the one person who might be able to penetrate his defenses it is most important that we secure the true memory harry how important we will only know when we have seen the real thing so good luck and goodnight 
 
 a little taken aback by the abrupt dismissal harry got to his feet quickly good night sir 
 
 as he closed the study door behind him he distinctly heard phineas nigellus say i see why the boy should be able to do it better than you dumbledore 
 
 i expect you to phineas replied dumbledore and fawkes gave another low musical cry 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the half blood prince 
 

lionfish nov chapter seventeen bathildas secretcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 harry stop 
 
 whats wrong 
 
 they had only just reached the grave of the unknown abbott 
 
 theres someone there someone watching us i can tell there over by the bushes 
 
 they stood quite still holding on to each other gazing at the dense black boundary of the graveyard harry could not see anything 
 
 are you sure 
 
 i saw something move i could have sworn i did 
 
 she broke from him to free her wand arm 
 
 we look like muggles harry pointed out 
 
 muggles whove just been laying flowers on your parents grave harry im sure theres someone over there 
 
 harry thought of a history of magic the graveyard was supposed to be haunted what if c but then he heard a rustle and saw a little eddy of dislodged snow in the bush to which hermione had pointed ghosts could not move snow 
 
 its a cat said harry after a second or two or a bird if it was a death eater wed be dead by now but lets get out of here and we can put the cloak back on 
 
 they glanced back repeatedly as they made their way out of the graveyard harry who did not feel as sanguine as he had pretended when reassuring hermione was glad to reach the gate and the slippery pavement they pulled the invisibility cloak back over themselves the pub was fuller than before many voices inside it were now singing the carol that they had heard as they approached the church for a moment harry considered suggesting they take refuge inside it but before he could say anything hermione murmured lets go this way and pulled him down the dark street leading out of the village in the opposite direction from which they had entered harry could make out the point where the cottages ended and the lane turned into open country again they walked as quickly as they dared past more windows sparkling with multicolored lights the outlines of christmas trees dark through the curtains 
 
 how are we going to find bathildas house asked hermione who was shivering a little and kept glancing back over her shoulder harry what do you think harry 
 
 she tugged at this arm but harry was not paying attention he was looking toward the dark mass that stood at the very end of this row of houses next moment he sped up dragging hermione along with him she slipped a little on the ice 
 
 harry c 
 
 look look at it hermione 
 
 i dont oh 
 
 he could see it the fidelius charm must have died with james and lily the hedge had grown wild in the sixteen years since hagrid had taken harry from the rubble that lay scattered amongst the grass most of the cottage was still standing though entirely covered in the dark ivy and snow but the right side of the top floor had been blown apart that harry was sure was where the curse had backfired he and hermione stood at the gate gazing up at the wreck of what must once have been a cottage just like those that flanked it 
 
 i wonder why nobodys ever rebuilt it whispered hermione 
 
 maybe you cant rebuild it harry replied maybe its like the injuries from dark magic and you cant repair the damage 
 
 he slipped a hand from beneath the cloak and grasped the snowy and thickly rusted gate not wishing to open it but simply so hed some part of the house 
 
 youre not going to go inside it looks unsafe it might c oh harry look 
 
 his touch on the gate seemed to have done it a sign had risen out of the ground in front of them up thorough the tangles of nettles and weeds like some bizarre flower and in golden letters upon the wood it said 
 
 on this spot on this night of october lily and james potter lost their lives their son harry remains the only wizard ever to have survived the killing curse this house invisible to muggles has been left in its ruined state as a monument to the potters and as a reminder of the violence that tore apart their family 
 
 and all around these neatly lettered words scribbles had been added by other witches and wizards who had come to see the place where the boy who lived had escaped some had merely signed their names in everlasting ink others had carved their initials into the wood still others had left messages the most recent of these shining brightly over sixteen years worth of magical graffiti all said similar things 
 
 good luck harry wherever you are 
 
 if you read this harry were all behind you 
 
 long live harry potter 
 
 they shouldnt have written on the sign said hermione indignant 
 
 but harry beamed at her 
 
 its brilliant im glad they did i 
 
 he broke off a heavily muffled figure was hobbling up the lane toward them silhouetted by the bright lights in the distant square harry thought though it was hard to judge that the figure was a woman she was moving slowly possibly frightened of slipping on the snowy ground her stoop her stoutness her shuffling gait all gave an impression of extreme age they watched in silence as she drew nearer harry was waiting to see whether she would turn into any of the cottages she was passing but he knew instinctively that she would not at last she came to a halt a few yards from them and simply stood there in the middle of the frozen road facing them 
 
 he did not need hermiones pinch to his arm there was next to no chance that this woman was a muggle she was standing there gazing at a house that ought to have been completely invisible to her if she was not a witch even assuming that she was a witch however it was odd behavior to come out on a night this cold simply to look at an old ruin by all the rules of normal magic meanwhile she ought not to be able to see hermione and him at all nevertheless harry had the strangest feeling that she knew that they were there and also who they were just as he had reached this uneasy conclusion she raised a gloved hand and beckoned 
 
 hermione moved closer to him under the cloak her arm pressed against his 
 
 how does she know 
 
 he shook his head the woman beckoned again more vigorously harry could think of many reasons not to obey the summons and yet his suspicions about her identity were growing stronger every moment that they stood facing each other in the deserted street 
 
 was it possible that she had been waiting for them all these long months that dumbledore had told her to wait and that harry would come in the end was it not likely that it was she who had moved in the shadows in the graveyard and had followed them to this spot even her ability to sense them suggested some power that he had never encountered before 
 
 finally harry spoke causing hermione to gasp and jump 
 
 are you bathilda 
 
 the muffled figure nodded and beckoned again 
 
 beneath the cloak harry and hermione looked at each other harry raised his eyebrows hermione gave a tiny nervous nod 
 
 they stepped toward the woman and at once she turned and hobbled off back the way they had come leading them past several houses she turned in at a gate they followed her up the front path through a garden nearly as overgrown as the one they had just left she fumbled for a moment with a key at the front door then opened it and stepped back to let them pass 
 
 she smelled bad or perhaps it was her house harry wrinkled his nose as they sidled past her and pulled off the cloak now that he was beside her he realized how tiny she was bowed down with age she came barely level with his chest she closed the door behind them her knuckles blue and mottled against the peeling paint then turned and peered into harrys face her eyes were thick with cataracts and sunken into folds of transparent skin and her whole face was dotted with broken veins and liver spots he wondered whether she could make him out at all even if she could it was the balding muggle whose identity he had stolen that she would see 
 
 the odor of old age of dust of unwashed clothes and stale food intensified as the unwound a black shawl revealing a head of scant white hair through which the scalp showed clearly 
 
 bathilda harry repeated 
 
 she nodded again harry became aware of the locket against his skin the thing inside it that sometimes ticked or beat had woken he could feel it pulsing through the cold gold did it know could it sense that the thing that would destroy it was near 
 
 bathilda shuffled past them pushing hermione aside as though she had not seen her and vanished into what seemed to be a sitting room 
 
 harry im not sure about this breathed hermione 
 
 look at the size of her i think we could overpower her if we had to said harry listen i should have told you i knew she wasnt all there muriel called her gaga 
 
 come called bathilda from the next room 
 
 hermione jumped and clutched harrys arm 
 
 its okay said harry reassuringly and he led the way into the sitting room 
 
 bathilda was tottering around the place lighting candles but it was still very dark not to mention extremely dirty thick dust crunched beneath their feet and harrys nose detected underneath the dank and mildewed smell something worse like meat gone bad he wondered when was the last time anyone had been inside bathildas house to check whether she was coping she seemed to have forgotten that she could do magic too for she lit the candles clumsily by hand her trailing lace cuff in constant danger of catching fire 
 
 let me do that offered harry and he took the matches from her she stood watching him as he finished lighting the candle stubs that stood on saucers around the room perched precariously on stacks of books and on side tables crammed with cracked and moldy cups 
 
 the last surface on which harry spotted a candle was a chest of drawers on which there stood a large number of photographs when the flame danced into life its reflection wavered on their dusty glass and silver he saw a few tiny movements from the pictures as bathilda fumbled with logs for the fire he muttered tergeo the dust vanished from the photographs and he saw at once that half a dozen were missing from the largest and most ornate frames he wondered whether bathilda or somebody else had removed them then the sight of a photograph near the back of the collection caught his eye and he snatched it up 
 
 it was the thief the young man who had perched on gregorovitchs windowsill smiling lazily up at harry out of the silver frame and it came to harry instantly where he had seen the boy before in the life and lies of albus dumbledore arm in arm with the teenage dumbledore and that must be where all the missing photographs were in ritas book 
 
 mrs c miss c bagshot he said and his voice shook slightly who is this 
 
 bathilda was standing in the middle of the room watching hermione light the fire for her 
 
 miss bagshot harry repeated and he advanced with the picture in his hands as the flames burst into life in the fireplace bathilda looked up at his voice and the horcrux beat faster upon his chest 
 
 who is this person harry asked her pushing the picture forward 
 
 she peered at it solemnly then up at harry 
 
 do you know who this is he repeated in a much slower and louder voice than usual this man do you know him whats he called 
 
 bathilda merely looked vague harry felt an awful frustration how had rita skeeter unlocked bathildas memories 
 
 who is this man he repeated loudly 
 
 harry what area you doing asked hermione 
 
 this picture hermione its the thief the thief who stole from gregorovitch please he said to bathilda who is this 
 
 but she only stared at him 
 
 why did you ask us to come with you mrs c miss c bagshot asked hermione raising her own voice was there something you wanted to tell us 
 
 giving no sign that she had heard hermione bathilda now shuffled a few steps closer to harry with a little jerk of her head she looked back into the hall 
 
 you want us to leave he asked 
 
 she repeated the gesture this time pointing firstly at him then at herself then at the ceiling 
 
 oh right hermione i think she wants me to go upstairs with her 
 
 all right said hermione lets go 
 
 but when hermione moved bathilda shook her head with surprising vigor once more pointing first at harry then to herself 
 
 she wants me to go with her alone 
 
 why asked hermione and her voice rang out sharp and clear in the candlelit room the old lady shook her head a little at the loud noise 
 
 maybe dumbledore told her to give the sword to me and only to me 
 
 do you really think she knows who you are 
 
 yes said harry looking down into the milky eyes fixed upon his own i think she does 
 
 well okay then but be quick harry 
 
 lead the way harry told bathilda 
 
 she seemed to understand because she shuffled around him toward the door harry glanced back at hermione with a reassuring smile but he was not sure she had seen it she stood hugging herself in the midst of the candlelit squalor looking toward the bookcase as harry walked out of the room unseen by both hermione and bathilda he slipped the photograph of the unknown thief inside his jacket 
 
 the stairs were steep and narrow harry was half tempted to place his hands on stout bathildas backside to ensure that she did not topple over backward on top of him which seemed only too likely slowly wheezing a little she climbed to the upper landing turned immediately right and led him into a bedroom 
 
 it was and smelled horrible harry had just made out a chamber pot protruding from under the bed before bathilda closed the door and even that was swallowed by the darkness 
 
 lumos said harry and his wand ignited he gave a start bathilda had moved close to him in those few seconds of darkness and he had not heard her approach 
 
 you are potter she whispered 
 
 yes i am 
 
 she nodded slowly solemnly harry felt the horcrux beating fast faster than his own heart it was an unpleasant agitating sensation 
 
 have you got anything for me harry asked but she seemed distracted by his lit 
 
 have you got anything for me he repeated 
 
 then she closed her eyes and several things happened at once harrys scar prickled painfully the horcrux twitched so that the front of his sweater actually moved the dark fetid room dissolved momentarily he felt a leap of joy and spoke in a high cold voice hold him 
 
 harry swayed where he stood the dark room seemed to close around him again he did not know what had just happened 
 
 have you got anything for me he asked for a third time much louder 
 
 over here she whispered pointing to the corner harry raised his wand and saw the outline of a cluttered dressing table beneath the curtained window 
 
 this time she did not lead him harry edged between her and the unmade bed his wand raised he did not want to look away from her 
 
 what is it he asked as he reached the dressing table which was heaped high with what looked and smelled like dirty laundry 
 
 there she said pointing at the shapeless mass 
 
 and in the instant that he looked away his eyes taking the tangled mess for a sword hilt a ruby she moved weirdly he saw it out of the corner of his eye panic made him turn and horror paralyzed him as he saw the old body collapsing and the great snake pouring from the place where her neck had been 
 
 the snake struck as he raised his wand the force of the bite to his forearm sent the wand spinning up toward the ceiling its light swung dizzyingly around the room and was extinguished then a powerful blow from the tail to his midriff knocked the breath out of him he fell backward onto the dressing table into the mound of filthy clothing c 
 
 he rolled sideways narrowly avoiding the snakes tail which thrashed down upon the table where he had been a second earlier fragments of the glass surface rained upon him as he hit the floor from below he heard hermione call harry 
 
 he could not get enough breath into his lungs to call back then a heavy smooth mass smashed him to the floor and he felt it slide over him powerful muscular c 
 
 no he gasped pinned to the floor 
 
 yes whispered the voice yesss hold you hold you 
 
 accio accio wand 
 
 but nothing happened and he needed his hands to try to force the snake from him as it coiled itself around his torso squeezing the air from him pressing the horcrux hard into his chest a circle of ice that throbbed with life inches from his own frantic heart and his brain was flooding with cold white light all thought obliterated his own breath drowned distant footsteps everything going 
 
 a metal heart was banging outside his chest and now he was flying flying with triumph in his heart without need of broomstick or thestral 
 
 he was abruptly awake in the darkness nagini had released him he scrambled up and saw the snake outlined against the landing light it struck and hermione dived aside with a shriek her deflected curse hit the curtained window which shattered frozen air filled the room as harry ducked to avoid another shower of broken glass and his foot slipped on a something c his wand c 
 
 he bent and snatched it up but now the room was full of the snake its tail thrashing hermione was nowhere to be seen and for a moment harry thought the worst but then there was a loud bang and a flash of red light and the snake flew into the air smacking harry hard in the face as it went coil after heavy coil rising up to the ceiling harry raised his wand but as he did so his scar seared more painfully more powerfully than it had done in years 
 
 hes coming hermione hes coming 
 
 as he yelled the snake fell hissing wildly everything was chaos it smashed shelves from the wall and splintered china flew everywhere as harry jumped over the bed and seized the dark shape he knew to be hermione c 
 
 she shrieked with pain as he pulled her back across the bed the snake reared again but harry knew that worse than the snake was coming was perhaps already at the gate his head was going to split open with the pain from his scar c 
 
 the snake lunged as he took a running leap dragging hermione with him as it struck hermione screamed confringo and her spell flew around the room exploding the wardrobe mirror and ricocheting back at them bouncing from floor to ceiling harry felt the heat of it sear the back of his hand glass cut his cheek as pulling hermione with him he leapt from bed to broken dressing table and then straight out of the smashed window into nothingness her scream reverberating through the night as they twisted in midair 
 
 and then his scar burst open and he was voldemort and he was running across the fetid bedroom his long white hands clutching at the windowsill as he glimpsed the bald man and the little woman twist and vanish and he screamed with rage a scream that mingled with the girls that echoed across the dark gardens over the church bells ringing in christmas day 
 
 and his scream was harrys scream his pain was harrys pain that it could happen here where it had happened before here within sight of that house where he had come so close to knowing what it was to die to die the pain was so terrible ripped from his body but if he had no body why did his head hurt so badly if he was dead how cold he feel so unbearably didnt pain cease with death didnt it go 
 
 the night wet and windy two children dressed as pumpkins waddling across the square and the shop windows covered in paper spiders all the tawdry muggle trappings of a world in which they did not believe and he was gliding along that sense of purpose and power and rightness in him that he always knew on these occasions not anger that was for weaker souls than he but triumph yes he had waited for this he had hoped for it 
 
 nice costume mister 
 
 he saw the small boys smile falter as he ran near enough to see beneath the hood of the cloak saw the fear cloud his pained face then the child turned and ran away beneath the robe he fingered the handle of his wand one simple movement and the child would never reach his mother but unnecessary quite unnecessary 
 
 and along a new and darker street he moved and now his destination was in sight at last the fidelius charm broken though they did not know it yet and he made less noise than the dead leaves slithering along the pavement as he drew level with the dark hedge and steered over it 
 
 they had not drawn the curtains he saw them quite clearly in their little sitting room the tall man in his glasses making puffs of colored smoke erupt from his wand for the amusement of the small boy in his blue pajamas the child was laughing and trying to catch the smoke to grab it in his small fist 
 
 a door opened and the mother entered saying words he cold not hear her long hair falling over her face now the father scooped up the son and handed him to the mother he threw his wand down upon the sofa and stretched yawning 
 
 the gate creaked a little as he pushed it open but james potter did not hear his white hand pulled out the wand beneath his cloak and pointed it at the door which burst open 
 
 he was over the threshold as james came sprinting into the hall it was easy too easy he had not even picked up his wand 
 
 lily take harry and go its him go run ill hold him off 
 
 hold him off without a wand in his hand he laughed before casting the curse 
 
 avada kedavra 
 
 the green light filled the cramped hallway it lit the pram pushed against the wall it made the banisters glow like lighting rods and james potter fell like a marionette whose strings were cut 
 
 he could hear her screaming from the upper floor trapped but as long as she was sensible she at least had nothing to fear he climbed the steps listening with faint amusement to her attempts to barricade herself in she had no wand upon her either how stupid they were and how trusting thinking that their safety lay in friends that weapons could be discarded even for moments 
 
 he forced the door open cast aside the chair and boxes hastily piled against it with one lazy wave of his wand and there she stood the child in her arms at the sight of him she dropped her son into the crib behind her and threw her arms wide as if this would help as if in shielding him from sight she hoped to be chosen instead 
 
 not harry not harry please not harry 
 
 stand aside you silly girl stand aside now 
 
 not harry please no take me kill me instead c 
 
 this is my last warning c 
 
 not harry please have mercy have mercy not harry not harry please c ill do anything 
 
 stand aside stand aside girl 
 
 he could have forced her away from the crib but it seemed more prudent to finish them all 
 
 the green light flashed around the room and she dropped like her husband the child had not cried all this time he could stand clutching the bars of his crib and he looked up into the intruders face with a kind of bright interest perhaps thinking that it was his father who hid beneath the cloak making more pretty lights and his mother would pop up any moment laughing c 
 
 he pointed the wand very carefully into the boys face he wanted to see it happen the destruction of this one inexplicable danger the child began to cry it had seen that he was not james he did not like it crying he had never been able to stomach the small ones whining in the orphanage c 
 
 avada kedavra 
 
 and then he broke he was nothing nothing but pain and terror and he must hide himself not here in the rubble of the ruined house where the child was trapped screaming but far away far away 
 
 no he moaned 
 
 the snake rustled on the filthy cluttered floor and he had killed the boy and yet he was the boy 
 
 no 
 
 and now he stood at the broken window of bathildas house immersed in memories of his greatest loss and at his feet the great snake slithered over broken china and glass he looked down and saw something something incredible 
 
 no 
 
 harry its all right youre all right 
 
 he stooped down and picked up the smashed photograph there he was the unknown thief the thief he was seeking 
 
 no i dropped it i dropped it 
 
 harry its okay wake up wake up 
 
 he was harry harry not voldemort and the thing that was rustling was not a snake he opened his eyes 
 
 harry hermione whispered do you feel all c all right 
 
 yes he lied 
 
 he was in the tent lying on one of the lower bunks beneath a heap of blankets he could tell that it was almost dawn by the stillness and quality of the cold flat light beyond the canvas ceiling he was drenched in sweat he could feel it on the sheets and blankets 
 
 we got away 
 
 yes said hermione i had to use a hover charm to get you into your bunk i couldnt lift you youve been well you havent been quite 
 
 there were purple shadows under her brown eyes and he noticed a small sponge in her hand she had been wiping his face 
 
 youve been ill she finished quite ill 
 
 how long ago did we leave 
 
 hours ago its nearly morning 
 
 and ive been what unconscious 
 
 not exactly said hermione uncomfortably youve been shouting and moaning and things she added in a tone that made harry feel uneasy what had he done screamed curses like voldemort cried like the baby in the crib 
 
 i couldnt get the horcrux off you hermione said and he knew she wanted to change the subject it was stuck stuck to your chest youve got a mark im sorry i had to use a severing charm to get it away the snake hit you too but ive cleaned the wound and put some dittany on it 
 
 he pulled the sweaty he was wearing away from himself and looked down there was a scarlet oval over his heart where the locket had burned him he could also see the half healed puncture marks to his forearm 
 
 whereve you put the horcrux 
 
 in my bag i think we should keep it off for a while 
 
 he lay back on his pillows and looked into her pinched gray face 
 
 we shouldnt have gone to godrics hollow its my fault its all my fault hermione im sorry 
 
 its not you fault i wanted to go too i really thought dumbledore might have left the sword there for you 
 
 yeah well we got that wrong didnt we 
 
 what happened harry what happened when she took you upstairs was the snake hiding somewhere did it just come out and kill her and attack you 
 
 no he said she was the snake or the snake was her all along 
 
 
 
 he closed his eyes he could still smell bathildas house on him it made the whole thing horribly vivid 
 
 bathilda mustve been dead a while the snake was was inside her put it there in godrics hollow to wait you were right he knew id go back 
 
 the snake was inside her 
 
 he opened his eyes again hermione looked revolted nauseated 
 
 lupin said there would be magic wed never imagined harry said she didnt want to talk in front of you because it was parseltongue all parseltongue and i didnt realize but of course i could understand her once we were up in the room the snake sent a message to i heard it happen inside my head i felt him get excited he said to keep me there and then 
 
 he remembered the snake coming out of bathildas neck hermione did not need to know the details 
 
 she changed changed into the snake and attacked 
 
 he looked down at the puncture marks 
 
 it wasnt supposed to kill me just keep me there till came 
 
 if he had only managed to kill the snake it would have been worth it all of it sick at heart he sat up and threw back the covers 
 
 harry no im sure you ought to rest 
 
 youre the one who needs sleep no offense but you look terrible im fine ill keep watch for a while wheres my wand 
 
 she did not answer she merely looked at him 
 
 wheres my wand hermione 
 
 she was biting her lip and tears swam in her eyes 
 
 harry 
 
 wheres my wand 
 
 she reached down beside the bed and held it out to him 
 
 the holly and phoenix wand was nearly severed in two one fragile strand of phoenix feather kept both pieces hanging together the wood had splintered apart completely harry took it into his hands as though it was a living thing that had suffered a terrible injury he could not think properly everything was a blur of panic and fear then he held out the want to hermione 
 
 mend it please 
 
 harry i dont think when its broken like this c 
 
 please hermione try 
 
 
 
 the dangling half of the wand resealed itself harry held it up 
 
 lumos 
 
 the wand sparked feebly then went out harry pointed it at hermione 
 
 expelliarmus 
 
 hermiones wand gave a little jerk but did not leave her hand the feeble attempt at magic was too much for harrys wand which split into two again he stared at it aghast unable to take in what he was seeing the wand that had survived so much 
 
 harry hermione whispered so quietly he could hardly hear her im so so sorry i think it was me as we were leaving you know the snake was coming for us and so i cast a blasting curse and it rebounded everywhere and it must have c must have hit c 
 
 it was an accident said harry mechanically he felt empty stunned well c well find a way to repair it 
 
 harry i dont think were going to be able to said hermione the ears trickling down her face remember remember ron when he broke his wand crashing the car it was never the same again he had to get a new one 
 
 harry thought of ollivander kidnapped and held hostage by voldemort of gregorovitch who was dead how was he supposed to find himself a new wand 
 
 well he said in a falsely voice well ill just borrow yours for now then while i keep watch 
 
 her face glazed with tears hermione handed over her wand and he left her sitting beside his bed desiring nothing more than to get away from her 
 
 rowling

 the deathly hallows

 grandpapa now the speaking the waistcoat has a 
 laydown collar and is very modest but he knows his own value and 
 has quite a right to say what he says 
 
 i a spot on me goodness of material ought to be 
 appreciated i am of real silk and have strings to me 
 
 on the wedding day but no longer you keep your color 
 in the wash this is mr who is speaking mr de boots 
 is of strong leather and yet very delicate he can 
 creak and clank with his spurs and has an italian physiognomy 
 but they ought to speak in verses said anna for heard 
 the most charming way of all 
 
 they can do that too replied grandpapa and if the public 
 demands it they will talk in that way just look at little miss 
 glove how pointing her fingers 
 could i but have my love 
 who then so happy as glove 
 ah

 and therefore crow 
 kikkeriki in the lofty hall 
 now comes the exciting part little anna this is the most 
 important in all the play mr waistcoat undoes himself and addresses his speech to you that you may applaud but leave it alone considered more genteel 
 
 i am driven to extremities take care of yourself now comes the

 and now the old replies 
 though all ear 
 very stupid i appear 
 my humor gone i fear 
 and i feel my hollow not here 
 ah never my dear 
 did i feel so queer 
 oh pray let me out 
 and like a lamb led to slaughter 
 betroth you no doubt 
 to my daughter 
 is the play over already asked little anna 
 by no means replied grandpapa only all over with mr 
 de boots now the lovers kneel down and one of them sings 
 father 
 and the other 
 come do as you ought to do 
 bless your son and daughter 
 and they receive his blessing and celebrate their wedding and all 
 the pieces of furniture sing in chorus 
 klink clanks 
 a thousand thanks 
 and now the play is over 
 and now applaud said grandpapa call them all out 
 and the pieces of furniture too for they are of mahogany 
 
 and is not our play just as good as those which the others have 
 in the real theatre 
 
 our play is much better said grandpapa it is shorter the 
 performers are natural and it has passed away the interval before

 a whirlwind kicks up whipping everything into the air the hole in the wall is like a giant vacuum cleaner papers book toiletries bedding if it nailed down it gets sucked down the hole toward the light red fights it but the suction drags him closer and closer 
 pov 
 and camera rockets into the hole getting sucked down an endless tunnel at impossible speed the roar of air mixing with his scream closer and closer to the light 
 and erupting out the other side into total silence and a beautiful white beach the pacific ocean before us enormous beautiful beyond description all we hear now are the gentle sound of waves

 a lone figure stands at edge camera keeps moving 
 coming up behind him and tracking around to reveal red

 book friends of the a b c 
 chapter iii 
 
 marius astonishments 
 in a few days marius had become friend 
 youth is the season for prompt welding and the rapid healing of scars marius breathed freely in society a decidedly new thing for him 
 courfeyrac put no questions to him 
 he did not even think of such a thing 
 at that age faces disclose everything on the spot 
 words are superfluous 
 there are young men of whom it can be said that their countenances chatter 
 one looks at them and one knows them 
 one morning however courfeyrac abruptly addressed this interrogation to him 
 by the way have you any political opinions 
 the idea said marius almost affronted by the question 
 what are you 
 a 
 the gray hue of a reassured rat said courfeyrac 
 on the following day courfeyrac introduced marius at the cafe musain then he whispered in his ear with a smile 
 i must give you your entry to the revolution 
 and he led him to the hall of the friends of the a b c he presented him to the other comrades saying this simple word which marius did not understand 
 a pupil 
 marius had fallen into a of wits 
 however although he was silent and grave he was none the less both winged and armed 
 marius up to that time solitary and inclined to soliloquy and to asides both by habit and by taste was a little fluttered by this covey of young men around him 
 all these various initiatives solicited his attention at once and pulled him about the tumultuous movements of these minds at liberty and at work set his ideas in a whirl 
 sometimes in his trouble they fled so far from him that he had difficulty in recovering them he heard them talk of philosophy of literature of art of history of religion in unexpected fashion 
 he caught glimpses of strange aspects and as he did not place them in proper perspective he was not altogether sure that it was not chaos that he grasped on abandoning his opinions for the opinions of his father he had supposed himself fixed he now suspected with uneasiness and without daring to avow it to himself that he was not the angle at which he saw everything began to be displaced anew a certain oscillation set all the horizons of his brains in motion an odd internal upsetting 
 he almost suffered from it 
 it seemed as though there were no consecrated things for those young men 
 marius heard singular propositions on every sort of subject which embarrassed his still timid mind 
 a theatre poster presented itself adorned with the title of a tragedy from the ancient repertory called classic 
 down with tragedy dear to the bourgeois cried bahorel 
 and marius heard combeferre reply 
 you are wrong bahorel 
 the bourgeoisie loves tragedy and the bourgeoisie must be left at peace on that score bewigged tragedy has a reason for its existence and i am not one of those who by order of aeschylus contest its right to existence there are rough outlines in nature there are in creation parodies a beak which is not a beak wings which are not wings gills which are not gills paws which are not paws a cry of pain which arouses a desire to laugh there is the duck now since poultry exists by the side of the bird i do not see why classic tragedy should not exist in the face of antique tragedy 
 or chance decreed that marius should traverse rue rousseau between enjolras and courfeyrac 
 courfeyrac took his arm 
 pay attention 
 this is the rue platriere now called rue rousseau on account of a singular household which lived in it sixty years ago 
 this consisted of and therese from time to time little beings were born there 
 therese gave birth to them represented them as foundlings 
 and enjolras addressed courfeyrac roughly 
 silence in the presence of i admire that man he denied his own children that may be but he adopted the people 
 not one of these young men articulated the word 
 the emperor jean prouvaire alone sometimes said napoleon all the others said bonaparte 
 enjolras pronounced it buonaparte 
 marius was vaguely surprised

 chapter xiii 
 
 in the tavern before which stood the covered cart there were already some five officers mary hendrikhovna a plump little blonde german in a dressing jacket and nightcap was sitting on a broad bench in the front corner her husband the doctor lay asleep behind her rostov and ilyin on entering the room were welcomed with merry shouts and laughter 
 dear me how jolly we are said rostov laughing 
 and why do you stand there gaping 
 what swells they are why the water streams from them make our drawing room so wet 
 mess mary dress cried other voices 
 rostov and ilyin hastened to find a corner where they could change into dry clothes without offending mary modesty they were going into a tiny recess behind a partition to change but found it completely filled by three officers who sat playing cards by the light of a solitary candle on an empty box and these officers would on no account yield their position mary hendrikhovna obliged them with the loan of a petticoat to be used as a curtain and behind that screen rostov and ilyin helped by lavrushka who had brought their kits changed their wet things for dry ones 
 a fire was made up in the dilapidated brick stove a board was found fixed on two saddles and covered with a horsecloth a small samovar was produced and a cellaret and half a bottle of rum and having asked mary hendrikhovna to preside they all crowded round her one offered her a clean handkerchief to wipe her charming hands another spread a jacket under her little feet to keep them from the damp another hung his coat over the window to keep out the draft and yet another waved the flies off her face lest he should wake up 
 leave him alone said mary hendrikhovna smiling timidly and happily he is sleeping well as it is after a sleepless night 
 oh no mary hendrikhovna replied the officer one must look after the doctor perhaps take pity on me someday when it comes to cutting off a leg or an arm for me 
 there were only three tumblers the water was so muddy that one could not make out whether the tea was strong or weak and the samovar held only six tumblers of water but this made it all the pleasanter to take turns in order of seniority to receive tumbler from mary plump little hands with their short and not overclean nails all the officers appeared to be and really were in love with her that evening even those playing cards behind the partition soon left their game and came over to the samovar yielding to the general mood of courting mary hendrikhovna she seeing herself surrounded by such brilliant and polite young men beamed with satisfaction try as she might to hide it and perturbed as she evidently was each time her husband moved in his sleep behind her 
 there was only one spoon sugar was more plentiful than anything else but it took too long to dissolve so it was decided that mary hendrikhovna should stir the sugar for everyone in turn rostov received his tumbler and adding some rum to it asked mary hendrikhovna to stir it 
 but you take it without sugar she said smiling all the time as if everything she said and everything the others said was very amusing and had a double meaning 
 it is not the sugar i want but only that your little hand should stir my tea 
 mary hendrikhovna assented and began looking for the spoon which someone meanwhile had pounced on 
 use your finger mary hendrikhovna it will be still nicer said rostov 
 too hot she replied blushing with pleasure 
 ilyin put a few drops of rum into the bucket of water and brought it to mary hendrikhovna asking her to stir it with her finger 
 this is my cup said he only dip your finger in it and drink it all up 
 when they had emptied the samovar rostov took a pack of cards and proposed that they should play kings with mary hendrikhovna they drew lots to settle who should make up her set at suggestion it was agreed that whoever became king should have the right to kiss mary hand and that the booby should go to refill and reheat the samovar for the doctor when the latter awoke 
 well but supposing mary hendrikhovna is king asked ilyin 
 as it is she is queen and her word is law 
 they had hardly begun to play before the disheveled head suddenly appeared from behind mary hendrikhovna he had been awake for some time listening to what was being said and evidently found nothing entertaining or amusing in what was going on his face was sad and depressed without greeting the officers he scratched himself and asked to be allowed to pass as they were blocking the way as soon as he had left the room all the officers burst into loud laughter and mary hendrikhovna blushed till her eyes filled with tears and thereby became still more attractive to them returning from the yard the doctor told his wife who had ceased to smile so happily and looked at him in alarm awaiting her sentence that the rain had ceased and they must go to sleep in their covered cart or everything in it would be stolen 
 but send an orderly two of them said rostov what an idea doctor 
 stand guard on it myself said ilyin 
 no gentlemen you have had your sleep but i have not slept for two nights replied the doctor and he sat down morosely beside his wife waiting for the game to end 
 seeing his gloomy face as he frowned at his wife the officers grew still merrier and some of them could not refrain from laughter for which they hurriedly sought plausible pretexts when he had gone taking his wife with him and had settled down with her in their covered cart the officers lay down in the tavern covering themselves with their wet cloaks but they did not sleep for a long time now they exchanged remarks recalling the uneasiness and his delight now they ran out into the porch and reported what was taking place in the covered trap several times rostov covering his head tried to go to sleep but some remark would arouse him and conversation would be resumed to the accompaniment of unreasoning merry childlike laughter

 book friends of the a b c 
 chapter iv 
 
 the back room of the cafe musain 
 one of the conversations among the young men at which marius was present and in which he sometimes joined was a veritable shock to his mind 
 this took place in the back room of the cafe musain 
 nearly all the friends of the a b c had convened that evening 
 the argand lamp was solemnly lighted 
 they talked of one thing and another without passion and with noise 
 with the exception of enjolras and marius who held their peace all were haranguing rather at conversations between comrades sometimes are subject to these peaceable tumults 
 it was a game and an uproar as much as a conversation 
 they tossed words to each other and caught them up in turn 
 they were chattering in all quarters 
 no woman was admitted to this back room except louison the of the cafe who passed through it from time to time to go to her washing in the lavatory 
 grantaire thoroughly drunk was deafening the corner of which he had taken possession reasoning and contradicting at the top of his lungs and shouting 
 i am thirsty 
 mortals i am dreaming 
 that the tun of heidelberg has an attack of apoplexy and that i am one of the dozen leeches which will be applied to it 
 i want a drink 
 i desire to forget life life is a hideous invention of i know not whom 
 it lasts no time at all and is worth nothing 
 one breaks neck in living life is a theatre set in which there are but few practicable entrances happiness is an antique reliquary painted on one side only ecclesiastes says 
 all is vanity 
 i agree with that good man who never existed perhaps 
 zero not wishing to go stark naked clothed himself in vanity 
 o vanity 
 the patching up of everything with big words a kitchen is a laboratory a dancer is a professor an acrobat is a gymnast a boxer is a pugilist an apothecary is a chemist a wigmaker is an artist a hodman is an architect a jockey is a sportsman a is a pterigybranche 
 vanity has a right and a wrong side the right side is stupid it is the negro with his glass beads the wrong side is foolish it is the philosopher with his rags 
 i weep over the one and i laugh over the other what are called honors and dignities and even dignity and honor are generally of pinchbeck 
 kings make playthings of human pride caligula made a horse a consul charles ii 
 made a knight of a sirloin 
 wrap yourself up now then between consul incitatus and baronet roastbeef 
 as for the intrinsic value of people it is no longer respectable in the least 
 listen to the panegyric which neighbor makes of neighbor 
 white on white is ferocious if the lily could speak what a setting down it would give the dove a bigoted woman prating of a devout woman is more venomous than the asp and the cobra 
 it is a shame that i am ignorant otherwise i would quote to you a mass of things but i know nothing for instance i have always been witty when i was a pupil of gros instead of daubing wretched little pictures i passed my time in pilfering apples rapin is the masculine of rapine 
 so much for myself as for the rest of you you are worth no more than i am i scoff at your perfections excellencies and qualities every good quality tends towards a defect economy borders on avarice the generous man is next door to the prodigal the brave man rubs elbows with the braggart he who says very pious says a trifle bigoted there are just as many vices in virtue as there are holes in diogenes cloak 
 whom do you admire the slain or the slayer caesar or brutus 
 generally men are in favor of the slayer long live brutus he has slain 
 there lies the virtue 
 virtue granted but madness also 
 there are queer spots on those great men the brutus who killed caesar was in love with the statue of a little boy this statue was from the hand of the greek sculptor strongylion who also carved that figure of an amazon known as the beautiful leg eucnemos which nero carried with him in his travels 
 this strongylion left but two statues which placed nero and brutus in accord brutus was in love with the one nero with the other 
 all history is nothing but wearisome repetition 
 one century is the plagiarist of the other 
 the battle of marengo copies the battle of pydna the tolbiac of clovis and the austerlitz of napoleon are as like each other as two drops of water 
 i attach much importance to victory nothing is so stupid as to conquer true glory lies in convincing but try to prove something 
 if you are content with success what mediocrity and with conquering what wretchedness 
 alas vanity and cowardice everywhere 
 everything obeys success even grammar si volet usus says horace 
 therefore i disdain the human race shall we descend to the party at all 
 do you wish me to begin admiring the peoples 
 what people if you please 
 shall it be greece the athenians those parisians of days gone by slew phocion as we might say coligny and fawned upon tyrants to such an extent that anacephorus said of pisistratus 
 his urine attracts the bees the most prominent man in greece for fifty years was that grammarian philetas who was so small and so thin that he was obliged to load his shoes with lead in order not to be blown away by the wind there stood on the great square in corinth a statue carved by silanion and catalogued by pliny this statue represented episthates what did episthates do 
 he invented a trip 
 that sums up greece and glory 
 let us pass on to others 
 shall i admire england shall i admire france 
 france 
 why 
 because of paris 
 i have just told you my opinion of athens 
 england 
 why 
 because of london i hate carthage 
 and then london the metropolis of luxury is the headquarters of wretchedness 
 there are a hundred deaths a year of hunger in the parish of alone 
 such is albion i add as the climax that i have seen an englishwoman dancing in a wreath of roses and blue spectacles 
 a fig then for england if i do not admire john bull shall i admire brother jonathan i have but little taste for that brother 
 take away time is money what remains of england 
 take away cotton is king what remains of america 
 germany is the lymph italy is the bile shall we go into ecstasies over russia 
 voltaire admired it 
 he also admired china 
 i admit that russia has its beauties among others a stout despotism but i pity the despots 
 their health is delicate a decapitated alexis a poignarded peter a strangled paul another paul crushed flat with kicks divers ivans strangled with their throats cut numerous nicholases and basils poisoned all this indicates that the palace of the emperors of russia is in a condition of flagrant insalubrity 
 all civilized peoples offer this detail to the admiration of the thinker war now war civilized war exhausts and sums up all the forms of ruffianism from the brigandage of the trabuceros in the gorges of mont jaxa to the marauding of the comanche indians in the doubtful pass bah you will say to me but europe is certainly better than asia i admit that asia is a farce but i do not precisely see what you find to laugh at in the grand lama you peoples of the west who have mingled with your fashions and your elegances all the complicated filth of majesty from the dirty chemise of queen isabella to the of the dauphin 
 gentlemen of the human race i tell you not a bit of it 
 it is at brussels that the most beer is consumed at stockholm the most brandy at madrid the most chocolate at amsterdam the most gin at london the most wine at constantinople the most coffee at paris the most absinthe there are all the useful notions 
 paris carries the day in short in paris even the are sybarites diogenes would have loved to be a of the place maubert better than to be a philosopher at the piraeus 
 learn this in addition the wineshops of the ragpickers are called bibines the most celebrated are the saucepan and the hence goguettes caboulots bouibuis mastroquets bastringues manezingues bibines of the caravanseries of the caliphs i certify to you i am a voluptuary i eat at at forty sous a head i must have persian carpets to roll naked cleopatra in 
 where is cleopatra 
 ah 
 so it is you louison 
 good day 
 the slang term for a assistant 
 thus did grantaire more than intoxicated launch into speech catching at the in her passage from his corner in the back room of the cafe musain 
 bossuet extending his hand towards him tried to impose silence on him and grantaire began again worse than ever 
 aigle de meaux down with your paws 
 you produce on me no effect with your gesture of hippocrates refusing artaxerxes i excuse you from the task of soothing me 
 moreover i am sad what do you wish me to say to you 
 man is evil man is deformed the butterfly is a success man is a failure 
 god made a mistake with that animal 
 a crowd offers a choice of ugliness the first comer is a wretch with infame infamous 
 yes i have the spleen complicated with melancholy with homesickness plus hypochondria and i am vexed and i rage and i yawn and i am bored and i am tired to death and i am stupid let god go to the devil 
 silence then capital r resumed bossuet who was discussing a point of law behind the scenes and who was plunged more than waist high in a phrase of judicial slang of which this is the conclusion 
 and as for me although i am hardly a legist and at the most an amateur attorney i maintain this 
 that in accordance with the terms of the customs of normandy at and for each year an equivalent must be paid to the profit of the lord of the manor saving the rights of others and by all and several the proprietors as well as those seized with inheritance and that for all emphyteuses leases freeholds contracts of domain mortgages 
 echo plaintive nymph hummed grantaire 
 near grantaire an almost silent table a sheet of paper an inkstand and a pen between two glasses of brandy announced that a vaudeville was being sketched out 
 this great affair was being discussed in a low voice and the two heads at work touched each other 
 let us begin by finding names when one has the names one finds the subject 
 that is true 
 dictate 
 i will write 
 monsieur dorimon 
 an independent gentleman 
 of course 
 his daughter celestine 
 tine 
 what next 
 colonel sainval 
 sainval is stale 
 i should say valsin 
 beside the vaudeville aspirants another group which was also taking advantage of the uproar to talk low was discussing a duel an old fellow of thirty was counselling a young one of eighteen and explaining to him what sort of an adversary he had to deal with 
 the deuce 
 look out for yourself 
 he is a fine swordsman 
 his play is neat 
 he has the attack no wasted feints wrist dash lightning a just parade mathematical parries bigre and he is 
 in the angle opposite grantaire joly and bahorel were playing dominoes and talking of love 
 you are in luck that you are joly was saying 
 you have a mistress who is always laughing 
 that is a fault of hers returned bahorel 
 mistress does wrong to laugh 
 that encourages one to deceive her 
 to see her gay removes your remorse if you see her sad your conscience pricks you 
 ingrate a woman who laughs is such a good thing 
 and you never quarrel 
 that is because of the treaty which we have made 
 on forming our little holy alliance we assigned ourselves each our frontier which we never cross 
 what is situated on the side of winter belongs to vaud on the side of the wind to gex 
 hence the peace 
 peace is happiness digesting 
 and you jolllly where do you stand in your entanglement with mamselle you know whom i mean 
 she sulks at me with cruel patience 
 yet you are a lover to soften the heart with gauntness 
 alas 
 in your place i would let her alone 
 that is easy enough to say 
 and to do 
 is not her name musichetta 
 yes 
 ah my poor bahorel she is a superb girl very literary with tiny feet little hands she dresses well and is white and dimpled with the eyes of a i am wild over her 
 my dear fellow then in order to please her you must be elegant and produce effects with your knees 
 buy a good pair of trousers of cloth at that will assist 
 at what price shouted grantaire 
 the third corner was delivered up to a poetical discussion pagan mythology was giving battle to christian mythology the question was about olympus whose part was taken by jean prouvaire out of pure romanticism 
 jean prouvaire was timid only in repose 
 once excited he burst forth a sort of mirth accentuated his enthusiasm and he was at once both laughing and lyric 
 let us not insult the gods said he 
 the gods may not have taken their departure 
 jupiter does not impress me as dead the gods are dreams you say 
 well even in nature such as it is after the flight of these dreams we still find all the grand old pagan myths 
 such and such a mountain with the profile of a citadel like the vignemale for example is still to me the headdress of cybele it has not been proved to me that pan does not come at night to breathe into the hollow trunks of the willows stopping up the holes in turn with his fingers and i have always believed that io had something to do with the cascade of pissevache 
 in the last corner they were talking politics 
 the charter which had been granted was getting roughly handled 
 combeferre was upholding it weakly 
 courfeyrac was energetically making a breach in it on the table lay an unfortunate copy of the famous touquet charter courfeyrac had seized it and was brandishing it mingling with his arguments the rattling of this sheet of paper 
 in the first place i have any kings if it were only from an economical point of view i want any a king is a parasite 
 one does not have kings gratis 
 listen to this the dearness of kings 
 at the death of francois i the national debt of france amounted to an income of thirty thousand livres at the death of louis xiv 
 it was two milliards six hundred millions at livres the mark which was equivalent in according to desmarets to four milliards five hundred millions which would be equivalent to twelve milliards 
 in the second place and no offence to combeferre a charter granted is but a poor expedient of civilization 
 to save the transition to soften the passage to deaden the shock to cause the nation to pass insensibly from the monarchy to democracy by the practice of constitutional detestable reasons all those are no no let us never enlighten the people with false daylight principles dwindle and pale in your constitutional cellar no illegitimacy no compromise no grant from the king to the people in all such grants there is an article 
 by the side of the hand which gives there is the claw which snatches back 
 i refuse your charter a charter is a mask the lie lurks beneath it a people which accepts a charter abdicates 
 the law is only the law when entire 
 no no charter 
 it was winter a couple of fagots were crackling in the fireplace this was tempting and courfeyrac could not resist 
 he crumpled the poor touquet charter in his fist and flung it in the fire the paper flashed up 
 combeferre watched the masterpiece of louis xviii burn philosophically and contented himself with saying 
 the charter metamorphosed into flame 
 and sarcasms sallies jests that french thing which is called entrain and that english thing which is called humor good and bad taste good and bad reasons all the wild pyrotechnics of dialogue mounting together and crossing from all points of the room produced a sort of merry bombardment over their heads

 chapter xiv 
 
 it was nearly three but no one was yet asleep when the quartermaster appeared with an order to move on to the little town of ostrovna still laughing and talking the officers began hurriedly getting ready and again boiled again boiled some muddy water in the samovar but rostov went off to his squadron without waiting for tea day was breaking the rain had ceased and the clouds were dispersing it felt damp and cold especially in clothes that were still moist as they left the tavern in the twilight of the dawn rostov and ilyin both glanced under the wet and glistening leather hood of the cart from under the apron of which his feet were sticking out and in the middle of which his nightcap was visible and her sleepy breathing audible 
 she really is a dear little thing said rostov to ilyin who was following him 
 a charming woman said ilyin with all the gravity of a boy of sixteen 
 half an hour later the squadron was lined up on the road the command was heard to mount and the soldiers crossed themselves and mounted rostov riding in front gave the order forward and the hussars with clanking sabers and subdued talk their horses hoofs splashing in the mud defiled in fours and moved along the broad road planted with birch trees on each side following the infantry and a battery that had gone on in front 
 tattered clouds reddening in the east were scudding before the wind it was growing lighter and lighter that curly grass which always grows by country roadsides became clearly visible still wet with the rain the drooping branches of the birches also wet swayed in the wind and flung down bright drops of water to one side the soldiers faces were more and more clearly visible rostov always closely followed by ilyin rode along the side of the road between two rows of birch trees 
 when campaigning rostov allowed himself the indulgence of riding not a regimental but a cossack horse a judge of horses and a sportsman he had lately procured himself a large fine mettlesome donets horse with light mane and tail and when he rode it no one could outgallop him to ride this horse was a pleasure to him and he thought of the horse of the morning of the wife but not once of the impending danger 
 formerly when going into action rostov had felt afraid now he had not the least feeling of fear he was fearless not because he had grown used to being under fire one cannot grow used to danger but because he had learned how to manage his thoughts when in danger he had grown accustomed when going into action to think about anything but what would seem most likely to interest him the impending danger during the first period of his service hard as he tried and much as he reproached himself with cowardice he had not been able to do this but with time it had come of itself now he rode beside ilyin under the birch trees occasionally plucking leaves from a branch that met his hand sometimes touching his side with his foot or without turning round handing a pipe he had finished to an hussar riding behind him with as calm and careless an air as though he were merely out for a ride he glanced with pity at the excited face of ilyin who talked much and in great agitation he knew from experience the tormenting expectation of terror and death the cornet was suffering and knew that only time could help him 
 as soon as the sun appeared in a clear strip of sky beneath the clouds the wind fell as if it dared not spoil the beauty of the summer morning after the storm drops still continued to fall but vertically now and all was still the whole sun appeared on the horizon and disappeared behind a long narrow cloud that hung above it a few minutes later it reappeared brighter still from behind the top of the cloud tearing its edge everything grew bright and glittered and with that light and as if in reply to it came the sound of guns ahead of them 
 before rostov had had time to consider and determine the distance of that firing count adjutant came galloping from vitebsk with orders to advance at a trot along the road 
 the squadron overtook and passed the infantry and the battery which had also quickened their pace rode down a hill and passing through an empty and deserted village again ascended the horses began to lather and the men to flush 
 halt dress your ranks the order of the regimental commander was heard ahead forward by the left walk march came the order from in front 
 and the hussars passing along the line of troops on the left flank of our position halted behind our uhlans who were in the front line to the right stood our infantry in a dense column they were the reserve higher up the hill on the very horizon our guns were visible through the wonderfully clear air brightly illuminated by slanting morning sunbeams in front beyond a hollow dale could be seen the columns and guns our advanced line already in action could be heard briskly exchanging shots with the enemy in the dale 
 at these sounds long unheard spirits rose as at the strains of the merriest music cracked the shots now together now several quickly one after another again all was silent and then again it sounded as if someone were walking on detonators and exploding them 
 the hussars remained in the same place for about an hour a cannonade began count ostermann with his suite rode up behind the squadron halted spoke to the commander of the regiment and rode up the hill to the guns 
 after ostermann had gone a command rang out to the uhlans 
 form column prepare to charge 
 the infantry in front of them parted into platoons to allow the cavalry to pass the uhlans started the streamers on their spears fluttering and trotted downhill toward the french cavalry which was seen below to the left 
 as soon as the uhlans descended the hill the hussars were ordered up the hill to support the battery as they took the places vacated by the uhlans bullets came from the front whining and whistling but fell spent without taking effect 
 the sounds which he had not heard for so long had an even more pleasurable and exhilarating effect on rostov than the previous sounds of firing drawing himself up he viewed the field of battle opening out before him from the hill and with his whole soul followed the movement of the uhlans they swooped down close to the french dragoons something confused happened there amid the smoke and five minutes later our uhlans were galloping back not to the place they had occupied but more to the left and among the uhlans on chestnut horses and behind them in a large group blue french dragoons on gray horses could be seen

 chapter v 
 
 enlargement of horizon 
 the shocks of youthful minds among themselves have this admirable property that one can never foresee the spark nor divine the lightning flash 
 what will dart out presently 
 no one knows the burst of laughter starts from a tender feeling 
 at the moment of jest the serious makes its entry 
 impulses depend on the first chance word 
 the spirit of each is sovereign jest suffices to open the field to the unexpected 
 these are conversations with abrupt turns in which the perspective changes suddenly chance is the of such conversations 
 a severe thought starting oddly from a clash of words suddenly traversed the conflict of quips in which grantaire bahorel prouvaire bossuet combeferre and courfeyrac were confusedly fencing 
 how does a phrase crop up in a dialogue 
 whence comes it that it suddenly impresses itself on the attention of those who hear it we have just said that no one knows anything about it 
 in the midst of the uproar bossuet all at once terminated some apostrophe to combeferre with this date 
 june th waterloo 
 at this name of waterloo marius who was leaning his elbows on a table beside a glass of water removed his wrist from beneath his chin and began to gaze fixedly at the audience 
 pardieu exclaimed courfeyrac parbleu was falling into disuse at this period that number is strange and strikes me 
 it is fatal number 
 place louis in front and brumaire behind you have the whole destiny of the man with this significant peculiarity that the end treads close on the heels of the commencement 
 enjolras who had remained mute up to that point broke the silence and addressed this remark to combeferre 
 you mean to say the crime and the expiation 
 this word crime overpassed the measure of what marius who was already greatly agitated by the abrupt evocation of waterloo could accept 
 he rose walked slowly to the map of france spread out on the wall and at whose base an island was visible in a separate compartment laid his finger on this compartment and said 
 corsica a little island which has rendered france very great 
 this was like a breath of icy air 
 all ceased talking 
 they felt that something was on the point of occurring 
 bahorel replying to bossuet was just assuming an attitude of the torso to which he was addicted 
 he gave it up to listen 
 enjolras whose blue eye was not fixed on any one and who seemed to be gazing at space replied without glancing at marius 
 france needs no corsica to be great 
 france is great because she is france 
 quia nomina leo 
 marius felt no desire to retreat he turned towards enjolras and his voice burst forth with a vibration which came from a quiver of his very being 
 god forbid that i should diminish france 
 but amalgamating napoleon with her is not diminishing her 
 come let us argue the question i am a new comer among you but i will confess that you amaze me where do we stand 
 who are we 
 who are you 
 who am i 
 let us come to an explanation about the emperor 
 i hear you say buonaparte accenting the u like the royalists 
 i warn you that my grandfather does better still he says buonaparte i thought you were young men 
 where then is your enthusiasm 
 and what are you doing with it 
 whom do you admire if you do not admire the emperor and what more do you want 
 if you will have none of that great man what great men would you like 
 he had everything 
 he was complete he had in his brain the sum of human faculties 
 he made codes like justinian he dictated like caesar his conversation was mingled with the of pascal with the thunderclap of tacitus he made history and he wrote it his bulletins are iliads he combined the cipher of newton with the metaphor of mahomet he left behind him in the east words as great as the pyramids at tilsit he taught emperors majesty at the academy of sciences he replied to laplace in the council of state be held his own against merlin he gave a soul to the geometry of the first and to the chicanery of the last he was a legist with the attorneys and sidereal with the astronomers like cromwell blowing out one of two candles he went to the temple to bargain for a curtain tassel he saw everything he knew everything which did not prevent him from laughing beside the cradle of his little child and all at once frightened europe lent an ear armies put themselves in motion parks of artillery rumbled pontoons stretched over the rivers clouds of cavalry galloped in the storm cries trumpets a trembling of thrones in every direction the frontiers of kingdoms oscillated on the map the sound of a superhuman sword was heard as it was drawn from its sheath they beheld him him rise erect on the horizon with a blazing brand in his hand and a glow in his eyes unfolding amid the thunder his two wings the grand army and the old guard and he was the archangel of war 
 all held their peace and enjolras bowed his head 
 silence always produces somewhat the effect of acquiescence of the enemy being driven to the wall 
 marius continued with increased enthusiasm and almost without pausing for breath 
 let us be just my friends 
 what a splendid destiny for a nation to be the empire of such an emperor when that nation is france and when it adds its own genius to the genius of that man 
 to appear and to reign to march and to triumph to have for all capitals to take his grenadiers and to make kings of them to decree the falls of dynasties and to transfigure europe at the pace of a charge to make you feel that when you threaten you lay your hand on the hilt of the sword of god to follow in a single man hannibal caesar charlemagne to be the people of some one who mingles with your dawns the startling announcement of a battle won to have the cannon of the invalides to rouse you in the morning to hurl into abysses of light prodigious words which flame forever marengo arcola austerlitz jena wagram to cause constellations of victories to flash forth at each instant from the zenith of the centuries to make the french empire a pendant to the roman empire to be the great nation and to give birth to the grand army to make its legions fly forth over all the earth as a mountain sends out its eagles on all sides to conquer to dominate to strike with lightning to be in europe a sort of nation gilded through glory to sound athwart the centuries a of titans to conquer the world twice by conquest and by dazzling that is sublime and what greater thing is there 
 to be free said combeferre 
 marius lowered his head in his turn that cold and simple word had traversed his epic effusion like a blade of steel and he felt it vanishing within him 
 when he raised his eyes combeferre was no longer there 
 probably satisfied with his reply to the apotheosis he had just taken his departure and all with the exception of enjolras had followed him 
 the room had been emptied 
 enjolras left alone with marius was gazing gravely at him 
 marius however having rallied his ideas to some extent did not consider himself beaten there lingered in him a trace of inward fermentation which was on the point no doubt of translating itself into syllogisms arrayed against enjolras when all of a sudden they heard some one singing on the stairs as he went 
 it was combeferre and this is what he was singing si cesar donne la gloire et la guerre 
 et me fallait quitter de ma mere 
 je dirais au grand cesar reprends ton sceptre et ton char 
 mieux ma mere o gue 
 mieux ma mere 
 if cesar had given me glory and war and i were obliged to quit my love i would say to great caesar take back thy sceptre and thy chariot i prefer the love of my mother 
 the wild and tender accents with which combeferre sang communicated to this couplet a sort of strange grandeur 
 marius thoughtfully and with his eyes diked on the ceiling repeated almost mechanically my mother 
 at that moment he felt enjolras hand on his shoulder 
 citizen said enjolras to him my mother is the republic

 rostov with his keen eye was one of the first to catch sight of these blue french dragoons pursuing our uhlans nearer and nearer in disorderly crowds came the uhlans and the french dragoons pursuing them he could already see how these men who looked so small at the foot of the hill jostled and overtook one another waving their arms and their sabers in the air 
 rostov gazed at what was happening before him as at a hunt he felt instinctively that if the hussars struck at the french dragoons now the latter could not withstand them but if a charge was to be made it must be done now at that very moment or it would be too late he looked around a captain standing beside him was gazing like himself with eyes fixed on the cavalry below them 
 andrew sevastyanych said rostov you know we could crush them 
 a fine thing too replied the captain and really 
 rostov without waiting to hear him out touched his horse galloped to the front of his squadron and before he had time to finish giving the word of command the whole squadron sharing his feeling was following him rostov himself did not know how or why he did it he acted as he did when hunting without reflecting or considering he saw the dragoons near and that they were galloping in disorder he knew they could not withstand an attack knew there was only that moment and that if he let it slip it would not return the bullets were whining and whistling so stimulatingly around him and his horse was so eager to go that he could not restrain himself he touched his horse gave the word of command and immediately hearing behind him the tramp of the horses of his deployed squadron rode at full trot downhill toward the dragoons hardly had they reached the bottom of the hill before their pace instinctively changed to a gallop which grew faster and faster as they drew nearer to our uhlans and the french dragoons who galloped after them the dragoons were now close at hand on seeing the hussars the foremost began to turn while those behind began to halt with the same feeling with which he had galloped across the path of a wolf rostov gave rein to his donets horse and galloped to intersect the path of the dragoons disordered lines one uhlan stopped another who was on foot flung himself to the ground to avoid being knocked over and a riderless horse fell in among the hussars nearly all the french dragoons were galloping back rostov picking out one on a gray horse dashed after him on the way he came upon a bush his gallant horse cleared it and almost before he had righted himself in his saddle he saw that he would immediately overtake the enemy he had selected that frenchman by his uniform an officer was going at a gallop crouching on his gray horse and urging it on with his saber in another moment horse dashed its breast against the hindquarters of the horse almost knocking it over and at the same instant rostov without knowing why raised his saber and struck the frenchman with it 
 the instant he had done this all animation vanished the officer fell not so much from the blow which had but slightly cut his arm above the elbow as from the shock to his horse and from fright rostov reined in his horse and his eyes sought his foe to see whom he had vanquished the french dragoon officer was hopping with one foot on the ground the other being caught in the stirrup his eyes screwed up with fear as if he every moment expected another blow gazed up at rostov with shrinking terror his pale and face fair and young with a dimple in the chin and eyes was not an face at all suited to a battlefield but a most ordinary homelike face before rostov had decided what to do with him the officer cried i surrender he hurriedly but vainly tried to get his foot out of the stirrup and did not remove his frightened blue eyes from face some hussars who galloped up disengaged his foot and helped him into the saddle on all sides the hussars were busy with the dragoons one was wounded but though his face was bleeding he would not give up his horse another was perched up behind an hussar with his arms round him a third was being helped by an hussar to mount his horse in front the french infantry were firing as they ran the hussars galloped hastily back with their prisoners rostov galloped back with the rest aware of an unpleasant feeling of depression in his heart something vague and confused which he could not at all account for had come over him with the capture of that officer and the blow he had dealt him 
 count met the returning hussars sent for rostov thanked him and said he would report his gallant deed to the emperor and would recommend him for a st cross when sent for by count ostermann rostov remembering that he had charged without orders felt sure his commander was sending for him to punish him for breach of discipline flattering words and promise of a reward should therefore have struck him all the more pleasantly but he still felt that same vaguely disagreeable feeling of moral nausea but what on earth is worrying me he asked himself as he rode back from the general ilyin no safe have i disgraced myself in any way no not it something else resembling remorse tormented him yes oh yes that french officer with the dimple and i remember how my arm paused when i raised it 
 rostov saw the prisoners being led away and galloped after them to have a look at his frenchman with the dimple on his chin he was sitting in his foreign uniform on an hussar packhorse and looked anxiously about him the sword cut on his arm could scarcely be called a wound he glanced at rostov with a feigned smile and waved his hand in greeting rostov still had the same indefinite feeling as of shame 
 all that day and the next his friends and comrades noticed that rostov without being dull or angry was silent thoughtful and preoccupied he drank reluctantly tried to remain alone and kept turning something over in his mind 
 rostov was always thinking about that brilliant exploit of his which to his amazement had gained him the st cross and even given him a reputation for bravery and there was something he could not at all understand so others are even more afraid than i am he thought so all there is in what is called heroism and heroism and did i do it for my sake and how was he to blame with his dimple and blue eyes and how frightened he was he thought that i should kill him why should i kill him my hand trembled and they have given me a st cross i make it out at all 
 but while nicholas was considering these questions and still could reach no clear solution of what puzzled him so the wheel of fortune in the service as often happens turned in his favor after the affair at ostrovna he was brought into notice received command of an hussar battalion and when a brave officer was needed he was chosen

 res angusta 
 that evening left marius profoundly shaken and with a melancholy shadow in his soul 
 he felt what the earth may possibly feel at the moment when it is torn open with the iron in order that grain may be deposited within it it feels only the wound the quiver of the germ and the joy of the fruit only arrive later 
 marius was gloomy 
 he had but just acquired a faith must he then reject it already 
 he affirmed to himself that he would not he declared to himself that he would not doubt and he began to doubt in spite of himself 
 to stand between two religions from one of which you have not as yet emerged and another into which you have not yet entered is intolerable and twilight is pleasing only to souls 
 marius was and he required the true light 
 the of doubt pained him whatever may have been his desire to remain where he was he could not halt there he was irresistibly constrained to continue to advance to examine to think to march further 
 whither would this lead him he feared after having taken so many steps which had brought him nearer to his father to now take a step which should estrange him from that father 
 his discomfort was augmented by all the reflections which occurred to him 
 an escarpment rose around him he was in accord neither with his grandfather nor with his friends daring in the eyes of the one he was behind the times in the eyes of the others and he recognized the fact that he was doubly isolated on the side of age and on the side of youth 
 he ceased to go to the cafe musain 
 in the troubled state of his conscience he no longer thought of certain serious sides of existence 
 the realities of life do not allow themselves to be forgotten 
 they soon elbowed him abruptly 
 one morning the proprietor of the hotel entered marius room and said to him 
 monsieur courfeyrac answered for you 
 yes 
 but i must have my money 
 request courfeyrac to come and talk with me said marius 
 courfeyrac having made his appearance the host left them marius then told him what it had not before occurred to him to relate that he was the same as alone in the world and had no relatives 
 what is to become of you said courfeyrac 
 i do not know in the least replied marius 
 what are you going to do 
 i do not know 
 have you any money 
 fifteen francs 
 do you want me to lend you some 
 never 
 have you clothes 
 here is what i have 
 have you trinkets 
 a watch 
 silver 
 gold here it is 
 i know a who will take your and a pair of trousers 
 that is good 
 you will then have only a pair of trousers a waistcoat a hat and a coat 
 and my boots 
 what you will not go barefoot 
 what opulence 
 that will be enough 
 i know a watchmaker who will buy your watch 
 that is good 
 no it is not good 
 what will you do after that 
 whatever is necessary 
 anything honest that is to say 
 do you know english 
 no 
 do you know german 
 no 
 so much the worse 
 why 
 because one of my friends a publisher is getting up a sort of an encyclopaedia for which you might have translated english or german articles 
 it is badly paid work but one can live by it 
 i will learn english and german 
 and in the meanwhile 
 in the meanwhile i will live on my clothes and my watch 
 the was sent for 
 he paid twenty francs for the garments 
 they went to the he bought the watch for francs 
 that is not bad said marius to courfeyrac on their return to the hotel with my fifteen francs that makes eighty 
 and the hotel bill observed courfeyrac 
 hello i had forgotten that said marius 
 the landlord presented his bill which had to be paid on the spot it amounted to seventy francs 
 i have ten francs left said marius 
 the deuce exclaimed courfeyrac you will eat up five francs while you are learning english and five while learning german that will be swallowing a tongue very fast or a hundred sous very slowly 
 in the meantime aunt gillenormand a rather person at bottom in difficulties had finally hunted up marius abode 
 one morning on his return from the marius found a letter from his aunt and the sixty pistoles that is to say six hundred francs in gold in a sealed box 
 marius sent back the thirty louis to his aunt with a respectful letter in which he stated that he had sufficient means of subsistence and that he should be able thenceforth to supply all his needs at that moment he had three francs left 
 his aunt did not inform his grandfather of this refusal for fear of exasperating him 
 besides had he not said 
 let me never hear the name of that again 
 marius left the hotel de la porte as he did not wish to run in debt there

 on receiving news of illness the countess though not quite well yet and still weak went to moscow with petya and the rest of the household and the whole family moved from marya house to their own and settled down in town 
 illness was so serious that fortunately for her and for her parents the consideration of all that had caused the illness her conduct and the breaking off of her engagement receded into the background she was so ill that it was impossible for them to consider in how far she was to blame for what had happened she could not eat or sleep grew visibly thinner coughed and as the doctors made them feel was in danger they could not think of anything but how to help her doctors came to see her singly and in consultation talked much in french german and latin blamed one another and prescribed a great variety of medicines for all the diseases known to them but the simple idea never occurred to any of them that they could not know the disease natasha was suffering from as no disease suffered by a live man can be known for every living person has his own peculiarities and always has his own peculiar personal novel complicated disease unknown to medicine not a disease of the lungs liver skin heart nerves and so on mentioned in medical books but a disease consisting of one of the innumerable combinations of the maladies of those organs this simple thought could not occur to the doctors as it cannot occur to a wizard that he is unable to work his charms because the business of their lives was to cure and they received money for it and had spent the best years of their lives on that business but above all that thought was kept out of their minds by the fact that they saw they were really useful as in fact they were to the whole rostov family their usefulness did not depend on making the patient swallow substances for the most part harmful the harm was scarcely perceptible as they were given in small doses but they were useful necessary and indispensable because they satisfied a mental need of the invalid and of those who loved her and that is why there are and always will be wise women homeopaths and allopaths they satisfied that eternal human need for hope of relief for sympathy and that something should be done which is felt by those who are suffering they satisfied the need seen in its most elementary form in a child when it wants to have a place rubbed that has been hurt a child knocks itself and runs at once to the arms of its mother or nurse to have the aching spot rubbed or kissed and it feels better when this is done the child cannot believe that the strongest and wisest of its people have no remedy for its pain and the hope of relief and the expression of its sympathy while she rubs the bump comforts it the doctors were of use to natasha because they kissed and rubbed her bump assuring her that it would soon pass if only the coachman went to the in the arbat and got a powder and some pills in a pretty box of a ruble and seventy kopeks and if she took those powders in boiled water at intervals of precisely two hours neither more nor less 
 what would sonya and the count and countess have done how would they have looked if nothing had been done if there had not been those pills to give by the clock the warm drinks the chicken cutlets and all the other details of life ordered by the doctors the carrying out of which supplied an occupation and consolation to the family circle how would the count have borne his dearly loved illness had he not known that it was costing him a thousand rubles and that he would not grudge thousands more to benefit her or had he not known that if her illness continued he would not grudge yet other thousands and would take her abroad for consultations there and had he not been able to explain the details of how metivier and feller had not understood the symptoms but frise had and mudrov had diagnosed them even better what would the countess have done had she not been able sometimes to scold the invalid for not strictly obeying the orders 
 never get well like that she would say forgetting her grief in her vexation if you obey the doctor and take your medicine at the right time you trifle with it you know or it may turn to pneumonia she would go on deriving much comfort from the utterance of that foreign word incomprehensible to others as well as to herself 
 what would sonya have done without the glad consciousness that she had not undressed during the first three nights in order to be ready to carry out all the injunctions with precision and that she still kept awake at night so as not to miss the proper time when the slightly harmful pills in the little gilt box had to be administered even to natasha herself it was pleasant to see that so many sacrifices were being made for her sake and to know that she had to take medicine at certain hours though she declared that no medicine would cure her and that it was all nonsense and it was even pleasant to be able to show by disregarding the orders that she did not believe in medical treatment and did not value her life 
 the doctor came every day felt her pulse looked at her tongue and regardless of her face joked with her but when he had gone into another room to which the countess hurriedly followed him he assumed a grave air and thoughtfully shaking his head said that though there was danger he had hopes of the effect of this last medicine and one must wait and see that the malady was chiefly mental but and the countess trying to conceal the action from herself and from him slipped a gold coin into his hand and always returned to the patient with a more tranquil mind 
 the symptoms of illness were that she ate little slept little coughed and was always the doctors said that she could not get on without medical treatment so they kept her in the stifling atmosphere of the town and the rostovs did not move to the country that summer of 
 in spite of the many pills she swallowed and the drops and powders out of the little bottles and boxes of which madame schoss who was fond of such things made a large collection and in spite of being deprived of the country life to which she was accustomed youth prevailed grief began to be overlaid by the impressions of daily life it ceased to press so painfully on her heart it gradually faded into the past and she began to recover physically

 marius indigent 
 life became hard for marius 
 it was nothing to eat his clothes and his watch 
 he ate of that terrible inexpressible thing that is called de la vache enrage that is to say he endured great hardships and privations 
 a terrible thing it is containing days without bread nights without sleep evenings without a candle a hearth without a fire weeks without work a future without hope a coat out at the elbows an old hat which evokes the laughter of young girls a door which one finds locked on one at night because rent is not paid the insolence of the porter and the man the sneers of neighbors humiliations dignity trampled on work of whatever nature accepted disgusts bitterness despondency 
 marius learned how all this is eaten and how such are often the only things which one has to devour 
 at that moment of his existence when a man needs his pride because he needs love he felt that he was jeered at because he was badly dressed and ridiculous because he was poor at the age when youth swells the heart with imperial pride he dropped his eyes more than once on his dilapidated boots and he knew the unjust shame and the poignant blushes of wretchedness admirable and terrible trial from which the feeble emerge base from which the strong emerge sublime 
 a crucible into which destiny casts a man whenever it desires a scoundrel or a 
 for many great deeds are performed in petty combats 
 there are instances of bravery ignored and obstinate which defend themselves step by step in that fatal onslaught of necessities and turpitudes noble and mysterious triumphs which no eye beholds which are requited with no renown which are saluted with no trumpet blast life misfortune isolation abandonment poverty are the fields of battle which have their heroes obscure heroes who are sometimes grander than the heroes who win renown 
 firm and rare natures are thus created misery almost always a is sometimes a mother destitution gives birth to might of soul and spirit distress is the nurse of pride unhappiness is a good milk for the magnanimous 
 there came a moment in marius life when he swept his own landing when he bought his worth of brie cheese at the when he waited until twilight had fallen to slip into the and purchase a loaf which he carried off furtively to his attic as though he had stolen it 
 sometimes there could be seen gliding into the shop on the corner in the midst of the bantering cooks who elbowed him an awkward young man carrying big books under his arm who had a timid yet angry air who on entering removed his hat from a brow whereon stood drops of perspiration made a profound bow to the astonished wife asked for a mutton cutlet paid six or seven sous for it wrapped it up in a paper put it under his arm between two books and went away it was marius 
 on this cutlet which he cooked for himself he lived for three days 
 on the first day he ate the meat on the second he ate the fat on the third he gnawed the bone 
 aunt gillenormand made repeated attempts and sent him the sixty pistoles several times marius returned them on every occasion saying that he needed nothing 
 he was still in mourning for his father when the revolution which we have just described was effected within him 
 from that time forth he had not put off his black garments 
 but his garments were quitting him 
 the day came when he had no longer a coat the trousers would go next 
 what was to be done 
 courfeyrac to whom he had on his side done some good turns gave him an old coat for thirty sous marius got it turned by some porter or other and it was a new coat 
 but this coat was green 
 then marius ceased to go out until after nightfall 
 this made his coat black as he wished always to appear in mourning he clothed himself with the night 
 in spite of all this he got admitted to practice as a lawyer he was supposed to live in room which was decent and where a certain number of backed up and completed by several dilapidated volumes of romance passed as the library required by the regulations 
 he had his letters addressed to quarters 
 when marius became a lawyer he informed his grandfather of the fact in a letter which was cold but full of submission and respect m gillenormand trembled as he took the letter read it tore it in four pieces and threw it into the two or three days later mademoiselle gillenormand heard her father who was alone in his room talking aloud to himself 
 he always did this whenever he was greatly agitated 
 she listened and the old man was saying if you were not a fool you would know that one cannot be a baron and a lawyer at the same time

 natasha was calmer but no happier she not merely avoided all external forms of pleasure balls promenades concerts and theaters but she never laughed without a sound of tears in her laughter she could not sing as soon as she began to laugh or tried to sing by herself tears choked her tears of remorse tears at the recollection of those pure times which could never return tears of vexation that she should so uselessly have ruined her young life which might have been so happy laughter and singing in particular seemed to her like a blasphemy in face of her sorrow without any need of no wish to coquet ever entered her head she said and felt at that time that no man was more to her than nastasya ivanovna the buffoon something stood sentinel within her and forbade her every joy besides she had lost all the old interests of her carefree girlish life that had been so full of hope the previous autumn the hunting uncle and the christmas holidays spent with nicholas at otradnoe were what she recalled oftenest and most painfully what would she not have given to bring back even a single day of that time but it was gone forever her presentiment at the time had not deceived her that that state of freedom and readiness for any enjoyment would not return again yet it was necessary to live on 
 it comforted her to reflect that she was not better as she had formerly imagined but worse much worse than anybody else in the world but this was not enough she knew that and asked herself what next but there was nothing to come there was no joy in life yet life was passing natasha apparently tried not to be a burden or a hindrance to anyone but wanted nothing for herself she kept away from everyone in the house and felt at ease only with her brother petya she liked to be with him better than with the others and when alone with him she sometimes laughed she hardly ever left the house and of those who came to see them was glad to see only one person pierre it would have been impossible to treat her with more delicacy greater care and at the same time more seriously than did count bezukhov natasha unconsciously felt this delicacy and so found great pleasure in his society but she was not even grateful to him for it nothing good on part seemed to her to be an effort it seemed so natural for him to be kind to everyone that there was no merit in his kindness sometimes natasha noticed embarrassment and awkwardness on his part in her presence especially when he wanted to do something to please her or feared that something they spoke of would awaken memories distressing to her she noticed this and attributed it to his general kindness and shyness which she imagined must be the same toward everyone as it was to her after those involuntary words that if he were free he would have asked on his knees for her hand and her love uttered at a moment when she was so strongly agitated pierre never spoke to natasha of his feelings and it seemed plain to her that those words which had then so comforted her were spoken as all sorts of meaningless words are spoken to comfort a crying child it was not because pierre was a married man but because natasha felt very strongly with him that moral barrier the absence of which she had experienced with kuragin that it never entered her head that the relations between him and herself could lead to love on her part still less on his or even to the kind of tender romantic friendship between a man and a woman of which she had known several instances 
 before the end of the fast of st peter agrafena ivanovna belova a country neighbor of the rostovs came to moscow to pay her devotions at the shrines of the moscow saints she suggested that natasha should fast and prepare for holy communion and natasha gladly welcomed the idea despite the orders that she should not go out early in the morning natasha insisted on fasting and preparing for the sacrament not as they generally prepared for it in the rostov family by attending three services in their own house but as agrafena ivanovna did by going to church every day for a week and not once missing vespers matins or mass 
 the countess was pleased with zeal after the poor results of the medical treatment in the depths of her heart she hoped that prayer might help her daughter more than medicines and though not without fear and concealing it from the doctor she agreed to wish and entrusted her to belova agrafena ivanovna used to come to wake natasha at three in the morning but generally found her already awake she was afraid of being late for matins hastily washing and meekly putting on her shabbiest dress and an old mantilla natasha shivering in the fresh air went out into the deserted streets lit by the clear light of dawn by agrafena advice natasha prepared herself not in their own parish but at a church where according to the devout agrafena ivanovna the priest was a man of very severe and lofty life there were never many people in the church natasha always stood beside belova in the customary place before an icon of the blessed virgin let into the screen before the choir on the left side and a feeling new to her of humility before something great and incomprehensible seized her when at that unusual morning hour gazing at the dark face of the virgin illuminated by the candles burning before it and by the morning light falling from the window she listened to the words of the service which she tried to follow with understanding when she understood them her personal feeling became interwoven in the prayers with shades of its own when she did not understand it was sweeter still to think that the wish to understand everything is pride that it is impossible to understand all that it is only necessary to believe and to commit oneself to god whom she felt guiding her soul at those moments she crossed herself bowed low and when she did not understand in horror at her own vileness simply asked god to forgive her everything everything to have mercy upon her the prayers to which she surrendered herself most of all were those of repentance on her way home at an early hour when she met no one but bricklayers going to work or men sweeping the street and everybody within the houses was still asleep natasha experienced a feeling new to her a sense of the possibility of correcting her faults the possibility of a new clean life and of happiness 
 during the whole week she spent in this way that feeling grew every day and the happiness of taking communion or communing as agrafena ivanovna joyously playing with the word called it seemed to natasha so great that she felt she should never live till that blessed sunday 
 but the happy day came and on that memorable sunday when dressed in white muslin she returned home after communion for the first time for many months she felt calm and not oppressed by the thought of the life that lay before her 
 the doctor who came to see her that day ordered her to continue the powders he had prescribed a fortnight previously 
 she must certainly go on taking them morning and evening said he evidently sincerely satisfied with his success only please be particular about it 
 be quite easy he continued playfully as he adroitly took the gold coin in his palm she will soon be singing and frolicking about the last medicine has done her a very great deal of good she has freshened up very much 
 the countess with a cheerful expression on her face looked down at her nails and spat a little for luck as she returned to the drawing room

 marius poor 
 it is the same with wretchedness as with everything else 
 it ends by becoming bearable 
 it finally assumes a form and adjusts itself one vegetates that is to say one develops in a certain meagre fashion which is however sufficient for life 
 this is the mode in which the existence of marius pontmercy was arranged 
 he had passed the worst straits the narrow pass was opening out a little in front of him 
 by dint of toil perseverance courage and will he had managed to draw from his work about seven hundred francs a year he had learned german and english thanks to courfeyrac who had put him in communication with his friend the publisher marius filled the modest post of utility man in the literature of the publishing house he drew up prospectuses translated newspapers annotated editions compiled biographies etc net product year in and year out seven hundred francs 
 he lived on it 
 how 
 not so badly we will explain 
 marius occupied in the gorbeau house for an annual sum of thirty francs a den minus a fireplace called a cabinet which contained only the most indispensable articles of furniture 
 this furniture belonged to him 
 he gave three francs a month to the old principal tenant to come and sweep his hole and to bring him a little hot water every morning a fresh egg and a penny roll 
 he breakfasted on this egg and roll 
 his breakfast varied in cost from two to four sous according as eggs were dear or cheap 
 at six in the evening he descended the rue to dine at opposite the on the corner of the rue des mathurins 
 he ate no soup 
 he took a plate of meat a of vegetables for three sous and a dessert for three sous he got as much bread as he wished 
 as for wine he drank water 
 when he paid at the desk where madam rousseau at that period still plump and rosy majestically presided he gave a sou to the waiter and madam rousseau gave him a smile then he went away 
 for sixteen sous he had a smile and a dinner 
 this restaurant rousseau where so few bottles and so many water carafes were emptied was a calming potion rather than a restaurant it no longer exists 
 the proprietor had a fine nickname 
 he was called rousseau the aquatic 
 thus breakfast four sous dinner sixteen sous his food cost him twenty sous a day which made three hundred and francs a year 
 add the thirty francs for rent and the francs to the old woman plus a few trifling expenses for four hundred and fifty francs marius was fed lodged and waited on his clothing cost him a hundred francs his linen fifty francs his washing fifty francs the whole did not exceed six hundred and fifty francs 
 he was rich 
 he sometimes lent ten francs to a friend courfeyrac had once been able to borrow sixty francs of him as far as fire was concerned as marius had no fireplace he had simplified matters 
 marius always had two complete suits of clothes the one old for every day the other brand new for special occasions both were black 
 he had but three shirts one on his person the second in the commode and the third in the hands he renewed them as they wore out 
 they were always ragged which caused him to button his coat to the chin 
 it had required years for marius to attain to this flourishing condition hard years difficult some of them to traverse others to climb marius had not failed for a single day 
 he had endured everything in the way of destitution he had done everything except contract debts he did himself the justice to say that he had never owed any one a sou a debt was to him the beginning of slavery 
 he even said to himself that a creditor is worse than a master for the master possesses only your person a creditor possesses your dignity and can administer to it a box on the ear 
 rather than borrow he went without food he had passed many a day fasting 
 feeling that all extremes meet and that if one is not on guard lowered fortunes may lead to baseness of soul he kept a jealous watch on his pride such and such a formality or action which in any other situation would have appeared merely a deference to him now seemed insipidity and he nerved himself against it 
 his face wore a sort of severe flush he was timid even to rudeness 
 during all these trials he had felt himself encouraged and even uplifted at times by a secret force that he possessed within himself the soul aids the body and at certain moments raises it it is the only bird which bears up its own cage 
 besides his name another name was graven in marius heart the name of thenardier 
 marius with his grave and enthusiastic nature surrounded with a sort of aureole the man to whom in his thoughts he owed his intrepid sergeant who had saved the colonel amid the bullets and the of waterloo he never separated the memory of this man from the memory of his father and he associated them in his veneration 
 it was a sort of worship in two steps with the grand altar for the colonel and the lesser one for thenardier 
 what redoubled the tenderness of his gratitude towards thenardier was the idea of the distress into which he knew that thenardier had fallen and which had engulfed the latter marius had learned at montfermeil of the ruin and bankruptcy of the unfortunate since that time he had made efforts to find traces of him and to reach him in that dark abyss of misery in which thenardier had disappeared 
 marius had beaten the whole country he had gone to chelles to bondy to gourney to nogent to lagny he had persisted for three years expending in these explorations the little money which he had laid by 
 no one had been able to give him any news of thenardier 
 he was supposed to have gone abroad his creditors had also sought him with less love than marius but with as much assiduity and had not been able to lay their hands on him 
 marius blamed himself and was almost angry with himself for his lack of success in his researches 
 it was the only debt left him by the colonel and marius made it a matter of honor to pay it what he thought when my father lay dying on the field of battle did thenardier contrive to find him amid the smoke and the and bear him off on his shoulders and yet he owed him nothing and i who owe so much to thenardier cannot join him in this shadow where he is lying in the pangs of death and in my turn bring him back from death to life 
 oh 
 i will find him to find thenardier in fact marius would have given one of his arms to rescue him from his misery he would have sacrificed all his blood to see thenardier to render thenardier some service to say to him you do not know me well i do know you 
 here i am 
 dispose of me this was marius sweetest and most magnificent dream

 chapter xviii 
 
 at the beginning of july more and more disquieting reports about the war began to spread in moscow people spoke of an appeal by the emperor to the people and of his coming himself from the army to moscow and as up to the eleventh of july no manifesto or appeal had been received exaggerated reports became current about them and about the position of russia it was said that the emperor was leaving the army because it was in danger it was said that smolensk had surrendered that napoleon had an army of a million and only a miracle could save russia 
 on the eleventh of july which was saturday the manifesto was received but was not yet in print and pierre who was at the rostovs promised to come to dinner next day sunday and bring a copy of the manifesto and appeal which he would obtain from count rostopchin 
 that sunday the rostovs went to mass at the razumovskis private chapel as usual it was a hot july day even at ten when the rostovs got out of their carriage at the chapel the sultry air the shouts of hawkers the light and gay summer clothes of the crowd the dusty leaves of the trees on the boulevard the sounds of the band and the white trousers of a battalion marching to parade the rattling of wheels on the cobblestones and the brilliant hot sunshine were all full of that summer languor that content and discontent with the present which is most strongly felt on a bright hot day in town all the moscow notabilities all the rostovs acquaintances were at the razumovskis chapel for as if expecting something to happen many wealthy families who usually left town for their country estates had not gone away that summer as natasha at her side passed through the crowd behind a liveried footman who cleared the way for them she heard a young man speaking about her in too loud a whisper 
 rostova the one who 
 much thinner but all the same pretty 
 she heard or thought she heard the names of kuragin and bolkonski but she was always imagining that it always seemed to her that everyone who looked at her was thinking only of what had happened to her with a sinking heart wretched as she always was now when she found herself in a crowd natasha in her lilac silk dress trimmed with black lace walked as women can walk with the more repose and stateliness the greater the pain and shame in her soul she knew for certain that she was pretty but this no longer gave her satisfaction as it used to on the contrary it tormented her more than anything else of late and particularly so on this bright hot summer day in town sunday again another week past she thought recalling that she had been here the sunday before and always the same life that is no life and the same surroundings in which it used to be so easy to live pretty young and i know that now i am good i used to be bad but now i know i am good she thought but yet my best years are slipping by and are no good to anyone she stood by her side and exchanged nods with acquaintances near her from habit she scrutinized the ladies dresses condemned the bearing of a lady standing close by who was not crossing herself properly but in a cramped manner and again she thought with vexation that she was herself being judged and was judging others and suddenly at the sound of the service she felt horrified at her own vileness horrified that the former purity of her soul was again lost to her 
 a comely old man was conducting the service with that mild solemnity which has so elevating and soothing an effect on the souls of the worshipers the gates of the sanctuary screen were closed the curtain was slowly drawn and from behind it a soft mysterious voice pronounced some words tears the cause of which she herself did not understand made breast heave and a joyous but oppressive feeling agitated her 
 teach me what i should do how to live my life how i may grow good forever forever she pleaded 
 the deacon came out onto the raised space before the altar screen and holding his thumb extended drew his long hair from under his dalmatic and making the sign of the cross on his breast began in a loud and solemn voice to recite the words of the prayer 
 in peace let us pray unto the lord 
 as one community without distinction of class without enmity united by brotherly love let us pray thought natasha 
 for the peace that is from above and for the salvation of our souls 
 for the world of angels and all the spirits who dwell above us prayed natasha 
 when they prayed for the warriors she thought of her brother and denisov when they prayed for all traveling by land and sea she remembered prince andrew prayed for him and asked god to forgive her all the wrongs she had done him when they prayed for those who love us she prayed for the members of her own family her father and mother and sonya realizing for the first time how wrongly she had acted toward them and feeling all the strength of her love for them when they prayed for those who hate us she tried to think of her enemies and people who hated her in order to pray for them she included among her enemies the creditors and all who had business dealings with her father and always at the thought of enemies and those who hated her she remembered anatole who had done her so much harm and though he did not hate her she gladly prayed for him as for an enemy only at prayer did she feel able to think clearly and calmly of prince andrew and anatole as men for whom her feelings were as nothing compared with her awe and devotion to god when they prayed for the imperial family and the synod she bowed very low and made the sign of the cross saying to herself that even if she did not understand still she could not doubt and at any rate loved the governing synod and prayed for it 
 when he had finished the litany the deacon crossed the stole over his breast and said let us commit ourselves and our whole lives to christ the lord 
 commit ourselves to god natasha inwardly repeated lord god i submit myself to thy will she thought i want nothing wish for nothing teach me what to do and how to use my will take me take me prayed natasha with impatient emotion in her heart not crossing herself but letting her slender arms hang down as if expecting some invisible power at any moment to take her and deliver her from herself from her regrets desires remorse hopes and sins 
 the countess looked round several times at her softened face and shining eyes and prayed god to help her 
 unexpectedly in the middle of the service and not in the usual order natasha knew so well the deacon brought out a small stool the one he knelt on when praying on trinity sunday and placed it before the doors of the sanctuary screen the priest came out with his purple velvet biretta on his head adjusted his hair and knelt down with an effort everybody followed his example and they looked at one another in surprise then came the prayer just received from the synod a prayer for the deliverance of russia from hostile invasion 
 lord god of might god of our salvation began the priest in that voice clear not grandiloquent but mild in which only the slav clergy read and which acts so irresistibly on a russian heart 
 lord god of might god of our salvation look this day in mercy and blessing on thy humble people and graciously hear us spare us and have mercy upon us this foe confounding thy land desiring to lay waste the whole world rises against us these lawless men are gathered together to overthrow thy kingdom to destroy thy dear jerusalem thy beloved russia to defile thy temples to overthrow thine altars and to desecrate our holy shrines how long o lord how long shall the wicked triumph how long shall they wield unlawful power 
 lord god hear us when we pray to thee strengthen with thy might our most gracious sovereign lord the emperor alexander pavlovich be mindful of his uprightness and meekness reward him according to his righteousness and let it preserve us thy chosen israel bless his counsels his undertakings and his work strengthen his kingdom by thine almighty hand and give him victory over his enemy even as thou gavest moses the victory over amalek gideon over midian and david over goliath preserve his army put a bow of brass in the hands of those who have armed themselves in thy name and gird their loins with strength for the fight take up the spear and shield and arise to help us confound and put to shame those who have devised evil against us may they be before the faces of thy faithful warriors as dust before the wind and may thy mighty angel confound them and put them to flight may they be ensnared when they know it not and may the plots they have laid in secret be turned against them let them fall before thy servants feet and be laid low by our hosts lord thou art able to save both great and small thou art god and man cannot prevail against thee 
 god of our fathers remember thy bounteous mercy and which are from of old turn not thy face from us but be gracious to our unworthiness and in thy great goodness and thy many mercies regard not our transgressions and iniquities create in us a clean heart and renew a right spirit within us strengthen us all in thy faith fortify our hope inspire us with true love one for another arm us with unity of spirit in the righteous defense of the heritage thou gavest to us and to our fathers and let not the scepter of the wicked be exalted against the destiny of those thou hast sanctified 
 o lord our god in whom we believe and in whom we put our trust let us not be confounded in our hope of thy mercy and give us a token of thy blessing that those who hate us and our orthodox faith may see it and be put to shame and perish and may all the nations know that thou art the lord and we are thy people show thy mercy upon us this day o lord and grant us thy salvation make the hearts of thy servants to rejoice in thy mercy smite down our enemies and destroy them swiftly beneath the feet of thy faithful servants for thou art the defense the succor and the victory of them that put their trust in thee and to thee be all glory to father son and holy ghost now and forever world without end amen 
 in receptive condition of soul this prayer affected her strongly she listened to every word about the victory of moses over amalek of gideon over midian and of david over goliath and about the destruction of thy jerusalem and she prayed to god with the tenderness and emotion with which her heart was overflowing but without fully understanding what she was asking of god in that prayer she shared with all her heart in the prayer for the spirit of righteousness for the strengthening of the heart by faith and hope and its animation by love but she could not pray that her enemies might be trampled under foot when but a few minutes before she had been wishing she had more of them that she might pray for them but neither could she doubt the righteousness of the prayer that was being read on bended knees she felt in her heart a devout and tremulous awe at the thought of the punishment that overtakes men for their sins and especially of her own sins and she prayed to god to forgive them all and her too and to give them all and her too peace and happiness and it seemed to her that god heard her prayer

 book excellence of misfortune 
 chapter iii 
 
 marius grown up 
 at this epoch marius was twenty years of age 
 it was three years since he had left his grandfather 
 both parties had remained on the same terms without attempting to approach each other and without seeking to see each other 
 besides what was the use of seeing each other 
 marius was the brass vase while father gillenormand was the iron pot 
 we admit that marius was mistaken as to his heart he had imagined that m gillenormand had never loved him and that that crusty harsh and smiling old fellow who cursed shouted and stormed and brandished his cane cherished for him at the most only that affection which is at once slight and severe of the dotards of comedy 
 marius was in error there are fathers who do not love their children there exists no grandfather who does not adore his grandson 
 at bottom as we have said m gillenormand idolized marius 
 he idolized him after his own fashion with an accompaniment of snappishness and boxes on the ear but this child once gone he felt a black void in his heart he would allow no one to mention the child to him and all the while secretly regretted that he was so well obeyed at first he hoped that this buonapartist this jacobin this terrorist this septembrist would return 
 but the weeks passed by years passed to m great despair the did not make his appearance 
 i could not do otherwise than turn him out said the grandfather to himself and he asked himself if the thing were to do over again would i do it 
 his pride instantly answered yes but his aged head which he shook in silence replied sadly no 
 he had his hours of depression he missed marius 
 old men need affection as they need the sun it is warmth 
 strong as his nature was the absence of marius had wrought some change in him 
 nothing in the world could have induced him to take a step towards that rogue but he suffered he never inquired about him but he thought of him incessantly he lived in the marais in a more and more retired manner he was still merry and violent as of old but his merriment had a convulsive harshness and his violences always terminated in a sort of gentle and gloomy dejection 
 he sometimes said oh if he only would return what a good box on the ear i would give him 
 as for his aunt she thought too little to love much marius was no longer for her much more than a vague black form and she eventually came to occupy herself with him much less than with the cat or the paroquet which she probably had 
 what augmented father secret suffering was that he locked it all up within his breast and did not allow its existence to be divined his sorrow was like those recently invented furnaces which consume their own smoke 
 it sometimes happened that officious busybodies spoke to him of marius and asked him 
 what is your grandson doing what has become of him 
 the old bourgeois replied with a sigh that he was a sad case and giving a fillip to his cuff if he wished to appear gay 
 monsieur le baron de pontmercy is practising pettifogging in some corner or other 
 while the old man regretted marius applauded himself as is the case with all people misfortune had eradicated his bitterness 
 he only thought of m gillenormand in an amiable light but he had set his mind on not receiving anything more from the man who had been unkind to his father this was the mitigated translation of his first indignation moreover he was happy at having suffered and at suffering still it was for his sake 
 the hardness of his life satisfied and pleased him 
 he said to himself with a sort of joy that it was certainly the least he could do that it was an expiation that had it not been for that he would have been punished in some other way and later on for his impious indifference towards his father and such a father that it would not have been just that his father should have all the suffering and he none of it and that in any case what were his toils and his destitution compared with the heroic life that in short the only way for him to approach his father and resemble him was to be brave in the face of indigence as the other had been valiant before the enemy and that that was no doubt what the colonel had meant to imply by the words he will be worthy of it 
 words which marius continued to wear not on his breast since the writing had disappeared but in his heart 
 and then on the day when his grandfather had turned him out of doors he had been only a child now he was a man 
 he felt it 
 misery we repeat had been good for him 
 poverty in youth when it succeeds has this magnificent property about it that it turns the whole will towards effort and the whole soul towards aspiration poverty instantly lays material life bare and renders it hideous hence inexpressible bounds towards the ideal life 
 the wealthy young man has a hundred coarse and brilliant distractions horse races hunting dogs tobacco gaming good repasts and all the rest of it occupations for the baser side of the soul at the expense of the loftier and more delicate sides 
 the poor young man wins his bread with difficulty he eats when he has eaten he has nothing more but meditation 
 he goes to the spectacles which god furnishes gratis he gazes at the sky space the stars flowers children the humanity among which he is suffering the creation amid which he beams he gazes so much on humanity that he perceives its soul he gazes upon creation to such an extent that he beholds god 
 he dreams he feels himself great he dreams on and feels himself tender from the egotism of the man who suffers he passes to the compassion of the man who meditates 
 an admirable sentiment breaks forth in him forgetfulness of self and pity for all as he thinks of the innumerable enjoyments which nature offers gives and lavishes to souls which stand open and refuses to souls that are closed he comes to pity he the millionnaire of the mind the millionnaire of money 
 all hatred departs from his heart in proportion as light penetrates his spirit 
 and is he unhappy no the misery of a young man is never miserable 
 the first young lad who comes to hand however poor he may be with his strength his health his rapid walk his brilliant eyes his warmly circulating blood his black hair his red lips his white teeth his pure breath will always arouse the envy of an aged emperor and then every morning he sets himself afresh to the task of earning his bread and while his hands earn his bread his dorsal column gains pride his brain gathers ideas 
 his task finished he returns to ineffable ecstasies to contemplation to joys he beholds his feet set in afflictions in obstacles on the pavement in the nettles sometimes in the mire his head in the light 
 he is firm serene gentle peaceful attentive serious content with little kindly and he thanks god for having bestowed on him those two forms of riches which many a rich man lacks 
 work which makes him free and thought which makes him dignified 
 this is what had happened with marius 
 to tell the truth he inclined a little too much to the side of contemplation 
 from the day when he had succeeded in earning his living with some approach to certainty he had stopped thinking it good to be poor and retrenching time from his work to give to thought that is to say he sometimes passed entire days in meditation absorbed engulfed like a visionary in the mute voluptuousness of ecstasy and inward radiance he had thus propounded the problem of his life 
 to toil as little as possible at material labor in order to toil as much as possible at the labor which is impalpable in other words to bestow a few hours on real life and to cast the rest to the infinite 
 as he believed that he lacked nothing he did not perceive that contemplation thus understood ends by becoming one of the forms of idleness that he was contenting himself with conquering the first necessities of life and that he was resting from his labors too soon 
 it was evident that for this energetic and enthusiastic nature this could only be a transitory state and that at the first shock against the inevitable complications of destiny marius would awaken 
 in the meantime although he was a lawyer and whatever father gillenormand thought about the matter he was not practising he was not even pettifogging 
 meditation had turned him aside from pleading to haunt attorneys to follow the court to hunt up cases what a bore 
 why should he do it 
 he saw no reason for changing the manner of gaining his livelihood 
 the obscure and publishing establishment had come to mean for him a sure source of work which did not involve too much labor as we have explained and which sufficed for his wants 
 one of the publishers for whom he worked m magimel i think offered to take him into his own house to lodge him well to furnish him with regular occupation and to give him fifteen hundred francs a year 
 to be well lodged 
 fifteen hundred francs 
 no doubt but renounce his liberty 
 be on fixed wages 
 a sort of hired man of letters 
 according to marius opinion if he accepted his position would become both better and worse at the same time he acquired comfort and lost his dignity it was a fine and complete unhappiness converted into a repulsive and ridiculous state of torture something like the case of a blind man who should recover the sight of one eye 
 he refused 
 marius dwelt in solitude 
 owing to his taste for remaining outside of everything and through having been too much alarmed he had not entered decidedly into the group presided over by enjolras they had remained good friends they were ready to assist each other on occasion in every possible way but nothing more marius had two friends 
 one young courfeyrac and one old m mabeuf 
 he inclined more to the old man 
 in the first place he owed to him the revolution which had taken place within him to him he was indebted for having known and loved his father he operated on me for a cataract he said 
 the churchwarden had certainly played a decisive part 
 it was not however that m mabeuf had been anything but the calm and impassive agent of providence in this connection 
 he had enlightened marius by chance and without being aware of the fact as does a candle which some one brings he had been the candle and not the some one 
 as for marius inward political revolution m mabeuf was totally incapable of comprehending it of willing or of directing it 
 as we shall see m mabeuf again later on a few words will not be superfluous

 book nine 
 chapter xix 
 
 from the day when pierre after leaving the rostovs with grateful look fresh in his mind had gazed at the comet that seemed to be fixed in the sky and felt that something new was appearing on his own horizon from that day the problem of the vanity and uselessness of all earthly things that had incessantly tormented him no longer presented itself that terrible question why wherefore which had come to him amid every occupation was now replaced not by another question or by a reply to the former question but by her image when he listened to or himself took part in trivial conversations when he read or heard of human baseness or folly he was not horrified as formerly and did not ask himself why men struggled so about these things when all is so transient and incomprehensible but he remembered her as he had last seen her and all his doubts vanished not because she had answered the questions that had haunted him but because his conception of her transferred him instantly to another a brighter realm of spiritual activity in which no one could be justified or guilty a realm of beauty and love which it was worth living for whatever worldly baseness presented itself to him he said to himself 
 well supposing n n swindled the country and the tsar and the country and the tsar confer honors upon him what does that matter she smiled at me yesterday and asked me to come again and i love her and no one will ever know it and his soul felt calm and peaceful 
 pierre still went into society drank as much and led the same idle and dissipated life because besides the hours he spent at the rostovs there were other hours he had to spend somehow and the habits and acquaintances he had made in moscow formed a current that bore him along irresistibly but latterly when more and more disquieting reports came from the seat of war and health began to improve and she no longer aroused in him the former feeling of careful pity an restlessness which he could not explain took possession of him he felt that the condition he was in could not continue long that a catastrophe was coming which would change his whole life and he impatiently sought everywhere for signs of that approaching catastrophe one of his brother masons had revealed to pierre the following prophecy concerning napoleon drawn from the revelation of st john 
 in chapter verse of the apocalypse it is said 
 here is wisdom let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast for it is the number of a man and his number is six hundred threescore and six and in the fifth verse of the same chapter 
 and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months 
 the french alphabet written out with the same numerical values as the hebrew in which the first nine letters denote units and the others tens will have the following significance 
 a b c d e f g h i k 
 
 lmnopqrs 
 
 tuvwxy 
 
 zz 
 
 writing the words napoleon in numbers it appears that the sum of them is and that napoleon therefore the beast foretold in the apocalypse moreover by applying the same system to the words which was the term allowed to the beast that spoke great things and blasphemies the same number was obtained from which it followed that the limit fixed for power had come in the year when the french emperor was this prophecy pleased pierre very much and he often asked himself what would put an end to the power of the beast that is of napoleon and tried by the same system of using letters as numbers and adding them up to find an answer to the question that engrossed him he wrote the words alexandre la nation russe and added up their numbers but the sums were either more or less than once when making such calculations he wrote down his own name in french comte pierre besouhoff but the sum of the numbers did not come right then he changed the spelling substituting a z for the s and adding de and the article le still without obtaining the desired result then it occurred to him if the answer to the question were contained in his name his nationality would also be given in the answer so he wrote le russe besuhof and adding up the numbers got this was only five too much and five was represented by e the very letter elided from the article le before the word empereur by omitting the e though incorrectly pierre got the answer he sought besuhof made this discovery excited him how or by what means he was connected with the great event foretold in the apocalypse he did not know but he did not doubt that connection for a moment his love for natasha antichrist napoleon the invasion the comet napoleon and besuhof all this had to mature and culminate to lift him out of that spellbound petty sphere of moscow habits in which he felt himself held captive and lead him to a great achievement and great happiness 
 
 on the eve of the sunday when the special prayer was read pierre had promised the rostovs to bring them from count rostopchin whom he knew well both the appeal to the people and the news from the army in the morning when he went to call at he met there a courier fresh from the army an acquaintance of his own who often danced at moscow balls 
 do please for sake relieve me of something said the courier i have a sackful of letters to parents 
 among these letters was one from nicholas rostov to his father pierre took that letter and rostopchin also gave him the appeal to moscow which had just been printed the last army orders and his own most recent bulletin glancing through the army orders pierre found in one of them in the lists of killed wounded and rewarded the name of nicholas rostov awarded a st cross of the fourth class for courage shown in the ostrovna affair and in the same order the name of prince andrew bolkonski appointed to the command of a regiment of chasseurs though he did not want to remind the rostovs of bolkonski pierre could not refrain from making them happy by the news of their having received a decoration so he sent that printed army order and nicholas letter to the rostovs keeping the appeal the bulletin and the other orders to take with him when he went to dinner 
 his conversation with count rostopchin and the tone of anxious hurry the meeting with the courier who talked casually of how badly things were going in the army the rumors of the discovery of spies in moscow and of a leaflet in circulation stating that napoleon promised to be in both the russian capitals by the autumn and the talk of the being expected to arrive next day all aroused with fresh force that feeling of agitation and expectation in pierre which he had been conscious of ever since the appearance of the comet and especially since the beginning of the war 
 he had long been thinking of entering the army and would have done so had he not been hindered first by his membership of the society of freemasons to which he was bound by oath and which preached perpetual peace and the abolition of war and secondly by the fact that when he saw the great mass of muscovites who had donned uniform and were talking patriotism he somehow felt ashamed to take the step but the chief reason for not carrying out his intention to enter the army lay in the vague idea that he was besuhof who had the number of the beast that his part in the great affair of setting a limit to the power of the beast that spoke great and blasphemous things had been predestined from eternity and that therefore he ought not to undertake anything but wait for what was bound to come to pass

 m mabeuf 
 on the day when m mabeuf said to marius 
 certainly i approve of political opinions he expressed the real state of his mind all political opinions were matters of indifference to him and he approved them all without distinction provided they left him in peace as the greeks called the furies the beautiful the good the charming the eumenides 
 m political opinion consisted in a passionate love for plants and above all for books like all the rest of the world he possessed the termination in ist without which no one could exist at that time but he was neither a royalist a bonapartist a chartist an orleanist nor an anarchist he was a bouquinist a collector of old books 
 he did not understand how men could busy themselves with hating each other because of silly stuff like the charter democracy legitimacy monarchy the republic etc when there were in the world all sorts of mosses grasses and shrubs which they might be looking at and heaps of folios and even of mos which they might turn over 
 he took good care not to become useless having books did not prevent his reading being a botanist did not prevent his being a gardener 
 when he made acquaintance this sympathy had existed between the colonel and what the colonel did for flowers he did for fruits 
 m mabeuf had succeeded in producing seedling pears as savory as the pears of st germain it is from one of his combinations apparently that the october mirabelle now celebrated and no less perfumed than the summer mirabelle owes its origin 
 he went to mass rather from gentleness than from piety and because as he loved the faces of men but hated their noise he found them assembled and silent only in church feeling that he must be something in the state he had chosen the career of warden 
 however he had never succeeded in loving any woman as much as a tulip bulb nor any man as much as an elzevir he had long passed sixty when one day some one asked him have you never been married 
 i have forgotten said he when it sometimes happened to to whom does it not happen to say 
 oh if i were only rich it was not when ogling a pretty girl as was the case with father gillenormand but when contemplating an old book 
 he lived alone with an old housekeeper he was somewhat gouty and when he was asleep his aged fingers stiffened with rheumatism lay crooked up in the folds of his sheets he had composed and published a flora of the environs of cauteretz with colored plates a work which enjoyed a tolerable measure of esteem and which sold well 
 people rang his bell in the rue mesieres two or three times a day to ask for it 
 he drew as much as two thousand francs a year from it this constituted nearly the whole of his fortune 
 although poor he had had the talent to form for himself by dint of patience privations and time a precious collection of rare copies of every sort 
 he never went out without a book under his arm and he often returned with two 
 the sole decoration of the four rooms on the ground floor which composed his lodgings consisted of framed herbariums and engravings of the old masters the sight of a sword or a gun chilled his blood 
 he had never approached a cannon in his life even at the invalides 
 he had a passable stomach a brother who was a cure perfectly white hair no teeth either in his mouth or his mind a trembling in every limb a picard accent an infantile laugh the air of an old sheep and he was easily frightened 
 add to this that he had no other friendship no other acquaintance among the living than an old bookseller of the named royal 
 his dream was to naturalize indigo in france 
 his servant was also a sort of innocent 
 the poor good old woman was a spinster 
 sultan her cat which might have mewed miserere in the sixtine chapel had filled her heart and sufficed for the quantity of passion which existed in her 
 none of her dreams had ever proceeded as far as man 
 she had never been able to get further than her cat 
 like him she had a mustache 
 her glory consisted in her caps which were always white 
 she passed her time on sundays after mass in counting over the linen in her chest and in spreading out on her bed the dresses in the piece which she bought and never had made up 
 she knew how to read 
 m mabeuf had nicknamed her mother plutarque 
 m mabeuf had taken a fancy to marius because marius being young and gentle warmed his age without startling his timidity youth combined with gentleness produces on old people the effect of the sun without wind 
 when marius was saturated with military glory with gunpowder with marches and countermarches and with all those prodigious battles in which his father had given and received such tremendous blows of the sword he went to see m mabeuf and m mabeuf talked to him of his hero from the point of view of flowers 
 his brother the cure died about and almost immediately as when the night is drawing on the whole horizon grew dark for m mabeuf a failure deprived him of the sum of ten thousand francs which was all that he possessed in his right and his own the revolution of july brought a crisis to publishing 
 in a period of embarrassment the first thing which does not sell is a flora the flora of the environs of cauteretz stopped short 
 weeks passed by without a single purchaser 
 sometimes m mabeuf started at the sound of the bell 
 monsieur said mother plutarque sadly it is the in short one day m mabeuf quitted the rue mesieres abdicated the functions of warden gave up sold not a part of his books but of his prints that to which he was the least installed himself in a little house on the rue montparnasse where however he remained but one quarter for two reasons 
 in the first place the ground floor and the garden cost three hundred francs and he dared not spend more than two hundred francs on his rent in the second being near he could hear the which was intolerable to him 
 he carried off his flora his his herbariums his portfolios and his books and established himself near the salpetriere in a sort of thatched cottage of the village of austerlitz where for fifty crowns a year he got three rooms and a garden enclosed by a hedge and containing a well 
 he took advantage of this removal to sell off nearly all his furniture on the day of his entrance into his new quarters he was very gay and drove the nails on which his engravings and herbariums were to hang with his own hands dug in his garden the rest of the day and at night perceiving that mother plutarque had a melancholy air and was very thoughtful he tapped her on the shoulder and said to her with a smile 
 we have the indigo 
 only two visitors the bookseller of the and marius were admitted to view the thatched cottage at austerlitz a brawling name which was to tell the truth extremely disagreeable to him 
 however as we have just pointed out brains which are absorbed in some bit of wisdom or folly or as it often happens in both at once are but slowly accessible to the things of actual life their own destiny is a thing to them 
 there results from such concentration a passivity which if it were the outcome of reasoning would resemble philosophy 
 one declines descends trickles away even crumbles away and yet is hardly conscious of it self it always ends it is true in an awakening but the awakening is tardy in the meantime it seems as though we held ourselves neutral in the game which is going on between our happiness and our unhappiness we are the stake and we look on at the game with indifference 
 it is thus that athwart the cloud which formed about him when all his hopes were extinguished one after the other m mabeuf remained rather puerilely but profoundly serene 
 his habits of mind had the regular swing of a pendulum 
 once mounted on an illusion he went for a very long time even after the illusion had disappeared a clock does not stop short at the precise moment when the key is lost 
 m mabeuf had his innocent pleasures 
 these pleasures were inexpensive and unexpected the merest chance furnished them 
 one day mother plutarque was reading a romance in one corner of the room she was reading aloud finding that she understood better thus to read aloud is to assure self of what one is reading there are people who read very loud and who have the appearance of giving themselves their word of honor as to what they are perusing 
 it was with this sort of energy that mother plutarque was reading the romance which she had in hand 
 m mabeuf heard her without listening to her 
 in the course of her reading mother plutarque came to this phrase it was a question of an officer of dragoons and a beauty 
 the beauty pouted and the dragoon 
 here she interrupted herself to wipe her glasses 
 bouddha and the dragon struck in m mabeuf in a low voice yes it is true that there was a dragon which from the depths of its cave spouted flame through his maw and set the heavens on fire many stars had already been consumed by this monster which besides had the claws of a tiger 
 bouddha went into its den and succeeded in converting the dragon 
 that is a good book that you are reading mother plutarque 
 there is no more beautiful legend in existence 
 and m mabeuf fell into a delicious revery

 a few intimate friends were dining with the rostovs that day as usual on sundays 
 pierre came early so as to find them alone 
 he had grown so stout this year that he would have been abnormal had he not been so tall so broad of limb and so strong that he carried his bulk with evident ease 
 he went up the stairs puffing and muttering something his coachman did not even ask whether he was to wait he knew that when his master was at the rostovs he stayed till midnight the rostovs footman rushed eagerly forward to help him off with his cloak and take his hat and stick pierre from club habit always left both hat and stick in the anteroom 
 the first person he saw in the house was natasha even before he saw her while taking off his cloak he heard her she was practicing solfa exercises in the music room he knew that she had not sung since her illness and so the sound of her voice surprised and delighted him he opened the door softly and saw her in the lilac dress she had worn at church walking about the room singing she had her back to him when he opened the door but when turning quickly she saw his broad surprised face she blushed and came rapidly up to him 
 i want to try to sing again she said adding as if by way of excuse it is at least something to do 
 capital 
 how glad i am come i am so happy today she said with the old animation pierre had not seen in her for along time you know nicholas has received a st cross i am so proud of him 
 oh yes i sent that announcement but i want to interrupt you he added and was about to go to the drawing room 
 natasha stopped him 
 count is it wrong of me to sing she said blushing and fixing her eyes inquiringly on him 
 no why should it be on the contrary but why do you ask me 
 i know myself natasha answered quickly but i should not like to do anything you disapproved of i believe in you completely you know how important you are to me how much done for me she spoke rapidly and did not notice how pierre flushed at her words i saw in that same army order that he bolkonski she whispered the name hastily is in russia and in the army again what do you think she was speaking hurriedly evidently afraid her strength might fail her will he ever forgive me will he not always have a bitter feeling toward me what do you think what do you think 
 i think pierre replied that he has nothing to forgive if i were in his place 
 by association of ideas pierre was at once carried back to the day when trying to comfort her he had said that if he were not himself but the best man in the world and free he would ask on his knees for her hand and the same feeling of pity tenderness and love took possession of him and the same words rose to his lips but she did not give him time to say them 
 yes you you she said uttering the word you rapturously a different thing i know no one kinder more generous or better than you nobody could be had you not been there then and now too i know what would have become of me because 
 tears suddenly rose in her eyes she turned away lifted her music before her eyes began singing again and again began walking up and down the room 
 just then petya came running in from the drawing room 
 petya was now a handsome rosy lad of fifteen with full red lips and resembled natasha he was preparing to enter the university but he and his friend obolenski had lately in secret agreed to join the hussars 
 petya had come rushing out to talk to his namesake about this affair he had asked pierre to find out whether he would be accepted in the hussars 
 pierre walked up and down the drawing room not listening to what petya was saying 
 petya pulled him by the arm to attract his attention 
 well what about my plan peter kirilych for sake you are my only hope said petya 
 oh yes your plan to join the hussars mention it bring it all up today 
 well mon cher have you got the manifesto asked the old count the countess has been to mass at the razumovskis and heard the new prayer she says very fine 
 yes got it said pierre the emperor is to be here tomorrow to be an extraordinary meeting of the nobility and they are talking of a levy of ten men per thousand oh yes let me congratulate you 
 yes yes thank god well and what news from the army 
 we are again retreating they say already near smolensk replied pierre 
 o lord o lord exclaimed the count where is the manifesto 
 the appeal oh yes 
 pierre began feeling in his pockets for the papers but could not find them still slapping his pockets he kissed the hand of the countess who entered the room and glanced uneasily around evidently expecting natasha who had left off singing but had not yet come into the drawing room 
 on my word i know what done with it he said 
 there he is always losing everything remarked the countess 
 natasha entered with a softened and agitated expression of face and sat down looking silently at pierre as soon as she entered features which had been gloomy suddenly lighted up and while still searching for the papers he glanced at her several times 
 no really drive home i must have left them there certainly 
 but be late for dinner 
 oh and my coachman has gone 
 but sonya who had gone to look for the papers in the anteroom had found them in hat where he had carefully tucked them under the lining pierre was about to begin reading 
 no after dinner said the old count evidently expecting much enjoyment from that reading 
 at dinner at which champagne was drunk to the health of the new chevalier of st george shinshin told them the town news of the illness of the old georgian princess of disappearance from moscow and of how some german fellow had been brought to rostopchin and accused of being a french spyer so count rostopchin had told the story and how rostopchin let him go and assured the people that he was not a spire at all but only an old german ruin 
 people are being arrested said the count told the countess she should not speak french so much not the time for it now 
 and have you heard shinshin asked prince golitsyn has engaged a master to teach him russian it is becoming dangerous to speak french in the streets 
 and how about you count peter kirilych if they call up the militia you too will have to mount a horse remarked the old count addressing pierre 
 pierre had been silent and preoccupied all through dinner seeming not to grasp what was said he looked at the count 
 oh yes the war he said no what sort of warrior should i make and yet everything is so strange so strange i make it out i know i am very far from having military tastes but in these times no one can answer for himself 
 after dinner the count settled himself comfortably in an easy chair and with a serious face asked sonya who was considered an excellent reader to read the appeal 
 to moscow our ancient capital 
 the enemy has entered the borders of russia with immense forces he comes to despoil our beloved country 
 sonya read painstakingly in her voice the count listened with closed eyes heaving abrupt sighs at certain passages 
 natasha sat erect gazing with a searching look now at her father and now at pierre 
 pierre felt her eyes on him and tried not to look round the countess shook her head disapprovingly and angrily at every solemn expression in the manifesto in all these words she saw only that the danger threatening her son would not soon be over shinshin with a sarcastic smile on his lips was evidently preparing to make fun of anything that gave him the opportunity reading any remark of the or even the manifesto itself should no better pretext present itself 
 after reading about the dangers that threatened russia the hopes the emperor placed on moscow and especially on its illustrious nobility sonya with a quiver in her voice due chiefly to the attention that was being paid to her read the last words 
 we ourselves will not delay to appear among our people in that capital and in others parts of our realm for consultation and for the direction of all our levies both those now barring the path and those freshly formed to defeat him wherever he may appear may the ruin he hopes to bring upon us recoil on his own head and may europe delivered from bondage glorify the name of russia 
 yes it cried the count opening his moist eyes and sniffing repeatedly as if a strong vinaigrette had been held to his nose and he added let the emperor but say the word and sacrifice everything and begrudge nothing 
 before shinshin had time to utter the joke he was ready to make on the patriotism natasha jumped up from her place and ran to her father 
 what a darling our papa is she cried kissing him and she again looked at pierre with the unconscious coquetry that had returned to her with her better spirits 
 there a patriot for you said shinshin 
 not a patriot at all but simply natasha replied in an injured tone everything seems funny to you but this at all a joke 
 a joke indeed put in the count let him but say the word and all go not germans 
 but did you notice it says for consultation said pierre 
 never mind what for 
 at this moment petya to whom nobody was paying any attention came up to his father with a very flushed face and said in his breaking voice that was now deep and now shrill 
 well papa i tell you definitely and mamma too as you please but i say definitely that you must let me enter the army because i all 
 the countess in dismay looked up to heaven clasped her hands and turned angrily to her husband 
 that comes of your talking said she 
 but the count had already recovered from his excitement 
 come come said he a fine warrior no nonsense you must study 
 not nonsense papa fedya obolenski is younger than i and going too besides all the same i study now when petya stopped short flushed till he perspired but still got out the words when our fatherland is in danger 
 do do nonsense 
 but you said yourself that we would sacrifice everything 
 petya be quiet i tell you cried the count with a glance at his wife who had turned pale and was staring fixedly at her son 
 and i tell you peter kirilych here will also tell you 
 nonsense i tell you your milk has hardly dried on your lips and you want to go into the army there there i tell you and the count moved to go out of the room taking the papers probably to reread them in his study before having a nap 
 well peter kirilych go and have a smoke he said 
 pierre was agitated and undecided unwontedly brilliant eyes continually glancing at him with a more than cordial look had reduced him to this condition 
 no i think go home 
 home why you meant to spend the evening with us you often come nowadays as it is and this girl of mine said the count pointing to natasha only brightens up when here 
 yes i had forgotten i really must go home business said pierre hurriedly 
 well then au revoir said the count and went out of the room 
 why are you going why are you upset asked natasha and she looked challengingly into eyes 
 because i love you was what he wanted to say but he did not say it and only blushed till the tears came and lowered his eyes 
 because it is better for me to come less often because no simply i have business 
 why no tell me natasha began resolutely and suddenly stopped 
 they looked at each other with dismayed and embarrassed faces he tried to smile but could not his smile expressed suffering and he silently kissed her hand and went out 
 pierre made up his mind not to go to the rostovs any more

 poverty a good neighbor for misery 
 marius liked this candid old man who saw himself gradually falling into the clutches of indigence and who came to feel astonishment little by little without however being made melancholy by it marius met courfeyrac and sought out m mabeuf 
 very rarely however twice a month at most 
 marius pleasure consisted in taking long walks alone on the outer boulevards or in the or in the least frequented alleys of the luxembourg 
 he often spent half a day in gazing at a market garden the beds of lettuce the chickens on the the horse turning the the stared at him in surprise and some of them thought his attire suspicious and his mien sinister he was only a poor young man dreaming in an objectless way 
 it was during one of his strolls that he had hit upon the gorbeau house and tempted by its isolation and its cheapness had taken up his abode there 
 he was known there only under the name of m marius 
 some of his old generals or old comrades had invited him to go and see them when they learned about him 
 marius had not refused their invitations 
 they afforded opportunities of talking about his father 
 thus he went from time to time to comte pajol to general bellavesne to general fririon to the invalides there was music and dancing there 
 on such evenings marius put on his new coat 
 but he never went to these evening parties or balls except on days when it was freezing cold because he could not afford a carriage and he did not wish to arrive with boots otherwise than like mirrors 
 he said sometimes but without bitterness 
 men are so made that in a you may be soiled everywhere except on your shoes in order to insure a good reception there only one irreproachable thing is asked of you your conscience 
 no your boots 
 all passions except those of the heart are dissipated by revery marius political fevers vanished thus 
 the revolution of assisted in the process by satisfying and calming him he remained the same setting aside his fits of wrath he still held the same opinions 
 only they had been tempered to speak accurately he had no longer any opinions he had sympathies to what party did he belong 
 to the party of humanity 
 out of humanity he chose france out of the nation he chose the people out of the people he chose the woman 
 it was to that point above all that his pity was directed 
 now he preferred an idea to a deed a poet to a hero and he admired a book like job more than an event like marengo 
 and then when after a day spent in meditation he returned in the evening through the boulevards and caught a glimpse through the branches of the trees of the fathomless space beyond the nameless gleams the abyss the shadow the mystery all that which is only human seemed very pretty indeed to him 
 he thought that he had and he really had in fact arrived at the truth of life and of human philosophy and he had ended by gazing at nothing but heaven the only thing which truth can perceive from the bottom of her well 
 this did not prevent him from multiplying his plans his combinations his scaffoldings his projects for the future 
 in this state of revery an eye which could have cast a glance into marius interior would have been dazzled with the purity of that soul in fact had it been given to our eyes of the flesh to gaze into the consciences of others we should be able to judge a man much more surely according to what he dreams than according to what he thinks 
 there is will in thought there is none in dreams revery which is utterly spontaneous takes and keeps even in the gigantic and the ideal the form of our spirit 
 nothing proceeds more directly and more sincerely from the very depth of our soul than our unpremeditated and boundless aspirations towards the splendors of destiny 
 in these aspirations much more than in deliberate rational coordinated ideas is the real character of a man to be found 
 our chimeras are the things which the most resemble us each one of us dreams of the unknown and the impossible in accordance with his nature 
 towards the middle of this year the old woman who waited on marius told him that his neighbors the wretched jondrette family had been turned out of doors 
 marius who passed nearly the whole of his days out of the house hardly knew that he had any neighbors 
 why are they turned out he asked 
 because they do not pay their rent they owe for two quarters 
 how much is it 
 twenty francs said the old woman 
 marius had thirty francs saved up in a drawer 
 here he said to the old woman take these francs pay for the poor people and give them five francs and do not tell them that it was i

 chapter xxi 
 
 after the definite refusal he had received petya went to his room and there locked himself in and wept bitterly when he came in to tea silent morose and with face everybody pretended not to notice anything 
 next day the emperor arrived in moscow and several of the rostovs domestic serfs begged permission to go to have a look at him that morning petya was a long time dressing and arranging his hair and collar to look like a man he frowned before his looking glass gesticulated shrugged his shoulders and finally without saying a word to anyone took his cap and left the house by the back door trying to avoid notice petya decided to go straight to where the emperor was and to explain frankly to some he imagined the emperor to be always surrounded by that he count rostov in spite of his youth wished to serve his country that youth could be no hindrance to loyalty and that he was ready to while dressing petya had prepared many fine things he meant to say to the 
 it was on the very fact of being so young that petya counted for success in reaching the emperor he even thought how surprised everyone would be at his youthfulness and yet in the arrangement of his collar and hair and by his sedate deliberate walk he wished to appear a man but the farther he went and the more his attention was diverted by the crowds moving toward the kremlin the less he remembered to walk with the sedateness and deliberation of a man as he approached the kremlin he even began to avoid being crushed and resolutely stuck out his elbows in a menacing way but within the trinity gateway he was so pressed to the wall by people who probably were unaware of the patriotic intentions with which he had come that in spite of all his determination he had to give in and stop while carriages passed in rumbling beneath the archway beside petya stood a peasant woman a footman two tradesmen and a discharged soldier after standing some time in the gateway petya tried to move forward in front of the others without waiting for all the carriages to pass and he began resolutely working his way with his elbows but the woman just in front of him who was the first against whom he directed his efforts angrily shouted at him 
 what are you shoving for young lordling you see all standing still then why push 
 anybody can shove said the footman and also began working his elbows to such effect that he pushed petya into a very filthy corner of the gateway 
 petya wiped his perspiring face with his hands and pulled up the damp collar which he had arranged so well at home to seem like a 
 he felt that he no longer looked presentable and feared that if he were now to approach the in that plight he would not be admitted to the emperor but it was impossible to smarten oneself up or move to another place because of the crowd one of the generals who drove past was an acquaintance of the rostovs and petya thought of asking his help but came to the conclusion that that would not be a manly thing to do when the carriages had all passed in the crowd carrying petya with it streamed forward into the kremlin square which was already full of people there were people not only in the square but everywhere on the slopes and on the roofs as soon as petya found himself in the square he clearly heard the sound of bells and the joyous voices of the crowd that filled the whole kremlin 
 for a while the crowd was less dense but suddenly all heads were bared and everyone rushed forward in one direction petya was being pressed so that he could scarcely breathe and everybody shouted hurrah hurrah hurrah petya stood on tiptoe and pushed and pinched but could see nothing except the people about him 
 all the faces bore the same expression of excitement and enthusiasm a wife standing beside petya sobbed and the tears ran down her cheeks 
 father angel dear one she kept repeating wiping away her tears with her fingers 
 hurrah was heard on all sides 
 for a moment the crowd stood still but then it made another rush forward 
 quite beside himself petya clinching his teeth and rolling his eyes ferociously pushed forward elbowing his way and shouting hurrah as if he were prepared that instant to kill himself and everyone else but on both sides of him other people with similarly ferocious faces pushed forward and everybody shouted hurrah 
 so this is what the emperor is thought petya no i petition him myself that would be too bold but in spite of this he continued to struggle desperately forward and from between the backs of those in front he caught glimpses of an open space with a strip of red cloth spread out on it but just then the crowd swayed back the police in front were pushing back those who had pressed too close to the procession the emperor was passing from the palace to the cathedral of the assumption and petya unexpectedly received such a blow on his side and ribs and was squeezed so hard that suddenly everything grew dim before his eyes and he lost consciousness when he came to himself a man of clerical appearance with a tuft of gray hair at the back of his head and wearing a shabby blue cassock probably a church clerk and chanter was holding him under the arm with one hand while warding off the pressure of the crowd with the other 
 crushed the young gentleman said the clerk what are you up to gently crushed him crushed him 
 the emperor entered the cathedral of the assumption the crowd spread out again more evenly and the clerk led petya pale and breathless to the several people were sorry for petya and suddenly a crowd turned toward him and pressed round him those who stood nearest him attended to him unbuttoned his coat seated him on the raised platform of the cannon and reproached those others whoever they might be who had crushed him 
 one might easily get killed that way what do they mean by it killing people poor dear as white as a sheet various voices were heard saying 
 petya soon came to himself the color returned to his face the pain had passed and at the cost of that temporary unpleasantness he had obtained a place by the cannon from where he hoped to see the emperor who would be returning that way petya no longer thought of presenting his petition if he could only see the emperor he would be happy 
 while the service was proceeding in the cathedral of the assumption it was a combined service of prayer on the occasion of the arrival and of thanksgiving for the conclusion of peace with the turks the crowd outside spread out and hawkers appeared selling kvas gingerbread and poppyseed sweets of which petya was particularly fond and ordinary conversation could again be heard a wife was showing a rent in her shawl and telling how much the shawl had cost another was saying that all silk goods had now got dear the clerk who had rescued petya was talking to a functionary about the priests who were officiating that day with the bishop the clerk several times used the word plenary of the service a word petya did not understand two young citizens were joking with some serf girls who were cracking nuts all these conversations especially the joking with the girls were such as might have had a particular charm for petya at his age but they did not interest him now he sat on his elevation the pedestal of the cannon still agitated as before by the thought of the emperor and by his love for him the feeling of pain and fear he had experienced when he was being crushed together with that of rapture still further intensified his sense of the importance of the occasion 
 suddenly the sound of a firing of cannon was heard from the embankment to celebrate the signing of peace with the turks and the crowd rushed impetuously toward the embankment to watch the firing petya too would have run there but the clerk who had taken the young gentleman under his protection stopped him the firing was still proceeding when officers generals and came running out of the cathedral and after them others in a more leisurely manner caps were again raised and those who had run to look at the cannon ran back again at last four men in uniforms and sashes emerged from the cathedral doors hurrah hurrah shouted the crowd again 
 which is he which asked petya in a tearful voice of those around him but no one answered him everybody was too excited and petya fixing on one of those four men whom he could not clearly see for the tears of joy that filled his eyes concentrated all his enthusiasm on him though it happened not to be the emperor frantically shouted hurrah and resolved that tomorrow come what might he would join the army 
 the crowd ran after the emperor followed him to the palace and began to disperse it was already late and petya had not eaten anything and was drenched with perspiration yet he did not go home but stood with that diminishing but still considerable crowd before the palace while the emperor dined looking in at the palace windows expecting he knew not what and envying alike the notables he saw arriving at the entrance to dine with the emperor and the court footmen who served at table glimpses of whom could be seen through the windows 
 while the emperor was dining valuev looking out of the window said 
 the people are still hoping to see your majesty again 
 the dinner was nearly over and the emperor munching a biscuit rose and went out onto the balcony the people with petya among them rushed toward the balcony 
 angel dear one hurrah father cried the crowd and petya with it and again the women and men of weaker mold petya among them wept with joy 
 a largish piece of the biscuit the emperor was holding in his hand broke off fell on the balcony parapet and then to the ground a coachman in a jerkin who stood nearest sprang forward and snatched it up several people in the crowd rushed at the coachman seeing this the emperor had a plateful of biscuits brought him and began throwing them down from the balcony eyes grew bloodshot and still more excited by the danger of being crushed he rushed at the biscuits he did not know why but he had to have a biscuit from the hand and he felt that he must not give way he sprang forward and upset an old woman who was catching at a biscuit the old woman did not consider herself defeated though she was lying on the ground she grabbed at some biscuits but her hand did not reach them petya pushed her hand away with his knee seized a biscuit and as if fearing to be too late again shouted hurrah with a voice already hoarse 
 the emperor went in and after that the greater part of the crowd began to disperse 
 there i said if only we waited and so it was was being joyfully said by various people 
 happy as petya was he felt sad at having to go home knowing that all the enjoyment of that day was over he did not go straight home from the kremlin but called on his friend obolenski who was fifteen and was also entering the regiment on returning home petya announced resolutely and firmly that if he was not allowed to enter the service he would run away and next day count ilya rostov though he had not yet quite yielded went to inquire how he could arrange for petya to serve where there would be least danger

 the substitute 
 it chanced that the regiment to which lieutenant theodule belonged came to perform garrison duty in paris 
 this inspired aunt gillenormand with a second idea 
 she had on the first occasion hit upon the plan of having marius spied upon by theodule now she plotted to have theodule take marius place 
 at all events and in case the grandfather should feel the vague need of a young face in the rays of dawn are sometimes sweet to was expedient to find another marius 
 take it as a simple erratum she thought such as one sees in books for marius read theodule 
 a grandnephew is almost the same as a grandson in default of a lawyer one takes a lancer 
 one morning when m gillenormand was about to read something in the quotidienne his daughter entered and said to him in her sweetest voice for the question concerned her favorite 
 father theodule is coming to present his respects to you this morning 
 theodule 
 your grandnephew 
 ah said the grandfather 
 then he went back to his reading thought no more of his grandnephew who was merely some theodule or other and soon flew into a rage which almost always happened when he read 
 the sheet which he held although royalist of course announced for the following day without any softening phrases one of these little events which were of daily occurrence at that date in paris 
 that the students of the schools of law and medicine were to assemble on the place du pantheon at deliberate 
 the discussion concerned one of the questions of the moment the artillery of the national guard and a conflict between the minister of war and the militia on the subject of the cannon parked in the courtyard of the louvre the students were to deliberate over this 
 it did not take much more than this to swell m rage 
 he thought of marius who was a student and who would probably go with the rest to deliberate at midday on the place du pantheon 
 as he was indulging in this painful dream lieutenant theodule entered clad in plain clothes as a bourgeois which was clever of him and was discreetly introduced by mademoiselle gillenormand the lancer had reasoned as follows 
 the old druid has not sunk all his money in a life pension 
 it is well to disguise self as a civilian from time to time 
 mademoiselle gillenormand said aloud to her father 
 theodule your grandnephew 
 and in a low voice to the lieutenant 
 approve of everything 
 and she withdrew 
 the lieutenant who was but little accustomed to such venerable encounters stammered with some timidity 
 good day uncle and made a salute composed of the involuntary and mechanical outline of the military salute finished off as a bourgeois salute 
 ah so you that is well sit down said the old gentleman 
 that said he totally forgot the lancer 
 theodule seated himself and m gillenormand rose 
 m gillenormand began to pace back and forth his hands in his pockets talking aloud and twitching with his irritated old fingers at the two watches which he wore in his two fobs 
 that pack of brats they convene on the place du pantheon by my life urchins who were with their nurses but yesterday if one were to squeeze their noses milk would burst out and they deliberate at midday 
 what are we coming to what are we coming to 
 it is clear that we are making for the abyss that is what the descamisados have brought us to 
 to deliberate on the citizen artillery 
 to go and jabber in the open air over the jibes of the national guard 
 and with whom are they to meet there just see whither jacobinism leads 
 i will bet anything you like a million against a counter that there will be no one there but returned convicts and released the republicans and the form but one nose and one handkerchief carnot used to say 
 where would you have me go traitor fouche replied 
 wherever you please imbecile 
 what the republicans are like 
 that is true said theodule 
 m gillenormand half turned his head saw theodule and went on 
 when one reflects that that scoundrel was so vile as to turn carbonaro why did you leave my house 
 to go and become a republican 
 pssst in the first place the people want none of your republic they have common sense they know well that there always have been kings and that there always will be they know well that the people are only the people after all they make sport of it of your republic do you understand idiot 
 is it not a horrible caprice 
 to fall in love with pere duchesne to make at the guillotine to sing romances and play on the guitar under the balcony of enough to make one spit on all these young fellows such fools are they 
 they are all alike 
 not one escapes it suffices for them to breathe the air which blows through the street to lose their senses 
 the nineteenth century is poison the first scamp that happens along lets his beard grow like a thinks himself a real scoundrel and abandons his old relatives a republican a romantic 
 what does that mean romantic do me the favor to tell me what it is 
 all possible follies a year ago they ran to hernani 
 now i just ask you hernani antitheses abominations which are not even written in french and then they have cannons in the courtyard of the louvre such are the rascalities of this age 
 you are right uncle said theodule 
 m gillenormand resumed 
 cannons in the courtyard of the museum 
 for what purpose do you want to fire at the apollo belvedere 
 what have those cartridges to do with the venus de medici 
 oh the young men of the present day are all blackguards 
 what a pretty creature is their benjamin constant 
 and those who are not rascals are simpletons they do all they can to make themselves ugly they are badly dressed they are afraid of women in the presence of petticoats they have a mendicant air which sets the girls into fits of laughter on my word of honor one would say the poor creatures were ashamed of love they are deformed and they complete themselves by being stupid they repeat the puns of tiercelin and potier they have sack coats waistcoats shirts of coarse linen trousers of coarse cloth boots of coarse leather and their rigmarole resembles their plumage one might make use of their jargon to put new soles on their old shoes and all this awkward batch of brats has political opinions if you please 
 political opinions should be strictly forbidden they fabricate systems they recast society they demolish the monarchy they fling all laws to the earth they put the attic in the place and my porter in the place of the king they turn europe they reconstruct the world and all their love affairs consist in staring slily at the ankles of the laundresses as these women climb into their carts 
 ah 
 marius 
 ah you blackguard to go and vociferate on the public place to discuss to debate to take measures 
 they call that measures just god disorder humbles itself and becomes silly 
 i have seen chaos i now see a mess 
 students deliberating on the national guard such a thing could not be seen among the ogibewas nor the cadodaches savages who go naked with their noddles dressed like a shuttlecock with a club in their paws are less of brutes than those bachelors of arts 
 the monkeys 
 and they set up for judges those creatures deliberate and ratiocinate 
 the end of the world is come 
 this is plainly the end of this miserable terraqueous globe a final hiccough was required and france has emitted it deliberate my rascals 
 such things will happen so long as they go and read the newspapers under the arcades of the odeon that costs them a sou and their good sense and their intelligence and their heart and their soul and their wits 
 they emerge thence and decamp from their families 
 all newspapers are pests all even the drapeau blanc 
 at bottom martainville was a jacobin 
 ah just heaven you may boast of having driven your grandfather to despair that you may 
 that is evident said theodule 
 and profiting by the fact that m gillenormand was taking breath the lancer added in a magisterial manner 
 there should be no other newspaper than the moniteur and no other book than the annuaire militaire 
 m gillenormand continued 
 it is like their sieyes 
 a regicide ending in a senator for that is the way they always end 
 they give themselves a scar with the address of thou as citizens in order to get themselves called eventually monsieur le comte 
 monsieur le comte as big as my arm assassins of september 
 the philosopher sieyes i will do myself the justice to say that i have never had any better opinion of the philosophies of all those philosophers than of the spectacles of the grimacer of tivoli 
 one day i saw the senators cross the quai malplaquet in mantles of violet velvet sown with bees with hats a la henri iv 
 they were hideous 
 one would have pronounced them monkeys from the court 
 citizens i declare to you that your progress is madness that your humanity is a dream that your revolution is a crime that your republic is a monster that your young and virgin france comes from the brothel and i maintain it against all whoever you may be whether journalists economists legists or even were you better judges of liberty of equality and fraternity than the knife of the guillotine and that i announce to you my flne fellows 
 parbleu cried the lieutenant that is wonderfully true 
 m gillenormand paused in a gesture which he had begun wheeled round stared lancer theodule intently in the eyes and said to him 
 you are a fool

 book nine 
 chapter xxii 
 
 two days later on the fifteenth of july an immense number of carriages were standing outside the sloboda palace 
 the great halls were full in the first were the nobility and gentry in their uniforms in the second bearded merchants in coats of blue cloth and wearing medals in the hall there was an incessant movement and buzz of voices the chief magnates sat on chairs at a large table under the portrait of the emperor but most of the gentry were strolling about the room 
 all these nobles whom pierre met every day at the club or in their own houses were in uniform some in that of day others in that of emperor paul others again in the new uniforms of time or the ordinary uniform of the nobility and the general characteristic of being in uniform imparted something strange and fantastic to these diverse and familiar personalities both old and young the old men toothless bald sallow and bloated or gaunt and wrinkled were especially striking for the most part they sat quietly in their places and were silent or if they walked about and talked attached themselves to someone younger on all these faces as on the faces of the crowd petya had seen in the square there was a striking contradiction the general expectation of a solemn event and at the same time the everyday interests in a boston card party peter the cook zinaida health and so on 
 pierre was there too buttoned up since early morning in a uniform that had become too tight for him he was agitated this extraordinary gathering not only of nobles but also of the les etats generaux evoked in him a whole series of ideas he had long laid aside but which were deeply graven in his soul thoughts of the contrat social and the french revolution the words that had struck him in the appeal that the sovereign was coming to the capital for consultation with his people strengthened this idea and imagining that in this direction something important which he had long awaited was drawing near he strolled about watching and listening to conversations but nowhere finding any confirmation of the ideas that occupied him 
 the manifesto was read evoking enthusiasm and then all moved about discussing it besides the ordinary topics of conversation pierre heard questions of where the marshals of the nobility were to stand when the emperor entered when a ball should be given in the honor whether they should group themselves by districts or by whole provinces and so on but as soon as the war was touched on or what the nobility had been convened for the talk became undecided and indefinite then all preferred listening to speaking 
 a man handsome and virile in the uniform of a retired naval officer was speaking in one of the rooms and a small crowd was pressing round him pierre went up to the circle that had formed round the speaker and listened count ilya rostov in a military uniform of time was sauntering with a pleasant smile among the crowd with all of whom he was acquainted he too approached that group and listened with a kindly smile and nods of approval as he always did to what the speaker was saying the retired naval man was speaking very boldly as was evident from the expression on the faces of the listeners and from the fact that some people pierre knew as the meekest and quietest of men walked away disapprovingly or expressed disagreement with him pierre pushed his way into the middle of the group listened and convinced himself that the man was indeed a liberal but of views quite different from his own the naval officer spoke in a particularly sonorous musical and aristocratic baritone voice pleasantly swallowing his and generally slurring his consonants the voice of a man calling out to his servant heah bwing me my pipe it was indicative of dissipation and the exercise of authority 
 what if the smolensk people have offahd to waise militia for the empewah ah we to take smolensk as our if the noble awistocwacy of the pwovince of moscow thinks fit it can show its loyalty to our the empewah in other ways have we the waising of the militia in the yeah seven all that did was to enwich the pwiests sons and thieves and wobbahs 
 count ilya rostov smiled blandly and nodded approval 
 and was our militia of any use to the empia not at all it only wuined our farming bettah have another conscwiption o ou men will neithah soldiers no peasants and get only depwavity fwom them the nobility gwudge theah lives evewy one of us will go and bwing in more wecwuits and the that was the way he referred to the emperor need only say the word and all die fo him added the orator with animation 
 count mouth watered with pleasure and he nudged pierre but pierre wanted to speak himself he pushed forward feeling stirred but not yet sure what stirred him or what he would say scarcely had he opened his mouth when one of the senators a man without a tooth in his head with a shrewd though angry expression standing near the first speaker interrupted him evidently accustomed to managing debates and to maintaining an argument he began in low but distinct tones 
 i imagine sir said he mumbling with his toothless mouth that we have been summoned here not to discuss whether best for the empire at the present moment to adopt conscription or to call out the militia we have been summoned to reply to the appeal with which our sovereign the emperor has honored us but to judge what is best conscription or the militia we can leave to the supreme authority 
 pierre suddenly saw an outlet for his excitement he hardened his heart against the senator who was introducing this set and narrow attitude into the deliberations of the nobility pierre stepped forward and interrupted him he himself did not yet know what he would say but he began to speak eagerly occasionally lapsing into french or expressing himself in bookish russian 
 excuse me your excellency he began he was well acquainted with the senator but thought it necessary on this occasion to address him formally though i agree with the gentleman he hesitated he wished to say mon tres honorable preopinant my very honorable opponent with the gentleman whom i have not the honor of knowing i suppose that the nobility have been summoned not merely to express their sympathy and enthusiasm but also to consider the means by which we can assist our fatherland i imagine he went on warming to his subject that the emperor himself would not be satisfied to find in us merely owners of serfs whom we are willing to devote to his service and chair a canon we are ready to make of ourselves and not to obtain from us any 
 food for cannon 
 many persons withdrew from the circle noticing the sarcastic smile and the freedom of remarks only count rostov was pleased with them as he had been pleased with those of the naval officer the senator and in general with whatever speech he had last heard 
 i think that before discussing these questions pierre continued we should ask the emperor most respectfully ask his majesty to let us know the number of our troops and the position in which our army and our forces now are and then 
 but scarcely had pierre uttered these words before he was attacked from three sides the most vigorous attack came from an old acquaintance a boston player who had always been well disposed toward him stepan stepanovich adraksin adraksin was in uniform and whether as a result of the uniform or from some other cause pierre saw before him quite a different man with a sudden expression of malevolence on his aged face adraksin shouted at pierre 
 in the first place i tell you we have no right to question the emperor about that and secondly if the russian nobility had that right the emperor could not answer such a question the troops are moved according to the movements and the number of men increases and decreases 
 another voice that of a nobleman of medium height and about forty years of age whom pierre had formerly met at the gypsies and knew as a bad cardplayer and who also transformed by his uniform came up to pierre interrupted adraksin 
 yes and this is not a time for discussing he continued but for acting there is war in russia the enemy is advancing to destroy russia to desecrate the tombs of our fathers to carry off our wives and children the nobleman smote his breast we will all arise every one of us will go for our father the tsar he shouted rolling his bloodshot eyes several approving voices were heard in the crowd we are russians and will not grudge our blood in defense of our faith the throne and the fatherland we must cease raving if we are sons of our fatherland we will show europe how russia rises to the defense of russia 
 pierre wished to reply but could not get in a word he felt that his words apart from what meaning they conveyed were less audible than the sound of his voice 
 count rostov at the back of the crowd was expressing approval several persons briskly turning a shoulder to the orator at the end of a phrase said 
 right quite right just so 
 pierre wished to say that he was ready to sacrifice his money his serfs or himself only one ought to know the state of affairs in order to be able to improve it but he was unable to speak many voices shouted and talked at the same time so that count rostov had not time to signify his approval of them all and the group increased dispersed and then moved with a hum of talk into the largest hall and to the big table not only was attempt to speak unsuccessful but he was rudely interrupted pushed aside and people turned away from him as from a common enemy this happened not because they were displeased by the substance of his speech which had even been forgotten after the many subsequent speeches but to animate it the crowd needed a tangible object to love and a tangible object to hate pierre became the latter many other orators spoke after the excited nobleman and all in the same tone many spoke eloquently and with originality 
 glinka the editor of the russian messenger who was recognized cries of author author were heard in the crowd said that hell must be repulsed by hell and that he had seen a child smiling at lightning flashes and thunderclaps but we will not be that child 
 yes yes at thunderclaps was repeated approvingly in the back rows of the crowd 
 the crowd drew up to the large table at which sat or bald magnates uniformed and besashed almost all of whom pierre had seen in their own homes with their buffoons or playing boston at the clubs with an incessant hum of voices the crowd advanced to the table pressed by the throng against the high backs of the chairs the orators spoke one after another and sometimes two together those standing behind noticed what a speaker omitted to say and hastened to supply it others in that heat and crush racked their brains to find some thought and hastened to utter it the old magnates whom pierre knew sat and turned to look first at one and then at another and their faces for the most part only expressed the fact that they found it very hot pierre however felt excited and the general desire to show that they were ready to go to all lengths which found expression in the tones and looks more than in the substance of the speeches infected him too he did not renounce his opinions but felt himself in some way to blame and wished to justify himself 
 i only said that it would be more to the purpose to make sacrifices when we know what is needed said he trying to be heard above the other voices 
 one of the old men nearest to him looked round but his attention was immediately diverted by an exclamation at the other side of the table 
 yes moscow will be surrendered she will be our expiation shouted one man 
 he is the enemy of mankind cried another allow me to speak gentlemen you are crushing me

 of travel 
 travel in the younger sort is a part of education in the elder a part of experience he that travelleth into a country before he hath some entrance into the language goeth to school and not to travel that young men travel under some tutor or grave servant i allow well so that he be such a one that hath the language and hath been in the country before whereby he may be able to tell them what things are worthy to be seen in the country where they go what acquaintances they are to seek what exercises or discipline the place yieldeth 
 for else young men shall go hooded and look abroad little it is a strange thing that in sea voyages where there is nothing to be seen but sky and sea men should make diaries but in wherein so much is to be obscured for the most part they omit it as if chance were fitter to be registered than observation let diaries therefore be brought in use the things to be seen and observed are the courts of princes specially when they give audience to ambassadors the courts of justice while they sit and hear causes and 
 so of consistories ecclesiastics the churches and monasteries with the monuments which are therein extant the walls and fortifications of cities and towns and so the havens and harbours antiquities and ruins libraries colleges disputations and lectures where any are shipping and navies houses and gardens of state and pleasure near great cities armories arsenals magazines exchanges bourses warehouses exercises of horsemanship fencing training of soldiers and the like comedies such whereunto the better sort of persons do resort treasuries of jewels and robes cabinets and rarities and to conclude whatsoever is memorable in the places where they go after all which the tutors or servants ought to make diligent enquiry as for triumphs masques feasts weddings funerals capital executions and such shows men need not to be put in mind of them yet are they not to be neglected 
 if you will have a young man to put his travel into a little room and in short time to gather much this you must do first as was said he must have some entrance into the language before he goeth then he must have such a servant or tutor as knoweth the country as was likewise said let him carry with him also some card or book describing the country where he travelleth which will be a good key to his enquiry let him keep also a diary let him not stay 
 long in one city or town more or less as the place deserveth but not long nay 
 when he stayeth in one city or town let him change his lodging from one end and part of the town to another which is a great adamant of acquaintance let him sequester himself from the company of his countrymen and diet in such places where mere is good company of the nation where he travelleth let him upon his removes from one place to another procure recommendation to some person of quality residing in the place whither he removeth that he may use his favour in those things he desireth to see or know 
 thus he may abridge his travel with much profit as for the acquaintance 
 which is to be sought in travel that which is most of all profitable is acquaintance with the secretaries and employed men of ambassadors for so in travelling in one country he shall suck the experience of many let him also see and visit imminent persons in all kinds which are of great fame abroad that he may be able to tell how the life agreeth with the same for quarrels they are with care and discretion to be avoided they are commonly for mistresses healths place and words 
 and let a man beware how he keepeth company with choleric and quarrelsome persons for they will engage him into their own quarrels when a traveller returneth home let him not leave the countries where he hath travelled altogether behind him but maintain a correspondence by letters with those of his acquaintance which are of most worth 
 and let his travel appear rather in his discourse than in his apparel 
 or gesture and in his discourse let him be rather advised in his answers then 
 forwards to tell stories and let it appear that he doth not change his country 
 manners for those of foreign parts but only prick in some flowers of mat he hath learned abroad into the customs of his own country

 book fall 
 chapter iii 
 
 the heroism of passive obedience 
 the door opened 
 it opened wide with a rapid movement as though some one had given it an energetic and resolute push 
 a man entered 
 we already know the man 
 it was the wayfarer whom we have seen wandering about in search of shelter 
 he entered advanced a step and halted leaving the door open behind him 
 he had his knapsack on his shoulders his cudgel in his hand a rough audacious weary and violent expression in his eyes 
 the fire on the hearth lighted him up 
 he was hideous it was a sinister apparition 
 madame magloire had not even the strength to utter a cry she trembled and stood with her mouth wide open 
 mademoiselle baptistine turned round beheld the man entering and half started up in terror then turning her head by degrees towards the fireplace again she began to observe her brother and her face became once more profoundly calm and serene 
 the bishop fixed a tranquil eye on the man 
 as he opened his mouth doubtless to ask the what he desired the man rested both hands on his staff directed his gaze at the old man and the two women and without waiting for the bishop to speak he said in a loud voice 
 see here 
 my name is jean valjean 
 i am a convict from the galleys i have passed nineteen years in the galleys 
 i was liberated four days ago and am on my way to pontarlier which is my destination i have been walking for four days since i left toulon 
 i have travelled a dozen leagues on foot 
 this evening when i arrived in these parts i went to an inn and they turned me out because of my yellow passport which i had shown at the i had to do it 
 i went to an inn 
 they said to me be off at both places 
 no one would take me 
 i went to the prison the jailer would not admit me 
 i went into a kennel the dog bit me and chased me off as though he had been a man one would have said that he knew who i was 
 i went into the fields intending to sleep in the open air beneath the stars 
 there were no stars 
 i thought it was going to rain and i the town to seek the recess of a doorway 
 yonder in the square i meant to sleep on a stone bench 
 a good woman pointed out your house to me and said to me knock there 
 i have knocked what is this place 
 do you keep an inn 
 i have one hundred and nine francs fifteen sous which i earned in the galleys by my labor in the course of nineteen years i will pay 
 what is that to me 
 i have money 
 i am very weary twelve leagues on foot i am very hungry 
 are you willing that i should remain 
 madame magloire said the bishop you will set another place 
 the man advanced three paces and approached the lamp which was on the table 
 stop he resumed as though he had not quite understood not it 
 did you hear 
 i am a a convict i come from the galleys 
 he drew from his pocket a large sheet of yellow paper which he unfolded 
 my passport 
 yellow as you see 
 this serves to expel me from every place where i go will you read it 
 i know how to read 
 i learned in the galleys there is a school there for those who choose to learn 
 hold this is what they put on this passport 
 jean valjean discharged convict native is nothing to been nineteen years in the galleys 
 five years for and burglary fourteen years for having attempted to escape on four occasions he is a very dangerous man 
 there 
 every one has cast me out are you willing to receive me 
 is this an inn 
 will you give me something to eat and a bed 
 have you a stable 
 madame magloire said the bishop you will put white sheets on the bed in the alcove 
 we have already explained the character of the two obedience 
 madame magloire retired to execute these orders 
 the bishop turned to the man 
 sit down sir and warm yourself 
 we are going to sup in a few moments and your bed will be prepared while you are supping 
 at this point the man suddenly comprehended 
 the expression of his face up to that time sombre and harsh bore the imprint of stupefaction of doubt of joy and became extraordinary he began stammering like a crazy man 
 really 
 what 
 you will keep me 
 you do not drive me forth a convict 
 you call me sir 
 you do not address me as thou get out of here you dog is what people always say to me 
 i felt sure that you would expel me so i told you at once who i am 
 oh what a good woman that was who directed me hither 
 i am going to sup a bed with a mattress and sheets like the rest of the world a bed it is nineteen years since i have slept in a bed 
 you actually do not want me to go 
 you are good people 
 besides i have money i will pay well 
 pardon me monsieur the but what is your name 
 i will pay anything you ask 
 you are a fine man you are an are you not 
 i am replied the bishop a priest who lives here 
 a priest said the man 
 oh what a fine priest 
 then you are not going to demand any money of me 
 you are the cure are you not the cure of this big church 
 well 
 i am a fool truly i had not perceived your 
 as he spoke he deposited his knapsack and his cudgel in a corner replaced his passport in his pocket and seated himself mademoiselle baptistine gazed mildly at him 
 he continued 
 you are humane monsieur le cure you have not scorned me a good priest is a very good thing 
 then you do not require me to pay 
 no said the bishop keep your money 
 how much have you did you not tell me one hundred and nine francs 
 and fifteen sous added the man 
 one hundred and nine francs fifteen sous 
 and how long did it take you to earn that 
 nineteen years 
 nineteen years 
 the bishop sighed deeply 
 the man continued 
 i have still the whole of my money in four days i have spent only sous which i earned by helping unload some wagons at grasse 
 since you are an abbe i will tell you that we had a chaplain in the galleys 
 and one day i saw a bishop there 
 monseigneur is what they call him 
 he was the bishop of majore at marseilles 
 he is the cure who rules over the other cures you understand 
 pardon me i say that very badly but it is such a thing to me 
 you understand what we are he said mass in the middle of the galleys on an altar 
 he had a pointed thing made of gold on his head it glittered in the bright light of midday 
 we were all ranged in lines on the three sides with cannons with lighted matches facing us 
 we could not see very well 
 he spoke but he was too far off and we did not hear that is what a bishop is like 
 while he was speaking the bishop had gone and shut the door which had remained wide open 
 madame magloire returned 
 she brought a silver fork and spoon which she placed on the table 
 madame magloire said the bishop place those things as near the fire as possible 
 and turning to his guest 
 the night wind is harsh on the alps 
 you must be cold sir 
 each time that he uttered the word sir in his voice which was so gently grave and polished the face lighted up 
 monsieur to a convict is like a glass of water to one of the shipwrecked of the medusa ignominy thirsts for consideration 
 this lamp gives a very bad light said the bishop 
 madame magloire understood him and went to get the two silver candlesticks from the in and placed them lighted on the table 
 monsieur le cure said the man you are good you do not despise me you receive me into your house 
 you light your candles for me yet i have not concealed from you whence i come and that i am an unfortunate man 
 the bishop who was sitting close to him gently touched his hand you could not help telling me who you were 
 this is not my house it is the house of jesus christ 
 this door does not demand of him who enters whether he has a name but whether he has a grief you suffer you are hungry and thirsty you are welcome and do not thank me do not say that i receive you in my house no one is at home here except the man who needs a refuge i say to you who are passing by that you are much more at home here than i am myself 
 everything here is yours 
 what need have i to know your name 
 besides before you told me you had one which i knew 
 the man opened his eyes in astonishment 
 really 
 you knew what i was called 
 yes replied the bishop you are called my brother 
 stop monsieur le cure exclaimed the man 
 i was very hungry when i entered here but you are so good that i no longer know what has happened to me 
 the bishop looked at him and said 
 you have suffered much 
 oh the red coat the ball on the ankle a plank to sleep on heat cold toil the convicts the thrashings the double chain for nothing the cell for one word even sick and in bed still the chain 
 dogs dogs are happier 
 nineteen years 
 i am now there is the yellow passport 
 that is what it is like 
 yes resumed the bishop you have come from a very sad place listen 
 there will be more joy in heaven over the face of a repentant sinner than over the white robes of a hundred just men if you emerge from that sad place with thoughts of hatred and of wrath against mankind you are deserving of pity if you emerge with thoughts of and of peace you are more worthy than any one of us 
 in the meantime madame magloire had served supper 
 soup made with water oil bread and salt a little bacon a bit of mutton figs a fresh cheese and a large loaf of rye bread 
 she had of her own accord added to the ordinary fare a bottle of his old mauves wine 
 the face at once assumed that expression of gayety which is peculiar to hospitable natures 
 to table he cried vivaciously as was his custom when a stranger supped with him he made the man sit on his right 
 mademoiselle baptistine perfectly peaceable and natural took her seat at his left 
 the bishop asked a blessing then helped the soup himself according to his custom 
 the man began to eat with avidity 
 all at once the bishop said 
 it strikes me there is something missing on this table 
 madame magloire had in fact only placed the three sets of forks and spoons which were absolutely necessary 
 now it was the usage of the house when the bishop had any one to supper to lay out the whole six sets of silver on the innocent ostentation 
 this graceful semblance of luxury was a kind of play which was full of charm in that gentle and severe household which raised poverty into dignity 
 madame magloire understood the remark went out without saying a word and a moment later the three sets of silver forks and spoons demanded by the bishop were glittering upon the cloth symmetrically arranged before the three persons seated at the table

 the empire strikes back 
 iv 
 
 six ominous shapes appeared in the black space of the hoth system and loomed likevast demons of destruction ready to unleash the furies of their imperial the largest of the six imperial star destroyer darth vader sat alone in a smallspherical room a single shaft of light gleamed on his black helmet as he satmotionless in his raised meditation chamber 
 as general veers approached the sphere opened slowly the upper half liftinglike a mechanical jaw to veers the dark figure seated inside themouthlike cocoon hardly seemed alive though a powerful aura of sheer evil emanatedfrom him sending a chilling fear through the officer 
 uncertain of his own courage veers took a step forward he had a message todeliver but felt prepared to wait for hours if necessary rather than disturb 
 but vader spoke immediately what is it veers 
 my lord the general replied choosing each word with care the fleet hasmoved out of has detected an energy field protecting an areaof the sixth planet in the hoth system the field is strong enough to deflect anybombardment 
 vader stood rising to his full height his cloak swaying against thefloor so the rebel scum are alerted to our presence furious he clenched hands into fists admiral ozzel came out of too close tothe system 
 he felt surprise was a wiser 
 as clumsy as he is stupid vader cut in breathing heavily a cleanbombardment is impossible through their energy field prepare your troops for asurface attack 
 with military precision general veers turned and marched out of the meditationroom leaving behind an enraged darth vader alone in the chamber vaderactivated a large viewscreen that showed a brightly lit image of his star bridge 
 admiral ozzel responding to summons stepped forward his facealmost filling the dark monitor screen there was trepidation in when he announced lord vader the fleet has moved out of 
 but reply was addressed to the officer standing slightly behind piett 
 knowing better than to delay captain piett stepped forward instantly as theadmiral staggered back a step his hand automatically reaching for his throat 
 yes my lord piett answered respectfully 
 ozzel began to gag now as his throat as if in the grip of invisible talons beganto constrict 
 make ready to land assault troops beyond the energy field vader deploy the fleet so that nothing can get off that planet in commandnow admiral piett 
 piett was simultaneously pleased and unsettled by this news as he turned tocarry out the orders he saw a figure that might someday be himself facewas hideously contorted as he fought for one final breath of air then he dropped intoa dead heap on the floor 
 the empire had entered the system of hoth 
 rebel troops rushed to their alert stations as the warning alarms wailed throughthe ice tunnels ground crews and droids of all sizes and makes hurried to performtheir assigned duties responding efficiently to the impending imperial threat 
 the armored snowspeeders were fueled as they waited in attack formation toblast out of the main cavern entranceway meanwhile in the hangar princess leiawas addressing a small band of rebel fighter pilots the large transport ship willleave as soon as loaded only two fighter escorts per ship the energyshield can only be opened for a split second so have to stay very close to thetransports 
 hobbie a rebel veteran of many battles looked at the princess with fighters against a star destroyer 
 the ion cannon will fire several blasts which should destroy any ships in yourflight path leia explained when you clear the energy shield you will proceed tothe rendezvous point good luck 
 somewhat reassured hobbie and the other pilots raced toward their fightercockpits 
 meanwhile han was working frantically to complete welding a lifter on themillennium falcon finishing quickly he hopped to the hangar floor and switchedon his comlink all right chewie he said to the hairy figure seated at controls give it a try 
 just then leia walked past throwing him an angry look han looked at hersmugly while the lifters began to rise off the floor whereupon the rightlifter began to shake erratically then broke partially loose to swing back down againwith an embarrassing crash 
 he turned away from leia catching only a glimpse of her face as she mockinglyraised an eyebrow 
 hold it chewie han grunted into his small transmitter 
 the avenger one of the imperial star destroyers hoveredlike a mechanized death angel in the sea of stars outside the hoth system as thecolossal ship began to move closer to the ice world the planet became clearly visiblethrough the windows which stretched meters or more across the huge bridge ofthe warship 
 captain needa commander of the crew gazed out a main port lookingat the planet when a controller came up to him sir rebel ship coming into oursector 
 good needa replied with a gleam in his eyes our first catch of the day 
 their first target will be the power generators general rieekan told theprincess 
 first transport three zone approaching shield one of the rebel controllerssaid tracking a bright image that could only be an imperial star destroyer 
 prepare to open shield a radarman ordered 
 stand by ion control another controller said 
 a giant metal globe on icy surface rotated into position and angled itsgreat turret gun upward 
 fire came the order from general rieekan 
 suddenly two red beams of destructive energy were released into the cold beams almost immediately overtook the first of the racing rebel transport sped on a direct course toward the huge star destroyer 
 the twin red bolts struck the enormous ship and blasted its conning set off by the blast began to rock the great flying fortress spinning it outof control the star destroyer plunged into deep space as the rebel transport and itstwo fighter escorts streaked off to safety 
 luke skywalker preparing to depart pulled on his gear andwatched the pilots gunners and r units hurrying to complete their tasks hestarted toward the row of snowspeeders that awaited him on his way the youngcommander paused at the tail section of the millennium falcon where han solo andchewbacca were working frenetically on the right lifter 
 chewie luke called take care of yourself and watch over this guy willya 
 the wookie barked a farewell gave luke a big hug then turned back to hiswork on the lifters 
 the two friends luke and han stood looking at each other perhaps for the lasttime 
 i hope you make your peace with jabba luke said at last 
 give em hell kid the corellian responded lightly 
 the young commander began to walk away as memories of exploits shared withhan rushed to his mind he stopped and looked back the falcon and saw his friendstill staring after him as they gazed at each other for a brief moment chewbaccalooked up and knew that each was wishing the other the best wherever theirindividual fates might take them 
 the public address system broke in on their thoughts first transport is rebel announcer proclaimed the good news 
 at the announcement a cheer burst from those gathered in the hangar luketurned and hurried over to his snowspeeder when he reached it dack young gunner was standing outside the ship waiting for him 
 how are you feeling sir dack asked enthusiastically 
 like new dack how about you 
 dack beamed right now i feel like i could take on the whole empiremyself

 countess rostova with her daughters and a large number of guests was already seated in the drawing room the count took the gentlemen into his study and showed them his choice collection of turkish pipes from time to time he went out to ask she come yet they were expecting marya dmitrievna akhrosimova known in society as le terrible dragon a lady distinguished not for wealth or rank but for common sense and frank plainness of speech marya dmitrievna was known to the imperial family as well as to all moscow and petersburg and both cities wondered at her laughed privately at her rudenesses and told good stories about her while none the less all without exception respected and feared her 
 in the room which was full of tobacco smoke they talked of war that had been announced in a manifesto and about the recruiting none of them had yet seen the manifesto but they all knew it had appeared the count sat on the sofa between two guests who were smoking and talking he neither smoked nor talked but bending his head first to one side and then to the other watched the smokers with evident pleasure and listened to the conversation of his two neighbors whom he egged on against each other 
 one of them was a sallow civilian with a thin and wrinkled face already growing old though he was dressed like a most fashionable young man he sat with his legs up on the sofa as if quite at home and having stuck an amber mouthpiece far into his mouth was inhaling the smoke spasmodically and screwing up his eyes this was an old bachelor shinshin a cousin of the countess a man with a sharp tongue as they said in moscow society he seemed to be condescending to his companion the latter a fresh rosy officer of the guards irreproachably washed brushed and buttoned held his pipe in the middle of his mouth and with red lips gently inhaled the smoke letting it escape from his handsome mouth in rings this was lieutenant berg an officer in the semenov regiment with whom boris was to travel to join the army and about whom natasha had teased her elder sister vera speaking of berg as her intended the count sat between them and listened attentively his favorite occupation when not playing boston a card game he was very fond of was that of listener especially when he succeeded in setting two loquacious talkers at one another 
 well then old chap mon tres honorable alphonse karlovich said shinshin laughing ironically and mixing the most ordinary russian expressions with the choicest french phrases which was a peculiarity of his speech vous comptez vous faire des rentes sur you want to make something out of your company 
 you expect to make an income out of the government 
 no peter nikolaevich i only want to show that in the cavalry the advantages are far less than in the infantry just consider my own position now peter nikolaevich 
 berg always spoke quietly politely and with great precision his conversation always related entirely to himself he would remain calm and silent when the talk related to any topic that had no direct bearing on himself he could remain silent for hours without being at all put out of countenance himself or making others uncomfortable but as soon as the conversation concerned himself he would begin to talk circumstantially and with evident satisfaction 
 consider my position peter nikolaevich were i in the cavalry i should get not more than two hundred rubles every four months even with the rank of lieutenant but as it is i receive two hundred and thirty said he looking at shinshin and the count with a joyful pleasant smile as if it were obvious to him that his success must always be the chief desire of everyone else 
 besides that peter nikolaevich by exchanging into the guards i shall be in a more prominent position continued berg and vacancies occur much more frequently in the foot guards then just think what can be done with two hundred and thirty rubles i even manage to put a little aside and to send something to my father he went on emitting a smoke ring 
 la balance y est a german knows how to skin a flint as the proverb says remarked shinshin moving his pipe to the other side of his mouth and winking at the count 
 so that squares matters 
 the count burst out laughing the other guests seeing that shinshin was talking came up to listen berg oblivious of irony or indifference continued to explain how by exchanging into the guards he had already gained a step on his old comrades of the cadet corps how in wartime the company commander might get killed and he as senior in the company might easily succeed to the post how popular he was with everyone in the regiment and how satisfied his father was with him berg evidently enjoyed narrating all this and did not seem to suspect that others too might have their own interests but all he said was so prettily sedate and the naivete of his youthful egotism was so obvious that he disarmed his hearers 
 well my boy get along wherever you go foot or horse that warrant said shinshin patting him on the shoulder and taking his feet off the sofa 
 berg smiled joyously the count by his guests went into the drawing room 
 it was just the moment before a big dinner when the assembled guests expecting the summons to zakuska avoid engaging in any long conversation but think it necessary to move about and talk in order to show that they are not at all impatient for their food the host and hostess look toward the door and now and then glance at one another and the visitors try to guess from these glances who or what they are waiting for some important relation who has not yet arrived or a dish that is not yet ready 
 hors 
 pierre had come just at dinnertime and was sitting awkwardly in the middle of the drawing room on the first chair he had come across blocking the way for everyone the countess tried to make him talk but he went on naively looking around through his spectacles as if in search of somebody and answered all her questions in monosyllables he was in the way and was the only one who did not notice the fact most of the guests knowing of the affair with the bear looked with curiosity at this big stout quiet man wondering how such a clumsy modest fellow could have played such a prank on a policeman 
 you have only lately arrived the countess asked him 
 oui madame replied he looking around him 
 you have not yet seen my husband 
 non madame he smiled quite inappropriately 
 you have been in paris recently i believe i suppose very interesting 
 very interesting 
 the countess exchanged glances with anna mikhaylovna the latter understood that she was being asked to entertain this young man and sitting down beside him she began to speak about his father but he answered her as he had the countess only in monosyllables the other guests were all conversing with one another the razumovskis it was charming you are very kind countess apraksina was heard on all sides the countess rose and went into the ballroom 
 marya dmitrievna came her voice from there 
 herself came the answer in a rough voice and marya dmitrievna entered the room 
 all the unmarried ladies and even the married ones except the very oldest rose marya dmitrievna paused at the door tall and stout holding high her head with its gray curls she stood surveying the guests and leisurely arranged her wide sleeves as if rolling them up marya dmitrievna always spoke in russian 
 health and happiness to her whose name day we are keeping and to her children she said in her loud voice which drowned all others well you old sinner she went on turning to the count who was kissing her hand feeling dull in moscow i daresay nowhere to hunt with your dogs but what is to be done old man just see how these nestlings are growing up and she pointed to the girls you must look for husbands for them whether you like it or not 
 well said she my cossack marya dmitrievna always called natasha a cossack and she stroked the arm as she came up fearless and gay to kiss her hand i know a scamp of a girl but i like her 
 she took a pair of ruby earrings from her huge reticule and having given them to the rosy natasha who beamed with the pleasure of her fete turned away at once and addressed herself to pierre 
 eh eh friend come here a bit said she assuming a soft high tone of voice come here my friend and she ominously tucked up her sleeves still higher pierre approached looking at her in a childlike way through his spectacles 
 come nearer come nearer friend i used to be the only one to tell your father the truth when he was in favor and in your case my evident duty she paused all were silent expectant of what was to follow for this was dearly only a prelude 
 a fine lad my word a fine lad his father lies on his deathbed and he amuses himself setting a policeman astride a bear for shame sir for shame it would be better if you went to the war 
 she turned away and gave her hand to the count who could hardly keep from laughing 
 well i suppose it is time we were at table said marya dmitrievna 
 the count went in first with marya dmitrievna the countess followed on the arm of a colonel of hussars a man of importance to them because nicholas was to go with him to the regiment then came anna mikhaylovna with shinshin berg gave his arm to vera the smiling julie karagina went in with nicholas after them other couples followed filling the whole dining hall and last of all the children tutors and governesses followed singly the footmen began moving about chairs scraped the band struck up in the gallery and the guests settled down in their places then the strains of the household band were replaced by the clatter of knives and forks the voices of visitors and the soft steps of the footmen at one end of the table sat the countess with marya dmitrievna on her right and anna mikhaylovna on her left the other lady visitors were farther down at the other end sat the count with the hussar colonel on his left and shinshin and the other male visitors on his right midway down the long table on one side sat the grownup young people vera beside berg and pierre beside boris and on the other side the children tutors and governesses from behind the crystal decanters and fruit vases the count kept glancing at his wife and her tall cap with its ribbons and busily filled his neighbors glasses not neglecting his own the countess in turn without omitting her duties as hostess threw significant glances from behind the pineapples at her husband whose face and bald head seemed by their redness to contrast more than usual with his gray hair at the ladies end an even chatter of voices was heard all the time at the end the voices sounded louder and louder especially that of the colonel of hussars who growing more and more flushed ate and drank so much that the count held him up as a pattern to the other guests berg with tender smiles was saying to vera that love is not an earthly but a heavenly feeling boris was telling his new friend pierre who the guests were and exchanging glances with natasha who was sitting opposite pierre spoke little but examined the new faces and ate a great deal of the two soups he chose turtle with savory patties and went on to the game without omitting a single dish or one of the wines these latter the butler thrust mysteriously forward wrapped in a napkin from behind the next shoulders and whispered dry madeira hungarian or rhine wine as the case might be of the four crystal glasses engraved with the monogram that stood before his plate pierre held out one at random and drank with enjoyment gazing with amiability at the other guests natasha who sat opposite was looking at boris as girls of thirteen look at the boy they are in love with and have just kissed for the first time sometimes that same look fell on pierre and that funny lively little look made him inclined to laugh without knowing why 
 nicholas sat at some distance from sonya beside julie karagina to whom he was again talking with the same involuntary smile sonya wore a company smile but was evidently tormented by jealousy now she turned pale now blushed and strained every nerve to overhear what nicholas and julie were saying to one another the governess kept looking round uneasily as if preparing to resent any slight that might be put upon the children the german tutor was trying to remember all the dishes wines and kinds of dessert in order to send a full description of the dinner to his people in germany and he felt greatly offended when the butler with a bottle wrapped in a napkin passed him by he frowned trying to appear as if he did not want any of that wine but was mortified because no one would understand that it was not to quench his thirst or from greediness that he wanted it but simply from a conscientious desire for knowledge

 chapter 
 
 the twelve years continued mrs dean following that dismal period were the happiest of my life my greatest troubles in their passage rose from our little trifling illnesses which she had to experience in common with all children rich and poor for the rest after the first six months she grew like a larch and could walk and talk too in her own way before the heath blossomed a second time over mrs dust she was the most winning thing that ever brought sunshine into a desolate house a real beauty in face with the earnshaws handsome dark eyes but the lintons fair skin and small features and yellow curling hair her spirit was high though not rough and qualified by a heart sensitive and lively to excess in its affections that capacity for intense attachments reminded me of her mother still she did not resemble her for she could be soft and mild as a dove and she had a gentle voice and pensive expression her anger was never furious her love never fierce it was deep and tender however it must be acknowledged she had faults to foil her gifts a propensity to be saucy was one and a perverse will that indulged children invariably acquire whether they be or cross if a servant chanced to vex her it was shall tell papa and if he reproved her even by a look you would have thought it a business i believe he ever did speak a harsh word to her he took her education entirely on himself and made it an amusement fortunately curiosity and a quick intellect urged her into an apt scholar she learned rapidly and eagerly and did honour to his teaching 
 till she reached the age of thirteen she had not once been beyond the range of the park by herself mr linton would take her with him a mile or so outside on rare occasions but he trusted her to no one else gimmerton was an unsubstantial name in her ears the chapel the only building she had approached or entered except her own home wuthering heights and mr heathcliff did not exist for her she was a perfect recluse and apparently perfectly contented sometimes indeed while surveying the country from her nursery window she would observe 
 ellen how long will it be before i can walk to the top of those hills i wonder what lies on the other it the sea 
 no miss cathy i would answer it is hills again just like these 
 and what are those golden rocks like when you stand under them she once asked 
 the abrupt descent of penistone crags particularly attracted her notice especially when the setting sun shone on it and the topmost heights and the whole extent of landscape besides lay in shadow i explained that they were bare masses of stone with hardly enough earth in their clefts to nourish a stunted tree 
 and why are they bright so long after it is evening here she pursued 
 because they are a great deal higher up than we are replied i you could not climb them they are too high and steep in winter the frost is always there before it comes to us and deep into summer i have found snow under that black hollow on the side 
 oh you have been on them she cried gleefully then i can go too when i am a woman has papa been ellen 
 papa would tell you miss i answered hastily that they are not worth the trouble of visiting the moors where you ramble with him are much nicer and thrushcross park is the finest place in the world 
 but i know the park and i know those she murmured to herself and i should delight to look round me from the brow of that tallest point my little pony minny shall take me some time 
 one of the maids mentioning the fairy cave quite turned her head with a desire to fulfil this project she teased mr linton about it and he promised she should have the journey when she got older but miss catherine measured her age by months and now am i old enough to go to penistone crags was the constant question in her mouth the road thither wound close by wuthering heights edgar had not the heart to pass it so she received as constantly the answer not yet love not yet 
 i said mrs heathcliff lived above a dozen years after quitting her husband her family were of a delicate constitution she and edgar both lacked the ruddy health that you will generally meet in these parts what her last illness was i am not certain i conjecture they died of the same thing a kind of fever slow at its commencement but incurable and rapidly consuming life to wards the close she wrote to inform her brother of the probable conclusion of a four months indisposition under which she had suffered and entreated him to come to her if possible for she had much to settle and she wished to bid him adieu and deliver linton safely into his hands her hope was that linton might be left with him as he had been with her his father she would fain convince herself had no desire to assume the burden of his maintenance or education my master hesitated not a moment in complying with her request reluctant as he was to leave home at ordinary calls he flew to answer this commending catherine to my peculiar vigilance in his absence with reiterated orders that she must not wander out of the park even under my escort he did not calculate on her going unaccompanied 
 he was away three weeks the first day or two my charge sat in a corner of the library too sad for either reading or playing in that quiet state she caused me little trouble but it was succeeded by an interval of impatient fretful weariness and being too busy and too old then to run up and down amusing her i hit on a method by which she might entertain herself i used to send her on her travels round the on foot and now on a pony indulging her with a patient audience of all her real and imaginary adventures when she returned 
 the summer shone in full prime and she took such a taste for this solitary rambling that she often contrived to remain out from breakfast till tea and then the evenings were spent in recounting her fanciful tales i did not fear her breaking bounds because the gates were generally locked and i thought she would scarcely venture forth alone if they had stood wide open unluckily my confidence proved misplaced catherine came to me one morning at eight and said she was that day an arabian merchant going to cross the desert with his caravan and i must give her plenty of provision for herself and beasts a horse and three camels personated by a large hound and a couple of pointers i got together good store of dainties and slung them in a basket on one side of the saddle and she sprang up as gay as a fairy sheltered by her hat and gauze veil from the july sun and trotted off with a merry laugh mocking my cautious counsel to avoid galloping and come back early the naughty thing never made her appearance at tea one traveller the hound being an old dog and fond of its ease returned but neither cathy nor the pony nor the two pointers were visible in any direction i dispatched emissaries down this path and that path and at last went wandering in search of her myself there was a labourer working at a fence round a plantation on the borders of the grounds i inquired of him if he had seen our young lady 
 i saw her at morn he replied she would have me to cut her a hazel switch and then she leapt her galloway over the hedge yonder where it is lowest and galloped out of sight 
 you may guess how i felt at hearing this news it struck me directly she must have started for penistone crags what will become of her i ejaculated pushing through a gap which the man was repairing and making straight to the high road i walked as if for a wager mile after mile till a turn brought me in view of the heights but no catherine could i detect far or near the crags lie about a mile and a half beyond mr place and that is four from the grange so i began to fear night would fall ere i could reach them and what if she should have slipped in clambering among them i reflected and been killed or broken some of her bones my suspense was truly painful and at first it gave me delightful relief to observe in hurrying by the farmhouse charlie the fiercest of the pointers lying under a window with swelled head and bleeding ear i opened the wicket and ran to the door knocking vehemently for admittance a woman whom i knew and who formerly lived at gimmerton answered she had been servant there since the death of mr earnshaw 
 ah said she you are come a seeking your little mistress be frightened here safe but glad it the master 
 he is not at home then is he i panted quite breathless with quick walking and alarm 
 no no she replied both he and joseph are off and i think they return this hour or more step in and rest you a bit 
 i entered and beheld my stray lamb seated on the hearth rocking herself in a little chair that had been her when a child her hat was hung against the wall and she seemed perfectly at home laughing and chattering in the best spirits imaginable to a great strong lad of stared at her with considerable curiosity and astonishment comprehending precious little of the fluent succession of remarks and questions which her tongue never ceased pouring forth 
 very well miss i exclaimed concealing my joy under an angry countenance this is your last ride till papa comes back not trust you over the threshold again you naughty naughty girl 
 aha ellen she cried gaily jumping up and running to my side i shall have a pretty story to tell tonight and so found me out have you ever been here in your life before 
 put that hat on and home at once said i dreadfully grieved at you miss cathy done extremely wrong no use pouting and crying that repay the trouble had scouring the country after you to think how mr linton charged me to keep you in and you stealing off so it shows you are a cunning little fox and nobody will put faith in you any more 
 what have i done sobbed she instantly checked papa charged me nothing not scold me never cross like you 
 come come i repeated tie the riband now let us have no petulance oh for shame you thirteen years old and such a baby 
 this exclamation was caused by her pushing the hat from her head and retreating to the chimney out of my reach 
 nay said the servant be hard on the bonny lass mrs dean we made her stop fain have ridden forwards afeard you should be uneasy but hareton offered to go with her and i thought he should a wild road over the hills 
 hareton during the discussion stood with his hands in his pockets too awkward to speak though he looked as if he did not relish my intrusion 
 how long am i to wait i continued disregarding the interference it will be dark in ten minutes where is the pony miss cathy and where is phoenix i shall leave you unless you be quick so please yourself 
 the pony is in the yard she replied and phoenix is shut in there so is charlie i was going to tell you all about it but you are in a bad temper and deserve to hear 
 i picked up her hat and approached to reinstate it but perceiving that the people of the house took her part she commenced capering round the room and on my giving chase ran like a mouse over and under and behind the furniture rendering it ridiculous for me to pursue hareton and the woman laughed and she joined them and waxed more impertinent still till i cried in great irritation 
 well miss cathy if you were aware whose house this is be glad enough to get out 
 your it said she turning to hareton nay he replied looking down and blushing bashfully 
 he could not stand a steady gaze from her eyes though they were just his own 
 whose she asked 
 he coloured deeper with a different feeling muttered an oath and turned away 
 who is his master continued the tiresome girl appealing to me he talked about our house and our folk i thought he had been the son and he never said miss he should have done he if a servant 
 hareton grew black as a thunder cloud at this childish speech i silently shook my questioner and at last succeeded in equipping her for departure 
 now get my horse she said addressing her unknown kinsman as she would one of the at the grange and you may come with me i want to see where the rises in the marsh and to hear about the fairishes as you call them but make haste the matter get my horse i say 
 see thee damned before i be thy servant growled the lad see me what asked catherine in surprise saucy witch he replied 
 there miss cathy you see you have got into pretty company i interposed nice words to be used to a young lady pray begin to dispute with him come let us seek for minny ourselves and begone 
 but ellen cried she staring fixed in astonishment how dare he speak so to me he be made to do as i ask him you wicked creature i shall tell papa what you then 
 hareton did not appear to feel this threat so the tears sprang into her eyes with indignation you bring the pony she exclaimed turning to the woman and let my dog free this moment 
 softly miss answered the addressed lose nothing by being civil though mr hareton there be not the son your cousin and i was never hired to serve you 
 he my cousin cried cathy with a scornful laugh yes indeed responded her reprover 
 oh ellen let them say such things she pursued in great trouble papa is gone to fetch my cousin from london my cousin is a son that stopped and wept outright upset at the bare notion of relationship with such a clown 
 hush hush i whispered people can have many cousins and of all sorts miss cathy without being any the worse for it only they keep their company if they be disagreeable and bad 
 not my cousin ellen she went on gathering fresh grief from reflection and flinging herself into my arms for refuge from the idea 
 i was much vexed at her and the servant for their mutual revelations having no doubt of approaching arrival communicated by the former being reported to mr heathcliff and feeling as confident that first thought on her return would be to seek an explanation of the assertion concerning her kindred hareton recovering from his disgust at being taken for a servant seemed moved by her distress and having fetched the pony round to the door he took to propitiate her a fine terrier whelp from the kennel and putting it into her hand bid her wisht for he meant nought pausing in her lamentations she surveyed him with a glance of awe and horror then burst forth anew 
 i could scarcely refrain from smiling at this antipathy to the poor fellow who was a athletic youth in features and stout and healthy but attired in garments befitting his daily occupations of working on the farm and lounging among the moors after rabbits and game still i thought i could detect in his physiognomy a mind owning better qualities than his father ever possessed good things lost amid a wilderness of weeds to be sure whose rankness far overtopped their neglected growth yet notwithstanding evidence of a wealthy soil that might yield luxuriant crops under other and favourable circumstances mr heathcliff i believe had not treated him physically ill thanks to his fearless nature which offered no temptation to that course of oppression it had none of the timid susceptibility that would have given zest to in judgment he appeared to have bent his malevolence on making him a brute he was never taught to read or write never rebuked for any bad habit which did not annoy his keeper never led a single step towards virtue or guarded by a single precept against vice and from what i heard joseph contributed much to his deterioration by a partiality which prompted him to flatter and pet him as a boy because he was the head of the old family and as he had been in the habit of accusing catherine earnshaw and heathcliff when children of putting the master past his patience and compelling him to seek solace in drink by what he termed their offalld ways so at present he laid the whole burden of faults on the shoulders of the usurper of his property if the lad swore he correct him nor however culpably he behaved it gave joseph satisfaction apparently to watch him go the worst lengths he allowed that he was ruined that his soul was abandoned to perdition but then he reflected that heathcliff must answer for it blood would be required at his hands and there lay immense consolation in that thought joseph had instilled into him a pride of name and of his lineage he would had he dared have fostered hate between him and the present owner of the heights but his dread of that owner amounted to superstition and he confined his feelings regarding him to muttered innuendoes and private comminations i pretend to be intimately acquainted with the mode of living customary in those days at wuthering heights i only speak from hearsay for i saw little the villagers affirmed mr heathcliff was near and a cruel hard landlord to his tenants but the house inside had regained its ancient aspect of comfort under female management and the scenes of riot common in time were not now enacted within its walls the master was too gloomy to seek companionship with any people good or bad and he is yet 
 this however is not making progress with my story miss cathy rejected the peace offering of the terrier and demanded her own dogs charlie and phoenix they came limping and hanging their heads and we set out for home sadly out of sorts every one of us i could not wring from my little lady how she had spent the day except that as i supposed the goal of her pilgrimage was penistone crags and she arrived without adventure to the gate of the farmhouse when hareton happened to issue forth attended by some canine followers who attacked her train they had a smart battle before their owners could separate them that ormed an introduction catherine told hareton who she was nd where she was going and asked him to show her the way finally beguiling him to accompany her he opened the mysteries of the fairy cave and twenty other queer places but being in disgrace i was not favoured with a description of the interesting objects she saw i could gather however that her guide had been a favourite till she hurt his feelings by addressing him as a servant and heathcliffs housekeeper hurt hers by calling him her cousin then the language he had held to her rankled in her heart she who was always love and darling and queen and angel with everybody at the grange to be insulted so shockingly by a stranger she did not comprehend it and hard work i had to obtain a promise that she would not lay the grievance before her father i explained how he objected to the whole household at the heights and how sorry he would be to find she had been there but i insisted most on the fact that if she revealed my negligence of his orders he would perhaps be so angry that i should have to leave and cathy bear that prospect she pledged her word and kept it for my sake after all she was a sweet little girl

 chapter eighteen 
 
 beth did have the fever and was much sicker than anyone but hannah and the doctor suspected the girls knew nothing about illness and mr laurence was not allowed to see her so hannah had everything her own way and busy dr bangs did his best but left a good deal to the excellent nurse meg stayed at home lest she should infect the kings and kept house feeling very anxious and a little guilty when she wrote letters in which no mention was made of illness she could not think it right to deceive her mother but she had been bidden to mind hannah and hannah hear of mrs march bein told and worried just for sech a trifle 
 jo devoted herself to beth day and night not a hard task for beth was very patient and bore her pain uncomplainingly as long as she could control herself but there came a time when during the fever fits she began to talk in a hoarse broken voice to play on the coverlet as if on her beloved little piano and try to sing with a throat so swollen that there was no music left a time when she did not know the familiar faces around her but addressed them by wrong names and called imploringly for her mother then jo grew frightened meg begged to be allowed to write the truth and even hannah said she would think of it though there was no danger yet a letter from washington added to their trouble for mr march had had a relapse and could not think of coming home for a long while 
 how dark the days seemed now how sad and lonely the house and how heavy were the hearts of the sisters as they worked and waited while the shadow of death hovered over the once happy home then it was that margaret sitting alone with tears dropping often on her work felt how rich she had been in things more precious than any luxuries money could love protection peace and health the real blessings of life then it was that jo living in the darkened room with that suffering little sister always before her eyes and that pathetic voice sounding in her ears learned to see the beauty and to sweetness of nature to feel how deep and tender a place she filled in all hearts and to acknowledge the worth of unselfish ambition to live for others and make home happy by that exercise of those simple virtues which all may possess and which all should love and value more than talent wealth or beauty and amy in her exile longed eagerly to be at home that she might work for beth feeling now that no service would be hard or irksome and remembering with regretful grief how many neglected tasks those willing hands had done for her laurie haunted the house like a restless ghost and mr laurence locke the grand piano because he could not bear to be reminded of the young neighbor who used to make the twilight pleasant for him everyone missed beth the milkman baker grocer and butcher inquired how she did poor mrs hummel came to beg pardon for her thoughtlessness and to get a shroud for minna the neighbors sent all sorts of comforts and good wishes and even those who knew her best were surprised to find how many friends shy little beth had made 
 meanwhile she lay on her bed with old joanna at her side for even in her wanderings she did not forget her forlorn protege she longed for her cats but would not have them brought lest they should get sick and in her quiet hours she was full of anxiety about jo she sent loving messages to amy bade them tell her mother that she would write soon and often begged for pencil and paper to try to say a word that father might not think she had neglected him but soon even these intervals of consciousness ended and she lay hour after hour tossing to and fro with incoherent words on her lips or sank into a heavy sleep which brought her no refreshment dr bangs came twice a day hannah sat up at night meg kept a telegram in her desk all ready to send off at any minute and jo never stirred from side 
 the first of december was a wintry day indeed to them for a bitter wind blew snow fell fast and the year seemed getting ready for its death when dr bangs came that morning he looked long at beth held the hot hand in both his own for a minute and laid it gently down saying in a low voice to hannah if mrs march can leave her husband better be sent for 
 hannah nodded without speaking for her lips twitched nervously meg dropped down into a chair as the strength seemed to go out of her limbs at the sound of those words and jo standing with a pale face for a minute ran to the parlor snatched up the telegram and throwing on her things rushed out into the storm she was soon back and while noiselessly taking off her cloak laurie came in with a letter saying that mr march was mending again jo read it thankfully but the heavy weight did not seem lifted off her heart and her face was so full of misery that laurie asked quickly what is it is beth worse 
 sent for mother said jo tugging at her rubber boots with a tragic expression 
 good for you jo did you do it on your own responsibility asked laurie as he seated her in the hall chair and took off the rebellious boots seeing how her hands shook 
 no the doctor told us to 
 oh jo not so bad as that cried laurie with a startled face 
 yes it is she know us she even talk about the flocks of green doves as she calls the vine leaves on the wall she look like my beth and nobody to help us bear it mother and father both gone and god seems so far away i find him 
 as the tears streamed fast down poor cheeks she stretched out her hand in a helpless sort of way as if groping in the dark and laurie took it in his whispering as well as he could with a lump in his throat here hold on tome jo dear 
 she could not speak but she did hold on and the warm grasp of the friendly human hand comforted her sore heart and seemed to lead her nearer to the divine arm which alone could uphold her in her trouble 
 laurie longed to say something tender and comfortable but no fitting words came to him so he stood silent gently stroking her bent head as her mother used to do it was the best thing he could have done far more soothing than the most eloquent words for jo felt the unspoken sympathy and in the silence learned the sweet solace which affection administers to sorrow soon she dried the tears which had relieved her and looked up with a grateful face 
 thank you teddy better now i feel so forlorn and will try to bear it if it comes 
 keep hoping for the best that will help you jo soon your mother will be here and then everything will be all right 
 so glad father is better now she feel so bad about leaving him oh me it does seem as if all the troubles came in a heap and i got the heaviest part on my shoulders sighed jo spreading her wet handkerchief over her knees to dry 
 meg pull fair asked laurie looking indignant 
 oh yes she tries to but she love bethy as i do and she miss her as i shall beth is my conscience and i give her up i i 
 down went face into the wet handkerchief and she cried despairingly for she had kept up bravely till now and never shed a tear laurie drew his hand across his eyes but could not speak till he had subdued the choky feeling in his throat and steadied his lips it might be unmanly but he help it and i am glad of it presently as sobs quieted he said hopefully i think she will die so good and we all love her so much i believe god will take her away yet 
 the good and dear people always do die groaned jo but she stopped crying for her words cheered her up in spite of her own doubts and fears 
 poor girl worn out it like you to be forlorn stop a bit hearten you up in a jiffy 
 laurie went off two stairs at a time and jo laid her wearied head down on little brown hood which no one had thought of moving from the table where she left it it must have possessed some magic for the submissive spirit of its gentle owner seemed to enter into jo and when laurie came running down with a glass of wine she took it with a smile and said bravely i drink health to my beth you are a good doctor teddy and such a comfortable friend how can i ever pay you she added as the wine refreshed her body as the kind words had done her troubled mind 
 send my bill and tonight give you some thing that will warm the cockles of your heart better than quarts of wine said laurie beaming at her with a face of suppressed satisfaction at something 
 what is it cried jo forgetting her woes for a minute in her wonder 
 i telegraphed to your mother yesterday and brooke answered come at once and be here tonight and everything will be all right you glad i did it 
 laurie spoke very fast and turned red and excited all in a minute for he had kept his plot a secret for fear of disappointing the girls or harming beth jo grew quite white flew out of her chair and the moment he stopped speaking she electrified him by throwing her arms round his neck and crying out with a joyful cry oh laurie oh mother i am so glad she did not weep again but laughed hysterically and trembled and clung to her friend as if she was a little bewildered by the sudden news 
 laurie though decidedly amazed behaved with great presence of mind he patted her back soothingly and finding that she was recovering followed it up by a bashful kiss or two which brought jo round at once holding on to the banisters she put him gently away saying breathlessly oh i mean to it was dreadful of me but you were such a dear to go and do it in spite of hannah that i help flying at you tell me all about it and give me wine again it makes me act so 
 i mind laughed laurie as he settled his tie why you see i got fidgety and so did grandpa we thought hannah was overdoing the authority business and your mother ought to know never forgive us if beth well if anything happened you know so i got grandpa to say it was high time we did something and off i pelted to the office yesterday for the doctor looked sober and hannah most took my head off when i proposed a telegram i never can bear to be lorded over so that settled my mind and i did it your mother will come i know and the late train is in at two i shall go for her and only got to bottle up your rapture and keep beth quiet till that blessed lady gets here 
 laurie an angel how shall i ever thank you 
 fly at me again i rather liked it said laurie looking mischievous a thing he had not done for a fortnight 
 no thank you do it by proxy when your grandpa comes tease but go home and rest for be up half the night bless you teddy bless you 
 jo had backed into a corner and as she finished her vanished precipitately into the kitchen where she sat down upon a dresser and told the assembled cats that she was happy oh so happy while laurie departed feeling that he had made a rather neat thing of it 
 the interferingest chap i ever see but i forgive him and do hope mrs march is coming right away said hannah with an air of relief when jo told the good news 
 meg had a quiet rapture and then brooded over the letter while jo set the sickroom in order and hannah knocked up a couple of pies in case of company unexpected a breath of fresh air seemed to blow through the house and something better than sunshine brightened the quiet rooms everything appeared to feel the hopeful change bird began to chirp again and a rose was discovered on bush in the window the fires seemed to burn with unusual cheeriness and every time the girls met their pale faces broke into smiles as they hugged one another whispering encouragingly coming dear coming every one rejoiced but beth she lay in that heavy stupor alike unconscious of hope and joy doubt and danger it was a piteous sight the once rosy face so changed and vacant the once busy hands so weak and wasted the once smiling lips quite dumb and the once pretty hair scattered rough and tangled on the pillow all day she say so only rousing now and then to mutter water with lips so parched they could hardly shape the word all day jo and meg hovered over her watching waiting hoping and trusting in god and mother and all day the snow fell the bitter wind raged and the hours dragged slowly by but night came at last and every time the clock struck the sisters still sitting on either side of the bed looked at each other with brightening eyes for each hour brought help nearer the doctor had been in to say that some change for better or worse would probably take place about midnight at which time he would return 
 hannah quite worn out lay down on the sofa at the foot and fell fast asleep mr laurence marched to and fro in the parlor feeling that he would rather face a rebel battery than mrs countenance as she entered laurie lay on the rug pretending to rest but staring into the fire with the thoughtful look which made his black eyes beautifully soft and clear 
 the girls never forgot that night for no sleep came to them as they kept their watch with that dreadful sense of powerlessness which comes to us in hours like those 
 if god spares beth i never will complain again whispered meg earnestly 
 if god spares beth try to love and serve him all my life answered jo with equal fervor 
 i wish i had no heart it aches so sighed meg after a pause 
 if life is often as hard as this i see how we ever shall get through it added her sister despondently 
 here the clock struck twelve and both forgot themselves in watching beth for they fancied a change passed over her wan face the house was still as death and nothing but the wailing of the wind broke the deep hush weary hannah slept on and no one but the sisters saw the pale shadow which seemed to fall upon the little bed an hour went by and nothing happened except quiet departure for the station another hour still no one came and anxious fears of delay in the storm or accidents by the way or worst of all a great grief at washington haunted the girls 
 it was past two when jo who stood at the window thinking how dreary the world looked in its winding sheet of snow heard a movement by the bed and turning quickly saw meg kneeling before their easy chair with her face hidden a dreadful fear passed coldly over jo as she thought beth is dead and meg is afraid to tell me 
 she was back at her post in an instant and to her excited eyes a great change seemed to have taken place the fever flush and the look of pain were gone and the beloved little face looked so pale and peaceful in its utter repose that jo felt no desire to weep or to lament leaning low over this dearest of her sisters she kissed the damp forehead with her heart on her lips and softly whispered goodby my beth goodby 
 as if awaked by the stir hannah started out of her sleep hurried to the bed looked at beth felt her hands listened at her lips and then throwing her apron over her head sat down to rock to and fro exclaiming under her breath the turned sleepin her damp and she breathes easy praise be given oh my goodness me 
 before the girls could believe the happy truth the doctor came to confirm it he was a homely man but they thought his face quite heavenly when he smiled and said with a fatherly look at them yes my dears i think the little girl will pull through this time keep the house quiet let her sleep and when she wakes give her 
 what they were to give neither heard for both crept into the dark hall and sitting on the stairs held each other close rejoicing with hearts too full for words when they went back to be kissed and cuddled by faithful hannah they found beth lying as she used to do with her cheek pillowed on her hand the dreadful pallor gone and breathing quietly as if just fallen asleep 
 if mother would only come now said jo as the winter night began to wane 
 see said meg coming up with a white rose 
 i thought this would hardly be ready to lay in hand tomorrow if away from us but it has blossomed in the night and now i mean to put it in my vase here so that when the darling wakes the first thing she sees will be the little rose and face 
 never had the sun risen so beautifully and never had the world seemed so lovely as it did to the heavy eyes of meg and jo as they looked out in the early morning when their long sad vigil was done 
 it looks like a fairy world said meg smiling to herself as she stood behind the curtain watching the dazzling sight 
 hark cried jo starting to her feet 
 yes there was a sound of bells at the door below a cry from hannah and then voice saying in a joyful whisper 
 girls come come

lionfish nov chapter eighteen rewardcontents prev chapter 
 for a moment there was silence as harry ron ginny and lockhart stood in the doorway covered in muck and slime and in case blood then there was a scream 
 
 ginny 
 
 it was mrs weasley who had been sitting crying in front of the fire she leapt to her feet closely followed by mr weasley and both of them flung themselves on their daughter 
 
 harry however was looking past them professor dumbledore was standing by the mantelpiece beaming next to professor mcgonagall who was taking great steadying gasps clutching her chest fawkes went whooshing past ear and settled on shoulder just as harry found himself and ron being swept into mrs tight embrace 
 
 you saved her you saved her how did you do it 
 
 i think all like to know that said professor mcgonagall weakly 
 
 mrs weasley let go of harry who hesitated for a moment then walked over to the desk and laid upon it the sorting hat the sword and what remained of diary 
 
 then he started telling them everything for nearly a quarter of an hour he spoke into the rapt silence he told them about hearing the disembodied voice how hermione had finally realized that he was hearing a basilisk in the pipes how he and ron had followed the spiders into the forest that aragog had told them where the last victim of the basilisk had died how he had guessed that moaning myrtle had been the victim and that the entrance to the chamber of secrets might be in her bathroom 
 
 very well professor mcgonagall prompted him as he paused so you found out where the entrance was breaking a hundred school rules into pieces along the way i might add but how on earth did you all get out of there alive potter 
 
 so harry his voice now growing hoarse from all this talking told them about timely arrival and about the sorting hat giving him the sword but then he faltered he had so far avoided mentioning diary or ginny she was standing with her head against mrs shoulder and tears were still coursing silently down her cheeks what if they expelled her harry thought in panic diary work anymore how could they prove it had been he made her do it all 
 
 instinctively harry looked at dumbledore who smiled faintly the firelight glancing off his spectacles 
 
 what interests me most said dumbledore gently is how lord voldemort managed to enchant ginny when my sources tell me he is currently in hiding in the forests of albania 
 
 relief warm sweeping glorious relief swept over harry that said mr weasley in a stunned voice ginny but not ginny been has she 
 
 it was this diary said harry quickly picking it up and showing it to dumbledore riddle wrote it when he was sixteen 
 
 dumbledore took the diary from harry and peered keenly down his long crooked nose at its burnt and soggy pages 
 
 brilliant he said softly of course he was probably the most brilliant student hogwarts has ever seen he turned around to the weasleys who were looking utterly bewildered 
 
 very few people know that lord voldemort was once called tom riddle i taught him myself fifty years ago at hogwarts he disappeared after leaving the school traveled far and wide sank so deeply into the dark arts consorted with the very worst of our kind underwent so many dangerous magical transformations that when he resurfaced as lord voldemort he was barely recognizable hardly anyone connected lord voldemort with the clever handsome boy who was once head boy here 
 
 but ginny said mrs weasley our ginny got to do with with him 
 
 his ginny sobbed writing in it and been back all year 
 
 ginny said mr weasley flabbergasted i taught you anything what have i always told you never trust anything that can think for itself if you see where it keeps its brain why you show the diary to me or your mother a suspicious object like that it was clearly full of dark magic 
 
 i know sobbed ginny i found it inside one of the books mum got me i someone had just left it in there and forgotten about it 
 
 miss weasley should go up to the hospital wing right away dumbledore interrupted in a firm voice this has been a terrible ordeal for her there will be no punishment older and wiser wizards than she have been hoodwinked by lord voldemort he strode over to the door and opened it bed rest and perhaps a large steaming mug of hot chocolate i always find that cheers me up he added twinkling kindly down at her you will find that madam pomfrey is still awake just giving out mandrake juice i daresay the victims will be waking up any moment 
 
 so okay said ron brightly 
 
 there has been no lasting harm done ginny said dumbledore 
 
 mrs weasley led ginny out and mr weasley followed still looking deeply shaken 
 
 you know minerva professor dumbledore said thoughtfully to professor mcgonagall i think all this merits a good feast might i ask you to go and alert the kitchens 
 
 right said professor mcgonagall crisply also moving to the door leave you to deal with potter and weasley shall i 
 
 certainly said dumbledore 
 
 she left and harry and ron gazed uncertainly at dumbledore what exactly had professor mcgonagall meant deal with them surely surely they about to be punished 
 
 i seem to remember telling you both that i would have to expel you if you broke any more school rules said dumbledore 
 
 ron opened his mouth in horror 
 
 which goes to show that the best of us must sometimes eat our words dumbledore went on smiling you will both receive special awards for services to the school and let me see yes i think two hundred points apiece for gryffindor 
 
 ron went as brightly pink as valentine flowers and closed his mouth again 
 
 but one of us seems to be keeping mightily quiet about his part in this dangerous adventure dumbledore added why so modest gilderoy 
 
 harry gave a start he had completely forgotten about lockhart he turned and saw that lockhart was standing in a corner of the room still wearing his vague smile when dumbledore addressed him lockhart looked over his shoulder to see who he was talking to 
 
 professor dumbledore ron said quickly there was an accident down in the chamber of secrets professor lockhart 
 
 am i a professor said lockhart in mild surprise goodness i expect i was hopeless was i 
 
 he tried to do a memory charm and the wand backfired ron explained quietly to dumbledore 
 
 dear me said dumbledore shaking his head his long silver mustache quivering impaled upon your own sword gilderoy 
 
 sword said lockhart dimly got a sword that boy has though he pointed at harry lend you one 
 
 would you mind taking professor lockhart up to the infirmary too dumbledore said to ron like a few more words with harry 
 
 lockhart ambled out ron cast a curious look back at dumbledore and harry as he closed the door 
 
 dumbledore crossed to one of the chairs by the fire 
 
 sit down harry he said and harry sat feeling unaccountably nervous 
 
 first of all harry i want to thank you said dumbledore eyes twinkling again you must have shown me real loyalty down in the chamber nothing but that could have called fawkes to you 
 
 he stroked the phoenix which had fluttered down onto his knee harry grinned awkwardly as dumbledore watched him 
 
 and so you met tom riddle said dumbledore thoughtfully i imagine he was most interested in you 
 
 suddenly something that was nagging at harry came tumbling out of his mouth 
 
 professor dumbledore riddle said like him strange likenesses he said 
 
 did he now said dumbledore looking thoughtfully at harry from under his thick silver eyebrows and what do you think harry 
 
 i think like him said harry more loudly than intended i mean in gryffindor 
 
 but he fell silent a lurking doubt resurfacing in his mind 
 
 professor he started again after a moment the sorting hat told me have done well in slytherin everyone thought i was heir for a while because i can speak parseltongue 
 
 you can speak parseltongue harry said dumbledore calmly because lord voldemort who is the last remaining ancestor of salazar slytherin can speak parseltongue unless much mistaken he transferred some of his own powers to you the night he gave you that scar not something he intended to do sure 
 
 voldemort put a bit of himself in me harry said thunderstruck 
 
 it certainly seems so 
 
 so i should be in slytherin harry said looking desperately into face the sorting hat could see power in me and it 
 
 put you in gryffindor said dumbledore calmly listen to me harry you happen to have many qualities salazar slytherin prized in his students his own very rare gift parseltongue resourcefulness determination a certain disregard for rules he added his mustache quivering again yet the sorting hat placed you in gryffindor you know why that was think 
 
 it only put me in gryffindor said harry in a defeated voice because i asked not to go in slytherin 
 
 exactly said dumbledore beaming once more which makes you very different from tom riddle it is our choices harry that show what we truly are far more than our abilities harry sat motionless in his chair stunned if you want proof harry that you belong in gryffindor i suggest you look more closely at this 
 
 dumbledore reached across to professor desk picked up the silver sword and handed it to harry dully harry turned it over the rubies blazing in the firelight and then he saw the name engraved just below the hilt 
 
 godric gryffindor 
 
 only a true gryffindor could have pulled that out of the hat harry said dumbledore simply 
 
 for a minute neither of them spoke then dumbledore pulled open one of the drawers in professor desk and took out a quill and a bottle of ink 
 
 what you need harry is some food and sleep i suggest you go down to the feast while i write to azkaban we need our gamekeeper back and i must draft an advertisement for the daily prophet too he added thoughtfully be needing a new defense against the dark arts teacher dear me we do seem to run through them we 
 
 harry got up and crossed to the door he had just reached for the handle however when the door burst open so violently that it bounced back off the wall 
 
 lucius malfoy stood there fury in his face and cowering behind his legs heavily wrapped in bandages was dobby 
 
 good evening lucius said dumbledore pleasantly 
 
 mr malfoy almost knocked harry over as he swept into the room dobby went scurrying in after him crouching at the hem of his cloak a look of abject terror on his face 
 
 the elf was carrying a stained rag with which he was attempting to finish cleaning mr malfoys shoes apparently mr malfoy had set out in a great hurry for not only were his shoes but his usually sleek hair was disheveled ignoring the elf bobbing apologetically around his ankles he fixed his cold eyes upon dumbledore 
 
 so he said come back the governors suspended you but you still saw fit to return to hogwarts 
 
 well you see lucius said dumbledore smiling serenely the other eleven governors contacted me today it was something like being caught in a hailstorm of owls to tell the truth heard that arthur weasleys daughter had been killed and wanted me back here at once they seemed to think i was the best man for the job after all very strange tales they told me too several of them seemed to think that you had threatened to curse their families if they agree to suspend me in the first place 
 
 mr malfoy went even paler than usual but his eyes were still slits of fury 
 
 so have you stopped the attacks yet he sneered have you caught the culprit 
 
 we have said dumbledore with a smile 
 
 well said mr malfoy sharply who is it 
 
 the same person as last time lucius said dumbledore but this time lord voldemort was acting through somebody else by means of this diary 
 
 he held up the small black book with the large hole through the center watching mr malfoy closely harry however was watching dobby 
 
 the elf was doing something very odd his great eyes fixed meaningfully on harry he kept pointing at the diary then at mr malfoy and then hitting himself hard on the head with his fist 
 
 i see said mr malfoy slowly to dumbledore 
 
 a clever plan said dumbledore in a level voice still staring mr malfoy straight in the eye because if harry here mr malfoy shot harry a swift sharp look and his friend ron discovered this book why ginny weasley might have taken all the blame no one would ever have been able to prove she acted of her own free will 
 
 mr malfoy said nothing his face was suddenly masklike 
 
 and imagine dumbledore went on what might have happened then the weasleys are one of our most prominent families imagine the effect on arthur weasley and his muggle protection act if his own daughter was discovered attacking and killing very fortunate the diary was discovered and memories wiped from it who knows what the consequences might have been otherwise 
 
 mr malfoy forced himself to speak 
 
 very fortunate he said stiffly 
 
 and still behind his back dobby was pointing first to the diary then to lucius malfoy then punching himself in the head 
 
 and harry suddenly understood he nodded at dobby and dobby backed into a corner now twisting his ears in punishment 
 
 you want to know how ginny got hold of that diary mr malfoy said harry 
 
 lucius malfoy rounded on him 
 
 how should i know how the stupid little girl got hold of it he said 
 
 because you gave it to her said harry in flourish and blotts you picked up her old transfiguration book and slipped the diary inside it you 
 
 he saw mr white hands clench and unclench 
 
 prove it he hissed 
 
 oh no one will be able to do that said dumbledore smiling at harry not now that riddle has vanished from the book on the other hand i would advise you lucius not to go giving out any more of lord old school things if any more of them find their way into innocent hands i think arthur weasley for one will make sure they are traced back to you 
 
 lucius malfoy stood for a moment and harry distinctly saw his right hand twitch as though he was longing to reach for his wand instead he turned to his going dobby 
 
 he wrenched open the door and as the elf came hurrying up to him he kicked him right through it they could hear dobby squealing with pain all the way along the corridor harry stood for a moment thinking hard then it came to him 
 
 professor dumbledore he said hurriedly can i give that diary back to mr malfoy please 
 
 certainly harry said dumbledore calmly but hurry the feast remember harry grabbed the diary and dashed out of the office he could hear squeals of pain receding around the corner quickly wondering if this plan could possibly work harry took off one of his shoes pulled off his slimy filthy sock and stuffed the diary into it then he ran down the dark corridor 
 
 he caught up with them at the top of the stairs 
 
 mr malfoy he gasped skidding to a halt got something for you 
 
 and he forced the smelly sock into lucius hand 
 
 what the 
 
 mr malfoy ripped the sock off the diary threw it aside then looked furiously from the ruined book to meet the same sticky end as your parents one of these days harry potter he said softly they were meddlesome fools too 
 
 he turned to go 
 
 come dobby i said come 
 
 but dobby move he was holding up disgusting slimy sock and looking at it as though it were a priceless treasure 
 
 master has given a sock said the elf in wonderment master gave it to dobby 
 
 that spat mr malfoy what did you say 
 
 got a sock said dobby in disbelief master threw it and dobby caught it and dobby dobby is free 
 
 lucius malfoy stood frozen staring at the elf then he lunged at harry 
 
 lost me my servant boy 
 
 but dobby shouted you shall not harm harry potter 
 
 there was a loud bang and mr malfoy was thrown backward he crashed down the stairs three at a time landing in a crumpled heap on the landing below he got up his face livid and pulled out his wand but dobby raised a long threatening finger 
 
 you shall go now he said fiercely pointing down at mr malfoy you shall not touch harry potter you shall go now 
 
 lucius malfoy had no choice with a last incensed stare at the pair of them he swung his cloak around him and hurried out of sight 
 
 harry potter freed dobby said the elf shrilly gazing up at harry moonlight from the nearest window reflected in his eyes harry potter set dobby free 
 
 least i could do dobby said harry grinning just promise never to try and save my life again 
 
 the ugly brown face split suddenly into a wide toothy smile 
 
 just got one question dobby said harry as dobby pulled on sock with shaking hands you told me all this had nothing to do with remember well 
 
 it was a clue sir said dobby his eyes widening as though this was obvious was giving you a clue the dark lord before he changed his name could be freely named you see 
 
 right said harry weakly well better go a feast and my friend hermione should be awake by now 
 
 dobby threw his arms around middle and hugged him 
 
 harry potter is greater by far than dobby knew he sobbed farewell harry potter 
 
 and with a final loud crack dobby disappeared 
 
 harry had been to several hogwarts feasts but never one quite like this everybody was in their pajamas and the celebration lasted all night harry know whether the best bit was hermione running toward him screaming you solved it you solved it or justin hurrying over from the hufflepuff table to wring his hand and apologize endlessly for suspecting him or hagrid turning up at half past three cuffing harry and ron so hard on the shoulders that they were knocked into their plates of trifle or his and four hundred points for gryffindor securing the house cup for the second year running or professor mcgonagall standing up to tell them all that the exams had been canceled as a school treat oh no said hermione or dumbledore announcing that unfortunately professor lockhart would be unable to return next year owing to the fact that he needed to go away and get his memory back quite a few of the teachers joined in the cheering that greeted this news 
 
 shame said ron helping himself to a jam doughnut he has starting to grow on me 
 
 the rest of the final term passed in a haze of blazing sunshine hogwarts was back to normal with only a few small differences defense against the dark arts classes were canceled but had plenty of practice at that anyway ron told a disgruntled hermione and lucius malfoy had been sacked as a school governor draco was no longer strutting around the school as though he owned the place on the contrary he looked resentful and sulky on the other hand ginny weasley was perfectly happy again 
 
 too soon it was time for the journey home on the hogwarts express harry ron hermione fred george and ginny got a compartment to themselves they made the mos of the last few hours in which they were allowed to do magic before the holidays they played exploding snap set off the very last of fred and filibuster fireworks and practiced disarming each other by magic harry was getting very good at it 
 
 they were almost at cross when harry remembered something 
 
 ginny what did you see percy doing that he want you to tell anyone 
 
 oh that said ginny giggling well got a girlfriend fred dropped a stack of books on head 
 
 what 
 
 that ravenclaw prefect penelope clearwater said ginny who he was writing to all last summer been meeting her all over the school in secret i walked in on them kissing in an empty classroom one day he was so upset when she was you know attacked you tease him will you she added anxiously 
 
 dream of it said fred who was looking like his birthday had come early 
 
 definitely not said george sniggering 
 
 the hogwarts express slowed and finally stopped 
 
 harry pulled out his quill and a bit of parchment and turned to ron and hermione 
 
 this is called a telephone number he told ron scribbling it twice tearing the parchment in two and handing it to them i told your dad how to use a telephone last summer know call me at the dursleys okay i stand another two months with only dudley to talk to 
 
 your aunt and uncle will be proud though they said hermione as they got off the train and joined the crowd thronging toward the enchanted barrier when they hear what you did this year 
 
 proud said harry are you crazy all those times i died and i manage it be furious 
 
 and together they walked back through the gateway to the muggle world

 the chamber of secrets

 it took a few seconds for the absurdity of this statement to sink in then ron voiced what harry was thinking 
 
 both mental 
 
 ridiculous said hermione faintly 
 
 peter dead said harry he killed him twelve years ago he pointed at black whose face twitched convulsively 
 
 i meant to he growled his yellow teeth bared but little peter got the better of menot this time though 
 
 and crookshanks was thrown to the floor as black lunged at scabbers ron yelled with pain as weight fell on his broken leg 
 
 sirius no lupin yelled launching himself forwards and dragging black away from ron again wait you do it just like that they need to understand got to explain 
 
 we can explain afterwards snarled black trying to throw lupin off one hand was still clawing the air as it tried to reach scabbers who was squealing like a piglet scratching face and neck as he tried to escape 
 
 got a right to know everything lupin panted still trying to restrain black kept him as a pet there are parts of it even i understand and harry you owe harry the truth sirius 
 
 black stopped struggling though his hollowed eyes were still fixed on scabbers who was clamped tightly under bitten scratched and bleeding hands 
 
 all right then black said without taking his eyes off the rat 
 
 tell them whatever you like but make it quick remus i want to commit the murder i was imprisoned for 
 
 nutters both of you said ron shakily looking round at harry and hermione for support had enough of this off 
 
 he tried to heave himself up on his good leg but lupin raised his wand again pointing it at scabbers 
 
 going to hear me out ron he said quietly just keep a tight hold on peter while you listen 
 
 not peter scabbers ron yelled trying to force the rat back into his front pocket but scabbers was fighting too hard ron swayed and overbalanced and harry caught him am pushed him back down to the bed then ignoring black harry turned to lupin 
 
 there were witnesses who saw pettigrew die he said a whole street full of them 
 
 they see what they thought they saw said black savagely still watching scabbers struggling in hands 
 
 everyone thought sirius killed peter said lupin nodding i believed it myself until i saw the map tonight because the map never alive holding him harry 
 
 harry looked down at ron and as their eyes met they agreed silently black and lupin were both out of their minds their story made no sense whatsoever how could scabbers be peter pettigrew azkaban must have unhinged black after all but why was lupin playing along with him 
 
 then hermione spoke in a trembling calm sort of voice as though trying to will professor lupin to talk sensibly 
 
 but professor lupinscabbers be pettigrewit just be true you know it 
 
 why it be true lupin said calmly as though they were in class and hermione had simply spotted a problem in an experiment with grindylows 
 
 because because people would know if peter pettigrew had been an animagus we did animagi in class with professor mcgonagall and i looked them up when i did my homework the ministry of magic keeps tabs on witches and wizards who can become animals a register showing what animal they become and their markings and thingsand i went and looked professor mcgonagall up on the register and there have been only seven animagi this century and name on the list 
 
 harry had barely had time to marvel inwardly at the effort hermione put into her homework when lupin started to laugh 
 
 right again hermione he said but the ministry never knew that here used to be three unregistered animagi running around hogwarts 
 
 if going to tell them the story get a move on remus said black who was still watching every desperate move waited twelve years not going to wait much longer 
 
 all rightbut need to help me sirius said lupin i only know how it began 
 
 lupin broke off there had been a loud creak behind him the bedroom door had opened of its own accord all five of them stared at it then lupin strode toward it and looked out into the landing 
 
 no one there 
 
 this place is haunted said ron 
 
 not said lupin still looking at the door in a puzzled way the shrieking shack was never hauntedthe screams and howls the villagers used to hear were made by me 
 
 he pushed his graying hair out of his eyes thought for a moment then said where all of this starts with my becoming a werewolf none of this could have happened if i been bitterand if i been so foolhardy 
 
 he looked sober and tired ron started to interrupt but hermione said shh she was watching lupin very intently 
 
 i as a very small boy when i received the bite my parents tried everything but in those days there was no cure the potion that professor snape has been making for me is a very recent discovery it makes me safe you see as long as i take it in the week preceding the full moon i keep my mind when i able to curl up in my office a harmless wolf and wait for the moon to wane again 
 
 before the wolfsbane potion was discovered however i became a fully fledged monster once a month it seemed impossible that i would be able to come to hogwarts other parents likely to want their children exposed to me 
 
 but then dumbledore became headmaster and he was sympathetic he said that as long as we took certain precautions there was no reason i come to school lupin sighed and looked directly at harry i told you months ago that the whomping willow was planted the year i came to hogwarts the truth is that it was planted because i came to hogwarts this house lupin looked miserably around the room the tunnel that leads to it they were built for my use once a month i was smuggled out of the castle into this place to transform the tree was placed at the tunnel mouth to stop anyone coming across me while i was dangerous 
 
 harry see where this story was going but he was listening raptly all the same the only sound apart from voice was frightened squeaking 
 
 my transformations in those days were were terrible it is very painful to turn into a werewolf i was separated from humans to bite so i bit and scratched myself instead the villagers heard the noise and the screaming and thought they were hearing particularly violent spirits dumbledore encouraged the rumoreven now when the house has been silent for years the villagers dare approach it 
 
 but apart from my transformations i was happier than i had ever been in my life for the first time ever i had friends three great friends sirius blackpeter pettigrewand of course your father harry james potter 
 
 now my three friends could hardly fail to notice that i disappeared once a month i made up all sorts of stories i told them my mother was ill and that i had to go home to see heri was terrified they would desert me the moment they found out what i was but of course they like you hermione worked out the truth 
 
 and they desert me at all instead they did something for me that would make my transformations not only bearable but the best times of my life they became animagi 
 
 my dad too said harry astounded 
 
 yes indeed said lupin it took them the best part of three years to work out how to do it your father and sirius here were the cleverest students in the school and lucky they were because the animagus transformation can go horribly wrong one reason the ministry keeps a close watch on those attempting to do it peter needed all the help he could get from james and sirius finally in our fifth year they managed it they could each turn into a different animal at will 
 
 but how did that help you said hermione sounding puzzled 
 
 they keep me company as humans so they kept me company as animals said lupin a werewolf is only a danger to people they sneaked out of the castle every month under invisibility cloak they transformedpeter as the smallest could slip beneath the attacking branches and touch the knot that freezes it they would then slip down the tunnel and join me under their influence i became less dangerous my body was still wolfish but my mind seemed to become less so while i was with them 
 
 hurry up remus snarled black who was still watching scabbers with a horrible sort of hunger on his face 
 
 getting there sirius getting therewell highly exciting possibilities were open to us now that we could all transform soon we were leaving the shrieking shack and roaming the school grounds and the village by night sirius and james transformed into such large animals they were able to keep a werewolf in check i doubt whether any hogwarts students ever found out more about the hogwarts grounds and hogsmeade than we did and how we came to write the map and sign it with our nicknames sirius is padfoot peter is wormtail james was prongs 
 
 what sort of animal harry began but hermione cut him off that was still really dangerous running around in the dark with a werewolf what if given the others the slip and bitten somebody 
 
 a thought that still haunts me said lupin heavily and there were near misses many of them we laughed about them afterwards we were young thoughtless carried away with our own cleverness 
 
 i sometimes felt guilty about betraying trust of coursehe had admitted me to hogwarts when no other headmaster would have done so and he had no idea i was breaking the rules he had set down for my own and others safety he never knew i had led three fellow students into becoming animagi illegally but i always managed to forget my guilty feelings every time we sat down to plan our next adventure and i changed 
 
 face had hardened and there was in his voice all this year i have been battling with myself wondering whether i should tell dumbledore that sirius was an animagus but i do it why because i was too cowardly it would have meant admitting that betrayed his trust while i was at school admitting that led others along with meand trust has meant everything to me he let me into hogwarts as a boy and he gave me a job when i have been shunned all my adult life unable to find paid work because of what i am and so i convinced myself that sirius was getting into the school using dark arts he learned from voldemort that being an animagus had nothing to do with itso in a way been right about me all along 
 
 snape said black harshly taking his eyes off scabbers for the first time in minutes and looking up at lupin snape got to do with it 
 
 here sirius said lupin heavily teaching here as well he looked up at harry ron and hermione 
 
 professor snape was at school with us he fought very hard against my appointment to the defense against the dark arts job he has been telling dumbledore all year that i am not to be trusted he has his reasonsyou see sirius here played a trick on him which nearly killed him a trick which involved me 
 
 black made a derisive noise 
 
 it served him right he sneered sneaking around trying to find out what we were up tohoping he could get us expelled 
 
 severus was very interested in where i went every month lupin told harry ron and hermione we were in the same year you know and we er like each other very much he especially disliked james jealous i think of talent on the quidditch fieldanyway snape had seen me crossing the grounds with madam pomfrey one evening as she led me toward the whomping willow to transform sirius thought it would be er amusing to tell snape all he had to do was prod the knot on the tree trunk with a long stick and be able to get in after me well of course snape tried it if got as far as this house have met a fully grown werewolf but your father heard what sirius had done went after snape and pulled him back at great risk to his lifesnape glimpsed me though at the end of the tunnel he was forbidden by dumbledore to tell anybody but from that time on he knew what i was 
 
 so why snape like you said harry slowly because he thought you were in on the joke 
 
 right sneered a cold voice from the wall behind lupin 
 
 severus snape was pulling off the invisibility cloak his wand pointing directly at lupin

lionfish nov chapter eighteen the weighing of the wandscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 when harry woke up on sunday morning it took him a moment to remember why he felt so miserable and worried then the memory of the previous night rolled over him he sat up and ripped back the curtains of his own intending to talk to ron to force ron to believe him only to find that bed was empty he had obviously gone down to breakfast 
 
 harry dressed and went down the spiral staircase into the common room the moment he appeared the people who had already finished breakfast broke into applause again the prospect of going down into the great hall and facing the rest of the gryffindors all treating him like some sort of hero was not inviting it was that however or stay here and allow himself to be cornered by the creevey brothers who were both beckoning frantically to him to join them he walked resolutely over to the portrait hole pushed it open climbed out of it and found himself with hermione 
 
 hello she said holding up a stack of toast which she was carrying in a napkin i brought you to go for a walk 
 
 good idea said harry gratefully 
 
 they went downstairs crossed the entrance hall quickly without looking in at the great hall and were soon striding across the lawn toward the lake where the durmstrang ship was moored reflected blackly in the water it was a chilly morning and they kept moving munching their toast as harry told hermione exactly what had happened after he had left the gryffindor table the night before to his immense relief hermione accepted his story without question 
 
 well of course i knew you entered yourself she said when finished telling her about the scene in the chamber off the hall the look on your face when dumbledore read out your name but the question is who did put it in because right harryi think any student could have done never be able to fool the goblet or get over 
 
 have you seen ron harry interrupted 
 
 hermione hesitated 
 
 ermyeshe was at breakfast she said 
 
 does he still think i entered myself 
 
 wellno i think sonot really said hermione awkwardly 
 
 that supposed to mean not really 
 
 oh harry it obvious hermione said despairingly jealous 
 
 jealous harry said incredulously jealous of what he wants to make a prat of himself in front of the whole school does he 
 
 look said hermione patiently always you who gets all the attention you know it is i know not your fault she added quickly seeing harry open his mouth furiously i know you ask for itbut well you know got all those brothers to compete against at home and his best friend and really famous always shunted to one side whenever people see you and he puts up with it and he never mentions it but i suppose this is just one time too many 
 
 great said harry bitterly really great tell him from me swap any time he wants tell him from me welcome to gawping at my forehead everywhere i go 
 
 not teiling him anything hermione said shortly tell him yourself the only way to sort this out 
 
 not running around after him trying to make him grow up harry said so loudly that several owls in a nearby tree took flight in alarm maybe believe not enjoying myself once got my neck broken or 
 
 not funny said hermione quietly not funny at all she looked extremely anxious harry been thinking you know what got to do you straight away the moment we get back to the castle 
 
 yeah give ron a good kick up the 
 
 write to sirius got to tell him happened he asked you to keep him posted on everything going on at almost as if he expected something like this to happen i brought some parchment and a quill out with me 
 
 come off it said harry looking around to check that they be overheard but the grounds were quite deserted he came back to the country just because my scar twinged probably come bursting right into the castle if i tell him entered me in the triwizard tournament 
 
 want you to tell him said hermione sternly going to find out anyway 
 
 how 
 
 harry this going to be kept quiet said hermione very seriously this famous and famous be really surprised if there anything in the daily prophet about you already in half the books about you knowand sirius would rather hear it from you i know he would 
 
 okay okay write to him said harry throwing his last piece of toast into the lake they both stood and watched it floating there for a moment before a large tentacle rose out of the water and scooped it beneath the surface then they returned to the castle 
 
 whose owl am i going to use harry said as they climbed the stairs he told me not to use hedwig again 
 
 ask ron if you can borrow 
 
 not asking ron for anything harry said flatly 
 
 well borrow one of the school owls then anyone can use them said hermione 
 
 they went up to the owlery hermione gave harry a piece of parchment a quill and a bottle of ink then strolled around the long lines of perches looking at all the different owls while harry sat down against a wall and wrote his letter 
 
 dear sirius 
 you told me to keep you posted on happening at hogwarts so here goes i know if heard but the triwizard happening this year and on saturday night i got picked as a fourth champion i who put my name in the goblet of fire because i the other hogwarts champion is cedric diggory from hufflepuff 
 he paused at this point thinking he had an urge to say something about the large weight of anxiety that seemed to have settled inside his chest since last night but he think how to translate this into words so he simply dipped his quill back into the ink bottle and wrote 
 
 hope okay and buckbeak harry 
 finished he told hermione getting to his feet and brushing straw off his robes at this hedwig fluttered down onto his shoulder and held out her leg 
 
 i use you harry told her looking around for the school owls got to use one of these 
 
 hedwig gave a very loud hoot and took off so suddenly that her talons cut into his shoulder she kept her back to harry all the time he was tying his letter to the leg of a large barn owl when the barn owl had flown off harry reached out to stroke hedwig but she clicked her beak furiously and soared up into the rafters out of reach 
 
 first ron then you harry said angrily this my fault 
 
 
 
 if harry had thought that matters would improve once everyone got used to the idea of him being champion the following day showed him how mistaken he was he could no longer avoid the rest of the school once he was back at lessons and it was clear that the rest of the school just like the gryffindors thought harry had entered himself for the tournament unlike the gryffindors however they did not seem impressed 
 
 the hufflepuffs who were usually on excellent terms with the gryffindors had turned remarkably cold toward the whole lot of them one herbology lesson was enough to demonstrate this it was plain that the hufflepuffs felt that harry had stolen their glory a feeling exacerbated perhaps by the fact that hufflepuff house very rarely got any glory and that cedric was one of the few who had ever given them any having beaten gryffindor once at quidditch ernie macmillan and justin finchfletchley with whom harry normally got on very well did not talk to him even though they were repotting bouncing bulbs at the same tray though they did laugh rather unpleasantly when one of the bouncing bulbs wriggled free from grip and smacked him hard in the face ron talking to harry either hermione sat between them making very forced conversation but though both answered her normally they avoided making eye contact with each other harry thought even professor sprout seemed distant with him but then she was head of hufflepuff house 
 
 he would have been looking forward to seeing hagrid under normal circumstances but care of magical creatures meant seeing the slytherins too the first time he would come with them since becoming champion 
 
 predictably malfoy arrived at cabin with his familiar sneer firmly in place 
 
 ah look boys the champion he said to crabbe and goyle the moment he got within earshot of harry got your autograph books better get a signature now because i doubt going to be around much the triwizard champions have diedhow long reckon going to last potter ten minutes into the first my bet 
 
 crabbe and goyle guffawed sycophantically but malfoy had to stop there because hagrid emerged from the back of his cabin balancing a teetering tower of crates each containing a very large skrewt to the horror hagrid proceeded to explain that the reason the skrewts had been killing one another was an excess of energy and that the solution would be for each student to fix a leash on a skrewt and take it for a short walk the only good thing about this plan was that it distracted malfoy completely 
 
 take this thing for a walk he repeated in disgust staring into one of the boxes and where exactly are we supposed to fix the leash around the sting the blasting end or the sucker 
 
 roun the middle said hagrid demonstrating er yeh might want ter put on yer gloves jus as an extra precaution like harry you come here an help me with this big one 
 
 real intention however was totalk to harry away from the rest of the class he waited until everyone else had set off with their skrewts then turned to harry and said very seriously so yer competin harry in the tournament school champion 
 
 one of the champions harry corrected him 
 
 eyes looked very anxious under his wild eyebrows 
 
 no idea who put yeh in fer it harry 
 
 you believe i do it then said harry concealing with difficulty the rush of gratitude he felt at words 
 
 course i do hagrid grunted yeh say it wasn you an i believe yeh an dumbledore believes yer an all 
 
 wish i knew who did do it said harry bitterly 
 
 the pair of them looked out over the lawn the class was widely scattered now and all in great difficulty the skrewts were now over three feet long and extremely powerful no longer and colorless they had developed a kind of thick grayish shiny armor they looked like a cross between giant scorpions and elongated crabs but still without recognizable heads or eyes they had become immensely strong and very hard to control 
 
 look like havin fun don they hagrid said happily harry assumed he was talking about the skrewts because his classmates certainly every now and then with an alarming bang one of the skrewts ends would explode causing it to shoot forward several yards and more than one person was being dragged along on their stomach trying desperately to get back on their feet 
 
 ah i don know harry hagrid sighed suddenly looking back down at him with a worried expression on his face school championeverythin seems ter happen ter you doesn it 
 
 harry answer yes everything did seem to happen to himthat was more or less what hermione had said as they had walked around the lake and that was the reason according to her that ron was no longer talking to him 
 
 
 
 the next few days were some of worst at hogwarts the closest he had ever come to feeling like this had been during those months in his second year when a large part of the school had suspected him of attacking his fellow students but ron had been on his side then he thought he could have coped with the rest of the behavior if he could just have had ron back as a friend but he going to try and persuade ron to talk to him if ron want to nevertheless it was lonely with dislike pouring in on him from all sides 
 
 he could understand the hufflepuffs attitude even if he like it they had their own champion to support he expected nothing less than vicious insults from the slytherins he was highly unpopular there and always had been because he had helped gryffindor beat them so often both at quidditch and in the championship but he had hoped the ravenclaws might have found it in their hearts to support him as much as cedric he was wrong however most ravenclaws seemed to think that he had been desperate to earn himself a bit more fame by tricking the goblet into accepting his name 
 
 then there was the fact that cedric looked the part of a champion so much more than he did exceptionally handsome with his straight nose dark hair and gray eyes it was hard to say who was receiving more admiration these days cedric or viktor krum harry actually saw the same girls who had been so keen to get autograph begging cedric to sign their school bags one lunchtime 
 
 meanwhile there was no reply from sirius hedwig was refusing to come anywhere near him professor trelawney was predicting his death with even more certainty than usual and he did so badly at summoning charms in professor class that he was given extra homework the only person to get any apart from neville 
 
 really not that difficult harry hermione tried to reassure him as they left class she had been making objects zoom across the room to her all lesson as though she were some sort of weird magnet for board dusters wastepaper baskets and lunascopes you just concentrating properly 
 
 wonder why that was said harry darkly as cedric diggory walked past surrounded by a large group of simpering girls all of whom looked at harry as though he were a particularly large skrewt still never mind eh double potions to look forward to this afternoon 
 
 double potions was always a horrible experience but these days it was nothing short of torture being shut in a dungeon for an hour and a half with snape and the slytherins all of whom seemed determined to punish harry as much as possible for daring to become school champion was about the most unpleasant thing harry could imagine he had already struggled through one worth with hermione sitting next to him intoning ignore them ignore them ignore them under her breath and he see why today should be any better 
 
 when he and hermione arrived at dungeon after lunch they found the slytherins waiting outside each and every one of them wearing a large badge on the front of his or her robes for one wild moment harry thought they were badges then he saw that they all bore the same message in luminous red letters that burnt brightly in the dimly lit underground passage 
 
 support cedric diggory 
 the real hogwarts champion 
 like them potter said malfoy loudly as harry approached and this all they do look 
 
 he pressed his badge into his chest and the message upon it vanished to be replaced by another one which glowed green 
 
 potter stinks 
 the slytherins howled with laughter each of them pressed their badges too until the message potter stinks was shining brightly all around harry he felt the heat rise in his face and neck 
 
 oh very funny hermione said sarcastically to pansy parkinson and her gang of slytherin girls who were laughing harder than anyone really witty 
 
 ron was standing against the wall with dean and seamus he laughing but he sticking up for harry either 
 
 want one granger said malfoy holding out a badge to hermione got loads but touch my hand now just washed it you see want a mudblood sliming it up 
 
 some of the anger harry had been feeling for days and days seemed to burst through a dam in his chest he had reached for his wand before thought what he was doing people all around them scrambled out of the way backing down the corridor 
 
 harry hermione said warningly 
 
 go on then potter malfoy said quietly drawing out his own wand not here to look after you now do it if got the guts 
 
 for a split second they looked into each eyes then at exactly the same time both acted 
 
 funnunculus harry yelled 
 
 densaugeo screamed malfoy 
 
 jets of light shot from both wands hit each other in midair and ricocheted off at angles hit goyle in the face and hit hermione goyle bellowed and put his hands to his nose where great ugly boils were springing up hermione whimpering in panic was clutching her mouth 
 
 hermione 
 
 ron had hurried forward to see what was wrong with her harry turned and saw ron dragging hand away from her face it a pretty sight front teeth already larger than average were now growing at an alarming rate she was looking more and more like a beaver as her teeth elongated past her bottom lip toward her chin she felt them and let out a terrified cry 
 
 and what is all this noise about said a soft deadly voice 
 
 snape had arrived the slytherins clamored to give their explanations snape pointed a long yellow finger at malfoy and said explain 
 
 potter attacked me sir 
 
 we attacked each other at the same time harry shouted 
 
 and he hit goyle look 
 
 snape examined goyle whose face now resembled something that would have been at home in a book on poisonous fungi 
 
 hospital wing goyle snape said calmly 
 
 malfoy got hermione ron said look 
 
 he forced hermione to show snape her teeth she was doing her best to hide them with her hands though this was difficult as they had now grown down past her collar pansy parkinson and the other slytherin girls were doubled up with silent giggles pointing at hermione from behind back 
 
 snape looked coldly at hermione then said i see no difference 
 
 hermione let out a whimper her eyes filled with tears she turned on her heel and ran ran all the way up the corridor and out of sight 
 
 it was lucky perhaps that both harry and ron started shouting at snape at the same time lucky their voices echoed so much in the stone corridor for in the confused din it was impossible for him to hear exactly what they were calling him he got the gist however 
 
 see he said in his silkiest voice fifty points from gryffindor and a detention each for potter and weasley now get inside or be a worth of detentions 
 
 ears were ringing the injustice of it made him want to curse snape into a thousand slimy pieces he passed snape walked with ron to the back of the dungeon and slammed his bag down onto the table ron was shaking with anger too for a moment it felt as though everything was back to normal between them but then ron turned and sat down with dean and seamus instead leaving harry alone at his table on the other side of the dungeon malfoy turned his back on snape and pressed his badge smirking potter stinks flashed once more across the room 
 
 harry sat there staring at snape as the lesson began picturing horrific things happening to only he knew how to do the cruciatus have snape flat on his back like that spider jerking and twitching 
 
 antidotes said snape looking around at them all his cold black eyes glittering unpleasantly you should all have prepared your recipes now i want you to brew them carefully and then we will be selecting someone on whom to test one 
 
 eyes met and harry knew what was coming snape was going to poison him harry imagined picking up his cauldron and sprinting to the front of the class and bringing it down on greasy head and then a knock on the dungeon door burst in on thoughts 
 
 it was colin creevey he edged into the room beaming at harry and walked up to desk at the front of the room 
 
 yes said snape curtly 
 
 please sir supposed to take harry potter upstairs snape stared down his hooked nose at colin whose smile faded from his eager face 
 
 potter has another hour of potions to complete said snape coldly he will come upstairs when this class is finished 
 
 colin went pink 
 
 sir sir mr bagman wants him he said nervously all the champions have got to go i think they want to take photographs 
 
 harry would have given anything he owned to have stopped colin saying those last few words he chanced half a glance at ron but ron was staring determinedly at the ceiling 
 
 very well very well snape snapped potter leave your things here i want you back down here later to test your antidote 
 
 please sir got to take his things with him squeaked cohn all the champions 
 
 very well said snape potter take your bag and get out of my sight 
 
 harry swung his bag over his shoulder got up and headed for the door as he walked through the slytherin desks potter stinks flashed at him from every direction 
 
 amazing it harry said colin starting to speak the moment harry had closed the dungeon door behind him it though you being champion 
 
 yeah really amazing said harry heavily as they set off toward the steps into the entrance hall what do they want photos for colin 
 
 the daily prophet i think 
 
 great said harry dully exactly what i need more publicity 
 
 good luck said colin when they had reached the right room harry knocked on the door and entered 
 
 he was in a fairly small classroom most of the desks had been pushed away to the back of the room leaving a large space in the middle three of them however had been placed in front of the blackboard and covered with a long length of velvet five chairs had been set behind the desks and ludo bagman was sitting in one of them talking to a witch harry had never seen before who was wearing magenta robes 
 
 viktor krum was standing moodily in a corner as usual and not talking to anybody cedric and fheur were in conversation fheur looked a good deal happier than harry had seen her so far she kept throwing back her head so that her long silvery hair caught the light a paunchy man holding a large black camera that was smoking slightly was watching fleur out of the corner of his eye 
 
 bagman suddenly spotted harry got up quickly and bounded forward 
 
 ah here he is champion number four in you come harry in you comenothing to worry about just the wand weighing ceremony the rest of the judges will be here in a moment 
 
 wand weighing harry repeated nervously 
 
 we have to check that your wands are fully functional no problems you know as your most important tools in the tasks ahead said bagman the upstairs now with dumbledore and then going to be a little photo shoot this is rita skeeter he added gesturing toward the witch in magenta robes doing a small piece on the tournament for the daily prophet 
 
 maybe not that small ludo said rita skeeter her eyes on harry 
 
 her hair was set in elaborate and curiously rigid curls that contrasted oddly with her face she wore jeweled spectacles the thick fingers clutching her handbag ended in nails painted crimson 
 
 i wonder if i could have a little word with harry before we start she said to bagman but still gazing fixedly at harry the youngest champion you knowto add a bit of color 
 
 certainly cried bagman that is if harry has no objection 
 
 er said harry 
 
 lovely said rita skeeter and in a second her fingers had upper arm in a surprisingly strong grip and she was steering him out of the room again and opening a nearby door 
 
 we want to be in there with all that noise she said seeah yes this is nice and cozy 
 
 it was a broom cupboard harry stared at her 
 
 come along dear right lovely said rita skeeter again perching herself precariously upon an upturned bucket pushing harry down onto a cardboard box and closing the door throwing them into darkness see now 
 
 she unsnapped her handbag and pulled out a handful of candles which she lit with a wave of her wand and magicked into midair so that they could see what they were doing 
 
 you mind harry if i use a quill it leaves me free to talk to you normally 
 
 a what said harry 
 
 rita smile widened harry counted three gold teeth she reached again into her crocodile bag and drew out a long quill and a roll of parchment which she stretched out between them on a crate of mrs magical mess remover she put the tip of the green quill into her mouth sucked it for a moment with apparent relish then placed it upright on the parchment where it stood balanced on its point quivering slightly 
 
 testingmy name is rita skeeter daily prophet reporter 
 
 harry hooked down quickly at the quill the moment rita skeeter had spoken the green quill had started to scribble skidding across the parchment 
 
 attractive blonde rita skeeter savage quill has punctured many inflated reputations 
 lovely said rita skeeter yet again and she ripped the top piece of parchment off crumpled it up and stuffed it into her handbag now she leaned toward harry and said so harrywhat made you decide to enter the triwizard tournament 
 
 er said harry again but he was distracted by the quill even though he speaking it was dashing across the parchment and in its wake he could make out a fresh sentence 
 
 an ugly scar souvenier of a tragic past disfigures the otherwise charming face of harry potter whose eyes 
 ignore the quill harry said rita skeeter firmly reluctantly harry looked up at her instead now why did you decide to enter the tournament harry 
 
 i said harry i know how my name got into the goblet of fire i put it in there 
 
 rita skeeter raised one heavily penciled eyebrow 
 
 come now harry no need to be scared of getting into trouble we all know you really have entered at all but worry about that our readers hove a rebel 
 
 but i enter harry repeated i know who 
 
 how do you feel about the tasks ahead said rita skeeter excited nervous 
 
 i really thoughtyeah nervous i suppose said harry his insides squirmed uncomfortably as he spoke 
 
 champions have died in the past they said rita skeeter briskly have you thought about that at all 
 
 wellthey say going to be a lot safer this year said harry 
 
 the quill whizzed across the parchment between them back and forward as though it were skating 
 
 of course looked death in the face before you said rita skeeter watching him closely how would you say affected you 
 
 er said harry yet again 
 
 do you think that the trauma in your past might have made you keen to prove yourself to live up to your name do you think that perhaps you were tempted to enter the triwizard tournament because 
 
 i enter said harry starting to feel irritated 
 
 can you remember your parents at all said rita skeeter talking over him 
 
 no said harry 
 
 how do you think feel if they knew you were competing in the triwizard tournament proud worried angry 
 
 harry was feeling really annoyed now how on earth was he to know how his parents would feel if they were alive he could feel rita skeeter watching him very intently frowning he avoided her gaze and hooked down at words the quill had just written 
 
 tears fill those startlingly green eyes as our conversation turns to the parents he can barely remember 
 i have not got tears in my eyes said harry loudly 
 
 before rita skeeter could say a word the door of the broom cupboard was pulled open harry looked around blinking in the bright light albus dumbledore stood there looking down at both of them squashed into the cupboard 
 
 dumbledore cried rita skeeter with every appearance of delight but harry noticed that her quill and the parchment had suddenly vanished from the box of magical mess remover and clawed fingers were hastily snapping shut the clasp of her bag how are you she said standing up and holding out one of her large mannish hands to dumbledore i hope you saw my piece over the summer about the international confederation of wizards conference 
 
 enchantingly nasty said dumbledore his eyes twinkling i particularly enjoyed your description of me as an obsolete dingbat 
 
 rita skeeter look remotely abashed 
 
 i was just making the point that some of your ideas are a little dumbhedore and that many wizards in the street 
 
 i will be delighted to hear the reasoning behind the rudeness rita said dumbledore with a courteous bow and a smile but afraid we will have to discuss the matter later the weighing of the wands is about to start and it cannot take place if one of our champions is hidden in a broom cupboard 
 
 very glad to get away from rita skeeter harry hurried back into the room the other champions were now sitting in chairs near the door and he sat down quickly next to cedric hooking up at the table where four of the five judges were now sitting professor karkaroff madame maxime mr crouch and ludo bagman rita skeeter settled herself down in a corner harry saw her slip the parchment out of her bag again spread it on her knee suck the end of the quill and place it once more on the parchment 
 
 may i introduce mr ollivander said dumbledore taking his place at the judges table and talking to the champions he will be checking your wands to ensure that they are in good condition before the tournament 
 
 harry hooked around and with a jolt of surprise saw an old wizard with large pale eyes standing quietly by the window harry had met mr ollivander before he was the from whom harry had bought his own wand over three years ago in diagon alley 
 
 mademoiselle delacour could we have you first please said mr ollivander stepping into the empty space in the middle of the room 
 
 fleur delacour swept over to mr olhivander and handed him her wand 
 
 hmm he said 
 
 he twirled the wand between his long fingers like a baton and it emitted a number of pink and gold sparks then he held it chose to his eyes and examined it carefully 
 
 yes he said quietly nine and a half inchesinflexiblerosewoodand containingdear me 
 
 an air from ze ead of a veela said fleur one of my 
 
 so fleur was part veela thought harry making a mental note to tell ronthen he remembered that ron speaking to him 
 
 yes said mr ollivander yes never used veela hair myself of course i find it makes for rather temperamental wandshowever to each his own and if this suits you 
 
 mr ollivander ran his fingers along the wand apparently checking for scratches or bumps then he muttered orchideous and a bunch of flowers burst from the wand tip 
 
 very well very well in fine working order said mr ollivander scooping up the flowers and handing them to fleur with her wand mr diggory you next 
 
 fleur glided back to her seat smiling at cedric as he passed her 
 
 ah now this is one of mine it said mr ollivander with much more enthusiasm as cedric handed over his wand yes i remember it well containing a single hair from the tail of a particularly fine male unicornmust have been seventeen hands nearly gored me with his horn after i plucked his tail twelve and a quarter inchesashpleasantly springy in fine conditionyou treat it regularly 
 
 polished it last night said cedric grinning 
 
 harry hooked down at his own wand he could see finger marks all over it he gathered a fistful of robe from his knee and tried to rub it clean surreptitiously several gold sparks shot out of the end of it fleur delacour gave him a very patronizing look and he desisted 
 
 mr ollivander sent a stream of silver smoke rings across the room from the tip of wand pronounced himself satisfied and then said mr krum if you please 
 
 viktor krum got up and slouched and toward mr ollivander he thrust out his wand and stood scowling with his hands in the pockets of his robes 
 
 hmm said mr olhivander this is a gregorovitch creation unless much mistaken a fine though the styling is never quite what ihowever 
 
 he lifted the wand and examined it minutely turning it over and over before his eyes 
 
 yeshornbeam and dragon heartstring he shot at krum who nodded rather thicker than one usually seesquite rigidten and a quarter inchesavis 
 
 the hornbeam wand let off a blast hike a gun and a number of small twittering birds flew out of the end and through the open window into the watery sunlight 
 
 good said mr ollivander handing krum back his wand which leavesmr potter 
 
 harry got to his feet and walked past krum to mr ollivander he handed over his wand 
 
 aaaah yes said mr ohlivander his pale eyes suddenly gleaming yes yes yes how well i remember 
 
 harry could remember too he could remember it as though it had happened yesterday 
 
 four summers ago on his eleventh birthday he had entered mr shop with hagrid to buy a wand mr ollivander had taken his measurements and then started handing him wands to try harry had waved what felt like every wand in the shop until at last he had found the one that suited him this one which was made of holly eleven inches long and contained a single feather from the tail of a phoenix mr ollivander had been very surprised that harry had been so compatible with this wand curious he had said curious and not until harry asked what was curious had mr olhivander explained that the phoenix feather in wand had come from the same bird that had supplied the core of lord 
 
 harry had never shared this piece of information with anybody he was very fond of his wand and as far as he was concerned its relation to wand was something it help rather as he help being related to aunt petunia however he really hoped that mr ollivander about to tell the room about it he had a funny feeling rita quill might just explode with excitement if he did 
 
 mr ollivander spent much longer examining wand than anyone eventually however he made a fountain of wine shoot out of it and handed it back to harry announcing that it was still in perfect condition 
 
 thank you all said dumbledore standing up at the judges table you may go back to your lessons now or perhaps it would be quicker just to go down to dinner as they are about to end 
 
 feeling that at last something had gone right today harry got up to leave but the man with the black camera jumped up and cleared his throat 
 
 photos dumbledore photos cried bagman excitedly all the judges and champions what do you think rita 
 
 er yes do those first said rita skeeter whose eyes were upon harry again and then perhaps some individual shots 
 
 the photographs took a long time madame maxime cast everyone else into shadow wherever she stood and the photographer stand far enough back to get her into the frame eventually she had to sit while everyone else stood around her karkaroff kept twirling his goatee around his finger to give it an extra curl krum whom harry would have thought would have been used to this sort of thing skulked at the back of the group the photographer seemed keenest to get fleur at the front but rita skeeter kept hurrying forward and dragging harry into greater prominence then she insisted on separate shots of all the champions at last they were free to go 
 
 harry went down to dinner hermione there he supposed she was still in the hospital wing having her teeth fixed he ate alone at the end of the table then returned to gryffindor tower thinking of all the extra work on summoning charms that he had to do up in the dormitory he came across ron 
 
 had an owl said ron brusquely the moment he walked in he was pointing at pillow the school barn owl was waiting for him there 
 
 oh right said harry 
 
 and got to do our detentions tomorrow night dungeon said ron 
 
 he then walked straight out of the room not looking at harry for a moment harry considered going after him he sure whether he wanted to talk to him or hit him both seemed quite appealing but the lure of answer was too strong harry strode over to the barn owl took the letter off its leg and unrolled it 
 
 harry 
 i say everything i would like to in a letter too risky in case the owl is intercepted we need to talk can you ensure that you are alone by the fire in gryffindor tower at one in the morning on the nd ofnovember 
 i know better than anyone that you can look after yourself and while around dumbledore and moody i think anyone will be able to hurt you however someone seems to be having a good try entering you in that tournament would have been very risky especially right under nose 
 be on the watch harry i still want to hear about anything unusual let me know about the nd ofnovember as quickly as you can 
 sirius

 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire 
 

lionfish nov chapter eighteen armycontents prev chapter next chapter 
 umbridge has been reading your mail harry no other explanation 
 
 you think umbridge attacked hedwig he said outraged 
 
 almost certain of it said hermione grimly watch your frog escaping 
 
 harry pointed his wand at the bullfrog that had been hopping hopefully towards the other side of the tableaccio and it zoomed gloomily back into his hand 
 
 charms was always one of the best lessons in which to enjoy a private chat there was generally so much movement and activity that the danger of being overheard was very slight today with the room full of croaking bullfrogs and cawing ravens and with a heavy downpour of rain clattering and pounding against the classroom windows harry ron and whispered discussion about how umbridge had nearly caught sirius went quite unnoticed 
 
 been suspecting this ever since filch accused you of ordering dungbombs because it seemed such a stupid lie hermione whispered i mean once your letter had been read it would have been quite clear you ordering them so you have been in trouble at a bit of a feeble joke it but then i thought what if somebody just wanted an excuse to read your mail well then it would be a perfect way for umbridge to manage it tip off filch let him do the dirty work and confiscate the letter then either find a way of stealing it from him or else demand to see iti think filch would object he ever stuck up for a rights harry squashing your frog 
 
 harry looked down he was indeed squeezing his bullfrog so tightly its eyes were popping he replaced it hastily upon the desk 
 
 it was a very very close call last night said hermione i just wonder if umbridge knows how close it was silencio 
 
 the bullfrog on which she was practising her silencing charm was struck dumb and glared at her reproachfully 
 
 if caught snuffles 
 
 harry finished the sentence for her 
 
 probably be back in azkaban this morning he waved his wand without really concentrating his bullfrog swelled like a green balloon and emitted a whistle 
 
 silencio said hermione hastily pointing her wand at frog which deflated silently before them well he do it again all i just know how going to let him know we send him an owl 
 
 i reckon risk it again said ron not stupid he knows she nearly got him silencio 
 
 the large and ugly raven in front of him let out a derisive caw 
 
 silencio silencio 
 
 the raven cawed more loudly 
 
 the way moving your wand said hermione watching ron critically you want to wave it more a sharp jab 
 
 ravens are harder than frogs said ron through clenched teeth 
 
 fi ne swap said hermione seizing raven and replacing it with her own fat bullfrog silencio the raven continued to open and close its sharp beak but no sound came out 
 
 very good miss granger said professor squeaky little voice making harry ron and hermione all jump now let me see you try mr weasley 
 
 wha ohoh right said ron very flustered ersilencio 
 
 he jabbed at the bullfrog so hard he poked it in the eye the frog gave a deafening croak and leapt off the desk 
 
 it came as no surprise to any of them that harry and ron were given additional practice of the silencing charm for homework 
 
 they were allowed to remain inside over break due to the downpour outside they found seats in a noisy and overcrowded classroom on the first floor in which peeves was floating dreamily up near the chandelier occasionally blowing an ink pellet at the top of head they had barely sat down when angelina came struggling towards them through the groups of gossiping students 
 
 got permission she said to the quidditch team 
 
 excellent said ron and harry together 
 
 yeah said angelina beaming i went to mcgonagall and i think she might have appealed to dumbledore anyway umbridge had to give in ha so i want you down at the pitch at seven tonight all right because got to make up time you realise only three weeks away from our first match 
 
 she squeezed away from them narrowly dodged an ink pellet from peeves which hit a nearby instead and vanished from sight 
 
 smile slipped slightly as he looked out of the window which was now opaque with hammering rain 
 
 hope this clears up up with you hermione 
 
 she too was gazing at the window but not as though she really saw it her eyes were unfocused and there was a frown on her face 
 
 just thinking she said still frowning at the window 
 
 about siri snuffles said harry 
 
 no not exactly said hermione slowly more wondering i suppose doing the right thing i think we 
 
 harry and ron looked at each other 
 
 well that clears that up said ron it been really annoying if you explained yourself properly 
 
 hermione looked at him as though she had only just realised he was there 
 
 i was just wondering she said her voice stronger now whether doing the right thing starting this defence against the dark arts group 
 
 what said harry and ron together 
 
 hermione it was your idea in the first place said ron indignantly 
 
 i know said hermione twisting her fingers together but after talking to snuffles 
 
 but all for it said harry 
 
 yes said hermione staring at the window again yes what made me think maybe it a good idea after all 
 
 peeves floated over them on his stomach peashooter at the ready automatically all three of them lifted their bags to cover their heads until he had passed 
 
 get this straight said harry angrily as they put their bags back on the floor sirius agrees with us so you think we should do it any more 
 
 hermione looked tense and rather miserable now staring at her own hands she said do you honestly trust his judgement 
 
 yes i do said harry at once always given us great advice 
 
 an ink pellet whizzed past them striking katie bell squarely in the ear hermione watched katie leap to her feet and start throwing things at peeves it was a few moments before hermione spoke again and it sounded as though she was choosing her words very carefully 
 
 you think he has become sort of reckless since been cooped up in grimmauld place you think kind of living through us 
 
 what mean living through us harry retorted 
 
 i mean well i think love to be forming secret defence societies right under the nose of someone from the ministry i think really frustrated at how little he can do where he is so i think keen to kind of egg us on 
 
 ron looked utterly perplexed 
 
 sirius is right he said you do sound just like my mother 
 
 hermione bit her lip and did not answer the bell rang just as peeves swooped down on katie and emptied an entire ink bottle over her head 
 
 the weather did not improve as the day wore on so that at seven that evening when harry and ron went down to the quidditch pitch for practice they were soaked through within minutes their feet slipping and sliding on the sodden grass the sky was a deep thundery grey and it was a relief to gain the warmth and light of the changing rooms even if they knew the respite was only temporary they found fred and george debating whether to use one of their own skiving snackboxes to get out of flying 
 
 but i bet know what done fred said out of the corner of his mouth if only i offered to sell her some puking pastilles yesterday 
 
 we could try the fever fudge george muttered no seen that yet 
 
 does it work enquired ron hopefully as the hammering of rain on the roof intensified and wind howled around the building 
 
 well yeah said fred your go right up 
 
 but you get these massive boils too said george and we worked out how to get rid of them yet 
 
 i see any boils said ron staring at the twins 
 
 no well you said fred darkly not in a place we generally display to the public 
 
 but they make sitting on a broom a right pain in the 
 
 all right everyone listen up said angelina loudly emerging from the office i know not ideal weather but a chance be playing slytherin in conditions like this so a good idea to work out how going to cope with them harry you do something to your glasses to stop the rain fogging them up when we played hufflepuff in that storm 
 
 hermione did it said harry he pulled out his wand tapped his glasses and said impervius 
 
 i think we all ought to try that said angelina if we could just keep the rain off our faces it would really help visibilityall together come go 
 
 they all stowed their wands back in the inside pockets of their robes shouldered their brooms and followed angelina out of the changing rooms 
 
 they squelched through the deepening mud to the middle of the pitch visibility was still very poor even with the impervius charm light was fading fast and curtains of rain were sweeping the grounds 
 
 all right on my whistle shouted angelina 
 
 harry kicked off from the ground spraying mud in all directions and shot upwards the wind pulling him slightly off course 
 
 he had no idea how he was going to see the snitch in this weather he was having enough difficulty seeing the one bludger with which they were practising a minute into the practice it almost unseated him and he had to use the sloth grip roll to avoid it unfortunately angelina did not see this in fact she did not appear to be able to see anything none of them had a clue what the others were doing the wind was picking up even at a distance harry could hear the swishing pounding sounds of the rain pummelling the surface of the lake 
 
 angelina kept them at it for nearly an hour before conceding defeat she led her sodden and disgruntled team back into the changing rooms insisting that the practice had not been a waste of time though without any real conviction in her voice fred and george were looking particularly annoyed both were and winced with every movement harry could hear them complaining in low voices as he towelled his hair dry 
 
 i think a few of mine have ruptured said fred in a hollow voice 
 
 mine said george through clenched teeth throbbing like mad feel bigger if anything 
 
 ouch said harry 
 
 he pressed the towel to his face his eyes screwed tight with pain the scar on his forehead had seared again more painfully than it had in weeks 
 
 up said several voices 
 
 harry emerged from behind his towel the changing room was blurred because he was not wearing his glasses but he could still tell that face was turned towards him 
 
 nothing he muttered ipoked myself in the eye all 
 
 but he gave ron a significant look and the two of them hung back as the rest of the team filed back outside muffled in their cloaks their hats pulled low over their ears 
 
 what happened said ron the moment alicia had disappeared through the door was it your scar 
 
 harry nodded 
 
 but looking scared ron strode across to the window and stared out into the rain hehe be near us now can he 
 
 no harry muttered sinking on to a bench and rubbing his forehead probably miles away it hurt because angry 
 
 harry had not meant to say that at all and heard the words as though a stranger had spoken themyet knew at once that they were true he did not know how he knew it but he did voldemort wherever he was whatever he was doing was in a towering temper 
 
 did you see him said ron looking horrified did you get a vision or something 
 
 harry sat quite still staring at his feet allowing his mind and his memory to relax in the aftermath of the pain 
 
 a confused tangle of shapes a howling rush of voices 
 
 he wants something done and not happening fast enough he said 
 
 again he felt surprised to hear the words coming out of his mouth and yet was quite certain they were true 
 
 but how do you know said ron 
 
 harry shook his head and covered his eyes with his hands pressing down upon them with his palms little stars erupted in them he felt ron sit down on the bench beside him and knew ron was staring at him 
 
 is this what it was about last time said ron in a hushed voice when your scar hurt in office was angry 
 
 harry shook his head 
 
 what is it then 
 
 harry was thinking himself back he had been looking into face his scar had hurt and he had had that odd feeling in his stomach a strange leaping feeling a happy feeling but of course he had not recognised it for what it was as he had been feeling so miserable himself 
 
 last time it was because he was pleased he said really pleased he thought something good was going to happen and the night before we came back to hogwarts he thought back to the moment when his scar had hurt so badly in his and bedroom in grimmauld place he was furious 
 
 he looked round at ron who was gaping at him 
 
 you could take over from trelawney mate he said in an awed voice 
 
 not making prophecies said harry 
 
 no you know what doing ron said sounding both scared and impressed harry reading mind 
 
 no said harry shaking his head more like his mood i suppose just getting flashes of what mood in dumbledore said something like this was happening last year he said that when voldemort was near me or when he was feeling hatred i could tell well now feeling it when pleased too 
 
 there was a pause the wind and rain lashed at the building 
 
 got to tell someone said ron 
 
 i told sirius last time 
 
 well tell him about this time 
 
 can i said harry grimly umbridge is watching the owls and the fires remember 
 
 well then dumbledore 
 
 just told you he already knows said harry shortly getting to his feet taking his cloak off his peg and swinging it around him no point telling him again 
 
 ron did up the fastening of his own cloak watching harry thoughtfully 
 
 want to know he said 
 
 harry shrugged 
 
 still got silencing charms to practise 
 
 they hurried back through the dark grounds sliding and stumbling up the muddy lawns not talking harry was thinking hard what was it that voldemort wanted done that was not happening quickly enough 
 
 got other plans plans he can put into operation very quietly indeed stuff he can only get by stealth like a weapon something he have last time 
 
 harry had not thought about those words in weeks he had been too absorbed in what was going on at hogwarts too busy dwelling on the ongoing battles with umbridge the injustice of all the ministry interference but now they came back to him and made him wonder anger would make sense if he was no nearer to laying hands on the weapon whatever it was had the order thwarted him stopped him from seizing it where was it kept who had it now 
 
 mimbulus mimbletonia said voice and harry came back to his senses just in time to clamber through the portrait hole into the common room 
 
 it appeared that hermione had gone to bed early leaving crookshanks curled in a nearby chair and an assortment of knobbly knitted elf hats lying on a table by the fire harry was rather grateful that she was not around because he did not much want to discuss his scar hurting and have her urge him to go to dumbledore too ron kept throwing him anxious glances but harry pulled out his charms books and set to work on finishing his essay though he was only pretending to concentrate and by the time ron said he was going up to bed too he had written hardly anything 
 
 midnight came and went while harry was reading and rereading a passage about the uses of lovage and sneezewort and not taking in a word of it 
 
 these plantes are moste efficacious in the inflaming of the braine and are therefore much used in confusing and befuddlement draughts where the wizard is desirous of producing and recklessness 
 
 hermione said sirius was becoming reckless cooped up in grimmauld place 
 
 moste efficacious in the inflaming of the braine and are therefore much used 
 
 the daily prophet would think his brain was inflamed if they found out that he knew what voldemort was feeling 
 
 therefore much used in confusing and befuddlement draughts 
 
 confusing was the word all right why did he know what voldemort was feeling what was this weird connection between them which dumbledore had never been able to explain satisfactorily 
 
 where the wizard is desirous 
 
 how harry would like to sleep 
 
 of producing 
 
 it was warm and comfortable in his armchair before the fire with the rain still beating heavily on the windowpanes crookshanks purring and the crackling of the flames 
 
 the book slipped from slack grip and landed with a dull thud on the hearthrug his head lolled sideways 
 
 he was walking once more along a windowless corridor his footsteps echoing in the silence as the door at the end of the passage loomed larger his heart beat fast with excitement if he could only open it enter beyond 
 
 he stretched out his hand his fingertips were inches from it 
 
 harry potter sir 
 
 he awoke with a start the candles had all been extinguished in the common room but there was something moving close by 
 
 whozair said harry sitting upright in his chair the fire was almost out the room very dark 
 
 dobby has your owl sir said a squeaky voice 
 
 dobby said harry thickly peering through the gloom towards the source of the voice 
 
 dobby the was standing beside the table on which hermione had left half a dozen of her knitted hats his large pointed ears were now sticking out from beneath what looked like all the hats hermione had ever knitted he was wearing one on top of the other so that his head seemed elongated by two or three feet and on the very topmost bobble sat hedwig hooting serenely and obviously cured 
 
 dobby volunteered to return harry owl said the elf squeakily with a look of positive adoration on his face professor says she is all well now sir he sank into a deep bow so that his nose brushed the threadbare surface of the hearthrug and hedwig gave an indignant hoot and fluttered on to the arm of chair 
 
 thanks dobby said harry stroking head and blinking hard trying to rid himself of the image of the door in his dream it had been very vivid surveying dobby more closely he noticed that the elf was also wearing several scarves and innumerable socks so that his feet looked far too big for his body 
 
 er have you been taking all the clothes been leaving out 
 
 oh no sir said dobby happily dobby has been taking some for winky too sir 
 
 yeah how is winky asked harry 
 
 ears drooped slightly 
 
 winky is still drinking lots sir he said sadly his enormous round green eyes large as tennis balls downcast she still does not care for clothes harry potter nor do the other none of them will clean gryffindor tower any more not with the hats and socks hidden everywhere they finds them insulting sir dobby does it all himself sir but dobby does not mind sir for he always hopes to meet harry potter and tonight sir he has got his wish dobby sank into a deep bow again but harry potter does not seem happy dobby went on straightening up again and kicking timidly at harry dobby heard him muttering in his sleep was harry potter having bad dreams 
 
 not really bad said harry yawning and rubbing his eyes had worse 
 
 the elf surveyed harry out of his vast eyes then he said very seriously his ears drooping dobby wishes he could help harry potter for harry potter set dobby free and dobby is much much happier now 
 
 harry smiled 
 
 you help me dobby but thanks for the offer 
 
 he bent and picked up his potions book have to try to finish the essay tomorrow he closed the book and as he did so the firelight illuminated the thin white scars on the back of his handthe result of his detentions with umbridge 
 
 wait a moment there is something you can do for me dobby said harry slowly 
 
 the elf looked round beaming 
 
 name it harry potter sir 
 
 i need to find a place where people can practise defence against the dark arts without being discovered by any of the teachers especially harry clenched his hand on the book so that the scars shone pearly white professor umbridge 
 
 he expected the smile to vanish his ears to droop he expected him to say it was impossible or else that he would try to find somewhere but his hopes were not high what he had not expected was for dobby to give a little skip his ears waggling cheerfully and clap his hands together 
 
 dobby knows the perfect place sir he said happily dobby heard tell of it from the other when he came to hogwarts sir it is known by us as the come and go room sir or else as the room of requirement 
 
 why said harry curiously 
 
 because it is a room that a person can only enter said dobby seriously when they have real need of it sometimes it is there and sometimes it is not but when it appears it is always equipped for the needs dobby has used it sir said the elf dropping his voice and looking guilty when winky has been very drunk he has hidden her in the room of requirement and he has found antidotes to butterbeer there and a nice bed to settle her on while she sleeps it off sir and dobby knows mr filch has found extra cleaning materials there when he has run short sir and 
 
 and if you really needed a bathroom said harry suddenly remembering something dumbledore had said at the yule ball the previous christmas would it fill itself with chamber pots 
 
 dobby expects so sir said dobby nodding earnestly it is a most amazing room sir 
 
 how many people know about it said harry sitting up straight er in his chair 
 
 very few sir mostly people stumbles across it when they needs it sir but often they never finds it again for they do not know that it is always there waiting to be called into service sir 
 
 it sounds brilliant said harry his heart racing it sounds perfect dobby when can you show me where it is 
 
 any time harry potter sir said dobby looking delighted at enthusiasm we could go now if you like 
 
 for a moment harry was tempted to go with dobby he was halfway out of his seat intending to hurry upstairs for his invisibility cloak when not for the first time a voice very much like whispered in his ear was after all very late he was exhausted and had essay to finish 
 
 not tonight dobby said harry reluctantly sinking back into his chair this is really important i want to blow it need proper planning listen can you just tell me exactly where this room of requirement is and how to get in there 
 
 their robes billowed and swirled around them as they splashed across the flooded vegetable patch to double herbology where they could hardly hear what professor sprout was saying over the hammering of raindrops hard as hailstones on the greenhouse roof the care of magical creatures lesson was to be relocated from the grounds to a free classroom on the ground floor and to their intense relief angelina had sought out her team at lunch to tell them that quidditch practice was cancelled 
 
 good said harry quietly when she told him because found somewhere to have our first defence meeting tonight eight seventh floor opposite that tapestry of barnabas the barmy being clubbed by those trolls can you tell katie and alicia 
 
 she looked slightly taken aback but promised to tell the others harry returned hungrily to his sausages and mash when he looked up to take a drink of pumpkin juice he found hermione watching him 
 
 what he said thickly 
 
 well just that plans always that safe you remember when he lost you all the bones in your arm 
 
 this room just some mad idea of dumbledore knows about it too he mentioned it to me at the yule ball 
 
 expression cleared 
 
 dumbledore told you about it 
 
 just in passing said harry shrugging 
 
 oh well all right then said hermione briskly and raised no more objections 
 
 together with ron they had spent most of the day seeking out those people who had signed their names to the list in the head and telling them where to meet that evening somewhat to disappointment it was ginny who managed to find cho chang and her friend first however by the end of dinner he was confident that the news had been passed to every one of the people who had turned up in the head 
 
 at half past seven harry ron and hermione left the gryffindor common room harry clutching a certain piece of aged parchment in his hand were allowed to be out in the corridors until nine but all three of them kept looking around nervously as they made their way along the seventh floor 
 
 hold it harry warned unfolding the piece of parchment at the top of the last staircase tapping it with his wand and muttering i solemnly swear that i am up to no good 
 
 a map of hogwarts appeared on the blank surface of the parchment tiny black moving dots labelled with names showed where various people were 
 
 filch is on the second floor said harry holding the map close to his eyes and mrs norris is on the fourth 
 
 and umbridge said hermione anxiously 
 
 in her office said harry pointing ok go 
 
 they hurried along the corridor to the place dobby had described to harry a stretch of blank wall opposite an enormous tapestry depicting barnabas the foolish attempt to train trolls for the ballet 
 
 ok said harry quietly while a troll paused in his relentless clubbing of the ballet teacher to watch them dobby said to walk past this bit of wall three times concentrating hard on what we need 
 
 they did so turning sharply at the window just beyond the blank stretch of wall then at the vase on its other side ron had screwed up his eyes in concentration hermione was whispering something under her breath fists were clenched as he stared ahead of him 
 
 we need somewhere to learn to fight he thought just give us a place to practise somewhere they find us 
 
 harry said hermione sharply as they wheeled around after their third walk past 
 
 a highly polished door had appeared in the wall ron was staring at it looking slightly wary harry reached out seized the brass handle pulled open the door and led the way into a spacious room lit with flickering torches like those that illuminated the dungeons eight floors below 
 
 the walls were lined with wooden bookcases and instead of chairs the re were large silk cushions on the floor a set of shelves at the far end of the room carried a range of instruments such as sneakoscopes secrecy sensors and a large cracked that harry was sure had hung the previous year in the fake office 
 
 these will be good when practising stunning said ron enthusiastically prodding one of the cushions with his foot 
 
 and just look at these books said hermione excitedly running a finger along the spines of the large tomes a compendium of common curses and their the dark arts outsmarted spellwork wow she looked around at harry her face glowing and he saw that the presence of hundreds of books had finally convinced hermione that what they were doing was right harry this is wonderful everything we need here 
 
 and without further ado she slid jinxes for the jinxed from its shelf sank on to the nearest cushion and began to read 
 
 there was a gentle knock on the door harry looked round ginny neville lavender parvati and dean had arrived 
 
 whoa said dean staring around impressed what is this place 
 
 harry began to explain but before he had finished more people had arrived and he had to start all over again by the time eight arrived every cushion was occupied harry moved across to the door and turned the key protruding from the lock it clicked in a satisfyingly loud way and everybody fell silent looking at him hermione carefully marked her page of jinxes for the jinxed and set the book aside 
 
 well said harry slightly nervously this is the place found for practice sessions and found it ok 
 
 fantastic said cho and several people murmured their agreement 
 
 bizarre said fred frowning around at it we once hid from filch in here remember george but it was just a broom cupboard then 
 
 hey harry this stuff asked dean from the rear of the room indicating the sneakoscopes and the 
 
 dark detectors said harry stepping between the cushions to reach them basically they all show when dark wizards or enemies are around but you want to rely on them too much they can be fooled 
 
 he gazed for a moment into the cracked shadowy figures were moving around inside it though none was recognisable he turned his back on it 
 
 well been thinking about the sort of stuff we ought to do first ander he noticed a raised hand what hermione 
 
 i think we ought to elect a leader said hermione 
 
 leader said cho at once looking at hermione as though she were mad 
 
 stomach did yet another 
 
 yes but i think we ought to vote on it properly said hermione unperturbed it makes it formal and it gives him authority soeveryone who thinks harry ought to be our leader 
 
 everybody put up their hand even zacharias smith though he did it very 
 
 erright thanks said harry who could feel his face burning 
 
 i also think we ought to have a name she said brightly her hand still in the air it would promote a feeling of team spirit and unity you think 
 
 can we be the league said angelina hopefully 
 
 or the ministry of magic are morons group suggested fred 
 
 i was thinking said hermione frowning at fred more of a name that tell everyone what we were up to so we can refer to it safely outside meetings 
 
 the defence association said cho the da for short so nobody knows what talking about 
 
 yeah the good said ginny only make it stand for army because the worst fear it 
 
 there was a good deal of appreciative murmuring and laughter at this 
 
 all in favour of the da said hermione bossily kneeling up on her cushion to count a majoritymotion passed 
 
 she pinned the piece of parchment with all of their signatures on it on to the wall and wrote across the top in large letters 
 
 army 
 
 right said harry when she had sat down again shall we get practising then i was thinking the first thing we should do is expelliarmus you know the disarming charm i know pretty basic but found it really useful 
 
 oh please said zacharias smith rolling his eyes and folding his arms i think expelliarmus is exactly going to help us against do you 
 
 used it against him said harry quietly it saved my life in june 
 
 smith opened his mouth stupidly the rest of the room was very quiet 
 
 but if you think beneath you you can leave harry said 
 
 smith did not move nor did anybody else 
 
 ok said harry his mouth slightly drier than usual with all these eyes upon him i reckon we should all divide into pairs and practise 
 
 it felt very odd to be issuing instructions but not nearly as odd as seeing them followed everybody got to their feet at once and divided up predictably neville was left partnerless 
 
 you can practise with me harry told him righton the count of three thenone two three 
 
 the room was suddenly full of shouts of flew in all directions missed spells hit books on shelves and sent them flying into the air harry was too quick for neville whose wand went spinning out of his hand hit the ceiling in a shower of sparks and landed with a clatter on top of a bookshelf from which harry retrieved it with a summoning charm glancing around he thought he had been right to suggest they practise the basics first there was a lot of shoddy spellwork going on many people were not succeeding in disarming their opponents at all but merely causing them to jump backwards a few paces or wince as their feeble spell whooshed over them 
 
 expelliarmus said neville and harry caught unawares felt his wand fly out of his hand 
 
 i did it said neville gleefully never done it beforei did it 
 
 good one said harry encouragingly deciding not to point out that in a real duel opponent was unlikely to be staring in the opposite direction with his wand held loosely at his side listen neville can you take it in turns to practise with ron and hermione for a couple of minutes so i can walk around and see how the rest are doing 
 
 harry moved off into the middle of the room something very odd was happening to zacharias smith every time he opened his mouth to disarm anthony goldstein his own wand would fly out of his hand yet anthony did not seem to be making a sound harry did not have to look far to solve the mystery fred and george were several feet from smith and taking it in turns to point their wands at his back 
 
 sorry harry said george hastily when harry caught his eye resist 
 
 harry walked around the other pairs trying to correct those who were doing the spell wrong ginny was teamed with michael corner she was doing very well whereas michael was either very bad or unwilling to jinx her ernie macmillan was flourishing his wand unnecessarily giving his partner time to get in under his guard the creevey brothers were enthusiastic but erratic and mainly responsible for all the books leaping off the shelves around them luna lovegood was similarly patchy occasionally sending justin wand spinning out of his hand at other times merely causing his hair to stand on end 
 
 ok stop harry shouted stop stop 
 
 i need a whistle he thought and immediately spotted one lying on top of the nearest row of books he caught it up and blew hard everyone lowered their wands 
 
 that bad said harry but definite room for improvement zacharias smith glared at him try again 
 
 he moved off around the room again stopping here and there to make suggestions slowly the general performance improved 
 
 he avoided going near cho and her friend for a while but after walking twice around every other pair in the room felt he could not ignore them any longer 
 
 oh no said cho rather wildly as he approached mean expellimellius ioh sorry marietta 
 
 her sleeve had caught fire marietta extinguished it with her own wand and glared at harry as though it was his fault 
 
 you made me nervous i was doing all right before then cho told harry ruefully 
 
 that was quite good harry lied but when she raised her eyebrows he said well no it was lousy but i know you can do it properly i was watching from over there 
 
 she laughed her friend marietta looked at them rather sourly and turned away 
 
 mind her cho muttered she really want to be here but i made her come with me her parents have forbidden her to do anything that might upset umbridge you seeher mum works for the ministry 
 
 what about your parents asked harry 
 
 well forbidden me to get on the wrong side of umbridge too said cho drawing herself up proudly but if they think not going to fight after what happened to cedric 
 
 she broke off looking rather confused and an awkward silence fell between them terry wand went whizzing past ear and hit alicia spinnet hard on the nose 
 
 well my dad is very supportive of any action said luna lovegood proudly from just behind harry evidently she had been eavesdropping on his conversation while justin attempted to disentangle himself from the robes that had flown up over his head always saying believe anything of fudge i mean the number of goblins fudge has had assassinated and of course he uses the department of mysteries to develop terrible poisons which he secretly feeds to anybody who disagrees with him and then his umgubular slashkilter 
 
 ask harry muttered to cho as she opened her mouth looking puzzled she giggled 
 
 hey harry hermione called from the other end of the room have you checked the time 
 
 he looked down at his watch and was shocked to see it was already ten past nine which meant they needed to get back to their common rooms immediately or risk being caught and punished by filch for being out of bounds he blew his whistle everybody stopped shouting expelliarmus and the last couple of wands clattered to the floor 
 
 well that was pretty good said harry but overrun better leave it here same time same place next week 
 
 sooner said dean thomas eagerly and many people nodded in agreement 
 
 angelina however said quickly the quidditch about to start we need team practices too 
 
 say next wednesday night then said harry we can decide on additional meetings then come on better get going 
 
 he pulled out the map again and checked it carefully for signs of teachers on the seventh floor he let them all leave in threes and fours watching their tiny dots anxiously to see that they returned safely to their dormitories the hufflepuffs to the basement corridor that also led to the kitchens the ravenclaws to a tower on the west side of the castle and the gryffindors along the corridor to the fat portrait 
 
 that was really really good harry said hermione when finally it was just her harry and ron who were left 
 
 yeah it was said ron enthusiastically as they slipped out of the door and watched it melt back into stone behind them did you see me disarm hermione harry 
 
 only once said hermione stung i got you loads more than you got me 
 
 i did not only get you once i got you at least three times 
 
 well if counting the one where you tripped over your own feet and knocked the wand out of my hand 
 
 they argued all the way back to the common room but harry was not listening to them he had one eye on the map but he was also thinking of cho saying he made her nervous 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix
