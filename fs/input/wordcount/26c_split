lionfish nov chapter the second taskcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 you said already worked out that egg clue said hermione indignantly 
 
 keep your voice down said harry crossly i just need to sort of it all right 
 
 he ron and hermione were sitting at the very back of the charms class with a table to themselves they were supposed to be practicing the opposite of the summoning charm today the banishing charm owing to the potential for nasty accidents when objects kept flying across the room professor flitwick had given each student a stack of cushions on which to practice the theory being that these hurt anyone if they went off target it was a good theory but it working very well aim was so poor that he kept accidentally sending much heavier things flying across the room professor flitwick for instance 
 
 just forget the egg for a minute all right harry hissed as professor flitwick went whizzing resignedly past them landing on top of a large cabinet trying to tell you about snape and moody 
 
 this class was an ideal cover for a private conversation as everyone was having far too much fun to pay them any attention harry had been recounting his adventures of the previous night in whispered installments for the last half hour 
 
 snape said searched his office as well ron whispered his eyes alight with interest as he banished a cushion with a sweep of his wand it soared into the air and knocked hat off reckon here to keep an eye on snape as well as karkaroff 
 
 well i dunno if what dumbledore asked him to do but definitely doing it said harry waving his wand without paying much attention so that his cushion did an odd sort of belly flop off the desk moody said dumbledore only lets snape stay here because giving him a second chance or something 
 
 what said ron his eyes widening his next cushion spinning high into the air ricocheting off the chandelier and dropping heavily onto desk harrymaybe moody thinks snape put your name in the goblet of fire 
 
 oh ron said hermione shaking her head sceptically we thought snape was trying to kill harry before and it turned out he was saving life remember 
 
 she banished a cushion and it flew across the room and landed in the box they were all supposed to be aiming at harry looked at hermione thinkingit was true that snape had saved his life once but the odd thing was snape definitely loathed him just as loathed father when they had been at school together snape loved taking points from harry and had certainly never missed an opportunity to give him punishments or even to suggest that he should be suspended from the school 
 
 i care what moody says hermione went on not stupid he was right to trust hagrid and professor lupin even though loads of people have given them jobs so why he be right about snape even if snape is a bit 
 
 evil said ron promptly come on hermione why are all these dark wizard catchers searching his office then 
 
 why has mr crouch been pretending to be ill said hermione ignoring ron its a bit funny it that he cant manage to come to the yule ball but he can get up here in the middle of the night when he wants to 
 
 you just like crouch because of that elf winky said ron sending a cushion soaring into the window 
 
 you just want to think up to something said hermione sending her cushion zooming neatly into the box 
 
 i just want to know what snape did with his first chance if on his second one said harry grimly and his cushion to his very great surprise flew straight across the room and landed neatly on top of 
 
 
 
 obedient to wish of hearing about anything odd at hogwarts harry sent him a letter by brown owl that night explaining all about mr crouch breaking into office and moody and conversation then harry turned his attention in earnest to the most urgent problem facing him how to survive underwater for an hour on the of february 
 
 ron quite liked the idea of using the summoning charm again harry had explained about and ron see why harry summon one from the nearest muggle town hermione squashed this plan by pointing out that in the unlikely event that harry managed to learn how to operate an within the set limit of an hour he was sure to be disqualified for breaking the international code of wizarding secrecy it was too much to hope that no muggles would spot an zooming across the countryside to hogwarts 
 
 of course the ideal solution would be for you to transfigure yourself into a submarine or something hermione said if only done human transfiguration already but i think we start that until sixth year and it can go badly wrong if you know what doing 
 
 yeah i fancy walking around with a periscope sticking out of my head said harry i i could always attack someone in front of moody he might do it for me 
 
 i think let you choose what you wanted to be turned into though said hermione seriously no i think your best chance is some sort of charm 
 
 so harry thinking that he would soon have had enough of the library to last him a lifetime buried himself once more among the dusty volumes looking for any spell that might enable a human to survive without oxygen however though he ron and hermione searched through their lunchtimes evenings and whole weekends though harry asked professor mcgonagall for a note of permission to use the restricted section and even asked the irritable librarian madam pince for help they found nothing whatsoever that would enable harry to spend an hour underwater and live to tell the tale 
 
 familiar flutterings of panic were starting to disturb harry now and he was finding it difficult to concentrate in class again the lake which harry had always taken for granted as just another feature of the grounds drew his eyes whenever he was near a classroom window a great mass of chilly water whose dark and icy depths were starting to seem as distant as the moon 
 
 just as it had before he faced the horntail time was slipping away as though somebody had bewitched the clocks to go there was a week to go before february the there was still were five days to go he was bound to find something days to go please let me find somethingplease 
 
 with two days left harry started to go off food again the only good thing about breakfast on monday was the return of the brown owl he had sent to sirius he pulled off the parchment unrolled it and saw the shortest letter sirius had ever written to him 
 
 send date of next hogsmeade weekend by return owl 
 harry turned the parchment over and looked at the back hoping to see something else but it was blank 
 
 weekend after next whispered hermione who had read the note over shoulder here take my quill and send this owl back straight away 
 
 harry scribbled the dates down on the back of letter tied it onto the brown leg and watched it take flight again what had he expected advice on how to survive underwater he had been so intent on telling sirius all about snape and moody he had completely forgotten to mention the clue 
 
 he want to know about the next hogsmeade weekend for said ron 
 
 dunno said harry dully the momentary happiness that had flared inside him at the sight of the owl had died come oncare of magical creatures 
 
 whether hagrid was trying to make up for the skrewts or because there were now only two skrewts left or because he was trying to prove he could do anything that professor could harry didnt know but hagrid had been continuing her lessons on unicorns ever since returned to work it turned out that hagrid knew quite as much about unicorns as he did about monsters though it was clear that he found their lack of poisonous fangs disappointing 
 
 today he had managed to capture two unicorn foals unlike unicorns they were pure gold parvati and lavender went into transports of delight at the sight of them and even pansy parkinson had to work hard to conceal how much she liked them 
 
 easier ter spot than the adults hagrid told the class they turn silver when abou two years old an they grow horns at aroun four don go pure white till full grown round about seven a bit more trustin when babiesdon mind boys so move in a bit yeh can pat em if yeh wantgive em a few o these sugar lumps 
 
 you okay harry hagrid muttered moving aside slightly while most of the others swarmed around the baby unicorns 
 
 yeah said harry jus nervous eh said hagrid 
 
 bit said harry 
 
 harry said hagrid clapping a massive hand on his shoulder so that knees buckled under its weight bin worried before i saw yeh take on tha horntail but i know now yeh can do anythin yeh set yer mind ter not worried at all goin ter be fine got yer clue worked out haven yeh 
 
 harry nodded but even as he did so an insane urge to confess that he have any idea how to survive at the bottom of the lake for an hour came over him he looked up at hagrid perhaps he had to go into the lake sometimes to deal with the creatures in it he looked after everything else on the grounds after all 
 
 goin ter win hagrid growled patting shoulder again so that harry actually felt himself sink a couple of inches into the soft ground i know it i can feel it goin ter win harry 
 
 harry just bring himself to wipe the happy confident smile off face pretending he was interested in the young unicorns he forced a smile in return and moved forward to pat them with the others 
 
 
 
 by the evening before the second task harry felt as though he were trapped in a nightmare he was fully aware that even if by some miracle he managed to find a suitable spell have a real job mastering it overnight how could he have let this happen why he got to work on the clue sooner why had he ever let his mind wander in class what if a teacher had once mentioned how to breathe underwater 
 
 he sat with hermione and ron in the library as the sun set outside tearing feverishly through page after page of spells hidden from one another by the massive piles of books on the desk in front of each of them heart gave a huge leap every time he saw the word water on a page but more often than not it was merely take two pints of water half a pound of shredded mandrake leaves and a newt 
 
 i reckon it can be done said voice flatly from the other side of the table nothing nothing closest was that thing to dry up puddles and ponds that drought charm but that was nowhere near powerful enough to drain the lake 
 
 there must be something hermione muttered moving a candle closer to her her eyes were so tired she was poring over the tiny print of olde and forgotten bewitchments and charmes with her nose about an inch from the page never have set a task that was undoable 
 
 they have said ron harry just go down to the lake tomorrow right stick your head in yell at the merpeople to give back whatever nicked and see if they chuck it out best you can do mate 
 
 a way of doing it hermione said crossly there just has to be 
 
 she seemed to be taking the lack of useful information on the subject as a personal insult it had never failed her before 
 
 i know what i should have done said harry resting on saucy tricks for tricky sorts i learned to be an animagus like sirius 
 
 an animagus was a wizard who could transform into an animal 
 
 yeah you turned into a goldfish any time you wanted said ron 
 
 or a frog yawned harry he was exhausted it takes years to become an animagus and then you have to register yourself and everything said hermione vaguely now squinting down the index of weird wizarding dilemmas and their solutions professor mcgonagall told us got to register yourself with the improper use of magic officewhat animal you become and your markings so you abuse it 
 
 hermione i was joking said harry wearily i know i got a chance of turning into a frog by tomorrow morning 
 
 oh this is no use hermione said snapping shut weird wizarding dilemmas who on earth wants to make their nose hair grow into ringlets 
 
 i mind said fred voice be a talking point it 
 
 harry ron and hermione looked up fred and george had just emerged from behind some bookshelves 
 
 you two doing here ron asked 
 
 looking for you said george mcgonagall wants you ron and you hermione 
 
 why said hermione looking surprised 
 
 dunnoshe was looking a bit grim though said fred 
 
 supposed to take you down to her office said george 
 
 ron and hermione stared at harry who felt his stomach drop was professor mcgonagall about to tell ron and hermione off perhaps noticed how much they were helping him when he ought to be working out how to do the task alone 
 
 meet you back in the common room hermione told harry as she got up to go with ron both of them looked very anxious bring as many of these books as you can okay 
 
 right said harry uneasily 
 
 by eight madam pince had extinguished all the lamps and came to chivvy harry out of the library staggering under the weight of as many books as he could carry harry returned to the gryffindor common room pulled a table into a corner and continued to search there was nothing in madcap magic for wacky warlocksnothing in a guide to medieval sorcerynot one mention of underwater exploits in an anthology of charms or in dreadful denizens of the deep or powers you never knew you had and what to do with them now wised up 
 
 crookshanks crawled into lap and curled up purring deeply the common room emptied slowly around harry people kept wishing him luck for the next morning in cheery confident voices like all of them apparently convinced that he was about to pull off another stunning performance like the one he had managed in the first task harry answer them he just nodded feeling as though there were a golfball stuck in his throat by ten to midnight he was alone in the room with crookshanks he had searched all the remaining books and ron and hermione had not come back 
 
 over he told himself you do it just have to go down to the lake in the morning and tell the judges 
 
 he imagined himself explaining that he do the task he pictured look of surprise karkaroffs satisfied smile he could almost hear fleur delacour saying i knew is too young e is only a little boy he saw malfoy flashing his potter stinks badge at the front of the crowd saw crestfallen disbelieving face 
 
 forgetting that crookshanks was on his lap harry stood up very suddenly crookshanks hissed angrily as he landed on the floor gave harry a disgusted look and stalked away with his bottlebrush tail in the air but harry was already hurrying up the spiral staircase to his would grab the invisibility cloak and go back to the library stay there all night if he had to 
 
 lumos harry whispered fifteen minutes later as he opened the library door 
 
 wand tip alight he crept along the bookshelves pulling down more books books of hexes and charms books on merpeople and water monsters books on famous witches and wizards on magical inventions on anything at all that might include one passing reference to underwater survival he carried them over to a table then set to work searching them by the narrow beam of his wand occasionally checking his watch 
 
 one in the morningtwo in the morningthe only way he could keep going was to tell himself over and over again next bookin the next onethe next one 
 
 
 
 the mermaid in the painting in the prefects bathroom was laughing harry was bobbing like a cork in bubbly water next to her rock while she held his firebolt over his head 
 
 come and get it she giggled maliciously come on jump 
 
 i harry panted snatching at the firebolt and struggling not to sink give it to me 
 
 but she just poked him painfully in the side with the end of the broomstick laughing at him 
 
 that hurts get off ouch 
 
 harry potter must wake up sir 
 
 stop poking me 
 
 dobby must poke harry potter sir he must wake up 
 
 harry opened his eyes he was still in the library the invisibility cloak had slipped off his head as slept and the side of his face was stuck to the pages of where a wand a way he sat up straightening his glasses blinking in the bright daylight 
 
 harry potter needs to hurry squeaked dobby the second task starts in ten minutes and harry potter 
 
 ten minutes harry croaked ten ten minutes 
 
 he looked down at his watch dobby was right it was twenty past nine a large dead weight seemed to fall through chest into his stomach 
 
 hurry harry potter squeaked dobby plucking at sleeve you is supposed to be down by the lake with the other champions sir 
 
 too late dobby harry said hopelessly not doing the task i know how 
 
 harry potter will do the task squeaked the elf dobby knew harry had not found the right book so dobby did it for him 
 
 what said harry but you know what the second task is 
 
 dobby knows sir harry potter has to go into the lake and find his wheezy 
 
 find my what 
 
 and take his wheezy back from the merpeople 
 
 a wheezy 
 
 your wheezy sir your who is giving dobby his sweater 
 
 dobby plucked at the shrunken maroon sweater he was now wearing over his shorts 
 
 what harry gasped got ron 
 
 the thing harry potter will miss most sir squeaked dobby but past an hour 
 
 the black harry recited staring at the elf too late gone it come back dobby i got to do 
 
 you has to eat this sir squeaked the elf and he put his hand in the pocket of his shorts and drew out a ball of what looked like slimy rat tails right before you go into the lake sir gillyweed 
 
 it do said harry staring at the gillyweed 
 
 it will make harry potter breathe underwater sir 
 
 dobby said harry frantically listen are you sure about this 
 
 he quite forget that the last time dobby had tried to help him he had ended up with no bones in his right arm 
 
 dobby is quite sure sir said the elf earnestly dobby hears things sir he is a he goes all over the castle as he lights the fires and mops the floors dobby heard professor mcgonagall and professor moody in the staffroom talking about the next cannot let harry potter lose his wheezy 
 
 doubts vanished jumping to his feet he pulled off the invisibility cloak stuffed it into his bag grabbed the gillyweed and put it into his pocket then tore out of the library with dobby at his heels 
 
 dobby is supposed to be in the kitchens sir dobby squealed as they burst into the corridor dobby will be missed good luck harry potter sir good luck 
 
 see you later dobby harry shouted and he sprinted along the corridor and down the stairs three at a time 
 
 the entrance hall contained a few stragglers all leaving the great hall after breakfast and heading through the double oak doors to watch the second task they stared as harry flashed past sending colin and dennis creevey flying as he leapt down the stone steps and out onto the bright chilly grounds 
 
 as he pounded down the lawn he saw that the seats that had encircled the dragons enclosure in november were now ranged along the opposite bank rising in stands that were packed to the bursting point and reflected in the lake below the excited babble of the crowd echoed strangely across the water as harry ran around the other side of the lake toward the judges who were sitting at another table at the edge cedric fleur and krum were beside the judges table watching harry sprint toward them 
 
 harry panted skidding to a halt in the mud and accidentally splattering robes 
 
 where have you been said a bossy disapproving voice the about to start 
 
 harry looked around percy weasley was sitting at the judges table mr crouch had failed to turn up again 
 
 now now percy said ludo bagman who was looking intensely relieved to see harry let him catch his breath 
 
 dumbledore smiled at harry but karkaroff and madame maxime look at all pleased to see was obvious from the looks on their faces that they had thought he going to turn up 
 
 harry bent over hands on his knees gasping for breath he had a stitch in his side that felt as though he had a knife between his ribs but there was no time to get rid of it ludo bagman was now moving among the champions spacing them along the bank at intervals of ten feet harry was on the very end of the line next to krum who was wearing swimming trunks and was holding his wand ready 
 
 all right harry bagman whispered as he moved harry a few feet farther away from krum know what going to do 
 
 yeah harry panted massaging his ribs 
 
 bagman gave shoulder a quick squeeze and returned to the judges table he pointed his wand at his throat as he had done at the world cup said sonorus and his voice boomed out across the dark water toward the stands 
 
 well all our champions are ready for the second task which will start on my whistle they have precisely an hour to recover what has been taken from them on the count of three then onetwothree 
 
 the whistle echoed shrilly in the cold still air the stands erupted with cheers and applause without looking to see what the other champions were doing harry pulled off his shoes and socks pulled the handful of gillyweed out of his pocket stuffed it into his mouth and waded out into the lake 
 
 it was so cold he felt the skin on his legs searing as though this were fire not icy water his sodden robes weighed him down as he walked in deeper now the water was over his knees and his rapidly numbing feet were slipping over silt and flat slimy stones he was chewing the gillyweed as hard and fast as he could it felt unpleasantly slimy and rubbery like octopus tentacles in the freezing water he stopped swallowed and waited for something to happen 
 
 he could hear laughter in the crowd and knew he must look stupid walking into the lake without showing any sign of magical power the part of him that was still dry was covered in goose pimples half immersed in the icy water a cruel breeze lifting his hair harry started to shiver violently he avoided looking at the stands the laughter was becoming louder and there were catcalls and jeering from the slytherins 
 
 then quite suddenly harry felt as though an invisible pillow had been pressed over his mouth and nose he tried to draw breath but it made his head spin his lungs were empty and he suddenly felt a piercing pain on either side of his neck 
 
 harry clapped his hands around his throat and felt two large slits just below his ears flapping in the cold had gills without pausing to think he did the only thing that made sense he flung himself forward into the water 
 
 the first gulp of icy lake water felt like the breath of life his head had stopped spinning he took another great gulp of water and felt it pass smoothly through his gills sending oxygen back to his brain he stretched out his hands in front of him and stared at them they looked green and ghostly under the water and they had become webbed he twisted around and looked at his bare feet they had become elongated and the toes were webbed too it looked as though he had sprouted flippers 
 
 the water feel icy anymore eitheron the contrary he felt pleasantly cool and very struck out once more marveling at how far and fast his feet propelled him through the vater and noticing how clearly he could see and how he no longer seemed to need to blink he had soon swum so far into the lake that he could no longer see the bottom he flipped over and dived into its depths 
 
 silence pressed upon his ears as he soared over a strange dark foggy landscape he could only see ten feet around him so that as he sped throuugh the water new scenes seemed to loom suddenly out of the incoming darkness forests of rippling tangled black weed wide plains of mud littered with dull glimmering stones he swam deeper and deeper out toward the middle of the lake his eyes wide staring through the eerily water around him to the shadow beyond where the water became opaque 
 
 small fish flickered past him like silver darts once or twice he thought he saw something larger moving ahead of him but when he got nearer he discovered it to be nothing but a large blackened log or a dense clump of weed there was no sign of any of the other champions merpeople ron nor thankfully the giant squid 
 
 light green weed stretched ahead of him as far as he could see two feet deep like a meadow of very overgrown grass harry was staring unblinkingly ahead of him trying to discern shapes through the gloomand then without warning something grabbed hold of his ankle 
 
 harry twisted his body around and saw a grindylow a small horned water demon poking out of the weed its long fingers clutched tightly around leg its pointed fangs bared harry stuck his webbed hand quickly inside his robes and fumbled for his wand by the time he had grasped it two more grindylows had risen out of the weed had seized handfuls of robes and were attempting to drag him down 
 
 relashio harry shouted except that no sound came large bubble issued from his mouth and his wand instead of sending sparks at the grindylows pelted them with what seemed to be a jet of boiling water for where it struck them angry red patches appeared on their green skin harry pulled his ankle out of the grindylows grip and swam as fast as he could occasionally sending more jets of hot water over his shoulder at random every now and then he felt one of the grindylows snatch at his foot again and he kicked out hard finally he felt his foot connect with a horned skull and looking back saw the dazed grindylow floating away while its fellows shook their fists at harry and sank back into the weed 
 
 harry slowed down a little slipped his wand back inside his robes and looked around listening again he turned full circle in the water the silence pressing harder than ever against his eardrums he knew he must be even deeper in the lake now but nothing was moving but the rippling weed 
 
 how are you getting on 
 
 harry thought he was having a heart attack he whipped around and saw moaning myrtle floating hazily in front of him gazing at him through her thick pearly glasses 
 
 myrtle harry tried to shout but once again nothing came out of his mouth but a very large bubble moaning myrtle actually giggled 
 
 you want to try over there she said pointing i come with like them much they always chase me when i get too close 
 
 harry gave her the to show his thanks and set off once more careful to swim a bit higher over the weed to avoid any more grindylows that might be lurking there 
 
 he swam on for what felt like at least twenty minutes he was passing over vast expanses of black mud now which swirled murkily as he disturbed the water then at long last he heard a snatch of haunting mersong 
 
 an hour long have to look 
 and to recover what we took 
 harry swam faster and soon saw a large rock emerge out of the muddy water ahead it had paintings of merpeople on it they were carrying spears and chasing what looked like the giant squid harry swam on past the rock following the mersong 
 
 your half gone so tarry not 
 lest what you seek stays here to rot 
 a cluster of crude stone dwellings stained with algae loomed suddenly out of the gloom on all sides here and there at the dark windows harry saw facesfaces that bore no resemblance at all to the painting of the mermaid in the prefects bathroom 
 
 the merpeople had grayish skin and long wild dark green hair their eyes were yellow as were their broken teeth and they wore thick ropes of pebbles around their necks they leered at harry as he swam past one or two of them emerged from their caves to watch him better their powerful silver fish tails beating the water spears clutched in their hands 
 
 harry sped on staring around and soon the dwellings became more numerous there were gardens of weed around some of them and he even saw a pet grindylow tied to a stake outside one door merpeople were emerging on all sides now watching him eagerly pointing at his webbed hands and gills talking behind their hands to one another harry sped around a corner and a very strange sight met his eyes 
 
 a whole crowd of merpeople was floating in front of the houses that lined what looked like a of a village square a choir of merpeople was singing in the middle calling the champions toward them and behind them rose a crude sort of statue a gigantic merperson hewn from a boulder four people were bound tightly to the tail of the stone merperson 
 
 ron was tied between hermione and cho chang there was also a girl who looked no older than eight whose clouds of silvery hair made harry feel sure that she was fleur sister all four of them appeared to be in a very deep sleep their heads were lolling onto their shoulders and fine streams of bubbles kept issuing from their mouths 
 
 harry sped toward the hostages half expecting the merpeople to lower their spears and charge at him but they did nothing the ropes of weed tying the hostages to the statue were thick slimy and very strong for a fleeting second he thought of the knife sirius had bought him for christmas locked in his trunk in the castle a quarter of a mile away no use to him whatsoever 
 
 he looked around many of the merpeople surrounding them were carrying spears he swam swiftly toward a merman with a long green beard and a choker of shark fangs and tried to mime a request to borrow the spear the merman laughed and shook his head 
 
 we do not help he said in a harsh croaky voice 
 
 come on harry said fiercely but only bubbles issued from his mouth and he tried to pull the spear away from the merman but the merman yanked it back still shaking his head and laughing 
 
 harry swirled around staring about something sharpanything 
 
 there were rocks littering the lake bottom he dived and snatched up a particularly jagged one and returned to the statue he began to hack at the ropes binding ron and after several minutes hard work they broke apart ron floated unconscious a few inches above the lake bottom drifting a little in the ebb of the water 
 
 harry looked around there was no sign of any of the other champions what were they playing at why they hurry up he turned back to hermione raised the jagged rock and began to hack at her bindings too 
 
 at once several pairs of strong gray hands seized him half a dozen mermen were pulling him away from hermione shaking their heads and laughing 
 
 you take your own hostage one of them said to him leave the others 
 
 no way said harry furiously but only two large bubbles came out 
 
 your task is to retrieve your own friendleave the others 
 
 my friend too harry yelled gesturing toward hermione an enormous silver bubble emerging soundlessly from his lips and i want them to die either 
 
 head was on shoulder the small girl was ghostly green and pale harry struggled to fight off the mermen but they laughed harder than ever holding him back harry looked wildly around where were the other champions would he have time to take ron to the surface and come back down for hermione and the others would he be able to find them again he looked down at his watch to see how much time was left it had stopped working 
 
 but then the merpeople around him pointed excitedly over his head harry looked up and saw cedric swimming toward them there was an enormous bubble around his head which made his features look oddly wide and stretched 
 
 got lost he mouthed looking fleur and coming now 
 
 feeling enormously relieved harry watched cedric pull a knife out of his pocket and cut cho free he pulled her upward and out of sight 
 
 harry looked around waiting where were fleur and krum time was getting short and according to the song the hostages would be lost after an hour 
 
 the merpeople started screeching animatedly those holding harry loosened their grip staring behind them harry turned and saw something monstrous cutting through the water toward them a human body in swimming trunks with the head of a was krum he appeared to have transfigured himself but badly 
 
 the swam straight to hermione and began snapping and biting at her ropes the trouble was that new teeth were positioned very awkwardly for biting anything smaller than a dolphin and harry was quite sure that if krum careful he was going to rip hermione in half darting forward harry hit krum hard on the shoulder and held up the jagged stone krum seized it and began to cut hermione free within seconds he had done it he grabbed hermione around the waist and without a backward glance began to rise rapidly with her toward the surface 
 
 now what harry thought desperately if he could be sure that fleur was still no sign there was nothing to be done except 
 
 he snatched up the stone which krum had dropped but the mermen now closed in around ron and the little girl shaking their heads at him harry pulled out his wand 
 
 get out of the way 
 
 only bubbles flew out of his mouth but he had the distinct impression that the mermen had understood him because they suddenly stopped laughing their yellowish eyes were fixed upon wand and they looked scared there might be a lot more of them than there were of him but harry could tell by the looks on their faces that they knew no more magic than the giant squid did 
 
 got until three harry shouted a great stream of bubbles burst from him but he held up three fingers to make sure they got the message one he put down a finger put down a second one 
 
 they scattered harry darted forward and began to hack at the ropes binding the small girl to the statue and at last she was free he seized the little girl around the waist grabbed the neck of robes and kicked off from the bottom 
 
 it was very slow work he could no longer use his webbed hands to propel himself forward he worked his flippers furiously but ron and sister were like sacks dragging him back fixed his eyes skyward though he knew he must still be very deep the water above him was so dark 
 
 merpeople were rising with him he could see them swirling around him with ease watching him struggle through the they pull him back down to the depths when the time was up did they perhaps eat humans legs were seizing up with the effort to keep swimming his shoulders were aching horribly with the effort of dragging ron and the girl 
 
 he was drawing breath with extreme difficulty he could feel pain on the sides of his neck againhe was becoming very aware of how wet the water was in his mouthyet the darkness was definitely thinning nowhe could see daylight above him 
 
 he kicked hard with his flippers and discovered that they were nothing more than feetwater was flooding through his mouth into his lungshe was starting to feel dizzy but he knew light and air were only ten feet above himhe had to get therehe had to 
 
 harry kicked his legs so hard and fast it felt as though his muscles were screaming in protest his very brain felt waterlogged he breathe he needed oxygen he had to keep going he could not stop 
 
 and then he felt his head break the surface of the lake wonderful cold clear air was making his wet face sting he gulped it down feeling as though he had never breathed properly before and panting pulled ron and the little girl up with him all around him wild heads were emerging out of the water with him but they were smiling at him 
 
 the crowd in the stands was making a great deal of noise shouting and screaming they all seemed to be on their feet harry had the impression they thought that ron and the little girl might be dead but they were wrongboth of them had opened their eyes the girl looked scared and confused but ron merely expelled a great spout of water blinked in the bright light turned to harry and said wet this it then he spotted sister what did you bring her for 
 
 fleur turn up i leave her harry panted 
 
 harry you prat said ron you take that song thing seriously did you dumbledore have let any of us drown 
 
 the song said 
 
 it was only to make sure you got back inside the time limit said ron i hope you waste time down there acting the hero 
 
 harry felt both stupid and annoyed it was all very well for ron been asleep he felt how eerie it was down in the lake surrounded by merpeople looked more than capable of murder 
 
 harry said shortly help me with her i think she can swim very well 
 
 they pulled sister through the water back toward the bank where the judges stood watching twenty merpeople accompanying them like a guard of honor singing their horrible screechy songs 
 
 harry could see madam pomfrey fussing over hermione krum cedric and cho all of whom were wrapped in thick blankets 
 
 dumbledore and ludo bagman stood beaming at harry and ron from the bank as they swam nearer but percy who looked very white and somehow much younger than usual came splashing out to meet them meanwhile madame maxime was trying to restrain fleur delacour who was quite hysterical fighting tooth and nail to return to the water 
 
 gabrielle gabrielle is she alive is she urt 
 
 fine harry tried to tell her but he was so exhausted he could hardly talk let alone shout 
 
 percy seized ron and was dragging him back to the bank gerroff percy all right dumbledore and bagman were pulling harry upright fleur had broken free of madame maxime and was hugging her sister 
 
 it was ze grindylowszey attacked meoh gabrielle i thoughti thought 
 
 come here you said madam pomfrey she seized harry and pulled him over to hermione and the others wrapped him so tightly in a blanket that he felt as though he were in a straitjacket and forced a measure of very hot potion down his throat steam gushed out of his ears 
 
 harry well done hermione cried you did it you found out how all by yourself 
 
 well said harry he would have told her about dobby but he had just noticed karkaroff watching him he was the only judge who had not left the table the only judge not showing signs of pleasure and relief that harry ron and sister had got back safely yeah right said harry raising his voice slightly so that karkaroff could hear him 
 
 you haff a water beetle in your hair said krum harry had the impression that krum was drawing her attention back onto himself perhaps to remind her that he had just rescued her from the lake but hermione brushed away the beetle impatiently and said well outside the time limit though it take you ages to find us 
 
 noi found you okay 
 
 feeling of stupidity was growing now he was out of the water it seemed perfectly clear that dumbledores safety precautions have permitted the death of a hostage just because their champion turned up why he just grabbed ron and gone he would have been first and krum wasted time worrying about anyone else they taken the mersong seriously 
 
 dumbledore was crouching at the edge deep in conversation with what seemed to be the chief merperson a particularly wild and female he was making the same sort of screechy noises that the merpeople made when they were above water clearly dumbledore could speak mermish finally he straightened up turned to his fellow judges and said a conference before we give the marks i think 
 
 the judges went into a huddle madam pomfrey had gone to rescue ron from clutches she led him over to harry and the others gave him a blanket and some pepperup potion then went to fetch fleur and her sister fleur had many cuts on her face and arms and her robes were torn but she seem to care nor would she allow madam pomfrey to clean them 
 
 look after gabrielle she told her and then she turned to harry you saved er she said breathlessly even though she was not your ostage 
 
 yeah said harry who was now heartily wishing left all three girls tied to the statue 
 
 fleur bent down kissed harry twice on each cheek he felt his face burn and have been surprised if steam was coming out of his ears again then said to ron and you elped 
 
 yeah said ron looking extremely hopeful yeah a bit 
 
 fleur swooped down on him too and kissed him hermione looked simply furious but just then ludo magically magnified voice boomed out beside them making them all jump and causing the crowd in the stands to go very quiet 
 
 ladies and gentlemen we have reached our decision merchieftainess murcus has told us exactly what happened at the bottom of the lake and we have therefore decided to award marks out of fifty for each of the champions as follows 
 
 fleur delacour though she demonstrated excellent use of the charm was attacked by grindylows as she approached her goal and failed to retrieve her hostage we award her points 
 
 applause from the stands 
 
 i deserved zero said fleur throatily shaking her magnificent head 
 
 cedric diggory who also used the charm was first to return with his hostage though he returned one minute outside the time limit of an hour enormous cheers from the hufflepuffs in the crowd harry saw cho give cedric a glowing look we therefore award him points 
 
 heart sank if cedric had been outside the time limit he most certainly had been 
 
 viktor krum used an incomplete form of transfiguration which was nevertheless effective and was second to return with his hostage we award him forty points 
 
 karkaroff clapped particularly hard looking very superior 
 
 harry potter used gillyweed to great effect bagman continued he returned last and well outside the time limit of an hour however the merchieftainess informs us that mr potter was first to reach the hostages and that the delay in his return was due to his determination to return all hostages to safety not merely his own 
 
 ron and hermione both gave harry looks 
 
 most of the judges and here bagman gave karkaroff a very nasty look feel that this shows moral fiber and merits full marks howevermr score is points 
 
 stomach leapt he was now tying for first place with cedric ron and hermione caught by surprise stared at harry then laughed and started applauding hard with the rest of the crowd 
 
 there you go harry ron shouted over the noise you being thick after all you were showing moral fiber 
 
 fleur was clapping very hard too but krum look happy at all he attempted to engage hermione in conversation again but she was too busy cheering harry to listen 
 
 the third and final task will take place at dusk on the of june continued bagman the champions will be notified of what is coming precisely one month beforehand thank you all for your support of the champions 
 
 it was over harry thought dazedly as madam pomfrey began herding the champions and hostages back to the castle to get into dry clothesit was over he had got throughhe have to worry about anything now until june the 
 
 next time he was in hogsmeade harry decided as he walked back up the stone steps into the castle he was going to buy dobby a pair of socks for every day of the year
