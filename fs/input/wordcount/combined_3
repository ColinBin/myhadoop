 str carding and spinning threads and all the parts of the process 
 which are concerned with the actual manufacture of a woollen garment form a single art which is one of thow universally art of working in wool 
 
 y soc to be sure 
 
 str of working in wool again there are two divisions and both 
 these are parts of two arts at once 
 
 y soc how is that 
 
 str carding and one half of the use of the comb and the other 
 processes of which separate the composite may 
 be classed together as belonging both to the art of woolworking and also to one of the two great arts which are of universal art of composition and the art of division 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str to the latter belong carding and the other processes 
 of which i was just now speaking the art of discernment or division in wool and yarn which is effected in one manner with the comb and in another with the hands is variously described under all the names which i just now mentioned 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str again let us take some process of woolworking which is also 
 a portion of the art of composition and dismissing the elements of 
 division which we found there make two halves one on the principle 
 of composition and the other on the principle of division 
 
 y soc let that be done 
 
 str and once more socrates we must divide the part which 
 belongs at once both to woolworking and composition if we 
 are ever to discover satisfactorily the aforesaid art of weaving 
 
 y soc we must 
 
 str yes certainly and let us call one part of the art the art 
 of twisting threads the other the art of combining them 
 
 y soc do i understand you in speaking of twisting to be 
 referring to manufacture of the warp 
 
 str yes and of the woof too how if not by twisting is the 
 woof made 
 
 y soc there is no other way 
 
 str then suppose that you define the warp and the woof 
 for i think that the definition will be of use to you 
 
 y soc how shall i define them 
 
 str as thus a piece of carded wool which is drawn out lengthwise 
 and is said to be pulled out 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str and the wool thus prepared when twisted by the spindle and 
 made into a firm thread is called the warp and the art which 
 regulates these operations the art of spinning the warp 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str and the threads which are more loosely spun having a 
 softness proportioned to the intertexture of the warp and to the 
 degree of force used in dressing the threads which are 
 thus spun are called the woof and the art which is set over them 
 may be called the art of spinning the woof 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str and now there can be no mistake about the nature of the 
 part of weaving which we have undertaken to define for when 
 that part of the art of composition which is employed in the working of wool forms a web by the regular intertexture of warp and woof the entire woven substance is called by us a woollen garment and the art which presides over this is the art of weaving 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str but why did we not say at once that weaving is the art of 
 entwining warp and woof instead of making a long and 
 useless circuit 
 
 y soc i thought stranger that there was nothing useless in 
 what was said 
 
 str very likely but you may not always think so my sweet 
 friend and in case any feeling of dissatisfaction should hereafter 
 arise in your mind as it very well may let me lay down a principle 
 which will apply to arguments in general 
 
 y soc proceed 
 
 str let us begin by considering the whole nature of excess and 
 defect and then we shall have a rational ground on which we may 
 praise or blame too much length or too much shortness in discussions of this kind 
 
 y soc let us do so 
 
 str the points on which i think that we ought to dwell are the 
 following 
 
 y soc what 
 
 str length and shortness excess and defect with all of 
 these the art of measurement is conversant 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str and the art of measurement has to be divided into two parts 
 with a view to our present purpose 
 
 y soc where would you make the division 
 
 str as thus i would make two parts one having regard to the 
 relativity of greatness and smallness to each other and there is 
 another without which the existence of production would be 
 impossible 
 
 y soc what do you mean 
 
 str do you not think that it is only natural for the greater to 
 be called greater with reference to the less alone and the less 
 reference to the greater alone 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str well but is there not also something exceeding and 
 exceeded by the principle of the mean both in speech and action and is not this a reality and the chief mark of difference between good and bad men 
 
 y soc plainly 
 
 str then we must suppose that the great and small exist and are 
 discerned in both these ways and not as we were saying before 
 only relatively to one another but there must also be another 
 comparison of them with the mean or ideal standard would you like 
 to hear the reason why 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str if we assume the greater to exist only in relation to 
 the less there will never be any comparison of either with the mean 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str and would not this doctrine be the ruin of all the arts and 
 their creations would not the art of the statesman and the 
 aforesaid art of weaving disappear for all these arts are on the 
 watch against excess and defect not as unrealities but as real 
 evils which occasion a difficulty in action and the excellence of 
 beauty of every work of art is due to this observance of measure 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str but if the science of the statesman disappears the search 
 for the royal science will be impossible 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str well then as in the case of the sophist we extorted the 
 inference that had an existence because here was the 
 point at which the argument eluded our grasp so in this we must 
 endeavour to show that the greater and less are not only to be 
 measured with one another but also have to do with the production 
 of the mean for if this is not admitted neither a statesman nor 
 any other man of action can be an undisputed master of his science 
 
 y soc yes we must certainly do again what we did then 
 
 str but this socrates is a greater work than the other of 
 which we only too well remember the length i think however that 
 we may fairly assume something of this sort 
 
 y soc what 
 
 str that we shall some day require this notion of a mean with a 
 view to the demonstration of absolute truth meanwhile the argument 
 that the very existence of the arts must be held to depend on the 
 possibility of measuring more or less not only with one another 
 but also with a view to the attainment of the mean seems to afford 
 a grand support and satisfactory proof of the doctrine which we are 
 maintaining for if there are arts there is a standard of measure 
 and if there is a standard of measure there are arts but if either 
 is wanting there is neither 
 
 y soc true and what is the next step 
 
 str the next step clearly is to divide the art of measurement 
 into two parts all we have said already and to place in 
 the one part all the arts which measure number length depth breadth swiftness with their opposites and to have another part in which they are measured with the mean and the fit and the opportune and the due and with all those words in short which denote a mean or standard removed from the extremes 
 
 y soc here are two vast divisions embracing two very different 
 spheres 
 
 str there are many accomplished men socrates who say believing 
 themselves to speak wisely that the art of measurement is 
 universal and has to do with all things and this means what we are 
 now saying for all things which come within the province of art do 
 certainly in some sense partake of measure but these 
 persons because they are not accustomed to distinguish classes according to real forms jumble together two widely different things relation to one another and to a standard under the idea that they are the same and also fall into the converse error of dividing other things not according to their real parts whereas the right way is if a man 
 has first seen the unity of things to go on with the enquiry and 
 not desist until he has found all the differences contained in it 
 which form distinct classes nor again should he be able to rest 
 contented with the manifold diversities which are seen in a 
 multitude of things until he has comprehended all of them that have 
 any affinity within the bounds of one similarity and embraced them 
 within the reality of a single kind but we have said enough on this 
 head and also of excess and defect we have only to bear in 
 mind that two divisions of the art of measurement have been discovered which are concerned with them and not forget what they are 
 y soc we will not forget 
 
 str and now that this discussion is completed let us go on to 
 consider another question which concerns not this argument only but 
 the conduct of such arguments in general 
 
 y soc what is this new question 
 
 str take the case of a child who is engaged in learning his 
 letters when he is asked what letters make up a word should we say 
 that the question is intended to improve his grammatical knowledge 
 of that particular word or of all words 
 
 y soc clearly in order that he may have a better 
 knowledge of all words 
 
 str and is our enquiry about the statesman intended only 
 to improve our knowledge of politics or our power of reasoning generally 
 
 y soc clearly as in the former example the purpose is general 
 str still less would any rational man seek to analyse the 
 notion of weaving for its own sake but people seem to forget that some things have sensible images which are readily known and can be easily pointed out when any one desires to answer an enquirer without any trouble or argument whereas the greatest and highest truths have no outward image of themselves visible to man which he who wishes to satisfy the soul of the enquirer can adapt to the eye of sense and therefore we ought to train ourselves to give and accept a rational account of them for immaterial things which are the noblest and greatest are shown only in thought and idea and in no 
 other way and all that we are now saying is said for the sake of them moreover there is always less difficulty in fixing the mind on small matters than on great 
 
 y soc very good 
 
 str let us call to mind the bearing of all this 
 
 y soc what is it 
 
 str i wanted to get rid of any impression of tediousness which we 
 may have experienced in the discussion about weaving and 
 the reversal of the universe and in the discussion concerning the sophist and the being of i know that they were felt to be too long and i reproached myself with this fearing that they might be not only tedious but irrelevant and all that i have now said is only 
 designed to prevent the recurrence of any such disagreeables for the 
 future 
 
 y soc very good will you proceed 
 
 str then i would like to observe that you and i remembering what 
 has been said should praise or blame the length or shortness of 
 discussions not by comparing them with one another but with what 
 is fitting having regard to the part of measurement which as we 
 said was to be borne in mind 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str and yet not everything is to be judged even with a view to 
 what is fitting for we should only want such a length as is 
 suited to give pleasure if at all as a secondary matter and reason tells us that we should be contented to make the ease or rapidity of an enquiry not our first but our second object the first and highest 
 of all being to assert the great method of division according to 
 the discourse be shorter or longer is not to the 
 point no offence should be taken at length but the longer and 
 shorter are to be employed indifferently according as either of 
 them is better calculated to sharpen the wits of the auditors 
 reason would also say to him who censures the length of discourses 
 on such occasions and cannot away with their circumlocution that he 
 should not be in such a hurry to have done with them when 
 he can only complain that they are tedious but he should prove that if they had been shorter they would have made those who took part in them better dialecticians and more capable of expressing the truth of things about any other praise and blame he need not trouble should pretend not to hear them but we have had enough of this as you will probably agree with me in thinking let us return to our 
 statesman and apply to his case the aforesaid example of weaving 
 
 y soc very us do as you say 
 
 str the art of the king has been separated from the similar arts of 
 shepherds and indeed from all those which have to do with herds 
 at all there still remain however of the causal and 
 arts those which are immediately concerned with states and 
 which must first be distinguished from one another 
 
 y soc very good 
 
 str you know that these arts cannot easily be divided into two 
 halves the reason will be very evident as we proceed 
 
 y soc then we had better do so 
 
 str we must carve them like a victim into members or limbs since 
 we cannot bisect them for we certainly should divide everything 
 into as few parts as possible 
 
 y soc what is to be done in this case 
 
 str what we did in the example of those arts which 
 furnish the tools were regarded by us as 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str so now and with still more reason all arts which make any 
 implement in a state whether great or small may be 
 regarded by us as for without them neither state nor statesmanship would be possible and yet we are not inclined to say that any of them is a product of the kingly art 
 
 y soc no indeed 
 
 str the task of separating this class from others is not an easy 
 one for there is plausibility in saying that anything in 
 the world is the instrument of doing something but there is another dass of possessions in a city of which i have a word to say 
 
 y soc what class do you mean 
 
 str a class which may be described as not having this power that 
 is to say not like an instrument framed for production 
 but designed for the preservation of that which is produced 
 
 y soc to what do you refer 
 
 str to the class of vessels as they are comprehensively termed 
 which are constructed for the preservation of things moist 
 and dry of things prepared in the fire or out of the fire this is a very large class and has if i am not mistaken literally nothing to 
 do with the royal art of which we are in search 
 
 y soc certainly not 
 
 str there is also a third class of possessions to be noted 
 different from these and very extensive moving or resting on land 
 or water honourable and also dishonourable the whole of this class 
 has one name because it is intended to be sat upon being always a 
 seat for something 
 
 y soc what is it 
 
 str a vehicle which is certainly not the work of the statesman 
 but of the carpenter potter and coppersmith 
 
 y soc i understand 
 
 str and is there not a fourth class which is again different and 
 in which most of the things formerly mentioned are 
 kind of dress most sorts of arms walls and enclosures whether of 
 earth or stone and ten thousand other thing all of which being 
 made for the sake of defence may be truly called defences and are 
 for the most part to be regarded as the work of the builder or of 
 the weaver rather than of the statesman 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str shall we add a fifth class of ornamentation and drawing and 
 of the imitations produced by drawing and music which are designed for amusement only and may be fairly comprehended under one name 
 
 y soc what is it 
 
 str plaything is the name 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str that one name may be fitly predicated of all of them for 
 none of these things have a serious is their sole 
 aim 
 
 y soc that again i understand 
 
 str then there is a class which provides materials for all these 
 out of which and in which the arts already mentioned fabricate their 
 manifold class i say which is the creation and 
 offspring of many other arts may i not rank sixth 
 
 y soc what do you mean 
 
 str i am referring to gold silver and other metals and all 
 that and shearing of every sort provides for the art of 
 carpentry and plaiting and there is the process of barking and 
 stripping the cuticle of plants and the art which strips 
 off the skins of animals and other similar arts which manufacture 
 corks and papyri and cords and provide for the manufacture of 
 composite species out of simple whole class may be termed 
 the primitive and simple possession of man and with this the kingly 
 science has no concern at all 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str the provision of food and of all other things which mingle 
 their particles with the particles of the human body and minister 
 to the body will form a seventh class which may be called by the 
 general term of nourishment unless you have any better name 
 to however appertains rather to the husbandman 
 huntsman trainer doctor cook and is not to be assigned to the art 
 
 y soc certainly not 
 
 str these seven classes include nearly every description of 
 property with the exception of tame animals was 
 the original material which ought to have been placed first next 
 come instruments vessels vehicles defences playthings 
 nourishment small things which may under one 
 of for example coins seals and stamps are omitted for they have not in them the character of any larger kind which includes 
 them but some of them may with a little forcing be placed among ornaments and others may be made to harmonize with the class of implements the art of herding which has been already divided into parts will include all property in tame animals except slaves 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str the class of slaves and ministers only remains and i suspect 
 that in this the real aspirants for the throne who are the rivals 
 of the king in the formation of the political web will be 
 discovered just as spinners carders and the rest of them were the rivals of the weaver all the others who were termed have been got rid of among the occupations already mentioned and 
 separated from the royal and political science 
 
 y soc i agree 
 
 str let us go a little nearer in order that we may be 
 more certain of the complexion of this remaining class 
 
 y soc let us do so 
 
 str we shall find from our present point of view that the 
 greatest servants are in a case and condition which is the reverse 
 of what we anticipated 
 
 y soc who are they 
 
 str those who have been purchased and have so become 
 possessions these are unmistakably slaves and certainly do 
 not claim royal science 
 
 y soc certainly not 
 
 str again freemen who of their own accord become the servants of 
 the other classes in a state and who exchange and equalise the 
 products of husbandry and the other arts some sitting in the 
 others going from city to city by land or sea and 
 giving money in exchange for money or for other 
 the merchant the the retailer will not 
 put in any claim to statecraft or politics 
 
 y soc no unless indeed to the politics of commerce 
 
 str but surely men whom we see acting as hirelings and serfs and 
 too happy to turn their hand to anything will not profess 
 to share in royal science 
 
 y soc certainly not 
 
 str but what would you say of some other serviceable officials 
 
 y soc who are they and what services do they perform 
 
 str there are heralds and scribes perfected by practice and 
 divers others who have great skill in various sorts of business 
 connected with the government of shall we call them 
 
 y soc they are the officials and servants of the rulers as you 
 just now called them but not themselves rulers 
 
 str there may be something strange in any servant pretending to 
 be a ruler and yet i do not think that i could have been dreaming 
 when i imagined that the principal claimants to political science 
 would be found somewhere in this neighbourhood 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str well let us draw nearer and try the claims of some who have 
 not yet been tested in the first place there are diviners who 
 have a portion of servile or ministerial science and are thought to 
 be the interpreters of the gods to men 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str there is also the priestly class who as the law declares 
 know how to give the gods gifts from men in the form of sacrifices 
 which are acceptable to them and to ask on our behalf blessings in 
 return from them now both these are branches of the servile or 
 ministerial art 
 
 y soc yes clearly 
 
 str and here i think that we seem to be getting on the 
 right track for the priest and the diviner are swollen with pride and 
 prerogative and they create an awful impression of themselves by the magnitude of their enterprises in egypt the king himself is not allowed to reign unless he have priestly powers and if he should be of another class and has thrust himself in he must get enrolled in the 
 priesthood in many parts of hellas the duty of offering the most 
 solemn propitiatory sacrifices is assigned to the highest 
 magistracies and here at athens the most solemn and 
 national of the ancient sacrifices are supposed to be celebrated by him who has been chosen by lot to be the king archon 
 
 y soc precisely 
 
 str but who are these other kings and priests elected by lot who 
 now come into view followed by their retainers and a vast throng as 
 the former class disappears and the scene changes 
 
 y soc whom can you mean 
 
 str they are a strange crew 
 
 y soc why strange 
 
 str a minute ago i thought that they were animals of every tribe 
 for many of them are like lions and centaurs and many more like 
 satyrs and such weak and shifty shapes quickly 
 changing into one forms and natures and now socrates i 
 begin to see who they are 
 
 y soc who are they you seem to be gazing on some strange vision 
 
 str yes every one looks strange when you do not know 
 him and just now i myself fell into this first sight coming suddenly upon him i did not recognize the politician and his troop 
 
 y soc who is he 
 
 str the chief of sophists and most accomplished of wizards who 
 must at any cost be separated from the true king or statesman if we 
 are ever to see daylight in the present enquiry 
 
 y soc that is a hope not lightly to be renounced 
 
 str never if i can help it and first let me ask you a 
 question 
 
 y soc what 
 
 str is not monarchy a recognized form of government 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str and after monarchy next in order comes the government of 
 the few 
 
 y soc of course 
 
 str is not the third form of government the rule of the 
 multitude which is called by the name of democracy 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str and do not these three expand in a manner into five 
 producing out of themselves two other names y soc what are they 
 
 y soc what are they 
 
 str there is a criterion of voluntary and involuntary poverty 
 and riches law and the absence of law which men apply 
 to them the two first they subdivide accordingly and ascribe to 
 monarchy two forms and two corresponding names royalty and tyranny 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str and the government of the few they distinguish by the names 
 of aristocracy and oligarchy 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str democracy alone whether rigidly observing the laws 
 or not and whether the multitude rule over the men of property with 
 their consent or against their consent always in ordinary language has the same name 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str but do you suppose that any form of government which 
 is defined by these characteristics of the one the few or the many of 
 poverty or wealth of voluntary or compulsory submission of written 
 law or the absence of law can be a right one 
 
 y soc why not 
 
 str reflect and follow me 
 
 y soc in what direction 
 
 str shall we abide by what we said at first or shall we retract 
 our words 
 
 y soc to what do you refer 
 
 str if i am not mistaken we said that royal power was a science 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str and a science of a peculiar kind which was selected 
 out of the rest as having a character which is at once judicial and 
 authoritative 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str and there was one kind of authority over lifeless things and 
 another other living animals and so we proceeded in the 
 division step by step up to this point not losing the idea of science but unable as yet to determine the nature of the particular science 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str hence we are led to observe that the distinguishing principle 
 of the state cannot be the few or many the voluntary or 
 involuntary poverty or riches but some notion of science must 
 enter into it if we are to be consistent with what has preceded 
 
 y soc and we must be consistent 
 
 str well then in which of these various forms of states may the 
 science of government which is among the greatest of all 
 sciences and most difficult to acquire be supposed to reside that we must discover and then we shall see who are the false politicians who pretend to be politicians but are not although they persuade many and shall separate them from the wise king 
 
 y soc that as the argument has already intimated will be our 
 duty 
 str do you think that the multitude in a state can attain 
 politicals science 
 
 y soc impossible 
 
 str but perhaps in a city of a thousand men there would be a 
 hundred or say fifty who could 
 
 y soc in that case political science would certainly be the 
 easiest of all sciences there could not be found in a city of that 
 number as many really if judged by the 
 standard of the rest of hellas and there would certainly not be as 
 many kings for kings we may truly call those who possess royal 
 science whether they rule or not as was shown in the previous 
 argument 
 
 str thank you for reminding me and the consequence is that any 
 true form of government can only be supposed to be the government of one two or at any rate of a few 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str and these whether they rule with the will or 
 against the will of their subjects with written laws or without written laws and whether they are poor or rich and whatever be the nature of their rule must be supposed according to our present view to 
 rule on some scientific principle just as the physician whether he cures us against our will or with our will and whatever be his mode of 
 burning or the infliction of some other 
 he practises out of a book or not out of a book and 
 whether he be rich or poor whether he purges or reduces in 
 some other way or even fattens his patients is a physician all the same so long as he exercises authority over them according to rules 
 of art if he only does them good and heals and saves them and this we lay down to be the only proper test of the art of medicine or of any other art of command 
 
 y soc quite true 
 
 str then that can be the only true form of government in which 
 the governors are really found to possess science and are not mere 
 pretenders whether they rule according to law or without law 
 or unwilling subjects and are rich or poor 
 of these things can with any propriety be included 
 in the notion of the ruler 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str and whether with a view to the public good they purge 
 the state by killing some or exiling some whether they reduce the size of the body corporate by sending out from the hive swarms of citizens or by introducing persons from without increase it while they act according to the rules of wisdom and justice and use their 
 power with a view to the general security and improvement the city over which they rule and which has these characteristics may be described as the only true state all other governments are not genuine or real but only imitations of this and some of them are better and some of them are worse the better are said to be well governed but they are mere imitations like the others 
 
 y soc i agree stranger in the greater part of what you say 
 but as to their ruling without expression has a harsh sound 
 
 str you have been too quick for me socrates i was just going to 
 ask you whether you objected to any of my statements and now i see that we shall have to consider this notion of there being good 
 government without laws 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str there can be no doubt that legislation is in a manner the 
 business of a king and yet the best thing of all is not that the 
 law should rule but that a man should rule supposing him to have 
 wisdom and royal power do you see why this is 
 
 y soc why 
 
 str because the law does not perfectly comprehend what is noblest 
 and most just for all and therefore cannot enforce what is best the 
 differences of men and actions and the endless irregular 
 movements of human things do not admit of any universal and simple rule and no art whatsoever can lay down a rule which will last for all time 
 
 y soc of course not 
 
 str but the law is always striving to make an obstinate 
 and ignorant tyrant who will not allow anything to be done contrary 
 to his appointment or any question to be even in sudden 
 changes of circumstances when something happens to be better than 
 what he commanded for some one 
 
 y soc certainly the law treats us all precisely in the manner 
 which you describe 
 
 str a perfectly simple principle can never be applied to 
 a state of things which is the reverse of simple 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str then if the law is not the perfection of right why are we 
 compelled to make laws at all the reason of this has next to be 
 investigated 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str let me ask whether you have not meetings for gymnastic 
 contests in your city such as there are in other cities at 
 which men compete in running wrestling and the like 
 
 y soc yes they are very common among us 
 
 str and what are the rules which are enforced on their pupils by 
 professional trainers or by others having similar authority can you 
 remember 
 
 y soc to what do you refer 
 
 str the do not issue minute rules for 
 individuals or give every individual what is exactly suited to his constitution they think that they ought to go more roughly to work and to prescribe generally the regimen which will benefit the majority 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str and therefore they assign equal amounts of exercise to them 
 all they send them forth together and let them rest together from 
 their running wrestling or whatever the form of bodily exercise 
 may be 
 
 y so true 
 
 str and now observe that the legislator who has to 
 preside over the herd and to enforce justice in their dealings with one another will not be able in enacting for the general good to 
 provide exactly what is suitable for each particular case 
 
 y soc he cannot be expected to do so 
 
 str he will lay down laws in a general form for the majority 
 roughly meeting the cases of individuals and some of them he will 
 deliver in writing and others will be unwritten and these last 
 will be traditional customs of the country 
 
 y soc he will be right 
 
 str yes quite right for how can he sit at every side all 
 through his life prescribing for him the exact particulars of his 
 duty who socrates would be equal to such a task no one who 
 really had the royal science if he had been able to do this would 
 have imposed upon himself the restriction of a written law 
 
 y soc so i should infer from what has now been said 
 
 str or rather my good friend from what is going to be said 
 
 y soc and what is that 
 
 str let us put to ourselves the case of a physician or trainer 
 who is about to go into a far country and is expecting to be a long 
 time away from his that his instructions 
 will not be remembered unless they are written down he will leave notes of them for the use of his pupils or patients 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str but what would you say if he came back sooner than he had 
 intended and owing to an unexpected change of the winds or other 
 celestial influences something else happened to be better for 
 he not venture to suggest this new remedy although not 
 contemplated in his former prescription would he persist in 
 observing the original law neither himself giving any few 
 commandments nor the patient daring to do otherwise than was prescribed under the idea that this course only was healthy and medicinal all others noxious and heterodox viewed in the light of science and true art would not all such enactments be utterly ridiculous 
 
 y soc utterly 
 
 str and if he who gave laws written or unwritten 
 determining what was good or bad honourable or dishonourable just or unjust to the tribes of men who flock together in their several cities and are governed accordance with them if i say the wise legislator were suddenly to come again or another like to him is he to be prohibited from changing not this prohibition be in reality quite as ridiculous as the other 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str do you know a plausible saying of the common people 
 which is in point 
 
 y soc i do not recall what you mean at the moment 
 
 str they say that if any one knows how the ancient laws may be 
 improved he must first persuade his own state of the 
 improvement and then he may legislate but not otherwise 
 
 y soc and are they not right 
 
 str i dare say but supposing that he does use some 
 gentle violence for their good what is this violence to be called or rather 
 before you answer let me ask the same question in reference to our 
 previous instances 
 
 y soc what do you mean 
 
 str suppose that a skilful physician has a patient of 
 whatever sex or age whom he compels against his will to do something for his good which is contrary to the written rules what is this compulsion to be called would you ever dream of calling it a violation of the art or a breach of the laws of health nothing could be more unjust than for the patient to whom such violence is applied to charge the physician who practises the violence with wanting skill or aggravating his disease 
 
 y soc most true 
 
 str in the political art error is not called disease but evil 
 or disgrace or injustice 
 
 y soc quite true 
 
 str and when the citizen contrary to law and custom is 
 compelled to do what is juster and better and nobler than he did 
 before the last and most absurd thing which he could say about such 
 violence is that he has incurred disgrace or evil or injustice at 
 the hands of those who compelled him 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str and shall we say that the violence if exercised by a 
 rich just and if by a poor man unjust may not any man rich or poor with or without laws with the will of the citizens or against 
 the will of the citizens do what is for their interest is not this 
 the true principle of government according to which the 
 wise and good man will order the affairs of his subjects as the pilot by watching continually over the interests of the ship and of the 
 by laying down rules but by making his art a 
 the lives of his even and in the way may 
 there not be a true form of polity created by those who are able to 
 govern in a similar spirit and who show a strength of art which is 
 superior to the law nor can wise rulers ever err while they 
 observing the one great rule of distributing justice to the citizens 
 with intelligence and skill are able to preserve them and 
 as far as may be to make them better from being worse 
 
 y soc no one can deny what has been now said 
 
 str neither if you consider can any one deny the other 
 statement 
 
 y soc what was it 
 
 str we said that no great number of persons whoever they may be 
 can attain political knowledge or order a state wisely but that 
 the true government is to be found in a small body or in an 
 individual and that other states are but imitations of this as we 
 said a little while ago some for the better and some for the worse 
 
 y soc what do you mean i cannot have understood your previous 
 remark about imitations 
 
 str and yet the mere suggestion which i hastily threw out 
 is highly important even if we leave the question where it is and do not seek by the discussion of it to expose the error which prevails in 
 this matter 
 
 y soc what do you mean 
 
 str the idea which has to be grasped by us is not easy or 
 familiar but we may attempt to express it the government of which i have been speaking to be the only true model then the others must use the written laws of no other can they be saved they will have to do what is now generally approved although not the best thing in the world 
 
 y soc what is this 
 
 str no citizen should do anything contrary to the laws and any 
 infringement of them should be punished with death and the most 
 extreme penalties and this is very right and good when regarded as 
 the second best thing if you set aside the first of which 
 i was just now speaking shall i explain the nature of what call the 
 second best 
 
 y soc by all means 
 
 str i must again have recourse to my favourite images through 
 them and them alone can i describe kings and rulers 
 
 y soc what images 
 
 str the noble pilot and the wise physician who is worth many 
 another the similitude of these let us endeavour to discover 
 some image of the king 
 
 y soc what sort of image 
 
 str well such as man will reflect that he suffers 
 strange things at the hands of both of them the physician saves 
 any whom he wishes to save and any whom he wishes to maltreat he 
 or burning them and at the same time 
 requiring thems to bring him patients which are a sort of tribute of which little or nothing is spent upon the sick man and the greater part is consumed by him and his domestics and the finale is that he receives money from the relations of the sick man or from some enemy of his and puts him out of the way and the pilots of ships are guilty of numberless evil deeds of the same kind they intentionally play false and leave you ashore when the hour of sailing arrives or they cause mishaps at sea and cast away their freight and are guilty of 
 other rogueries now suppose that we bearing all this in mind were 
 to determine after consideration that neither of these arts shall 
 any longer be allowed to exercise absolute control either 
 over freemen or over slaves but that we will summon an assembly either of all the people or of the rich only that anybody who likes whatever may be his calling or even if he have no calling may offer an opinion either about seamanship or about as to the manner in which physic or surgical instruments are to be applied to the patient or again about the vessels and the nautical implements 
 which are required in navigation and how to meet the 
 dangers of winds and waves which are incidental to the voyage how to behave when encountering pirates and what is to be done with the old fashioned galleys if they have to fight with others of a similar that whatever shall be decreed by the multitude on these 
 points upon the advice of persons skilled or unskilled shall be written down on triangular tablets and columns or enacted although unwritten to be national customs and that in all future time vessels shall be navigated and remedies administered to the patient after 
 this fashion 
 
 y soc what a strange notion 
 
 str suppose further that the pilots and physicians are appointed 
 annually either out of the rich or out of the whole people and that 
 they are elected by lot and that after their election they navigate 
 vessels and heal the sick according to the written rules 
 
 y soc worse and worse 
 
 str but hear what the year of office has 
 expired the pilot or physician has to come before a court of review in which the judges are either selected from the wealthy classes or chosen by lot out of the whole people and anybody who pleases may be their accuser and may lay to their charge that during the past year they have not navigated their vessels or healed their patients 
 according to the letter of the law and the ancient customs of their and if either of them is condemned some of the judges must fix what he is to suffer or pay 
 y soc he who is willing to take a command under such conditions 
 deserves to suffer any penalty 
 
 str yet once more we shall have to enact that if any one is 
 detected enquiring into piloting and navigation or into health and 
 the true nature of medicine or about the winds or other conditions 
 of the atmosphere contrary to the written rules and has any 
 ingenious notions about such matters he is not to be called a pilot 
 or physician but a cloudy prating on the ground 
 that he is a corrupter of the young who would persuade them to 
 follow the art of medicine or piloting in an unlawful manner and to 
 exercise an arbitrary rule over their patients or ships any one who 
 is qualified by law may inform against him and indict him in some 
 court and then if he is found to be persuading any whether young 
 or old to act contrary to the written law he is to be punished 
 with the utmost rigour for no one should presume to be 
 wiser than the laws and as touching healing and health and piloting and navigation the nature of them is known to all for anybody may 
 learn the written laws and the national customs if such were the mode 
 of procedure socrates about these sciences and about generalship 
 and any branch of hunting or about painting or imitation in 
 general or carpentry or any sort of handicraft or husbandry or 
 planting or if we were to see an art of rearing horses or tending 
 herds or divination or any ministerial service or or any science conversant with number whether simple or square or cube or comprising say if all these things were done in this way according to written regulations and not according to art what would be the result 
 
 y soc all the arts would utterly perish and could never be 
 recovered because enquiry would be unlawful and human 
 life which is bad enough already would then become utterly unendurable 
 
 str but what if while compelling all these operations to be 
 regulated by written law we were to appoint as the guardian of the 
 laws some one elected by a show of hands or by lot and he caring 
 nothing about the laws were to act contrary to them from motives of 
 interest or favour and without not this be a still 
 worse evil than the former 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str to go against the laws which are based upon long experience 
 and the wisdom of counsellors who have graciously 
 recommended them and persuaded the multitude to pass them would be a far greater and more ruinous error than any adherence to written law 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str therefore as there is a danger of this the next 
 best thing in legislating is not to allow either the individual or the multitude to break the law in any respect whatever 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str the laws would be copies of the true particulars of action as 
 far as they admit of being written down from the lips of those who 
 have knowledge 
 
 y soc certainly they would 
 
 str and as we were saying he who has knowledge and is a true 
 statesman will do many things within his own sphere of action by 
 his art without regard to the laws when he is of opinion that 
 something other than that which he has written down and 
 enjoined to be observed during his absence would be better 
 
 y soc yes we said so 
 
 str and any individual or any number of men having fixed laws 
 in acting contrary to them with a view to something better 
 would only be acting as far as they are able like the true statesman 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str if they had no knowledge of what they were doing they would 
 imitate the truth and they would always imitate ill but if they 
 had knowledge the imitation would be the perfect truth and an 
 imitation no longer 
 
 y soc quite true 
 
 str and the principle that no great number of men are able to 
 acquire a knowledge of any art has been already admitted by us 
 
 y soc yes it has 
 
 str then the royal or political art if there be such an art 
 will never be attained either by the wealthy or by the other mob 
 
 y soc impossible 
 
 str then the nearest approach which these lower forms of 
 government can ever make to the true government of the one scientific ruler is to do nothing contrary to their own written laws and 
 national customs 
 
 y soc very good 
 
 str when the rich imitate the true form such a government is 
 called aristocracy and when they are regardless of the laws 
 oligarchy 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str or again when an individual rules according to law in 
 imitation of him who knows we call him a king and if he rules 
 according to law we give him the same name whether he rules with 
 opinion or with knowledge 
 
 y soc to be sure 
 
 str and when an individual truly possessing knowledge rules his 
 name will surely be the will be called a king and thus the 
 five names of governments as they are now reckoned become one 
 
 y soc that is true 
 
 str and when an individual ruler governs neither by law nor by 
 custom but following in the steps of the true man of 
 science pretends that he can only act for the best by violating the laws while in reality appetite and ignorance are the motives of the imitation may not such an one be called a tyrant 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str and this we believe to be the origin of the tyrant and the 
 king of oligarchies and aristocracies and men 
 are offended at the one monarch and can never be made to 
 believe that any one can be worthy of such authority or is able and 
 willing in the spirit of virtue and knowledge to act justly and holily to all they fancy that he will be a despot who will wrong and harm and slay whom he pleases of us for if there could be such a despot as we 
 describe they would acknowledge that we ought to be too glad to 
 have him and that he alone would be the happy ruler of a true and 
 perfect state 
 
 y soc to be sure 
 
 str but then as the state is not like a beehive and has no 
 natural head who is at once recognized to be the superior 
 both in body and in mind mankind are obliged to meet and make laws and endeavour to approach as nearly as they can to the true form of government 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str and when the foundation of politics is in the letter only and 
 in custom and knowledge is divorced from action can we wonder 
 socrates at the miseries which there are and always will be in 
 states any other art built on such a foundation and thus 
 conducted would ruin all that it touched ought we not rather to 
 wonder at the natural strength of the political bond for states 
 have endured all this time out of mind and yet some of them still 
 remain and are not overthrown though many of them like 
 ships at sea founder from time to time and perish and have perished and will hire after perish through the badness of their pilots and crews who have the worst sort of ignorance of the highest mean to say that they are wholly unaquainted with politics of which above all other sciences they believe themselves to have acquired the 
 most perfect knowledge 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str then the question of these untrue forms of 
 government is the least oppressive to their subjects though they 
 are all oppressive and which is the worst of them here is a 
 consideration which is beside our present purpose and yet having 
 regard to the whole it seems to influence all our actions we must 
 examine it 
 
 y soc yes we must 
 
 str you may say that of the three forms the same is at once the 
 hardest and the easiest 
 
 y soc what do you mean 
 
 str i am speaking of the three forms of government which i 
 mentioned at the beginning of this the rule of 
 the few and the rule of the many 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str if we divide each of these we shall have six from which the 
 true one may be distinguished as a seventh 
 
 y soc how would you make the division 
 
 str monarchy divides into royalty and tyranny the rule of the 
 few into aristocracy which has an auspicious name and 
 oligarchy and democracy or the rule of the many which before was one must now be divided 
 
 y soc on what principle of division 
 
 str on the same principle as before although the name is now 
 discovered to have a twofold the distinction of ruling 
 with law or without applies to this as well as to the rest 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str the division made no difference when we were looking for the 
 perfect state as we showed before but now that this has been 
 separated off and as we said the others alone are left for us 
 the principle of law and the absence of law will bisect them all 
 
 y soc that would seem follow from what has been said 
 
 str then monarchy when bound by good prescriptions or 
 laws is the best of all the six and when lawless is the most bitter and 
 oppressive to the subject 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str the government of the few which is intermediate 
 between that of the one and many is also intermediate in good and evil but the government of the many is in every respect weak and unable to do either any great good or any great evil when compared with the others because the offices are too minutely subdivided and too many hold them and this therefore is the worst of all lawful 
 governments and the best of all lawless ones if they are 
 all without the restraints of law democracy is the form in which to 
 live is best if they are well ordered then this is the last which you should choose as royalty the first form is the best with the 
 exception of the seventh for that excels them all and is among states what god is among men 
 
 y soc you are quite right and we should choose that above all 
 
 str the members of all these states with the exception of the 
 one which has knowledge may be set aside as being not statesmen but of the most monstrous idols and 
 themselves being the greatest imitators and magicians they are also the greatest of sophists 
 
 y soc the name of sophist after many windings in the argument 
 appears to have been most justly fixed upon the politicians as they 
 are termed 
 
 str and so our satyric drama has been played out and the troop 
 of centaurs and satyrs however unwilling to leave the stage have 
 at last been separated from the political science 
 
 y soc so i perceive 
 
 str there remain however natures still more troublesome 
 because they are more nearly akin to the king and more difficult to 
 discern the examination of them may be compared to the process of 
 refining gold 
 
 y soc what is your meaning 
 
 str the workmen begin by sifting away the earth and stones and 
 the like there remain in a confused mass the valuable clements akin 
 to gold which can only be separated by silver 
 and other precious metals these are at last refined away by the use of tests until the gold is left quite pure 
 
 y soc yes that is the way in which these things are said to be 
 done 
 
 str in like manner all alien and uncongenial matter has been 
 separated from political science and what is precious and of a 
 kindred nature has been left there remain the nobler arts of the 
 general and the judge and the higher sort of oratory which 
 is an ally of the royal art and persuades men to do justice and assists in guiding the helm of can we best clear away all these 
 leaving him whom we seek alone and unalloyed 
 
 y soc that is obviously what has in some way to be attempted 
 
 str if the attempt is all that is wanting he shall certainly be 
 brought to light and i think that the illustration of music may 
 assist in exhibiting him please to answer me a question 
 
 y soc what question 
 
 str there is such a thing as learning music or handicraft arts in 
 general 
 
 y soc there is 
 
 str and is there any higher art or science having power to 
 decide which of these arts are and are not to be do 
 you say 
 
 y soc i should answer that there is 
 
 str and do we acknowledge this science to be different from the 
 others 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str and ought the other sciences to be superior to this or no 
 single science to any other or ought this science to be the 
 overseer and governor of all the others 
 
 y soc the latter 
 
 str you mean to say that the science which judges whether we 
 ought to learn or not must be superior to the science which is 
 learned or which teaches 
 
 y soc far superior 
 
 str and the science which determines whether we ought to persuade 
 or not must be superior to the science which is able to persuade 
 
 y soc of course 
 
 str very good and to what science do we assign the power of 
 persuading a multitude by a pleasing tale and not by teaching 
 
 y soc that power i think must clearly be assigned to rhetoric 
 
 str and to what science do we give the power of 
 determining whether we are to employ persuasion or force towards any one or to refrain altogether 
 
 y soc to that science which governs the arts of speech and 
 persuasion 
 
 str which if i am not mistaken will be politics 
 
 y soc very good 
 
 str rhetoric seems to be quickly distinguished from 
 politics being a different species yet ministering to it 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str but what would you think of another sort of power or science 
 
 y soc what science 
 
 str the science which has to do with military operations against 
 our that to be regarded as a science or not 
 
 y soc how can generalship and military tactics be regarded as 
 other than a science 
 
 str and is the art which is able and knows how to advise when we 
 are to go to war or to make peace the same as this or different 
 
 y soc if we are to be consistent we must say different 
 
 str and we must also suppose that this rules the other if we are 
 not to give up our former notion 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str and considering how great and terrible the whole art of war 
 is can we imagine any which is superior to it but the truly royal 
 
 y soc no other 
 
 str the art of the general is only ministerial and therefore not 
 political 
 
 y soc exactly 
 
 str once more let us consider the nature of the righteous judge 
 
 y soc very good 
 
 str does he do anything but decide the dealings of men with one 
 another to be just or unjust in accordance with the standard which 
 he receives from the king and his own peculiar 
 virtue only in this that he is not perverted by gifts or fears or 
 pity or by any sort of favour or enmity into deciding the suits of 
 men with one another contrary to the appointment of the legislator 
 
 y soc no his office is such as you describe 
 
 str then the inference is that the power of the judge is 
 not only the power of a guardian of the law which ministers to the royal power 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str the review of all these sciences shows that none of them is 
 political or royal for the truly royal ought not itself to act but 
 to rule over those who are able to act the king ought to 
 know what is and what is not a fitting opportunity for taking the initiative in matters of the greatest importance whilst others should execute his orders 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str and therefore the arts which we have described as they 
 have no authority over themselves or one another but are 
 each of them concerned with some special action of their own have as they ought to have special names corresponding to their several actions 
 y soc i agree 
 
 str and the science which is over them all and has charge of the 
 laws and of all matters affecting the state and truly weaves them 
 all into one if we would describe under a name characteristic of 
 their common nature most truly we may call politics 
 
 y soc exactly so 
 
 str then now that we have discovered the various classes in a 
 state shall i analyse politics after the pattern which weaving 
 supplied 
 
 y soc i greatly wish that you would 
 
 str then i must describe the nature of the royal web and show 
 how the various threads are woven into one piece 
 
 y soc clearly 
 
 str a task has to be accomplished which although difficult 
 appears to be necessary 
 
 y soc certainly the attempt must be made 
 
 str to assume that one part of virtue differs in kind 
 from a position easily assailable by contentious disputants who appeal to popular opinion 
 
 y soc i do not understand 
 
 str let me put the matter in another way i suppose that you 
 would consider courage to be a part of virtue 
 
 y soc certainly i should 
 
 str and you would think temperance to be different from courage 
 and likewise to be a part of virtue 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str i shall venture to put forward a strange theory about them 
 
 y soc what is it 
 
 str that they are two principles which thoroughly hate one 
 another and are antagonistic throughout a great part of nature 
 
 y soc how singular 
 
 str yes all the parts of virtue are commonly said to be 
 friendly to one another 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str then let us carefully investigate whether this is universally 
 true or whether there are not parts of virtue which are at war with 
 their kindred in some respect 
 
 y soc tell me how we shall consider that question 
 
 str we must extend our enquiry to all those things which we 
 consider beautiful and at the same time place in two 
 opposite classes 
 
 y soc explain what are they 
 
 str acuteness and quickness whether in body or soul or in the 
 movement of sound and the imitations of them which painting 
 and music 
 supply you must have praised yourself before now or been present 
 when others praised them 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str and do you remember the terms in which they are praised 
 
 y soc i do not 
 
 str i wonder whether i can explain to you in words the thought 
 which is passing in my mind 
 
 y soc why not 
 
 str you fancy that this is all so easy well let us 
 consider these notions with reference to the opposite classes of action under which they fall when we praise quickness and energy and acuteness whether of mind or body or sound we express our praise of the quality which we admire by one word and that one word is manliness or courage 
 
 y soc how 
 
 str we speak of an action as energetic and brave quick and 
 manly and vigorous too and when we apply the name of which i speak as the common attribute of all these natures we certainly praise 
 them 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str and do we not often praise the quiet strain of action also 
 
 y soc to be sure 
 
 str and do we not then say the opposite of what we said of the 
 other 
 
 y soc how do you mean 
 
 str we exclaim how calm how temperate in admiration of the slow 
 and quiet working of the intellect and of steadiness and gentleness 
 in action of smoothness and depth of voice and of all rhythmical 
 movement and of music in general when these have a proper 
 solemnity of all such actions we predicate not courage but a name 
 indicative of order 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str but when on the other hand either of these is out of place 
 the names of either are changed into terms of censure 
 
 y soc how so 
 
 str too great sharpness or quickness or hardness is 
 termed violence or madness too great slowness or gentleness is called cowardice or sluggishness and we may observe that for the most part these qualities and the temperance and manliness of the opposite characters are arrayed as enemies on opposite sides and do not mingle with one another in their respective actions and if we 
 pursue the enquiry we shall find that men who have these different 
 qualities of mind differ from one another 
 
 y soc in what respect 
 
 str in respect of all the qualities which i mentioned and very 
 likely of many others according to their respective affinities to 
 either class of actions they distribute praise and 
 to the actions which are akin to their own blame to those of the opposite out of this many quarrels and occasions of quarrel arise among them 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str the difference between the two classes is often a trivial 
 concern but in a state and when affecting really important 
 matters becomes of all disorders the most hateful 
 
 y soc to what do you refer 
 
 str to nothing short of the whole regulation of human 
 life for the orderly class are always ready to lead a peaceful life quietly doing their own business this is their manner of behaving with all men at home and they are equally ready to find some way of keeping the peace with foreign states and on account of this fondness of theirs for peace which is often out of season where their influence prevails they become by degrees unwarlike and bring up their young men to be like themselves they are at the mercy of their enemies whence in a few years they and their children and the whole 
 city often pass imperceptibly from the condition of freemen into that of slaves 
 y soc what a cruel fate 
 
 str and now think of what happens with the more 
 courageous natures are they not always inciting their country to go to war owing to their excessive love of the military life they raise up enemies against themselves many and mighty and either utterly ruin their native land or enslave and subject it to its foes 
 
 y soc that again is true 
 
 str must we not admit then that where these two classes exist 
 they always feel the greatest antipathy and antagonism towards one 
 another 
 
 y soc we cannot deny it 
 
 str and returning to the enquiry with which we began have we not 
 found that considerable portions of virtue are at variance with one 
 another and give rise to a similar opposition in the characters who 
 are endowed with them 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str let us consider a further point 
 
 y soc what is it 
 
 str i want to know whether any constructive art will make any 
 even the most trivial thing out of bad and good materials 
 indifferently if this can be helped does not all art rather reject 
 the bad as far as possible and accept the good and fit 
 materials and from these elements whether like or unlike gathering them all into one work out some nature or idea 
 
 y soc to be sure 
 
 str then the true and natural art of statesmanship will 
 never allow any state to be formed by a combination of good and bad men if this can be avoided but will begin by testing human natures in play and after testing them will entrust them to proper teachers who are the ministers of her will herself give orders and maintain authority just as the art of weaving continually gives orders and maintains authority over the carders and all the others who prepare the material for the work commanding the subsidiary arts to execute the works which she deems necessary for making the web 
 
 y soc quite true 
 
 str in like manner the royal science appears to me to be the 
 mistress of all lawful educators and instructors and having this 
 queenly power will not permit them to train men in what will 
 produce characters unsuited to the political constitution which she 
 desires to create but only in what will produce such as are 
 suitable those which have no share of manliness and temperance or any other virtuous inclination and from the necessity of an evil nature are violently carried away to godlessness and insolence and 
 injustice she gets rid of by death and exile and punishes them with the greatest of disgraces 
 
 y soc that is commonly said 
 
 str but those who are wallowing in ignorance and baseness she 
 bows under the yoke of slavery 
 
 y soc quite right 
 
 str the rest of the citizens out of whom if they have 
 education something noble may be made and who are capable of being united by the statesman the kingly art blends and weaves together taking on the one hand those whose natures tend rather to courage which is the stronger element and may be regarded as the warp and on the other hand those which incline to order and gentleness and which are represented in the figure as spun thick and soft after the manner of the which are naturally opposed she seeks to bind and weave together in the following manner 
 
 y soc in what manner 
 
 str first of all she takes the eternal element of the soul and 
 binds it with a divine cord to which it is akin and then the 
 animal nature and binds that with human cords 
 
 y soc i do not understand what you mean 
 
 str the meaning is that the opinion about the honourable and the 
 just and good and their opposites which is true and confirmed by 
 reason is a divine principle and when implanted in the soul is 
 implanted as i maintain in a nature of heavenly birth 
 
 y soc yes what else should it be 
 
 str only the statesman and the good legislator having the 
 inspiration of the royal muse can implant this opinion and he 
 only in the rightly educated whom we were just now describing 
 
 y soc likely enough 
 
 str but him who cannot we will not designate by any of the names 
 which are the subject of the present which are the subject of the 
 present enquiry 
 
 y soc very right 
 
 str the courageous soul when attaining this truth becomes 
 civilized and rendered more capable of partaking of 
 justice but when not partaking is inclined to brutality is not that true 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str and again the peaceful and orderly nature if sharing in these 
 opinions becomes temperate and wise as far as this may be in a 
 state but if not deservedly obtains the ignominious name of 
 silliness 
 
 y soc quite true 
 
 str can we say that such a connection as this will lastingly 
 unite the evil with one another or with the good or that any 
 science would seriously think of using a bond of this kind to join 
 such materials 
 
 y soc impossible 
 
 str but in those who were originally of a noble nature and who 
 have been nurtured in noble ways and in those only may we not say 
 that union is implanted by law and that this is the medicine which 
 art prescribes for them and of all the bonds which unite the 
 dissimilar and contrary parts of virtue is not this as i was 
 saying the divinest 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str where this divine bond exists there is no difficulty in 
 imagining or when you have imagined in creating the other bonds 
 which are human only 
 
 y soc how is that and what bonds do you mean 
 
 str rights of intermarriage and ties which are formed between 
 states by giving and taking children in marriage or between 
 individuals by private betrothals and espousals for most persons 
 form marriage connection without due regard to what is best for the 
 procreation of children 
 
 y soc in what way 
 
 str they seek after wealth and power which in matrimony are 
 objects not of a serious censure 
 
 y soc there is no need to consider them at all 
 
 str more reason to consider the practice of 
 those who make family their chief aim and to indicate their error 
 
 y soc quite true 
 
 str they act on no true principle at all they seek their ease 
 and receive with open arms those are like themselves and hate those 
 who are unlike them being too much influenced by feelings 
 of dislike 
 
 y soc how so 
 
 str the quiet orderly class seek for natures like their 
 own and as far as they can they marry and give in marriage exclusively in this class and the courageous do the same they seek natures like their own whereas they should both do precisely the opposite 
 
 y soc how and why is that 
 
 str because courage when untempered by the gentler nature during 
 many generations may at first bloom and strengthen but at last 
 bursts forth into downright madness 
 
 y soc like enough 
 
 str and then again the soul which is of 
 modesty and has no element of courage in many successive generations is apt to grow too indolent and at last to become utterly paralyzed and useless 
 
 y soc that again is quite likely 
 
 str it was of these bonds i said that there would be no 
 difficulty in creating them if only both classes originally held 
 the same opinion about the honourable and in 
 this single work the whole process of royal weaving is to allow temperate natures to be separated from the brave but to weave them together like the warp and the woof by common sentiments and honours and reputation and by the giving of pledges to one another and out of them forming one smooth and even web to entrust to them the offices of state 
 y soc how do you mean 
 str where one officer only is needed you must choose a ruler who has both these many you must mingle some of each 
 for the temperate ruler is very careful and just and safe but is 
 wanting in thoroughness and go 
 
 y soc certainly that is very true 
 
 str the character of the courageous on the other hand 
 falls short of the former in justice and caution but has the power of 
 action in a remarkable degree and where either of these two qualities 
 is wanting there cities cannot altogether prosper either in their public or private life 
 
 y soc certainly they cannot 
 
 str this then we declare to be the completion of the web of 
 political action which is created by a direct intertexture of the 
 brave and temperate natures whenever the royal science has drawn 
 the two minds into communion with one another by unanimity and 
 friendship and having perfected the noblest and best of all the 
 webs which political life admits and enfolding therein all other 
 inhabitants of cities whether slaves or freemen binds them in one 
 fabric and governs and presides over them and in so far as to be 
 happy is vouchsafed to a city in no particular fails to secure 
 their happiness 
 
 y soc your picture stranger of the king and statesman no less 
 than of the sophist is quite perfect

 of simulation dissimulation 
 dissimulation is but a faint kind of policy or wisdom for it asketh a strong wit 
 and a strong heart to know when to tell truth and to do it therefore it is me weaker sort of politics that are the great dissemblers 
 tacitus saith livia sorted well with the arts of her husband and dissimulation 
 of her son attributing arts or policy to augustus and dissimulation to tiberius 
 and again when lucianus encourageth vespasian to take arms against vitellius he saith we rise not against the piercing judgment of augustus nor the extreme caution or closeness of tiberius these properties of arts or policy and dissimulation or closeness are indeed habits and faculties several and to be distinguished for if a man have that penetration of judgment as he can discern what things are to be laid open and what to be secreted and what to be showed at half lights and to whom and when which indeed are arts of state and arts of life as tacitus well calleth mem to him a habit of dissimulation is a hindrance and a poorness but if a man cannot obtain to that judgment then it is left to him generally to be close and a dissembler for where a man cannot choose or vary in particulars there it is good to take the safest and wariest way in general like the going softly by one that cannot well see certainly the ablest men that ever were have had all an openness and frankness of dealing and a name of certainty and veracity but then they were like horses well managed for they could tell passing well when to stop or turn and at such times when they thought the case indeed required dissimulation if then they used it it came to pass that me former opinion spread abroad of their good faith and clearness of dealing made them almost invisible 
 there be three degrees of this hiding and veiling of a self the first closeness reservation and secrecy when a man leaveth himself without 
 observation or without hold to be taken what he is the second dissimulation in the negative when a man lets fall signs and arguments that he is not that he is and the third simulation in the affirmative when a man industriously and expressly feigns and pretends to be that he is not 
 for the first of these secrecy it is indeed the virtue of a confessor and assuredly the secret man heareth many confessions for who will open himself to a blab or a babbler but if a man be thought secret it inviteth discovery as the more close air sucketh in the more open and as in confession the revealing is not for worldly use but for the ease of a heart so secret men come to the knowledge of many things in that kind while men rather discharge their minds than impart their minds in few words mysteries are due to secrecy besides to say truth nakedness is uncomely as well in mind as body and it addeth no small reverence to manners and actions if they be not altogether open as for talkers and futile persons they are commonly vain and credulous withal for he that talketh what he knoweth will also talk what he knoweth not therefore set it down that an habit of secrecy is both politic and moral and in this part it is good that a face give his tongue leave to speak for the discovery of a self by the tracts of his countenance 
 is a great weakness and betraying by how much it is many times more marked and believed than a words 
 for the second which is dissimulation it followeth many times upon secrecy by a necessity so that he that will be secret must be a dissembler in some degree for men are too cunning to suffer a man to keep an indifferent carriage between both and to be secret without swaying the balance on either side they will so beset a man with questions and draw him on and pick it out of him that without an absurd silence he must show an inclination one way or if he do not they will gather as much by his silence as by his speech as for equivocations or oraculous speeches they cannot hold out long so that no man can be secret except he give himself a little scope of dissimulation which is as it were but the skirts or train of secrecy 
 but for the third degree which is simulation and false profession mat i hold more culpable and less politic except it be in great and rare matters 
 and therefore a general custom of simulation which is this last degree is a vice 
 rising either of a natural falseness or tearfulness or of a mind that hath some 
 main faults which because a man must needs disguise it maketh him practise 
 simulation in other things lest his hand should be out of use 
 
 the great advantages of simulation and dissimulation are three first to lay asleep opposition and to surprise for where a intentions are published it is an alarum to call up all that are against them the second is to reserve to a self a fair retreat for if a man engage himself by a manifest declaration he must go through or take a fall the third is the better to discover the mind of another for to him that opens himself men will hardly show themselves adverse but will fair let him go on and turn their freedom of speech to freedom of thought 
 and therefore it is a good shrewd proverb of the spaniard tell a lie and find a troth as if there were no way of discovery but by simulation there be also three disadvantages to set it even the first that simulation and dissimulation commonly cany with them a show of fearfulness which in any business doth spoil the feathers of round flying up to the mark the second that it puzzleth and perplexeth the conceits of many that perhaps would otherwise cooperate with him and makes a man walk almost alone to his own ends the third and greatest is mat it depriveth a man of one of the most principal instruments for action which is trust and belief the best composition and temperature is to have openness in fame and opinion secrecy in habit dissimulation in seasonable use and a power to feign if there be no remedy

 book just man 
 chapter v 
 
 monseigneur bienvenu made his cassocks last too long 
 the private life of m myriel was filled with the same thoughts as his public life 
 the voluntary poverty in which the bishop of d lived would have been a solemn and charming sight for any one who could have viewed it close at hand 
 like all old men and like the majority of thinkers he slept little this brief slumber was profound 
 in the morning he meditated for an hour then he said his mass either at the cathedral or in his own house his mass said he broke his fast on rye bread dipped in the milk of his own cows 
 then he set to work 
 a bishop is a very busy man 
 he must every day receive the secretary of the bishopric who is generally a canon and nearly every day his he has congregations to reprove privileges to grant a whole ecclesiastical library to examine diocesan catechisms books of hours to write sermons to authorize cures and mayors to reconcile a clerical correspondence an administrative correspondence on one side the state on the other the holy see and a thousand matters of business 
 what time was left to him after these thousand details of business and his offices and his breviary he bestowed first on the necessitous the sick and the afflicted the time which was left to him from the afflicted the sick and the necessitous he devoted to work sometimes he dug in his garden again he read or wrote 
 he had but one word for both these kinds of toil he called them gardening the mind is a garden said he 
 towards when the weather was fine he went forth and took a stroll in the country or in town often entering lowly dwellings he was seen walking alone buried in his own thoughts his eyes cast down supporting himself on his long cane clad in his wadded purple garment of silk which was very warm wearing purple stockings inside his coarse shoes and surmounted by a flat hat which allowed three golden tassels of large bullion to droop from its three points 
 it was a perfect festival wherever he appeared 
 one would have said that his presence had something warming and luminous about it the children and the old people came out to the doorsteps for the bishop as for the sun 
 he bestowed his blessing and they blessed him they pointed out his house to any one who was in need of anything 
 here and there he halted accosted the little boys and girls and smiled upon the mothers 
 he visited the poor so long as he had any money when he no longer had any he visited the rich 
 as he made his cassocks last a long while and did not wish to have it noticed he never went out in the town without his wadded purple cloak 
 this inconvenienced him somewhat in summer 
 on his return he dined 
 the dinner resembled his breakfast 
 at eight in the evening he supped with his sister madame magloire standing behind them and serving them at table nothing could be more frugal than this repast 
 if however the bishop had one of his cures to supper madame magloire took advantage of the opportunity to serve monseigneur with some excellent fish from the lake or with some fine game from the mountains 
 every cure furnished the pretext for a good meal 
 the bishop did not interfere with that exception his ordinary diet consisted only of vegetables boiled in water and oil soup 
 thus it was said in the town when the bishop does not indulge in the cheer of a cure he indulges in the cheer of a trappist 
 after supper he conversed for half an hour with mademoiselle baptistine and madame magloire then he retired to his own room and set to writing sometimes on loose sheets and again on the margin of some folio he was a man of letters and rather learned 
 he left behind him five or six very curious manuscripts among others a dissertation on this verse in genesis in the beginning the spirit of god floated upon the waters 
 with this verse he compares three texts the arabic verse which says the winds of god blew flavius josephus who says a wind from above was precipitated upon the earth and finally the chaldaic paraphrase of onkelos which renders it a wind coming from god blew upon the face of the waters in another dissertation he examines the theological works of hugo bishop of ptolemais to the writer of this book and establishes the fact that to this bishop must be attributed the divers little works published during the last century under the pseudonym of barleycourt 
 sometimes in the midst of his reading no matter what the book might be which he had in his hand he would suddenly fall into a profound meditation whence he only emerged to write a few lines on the pages of the volume itself 
 these lines have often no connection whatever with the book which contains them 
 we now have under our eyes a note written by him on the margin of a quarto entitled correspondence of lord germain with generals clinton cornwallis and the admirals on the american station 
 versailles poincot and paris pissot bookseller quai des augustins 
 here is the note 
 oh you who are 
 ecclesiastes calls you the the maccabees call you the creator the epistle to the ephesians calls you liberty baruch calls you immensity the psalms call you wisdom and truth john calls you light the books of kings call you lord exodus calls you providence leviticus sanctity esdras justice the creation calls you god man calls you father but solomon calls you compassion and that is the most beautiful of all your names 
 toward nine in the evening the two women retired and betook themselves to their chambers on the first floor leaving him alone until morning on the ground floor 
 it is necessary that we should in this place give an exact idea of the dwelling of the bishop of d

 the er direct and 
 
 hennessy 
 oh remarkable 
 
 joe 
 naturally she thought that the indirect would not be the direct that is not right away later on of course well nobody knows 
 
 hennessy 
 well well well that was a shrewd observation they fool you you know these royal kids got a lot more on the ball than we suspect 
 
 looking at the paper again 
 how did she feel about the future friendship of nations 
 
 joe 
 youth 
 
 hennessy 
 yep 
 
 joe 
 she felt that er 
 
 nervously walking around the desk sitting on the corner 
 the youth of the world must lead the way to a better 
 
 he nervously slides a piece of desk equipment a few inches 
 world 
 
 hennessy 
 
 
 sliding it back 
 original er by the way what was she wearing 
 
 joe 
 he pauses blankly 
 oh you mean what did she have on 
 
 hennessy 
 chuckling 
 well usually what it means 
 
 joe nervously adjusts his collar getting up off the desk again 
 er the matter is it a little warm in here for you 
 
 joe 
 walking back to the front of the desk 
 no no i just hurried over here 
 
 hennessy 
 oh naturally with a story of these dimensions did you say she was wearing gray 
 
 joe 
 no i say that 
 
 hennessy

 hennessy

 his expression changes as he sits forward standing up dramatically 
 in view of the fact that her highness was taken violently ill at three this morning put to bed with a high fever and has had all her appointments for today cancelled in toto 
 
 joe 
 helplessly 
 in toto 
 
 hennessy 
 yes mr bradley in toto

 hennessy 
 if you ever get up early enough to read a morning paper you might discover little news events 
 
 pointing to the article in the paper 
 little items of general interest 
 
 joe looks at the paper and stares at the picture of the same woman as in his apartment but in a regal gown necklace and tiara 
 that might prevent you in the future from getting immersed in such a lies as you have just told me 
 
 as joe continues to stare at the picture 
 if i was you i would try some other line of mattress testing 
 
 joe

 hennessy

 pointing to the picture 
 that is the princess it annie oakley dorothy lamour or madame chiang take a good look at her

 joe 
 looking at mr hennessy

 joe looks back and forth and walks straight out of the office carrying the paper

 joe walks to the other end of the newsroom stopping shaking his head seeing that joe has left the office 
 the mad 
 joe opens the other door closing it carefully behind him and dials the in the small foyer someone comes in from the front door and joe watches him nervously until the man goes into the office 
 
 an old man giovanni sits down at the desk in his room picking up the phone he greets joe in italian

 a new hope

 it was tall but hardly monstrous artoo frowned inwardly as he checked ocularcircuitry and reactivated his innards 
 the monster looked very much like and old man he was clad in a shabbycloak and loose robes hung with a few small straps packs and unrecognizableinstruments artoo searched the wake but detected no evidence of apursuing nightmare nor did the man appear threatened actually artoo looked kind of pleased 
 it was impossible to tell where the odd overlapping attire ended and hisskin began that aged visage blended into the cloth and his beardappeared but an extension of the loose threads covering his upper chest 
 hints of extreme climates other than desert of ultimate cold and humidity wereetched into that seamed face a questing beak of nose like a high rock protrudedoutward from a flashflood of wrinkles and scars the eyes bordering it were a liquidcrystalazure the man smiled through sand and dust and beard squinting at the sightof the crumpled form lying quietly alongside of the landspeeder 
 convinced that the sandpeople had been the victims of an auditory delusion ofsome ignoring the fact that he had experienced it assured that this stranger meant luke no harm artoo shifted his positionslightly trying to obtain a better view the sound produced by a tiny pebble hedislodged was barely perceptible to his electronic sensors but the man whirled as ifshot he stared straight at alcove still smiling gently 
 hello there he called in a deep surprisingly cheerful voice come here mylittle friend no need to be afraid 
 something forthright and reassuring was in that voice in any case theassociation of an unknown human was preferable to remaining isolated in thiswasteland waddling out into the sunlight artoo made his way over to whereluke lay sprawled the body inclined forward as he examinedthe limp form whistles and beeps of concern came from within 
 walking over the old man bent beside luke and reached out to touch hisforehead then his temple shortly the unconscious youth was stirring andmumbling like a dreaming sleeper 
 worry the human told artoo be all right 
 as if to confirm this opinion luke blinked stared upward muttered what happened 
 rest easy son the man instructed him as he sat back on his heels a busy day again the boyish grin mighty lucky your stillattached to the rest of you 
 luke looked around his gaze coming to rest on the elderly face hovering abovehim recognition did wonders for his condition 
 got to be a sudden remembrance made him look around there was no sign of sandpeople slowly he raised his body to a sitting kenobiam i glad to see you 
 rising the old man surveyed the canyon floor and rolling rimwall above onefoot played with the sand the jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly misguided traveler who tempts the hospitality his gaze went back tohis patient tell me young man what brings you out this far into nowhere 
 luke indicated artoo detoo this little droid for a while i thought crazy claiming he was searching for a former master now i think never seen such devotion in a or otherwise there seems tobe no stopping him he even resorted to tricking me 
 gaze shifted upward he claims to be the property of someone kenobi luke watched closely but the man showed no reaction is that arelative of yours my uncle thinks he was a real person or is it just someunimportant bit of scrambled information that got shifted into his primaryperformance bank 
 an introspective frown did remarkable things to that sandlbasted face kenobiappeared to ponder the question scratching absently at his scruffy beard he recited a name i heard in a long long time most curious 
 my uncle said he was dead luke supplied helpfully 
 oh not dead kenobi corrected him easily not yet not yet 
 luke climbed excitedly to his feet all thoughts of tusken raiders forgotten know him then 
 a smile of perverse youthfulness split that collage of wrinkled skin and course i know him me just as you probably suspected luke i by the name though since before you were born 
 then luke essayed gesturing at artoo detoo this droid does belong to he claims 
 now the peculiar part an openly puzzled kenobi confessed regardingthe silent robot i seem to remember owning a droid least of all a modernartoo unit most interesting most interesting 
 something drew the old gaze suddenly to the brow of nearby cliffs ithink best we make use of your landspeeder some the sandpeople are easilystartled but soon return in greater numbers a not a prizereadily conceded and after all jawas not 
 placing both hands over his mouth in a peculiar fashion kenobi inhaled deeplyand let out an unearthly howl that made luke jump that ought to keep anylaggards running for a while yet the old man concluded with satisfaction 
 a krayt dragon call luke gaped in astonishment how did you dothat 
 show you sometime son not too hard just takes the right attitude aset of vocal cords and a lot of wind now if you were an imperialbureaucrat i could teach you right off but not he scanned the and i think this is the time or place for it 
 i argue that luke was rubbing at the back of his head getstarted 
 that was when artoo let out a pathetic beep and whirled luke the electronic squeal but he suddenly comprehended the reason behind luke exclaimed worriedly artoo was already moving as fast aspossible away from the landspeeder come on ben 
 the little robot led them to the edge of a large sandpit it stopped downward and squeaking mournfully luke saw where artoo was started cautiously down the smooth shifting slope while kenobi followedeffortlessly 
 threepio lay in the sand at the base of the slope down which he had rolled andtumbled his casing was dented and badly mangled one arm lay broken and benta short distance away 
 threepio luke called there was no response shaking the droid failed toactivate anything opening a plate on the back luke flipped a hidden switchon and off several times in succession a low hum started stopped started then dropped to a normal purr 
 using his remaining arm threepio rolled over and sat up where am i hemurmured as his photoreceptors continued to clear then he recognized sorry sir i must have taken a bad step 
 lucky any of your main circuits are still operational luke informedhim he looked significantly toward the top of the hill can you stand to get out of here before the sandpeople return 
 servomotors whined in protest until threepio ceased struggling i thinki can make it you go on master luke it make sense to risk yourself onmy account finished 
 no not luke shot back unaccountably affected by this recentlyencountered machine but then threepio was not the usual device luke was accustomed to dealing with what kind of talk isthat 
 logical threepio informed him 
 luke shook his head angrily defeatist 
 with luke and ben aid the battered droid somehow managed tostruggle erect little artoo watched from the rim 
 hesitating part way up the slope kenobi sniffed the air suspiciously on the move again 
 trying to watch the surrounding rocks and his footsteps simultaneously lukefought to drag threepio clear of the pit 
 the dcor of ben cave was spartan without appearinguncomfortable it would not have suited most people reflecting as it did eclectic tastes the living area radiated an aura of lean comfort with moreimportance attached to mental comforts than those of the awkward human body 
 they had succeeded in vacating the canyon before the tusken raiders couldreturn in force under direction luke left a trail behind them so confusingthat not even a hypernasal jawa could have followed it 
 luke spent several hours ignoring the temptations of cave instead heremained in the corner which was equipped as a compact yet complete repair to fix severed arm 
 fortunately the automatic overload disconnects had given way under the severestrain sealing electronic nerves and ganglia without real damage repair wasmerely a matter of reattaching the limb to the shoulder then activating the the arm been broken in instead of at a joint such repairs would havebeen impossible save at a factory shop 
 while luke was thus occupied attention was concentrated on artoodetoo the squat droid sat passively on the cool cavern floor while the old manfiddled with its metal insides finally the man sat back with a humph ofsatisfaction and closed the open panels in the rounded head now seeif we can figure out what you are my little friend and where you came from 
 luke was almost finished anyway and words were sufficient to pullhim away from the repair area i saw part of the message he began and i 
 once more the striking portrait was being projected into empty space from thefront of the little robot luke broke off enraptured by its enigmatic beauty onceagain 
 yes i think got it kenobi murmured contemplatively 
 the image continued to flicker indicating a tape hastily prepared but it wasmuch sharper better defined now luke noted with admiration one thing wasapparent kenobi was skilled in subjects more specific than desert scavenging 
 general kenobi the mellifluous voice was saying i present myselfin the name of the world family of alderaan and of the alliance to restore therepublic i break your solitude at the bidding of my father bail organa viceroyand first chairman of the alderaan system 
 kenobi absorbed this extraordinary declamation while eyes bugged bigenough to fall from his face 
 years ago general the voice continued you served the old republic in theclone wars now my father begs you to aid us again in our most desperate would have you join him on alderaan you must go to him 
 i regret that i am unable to present my request to you in person mymission to meet personally with you has failed hence i have been forced to resortto this secondary method of communication 
 information vital to the survival of the alliance has been secured in the mind ofthis detoo droid my father will know how to retrieve it i plead with you to seethis unit safely delivered to alderaan 
 she paused and when she continued her words were hurried and less laced withformality you must help me kenobi you are my last hope i will becaptured by agents of the empire they will learn nothing from me everything tobe learned lies locked in the memory cells of this droid do not fail us do not fail me 
 a small cloud of tridimensional static replaced the delicate portrait and then itvanished entirely artoo detoo gazed up expectantly at kenobi 
 mind was as muddy as a pond laced with petroleum unanchored histhoughts and eyes turned for stability to the quiet figure seated nearby 
 the old man the crazy wizard the desert bum and characterswhom his uncle and everyone else had known of for as long as luke could recall 
 if the breathless message the unknown woman had just spokeninto the cool air of the cave had affected kenobi in any way he gave no hint of he leaned back against the rock wall and tugged thoughtfully at his slowly on a water pipe of tarnished chrome 
 luke visualized that simple yet lovely portrait his farmingbackground provide him with the requisite words suddenly something in themessage caused him to stare disbelievingly at the oldster general kenobi youfought in the clone wars butthat was so long ago 
 um yes kenobi acknowledged as casually as he might have discussed therecipe for shang stew i guess it was a while back i was a jedi knight he added watching the youth appraisingly your father 
 a jedi knight luke echoed then he looked confused but my fight in the clone wars he was no a navigator on a spacefreighter 
 smile enfolded the mouthpiece or so your uncle has toldyou his attention was suddenly focused elsewhere owen lars agreewith your ideas opinions or with his philosophy of life he believed thatyour father should have stayed here on tatooine and not gotten involved the seemingly indifferent shrug well he thought he should have remainedhere and minded his farming 
 luke said nothing his body tense as the old man related bits and pieces of apersonal history luke had viewed only through his distortions 
 owen was always afraid that your adventurous life might influence pull you away from anchorhead he shook his head slowly regretfully atthe remembrance afraid there much of the farmer in your father 
 luke turned away he returned to cleaning the last particles of sand healing armature i wish known him he finally whispered 
 he was the best pilot i ever knew kenobi went on and a smart fighter theforcethe instinct was strong in him for a brief second kenobi actually appearedold he was also a good friend 
 suddenly the boyish twinkle returned to those piercing eyes along with the natural humor i understand quite a pilot yourself piloting andnavigation hereditary but a number of the things that can combine to make agood pilot are those you may have inherited still even a duck has tobe taught to swim 
 a duck luke asked curiously 
 never mind in many ways you know you are much like your unabashed look of evaluation made luke nervous grown upquite a bit since the last time i saw you 
 having no reply for that luke waited silently as kenobi sank back into deepcontemplation after a while the old man stirred evidently having reached animportant decision 
 all this reminds me he declared with deceptive casualness i have somethinghere for you he rose and walked over to a bulky chest and startedrummaging through it all sorts of intriguing items were removed and shovedaround only to be placed back in the bin a few of them luke recognized askenobi was obviously intent on something important he forbore inquiring about anyof the other tantalizing flotsam 
 when you were old enough kenobi was saying your father want you to havethisif i can ever find the blasted device i tried to give it to you once before butyour uncle allow it he believed you might get some crazy ideas from itand end up following old on some idealistic crusade 
 you see luke where your father and your uncle owen disagreed larsis not a man to let idealism interfere with business whereas your father thinkthe question even worth discussing his decision on such matters came like 
 luke nodded he finished picking out the last of the grit and looked around forone remaining component to snap back in open chest plate locating therestraining module he opened the receiving latches in the machine and set aboutlocking it back in place threepio watched the process and appeared to wince everso perceptibly 
 luke stared into those metal and plastic photoreceptors for a long he set the module pointedly on the workbench and closed the droid said nothing 
 a grunt came from behind them and luke turned to see a pleased kenobiwalking over he handed luke a small device which the youthstudied with interest 
 it consisted primarily of a short thick handgrip with a couple of small switchesset into the grip above this small post was a circular metal disk barely larger indiameter than his spread palm a number of unfamiliar components werebuilt into both handle and disk including what looked like the smallest power cellluke had ever seen the reverse side of the disk was polished to a mirror it was the power cell that puzzled luke the most whatever the thing was itrequired a great deal of energy according to the rating form of the cell 
 despite the claim that it had belonged to his father the gizmo looked newlymanufactured kenobi had obviously kept it carefully only a number of minutescratches on the handgrip hinted at previous usage 
 sir came a familiar voice luke heard in a while 
 what luke was startled out of his examination 
 if not be needing me threepio declared i think shut down for a will help the armature nerves to knit and due for some internal 
 sure go ahead luke said absently returning to his fascinated study of behind him threepio became silent the glow fading temporarilyfrom his eyes luke noticed that kenobi was watching him with interest what isit he finally asked unable despite his best efforts to identify the device 
 your lightsaber kenobi told him at one time they were widelyused still are in certain galactic quarters 
 luke examined the controls on the handle then tentatively touched a brightlycolored button up near the mirrored pommel instantly the disk put forth a beam as thick around as his thumb it was dense to the point of opacity and alittle over a meter in length it did not fade but remained as brilliant and intense atits far end as it did next to the disk strangely luke felt no heat from it though hewas very careful not to touch it he knew what a lightsaber could do though he hadnever seen one before it could drill a hole right through the rock wall of through a human being 
 this was the formal weapon of a jedi knight explained kenobi not asclumsy or random as a blaster more skill than simple sight was required for its elegant weapon it was a symbol as well anyone can use a blaster to use a lightsaber well was a mark of someone a cut above theordinary he was pacing the floor of the cave as he spoke 
 for over a thousand generations luke the jedi knights were the most respected force in the galaxy they served as the guardians and guarantors ofpeace and justice in the old republic 
 when luke failed to ask what had happened to them since kenobi looked up tosee that the youth was staring vacantly into space having absorbed little if any of instruction some men would have chided luke for not paying kenobi more sensitive than most he waited patiently until the silence weighedstrong enough on luke for him to resume speaking 
 how he asked slowly did my father die 
 kenobi hesitated and luke sensed that the old man had no wish to talk aboutthis particular matter unlike owen lars however kenobi was unable to takerefuge in a comfortable lie 
 he was betrayed and murdered kenobi declared solemnly by a very youngjedi named darth vader he was not looking at luke a boy i was of my brightest disciplesone of my greatest failures 
 kenobi resumed his pacing vader used the training i gave him and the forcewithin him for evil to help the later corrupt emperors with the jedi knightsdisbanded disorganized or dead there were few to oppose vader today they areall but extinct 
 an indecipherable expression crossed face in many ways they weretoo good too trusting for their own health they put too much trust in the stabilityof the republic failing to realize that while the body might be sound the head wasgrowing diseased and feeble leaving it open to manipulation by such as the emperor 
 i wish i knew what vader was after sometimes i have the feeling he ismarking time in preparation for some incomprehensible abomination such is thedestiny of one who masters the force and is consumed by its dark side 
 face twisted in confusion a force the second time a force 
 kenobi nodded i forget sometimes in whose presence i babble let us saysimply that the force is something a jedi must deal with while it has never beenproperly explained scientists have theorized it is an energy field generated by livingthings early man suspected its existence yet remained in ignorance of its potentialfor millennia 
 only certain individuals could recognize the force for what it was they weremercilessly labeled charlatans fakers worse even fewer could makeuse of it as it was usually beyond their primitive controls it frequently was toopowerful for them they were misunderstood by their worse 
 kenobi made a wide all encompassing gesture with both arms the forcesurrounds each and every one of us some men believe it directs our actions and notthe other way around knowledge of the force and how to manipulate it was whatgave the jedi his special power 
 the arms came down and kenobi stared at luke until the youth began to fidgetuncomfortably when he spoke again it was in a tone so crisp and unaged that lukejumped in spite of himself you must learn the ways of the force also are to come with me to alderaan 
 alderaan luke hopped off the repair seat looking dazed not going toalderaan i even know where alderaan is vaporators droids the surroundings seemed to close in on him the formerly intriguingfurnishings and alien artifacts now just a mite frightening he looked around to avoid the piercing gaze of ben kenobiold bencrazy bengeneral 
 got to get back home he found himself muttering thickly in for it as it is remembering something he gestured toward the motionlessbulk of artoo detoo you can keep the droid he seems to want you to of something to tell my hope he added forlornly 
 i need your help luke kenobi explained his manner a combination ofsadness and steel getting too old for this kind of thing trust myself tofinish it properly on my own this mission is far too important he noddedtoward artoo detoo you heard and saw the message 
 buti get involved with anything like that protested luke gotwork to do got crops to bring though uncle owen could alwaysbreak down and hire a little extra help i mean one i guess but nothing ican do about it not now besides all such a long way from here thewhole thing is really none of my business 
 that sounds like your uncle talking kenobi observed without rancor 
 oh my uncle owenhow am i going to explain all this to him 
 the old man suppressed a smile aware that destiny had already beendetermined for him it had been ordained five minutes before he had learned aboutthe manner of his death it had been ordered before that when he had heardthe complete message it had been fixed in the nature of things when he had firstviewed the pleading portrait of the beautiful senator organa awkwardly projected bythe little droid kenobi shrugged inwardly likely it had been finalized evenbefore the boy was born not that ben believed in predestination but he did believein in the force 
 remember luke the suffering of one man is the suffering of all distancesare irrelevant to injustice if not stopped soon enough evil eventually reaches out toengulf all men whether they have opposed it or ignored it 
 i suppose luke confessed nervously i could take you as far as can get transport from there to mos eisley or wherever it is you want to go 
 very well agreed kenobi that will do for a beginning then you must dowhat you feel is right 
 luke turned away now thoroughly confused okay right now i feeltoo good 
 the holding hole was deathly dim with only the bare minimum of illuminationprovided there was barely enough to see the black metal walls and the high ceilingoverhead the cell was designed to maximize a feelings of this it achieved well so much so that the single occupant started tensely as ahum came from one end of the chamber the metal door which began moving asidewas as thick as her if she mused bitterly they were afraid she might breakthrough anything less massive with her bare hands 
 straining to see outside the girl saw several imperial guards assume positionsjust outside the doorway eyeing them defiantly leia organa backed up against thefar wall 
 her determined expression collapsed as soon as a monstrous black form enteredthe room gliding smoothly as if on treads presence crushed her spirit asthoroughly as an elephant would crush an eggshell that villain was followed by anantiqued whip of a man who was only slightly less terrifying despite his minisculeappearance alongside the dark lord 
 darth vader made a gesture to someone outside something that hummed like ahuge bee moved close and slipped inside the doorway leia choked on her ownbreath at the sight of the dark metal globe it hung suspended on independentrepulsors a farrago of metal arms protruding from its sides the arms were tippedwith a multitude of delicate instruments 
 leia studied the contraption fearfully she had heard rumors of such had never really believed that imperial technicians would construct such amonstrosity incorporated into its soulless memory was every barbarity everysubstantiated outrage known to to several alien races as well 
 vader and tarkin stood there quietly giving her plenty of time to study thehovering nightmare the governor in particular did not delude himself into thinkingthat the mere presence of the device would shock her into giving up the informationhe needed not he reflected that the ensuing session would be especiallyunpleasant there was always enlightenment and knowledge to be gained from suchencounters and the senator promised to be a most interesting subject 
 after a suitable interval had passed he motioned to the machine organa princess organa we will discuss the location of the principal rebelbase 
 the machine moved slowly toward her traveling on a rising hum itsindifferent spherical form blocked out vader the governor the rest of the cellthelight 
 muffled sounds penetrated the cell walls and thick door drifting out into thehallway beyond they barely intruded on the peace and quiet of the walkwayrunning past the sealed chamber even so the guards stationed immediately outsidemanaged to find excuses to edge a sufficient distance away to where those oddlymodulated sounds could no longer be heard at all

 book one 
 chapter vi 
 
 having thanked anna pavlovna for her charming soiree the guests began to take their leave 
 pierre was ungainly stout about the average height broad with huge red hands he did not know as the saying is to enter a drawing room and still less how to leave one that is how to say something particularly agreeable before going away besides this he was when he rose to go he took up instead of his own the hat and held it pulling at the plume till the general asked him to restore it all his and inability to enter a room and converse in it was however redeemed by his kindly simple and modest expression anna pavlovna turned toward him and with a christian mildness that expressed forgiveness of his indiscretion nodded and said i hope to see you again but i also hope you will change your opinions my dear monsieur pierre 
 when she said this he did not reply and only bowed but again everybody saw his smile which said nothing unless perhaps opinions are opinions but you see what a capital fellow i am and everyone including anna pavlovna felt this 
 prince andrew had gone out into the hall and turning his shoulders to the footman who was helping him on with his cloak listened indifferently to his chatter with prince hippolyte who had also come into the hall prince hippolyte stood close to the pretty pregnant princess and stared fixedly at her through his eyeglass 
 go in annette or you will catch cold said the little princess taking leave of anna pavlovna it is settled she added in a low voice 
 anna pavlovna had already managed to speak to lise about the match she contemplated between anatole and the little princess 
 i rely on you my dear said anna pavlovna also in a low tone write to her and let me know how her father looks at the matter au revoir and she left the hall 
 prince hippolyte approached the little princess and bending his face close to her began to whisper something 
 two footmen the princess and his own stood holding a shawl and a cloak waiting for the conversation to finish they listened to the french sentences which to them were meaningless with an air of understanding but not wishing to appear to do so the princess as usual spoke smilingly and listened with a laugh 
 i am very glad i did not go to the said prince hippolyte so dull it has been a delightful evening has it not delightful 
 they say the ball will be very good replied the princess drawing up her downy little lip all the pretty women in society will be there 
 not all for you will not be there not all said prince hippolyte smiling joyfully and snatching the shawl from the footman whom he even pushed aside he began wrapping it round the princess either from awkwardness or intentionally no one could have said which after the shawl had been adjusted he kept his arm around her for a long time as though embracing her 
 still smiling she gracefully moved away turning and glancing at her husband prince eyes were closed so weary and sleepy did he seem 
 are you ready he asked his wife looking past her 
 prince hippolyte hurriedly put on his cloak which in the latest fashion reached to his very heels and stumbling in it ran out into the porch following the princess whom a footman was helping into the carriage 
 princesse au revoir cried he stumbling with his tongue as well as with his feet 
 the princess picking up her dress was taking her seat in the dark carriage her husband was adjusting his saber prince hippolyte under pretense of helping was in way 
 allow me sir said prince andrew in russian in a cold disagreeable tone to prince hippolyte who was blocking his path 
 i am expecting you pierre said the same voice but gently and affectionately 
 the postilion started the carriage wheels rattled prince hippolyte laughed spasmodically as he stood in the porch waiting for the vicomte whom he had promised to take home 
 well mon cher said the vicomte having seated himself beside hippolyte in the carriage your little princess is very nice very nice indeed quite french and he kissed the tips of his fingers hippolyte burst out laughing 
 do you know you are a terrible chap for all your innocent airs continued the vicomte i pity the poor husband that little officer who gives himself the airs of a monarch 
 hippolyte spluttered again and amid his laughter said and you were saying that the russian ladies are not equal to the french one has to know how to deal with them 
 pierre reaching the house first went into prince study like one quite at home and from habit immediately lay down on the sofa took from the shelf the first book that came to his hand it was commentaries and resting on his elbow began reading it in the middle 
 what have you done to mlle scherer she will be quite ill now said prince andrew as he entered the study rubbing his small white hands 
 pierre turned his whole body making the sofa creak he lifted his eager face to prince andrew smiled and waved his hand 
 that abbe is very interesting but he does not see the thing in the right light in my opinion perpetual peace is possible but i do not know how to express it not by a balance of political power 
 it was evident that prince andrew was not interested in such abstract conversation 
 one everywhere say all one thinks mon cher well have you at last decided on anything are you going to be a guardsman or a diplomatist asked prince andrew after a momentary silence 
 pierre sat up on the sofa with his legs tucked under him 
 really i yet know i like either the one or the other 
 but you must decide on something your father expects it 
 pierre at the age of ten had been sent abroad with an abbe as tutor and had remained away till he was twenty when he returned to moscow his father dismissed the abbe and said to the young man now go to petersburg look round and choose your profession i will agree to anything here is a letter to prince vasili and here is money write to me all about it and i will help you in everything pierre had already been choosing a career for three months and had not decided on anything it was about this choice that prince andrew was speaking pierre rubbed his forehead 
 but he must be a freemason said he referring to the abbe whom he had met that evening 
 that is all nonsense prince andrew again interrupted him let us talk business have you been to the horse guards 
 no i have not but this is what i have been thinking and wanted to tell you there is a war now against napoleon if it were a war for freedom i could understand it and should be the first to enter the army but to help england and austria against the greatest man in the world is not right 
 prince andrew only shrugged his shoulders at childish words he put on the air of one who finds it impossible to reply to such nonsense but it would in fact have been difficult to give any other answer than the one prince andrew gave to this naive question 
 if no one fought except on his own conviction there would be no wars he said 
 and that would be splendid said pierre 
 prince andrew smiled ironically 
 very likely it would be splendid but it will never come about 
 well why are you going to the war asked pierre 
 what for i know i must besides that i am going he paused i am going because the life i am leading here does not suit me

 chapter 
 
 mr hindley came home to the funeral thing that amazed us and set the neighbours gossiping right and brought a wife with him what she was and where she was born he never informed us probably she had neither money nor name to recommend her or he would scarcely have kept the union from his father 
 she was not one that would have disturbed the house much on her own account every object she saw the moment she crossed the threshold appeared to delight her and every circumstance that took place about her except the preparing for the burial and the presence of the mourners i thought she was half silly from her behaviour while that went on she ran into her chamber and made me come with her though i should have been dressing the children and there she sat shivering and clasping her hands and asking repeatedly are they gone yet then she began describing with hysterical emotion the effect it produced on her to see black and started and trembled and at last fell when i asked what was the matter answered she know but she felt so afraid of dying i imagined her as little likely to die as myself she was rather thin but young and and her eyes sparkled as bright as diamonds i did remark to be sure that mounting the stairs made her breathe very quick that the least sudden noise set her all in a quiver and that she coughed troublesomely sometimes but i knew nothing of what these symptoms portended and had no impulse to sympathize with her we in general take to foreigners here mr lockwood unless they take to us first 
 young earnshaw was altered considerably in the three years of his absence he had grown sparer and lost his colour and spoke and dressed quite differently and on the very day of his return he told joseph and me we must thenceforth quarter ourselves in the back kitchen and leave the house for him indeed he would have carpeted and papered a small spare room for a parlour but his wife expressed such pleasure at the white floor and huge glowing fireplace at the pewter dishes and delf case and dog kennel and the wide space there was to move about in where they usually sat that he thought it unnecessary to her comfort and so dropped the intention 
 she expressed pleasure too at finding a sister among her new acquaintance and she prattled to catherine and kissed her and ran about with her and gave her quantities of presents at the beginning her affection tired very soon however and when she grew peevish hindley became tyrannical a few words from her evincing a dislike to heathcliff were enough to rouse in him all his old hatred of the boy he drove him from their company to the servants deprived him of the instructions of the curate and insisted that he should labour out of doors instead compelling him to do so as hard as any other lad on the farm 
 heathcliff bore his degradation pretty well at first because cathy taught him what she learnt and worked or played with him in the fields they both promised fair to grow up as rude as savages the young master being entirely negligent how they behaved and what they did so they kept clear of him he would not even have seen after their going to church on sundays only joseph and the curate reprimanded his carelessness when they absented themselves and that reminded him to order heathcliff a flogging and catherine a fast from dinner or supper but it was one of their chief amusements to run away to the moors in the morning and remain there all day and the after punishment grew a mere thing to laugh at the curate might set as many chapters as he pleased for catherine to get by heart and joseph might thrash heathcliff till his arm ached they forgot everything the minute they were together again at least the minute they had contrived some naughty plan of revenge and many a time cried to myself to watch them growing more reckless daily and i not daring to speak a syllable for fear of losing the small power i still retained over the unfriended creatures one sunday evening it chanced that they were banished from the for making a noise or a light offence of the kind and when i went to call them to supper i could discover them nowhere we searched the house above and below and the yard and stables they were invisible and at last hindley in a passion told us to bolt the doors and swore nobody should let them in that night the household went to bed and i too anxious to lie down opened my lattice and put my head out to hearken though it rained determined to admit them in spite of the prohibition should they return in a while i distinguished steps coming up the road and the light of a lantern glimmered through the gate i threw a shawl over my head and ran to prevent them from waking mr earnshaw by knocking there was heathcliff by himself it gave me a start to see him alone 
 where is miss catherine i cried hurriedly no accident i hope 
 at thrushcross grange he answered and i would have been there too but they had not the manners to ask me to stay well you will catch it i said never be content till sent about your business what in the world led you wandering to thrushcross grange 
 let me get off my wet clothes and tell you all about it nelly he replied i bid him beware of rousing the master and while he undressed and i waited to put out the candle he and i escaped from the to have a ramble at liberty and getting a glimpse of the grange lights we thought we would just go and see whether the lintons passed their sunday evenings standing shivering in corners while their father and mother sat eating and drinking and singing and laughing and burning their eyes out before the fire do you think they do or reading sermons and being catechized by their manservant and set to learn a column of scripture names if they answer properly 
 probably not i responded they are good children no doubt and deserve the treatment you receive for your bad conduct 
 you cant nelly he said nonsense we ran from the top of the heights to the park without completely beaten in the race because she was barefoot have to seek for her shoes in the bog tomorrow we crept through a broken hedge groped our way up the path and planted ourselves on a flower plot under the window the light came from thence they had not put up the shutters and the curtains were only half closed both of us were able to look in by standing on the basement and clinging to the ledge and we it was splendid place carpeted with crimson and chairs and tables and a pure white ceiling bordered by gold a shower of glass drops hanging in silver chains from the centre and shimmering with little soft tapers old mr and mrs linton were not there edgar and his sister had it entirely to themselves they have been happy we should have thought ourselves in heaven and now guess what your good children were doing believe she is eleven a year younger than screaming at the farther end of the room shrieking as if witches were running needles into her edgar stood on the hearth weeping silently and in the middle of the table sat a little dog shaking its paw and yelping which from their mutual accusations we understood they had nearly pulled in two between them the idiots that was their pleasure to quarrel who should hold a heap of warm hair and each begin to cry because both after struggling to get it refused to take it we laughed outright at the petted things we did despise them when would you catch me wishing to have what catherine wanted or find us by ourselves seeking entertainment in yelling and sobbing and rolling on the ground divided by the whole room not exchange for a thousand lives my condition here for edgar at thrushcross if i might have the privilege of off the highest gable and painting the with blood 
 hush hush i interrupted still you have not told me heathcliff how catherine is left behind 
 i told you we laughed he answered the lintons heard us and with one accord they shot like arrows to the door there was silence and then a cry oh mamma mamma oh papa oh mamma come here oh papa oh they really did howl out something in that way we made frightful noises to terrify them still more and then we dropped off the ledge because somebody was drawing the bars and we felt we had better flee i had cathy by the hand and was urging her on when all at once she fell down run heathcliff run she whispered they have let the bulldog loose and he holds me the devil had seized her ankle nelly i heard his abominable snorting she did not yell she would have scorned to do it if she had been spitted on the horns of a mad cow i did though i vociferated curses enough to annihilate any fiend in christendom and i got a store and thrust it between his jaws and tried with all my might to cram it down his throat a beast of a servant came up with a lantern at last fast skulker keep fast he changed his note he saw game the dog was throttled off his huge purple tongue hanging half a foot out of his mouth and his pendent lips streaming with bloody slaver the man took cathy up she was sick not from fear certain but from pain he carried her in i followed grumbling execrations and vengeance what prey robert hallooed linton from the entrance skulker has caught a little girl sir he replied and a lad here he added making a clutch at me who looks an very like the robbers were for putting them through the window to open the doors to the gang after all were asleep that they might murder us at their ease hold your tongue you thief you you shall go to the gallows for this mr linton sir lay by your gun no no robert said the old fool the rascals knew that yesterday was my rent day they thought to have me cleverly come in furnish them a reception there john fasten the chain give skulker some water jenny to beard a magistrate in his stronghold and on the sabbath too where will their insolence stop oh my dear mary look here be afraid it is but a the villain scowls so plainly in his face would it not be a kindness to the country to hang him at once before he shows his nature in acts as well as features he pulled me under the chandelier and mrs linton placed her spectacles on her nose and raised her hands in horror the cowardly children crept nearer also isabella thing put him in the cellar papa exactly like the son of the that stole my tame pheasant he edgar 
 while they examined me cathy came round she heard the last speech and laughed edgar linton after an inquisitive stare collected sufficient wit to recognize her they see us at church you know though we seldom meet them elsewhere miss earnshaw he whispered to his mother and look how skulker has bitten her foot bleeds 
 miss earnshaw nonsense cried the dame miss earnshaw scouring the country with a gipsy and yet my dear the child is in it she may be lamed for life 
 what culpable carelessness in her brother exclaimed mr linton turning from me to catherine understood from shielders that was the curate sir that he lets her grow up in absolute heathenism but who is this where did she pick up this companion oho i declare he is that strange acquisition my late neighbour made in his journey to little lascar or an american or spanish castaway 
 a wicked boy at all events remarked the old lady and quite unfit for a decent house did you notice his language linton shocked that my children should have heard it 
 i recommenced be angry so robert was ordered to take me off i refused to go without cathy he dragged me into the garden pushed the lantern into my hand assured me that mr earnshaw should be informed of my behaviour and bidding me march directly secured the door again the curtains were still looped up at one comer and i resumed my station as spy because if catherine had wished to return i intended shattering their great glass panes to a million of fragments unless they let her out she sat on the sofa quietly mrs linton took off the grey cloak of the dairymaid which we had borrowed for our excursion shaking her head and expostulating with her i suppose she was a young lady and they made a distinction between her treatment and mine then the brought a basin of warm water and washed her feet and mr linton mixed a tumbler of negus and isabella emptied a plateful of cakes into her lap and edgar stood gaping at a distance afterwards they dried and combed her beautiful hair and gave her a pair of enormous slippers and wheeled her to the fire and i left her as merry as she could be dividing her food between the little dog and skulker whose nose she pinched as he ate and kindling a spark of spirit in the vacant blue eyes of the dim reflection from her own enchanting face i saw they were full of stupid admiration she is so immeasurably superior to everybody on earth is she not nelly 
 there will more come of this business than you reckon on i answered covering him up and extinguishing the light you are incurable heathcliff and mr hindley will have to proceed to extremities see if he my words came truer than i desired the luckless adventure made earnshaw furious and then mr linton to mend matters paid us a visit himself on the morrow and read the young master such a lecture on the road he guided his family that he was stirred to look about him in earnest heathcliff received no flogging but he was told that the first word he spoke to miss catherine should ensure a dismissal and mrs earnshaw undertook to keep her in due restraint when she returned home employing art not force with force she would have found it impossible

 chapter six 
 
 the big house did prove a palace beautiful though it took some time for all to get in and beth found it very hard to pass the lions old mr laurence was the biggest one but after he had called said something funny or kind to each one of the girls and talked over old times with their mother nobody felt much afraid of him except timid beth the other lion was the fact that they were poor and laurie rich for this made them shy of accepting favors which they could not return but after a while they found that he considered them the benefactors and could not do enough to show how grateful he was for mrs motherly welcome their cheerful society and the comfort he took in that humble home of theirs so they soon forgot their pride and interchanged kindnesses without stopping to think which was the greater 
 all sorts of pleasant things happened about that time for the new friendship flourished like grass in spring every one liked laurie and he privately informed his tutor that the marches were regularly splendid girls with the delightful enthusiasm of youth they took the solitary boy into their midst and made much of him and he found something very charming in the innocent companionshipof these girls never having known mother or sisters he was quick to feel the influences they brought about him and their busy lively ways made him ashamed of the indolent life he led he was tired of books and found people so interesting now that mr brooke was obliged to make very unsatisfactory reports for laurie was always playing truant and running over to the marches 
 never mind let him take a holiday and make it up afterward said the old gentleman the good lady next door says he is studying too hard and needs young society amusement and exercise i suspect she is right and that been coddling the fellow as if been his grandmother let him do what he likes as long as he is happy he get into mischief in that little nunnery over there and mrs march is doing more for him than we can 
 what good times they had to be sure such plays and tableaux such sleigh rides and skating frolics such pleasant evenings in the old parlor and now and then such gay little parties at the great house meg could walk in the conservatory whenever she liked and revel in bouquets jo browsed over the new library voraciously and convulsed the old gentleman with her criticisms amy copied pictures and enjoyed beauty to her content and laurie played lord of the manor in the most delightful style 
 but beth though yearning for the grand piano could not pluck up courage to go to the mansion of bliss as meg called it she went once with jo but the old gentleman not being aware of her infirmity stared at her so hard from under his heavy eyebrows and said hey so loud that he frightened her so much her feet chattered on the floor she never told her mother and she ran away declaring she would never go there any more not even for the dear piano no persuasions orenticements could overcome her fear till the fact coming to mr ear in some mysterious way he set about mending matters during one of the brief calls he made he artfully led the conversation to music and talked away about great singers whom he had seen fine organs he had heard and toldsuch charming anecdotes that beth found it impossible to stay in her distant corner but crept nearer and nearer as if fascinated at the back of his chair she stopped and stood listening with her great eyes wide open and her cheeks red with excitement of this unusual performance taking no more notice of her than if she had been a fly mr laurence talked on about lessons and teachers and presently as if the idea had just occurred to him he said to mrs march 
 the boy neglects his music now and glad of it for he was getting too fond of it but the piano suffers for want of use some of your girls like to run over and practice on it now and then just to keep it in tune you know 
 beth took a step forward and pressed her hands tightly together to keep from clapping them for this was an irresistible temptation and the thought of practicing on that splendid instrument quite took her breath away before mrs march could reply mr laurence went on with an odd little nod and smile 
 they see or speak to anyone but run in at any time for shut up in my study at the other end of the house laurie is out a great deal and the servants are never near the drawing room after nine 
 here he rose as if going and beth made up her mind to speak for that last arrangement left nothing to be desired please tell the young ladies what i say and if they care to come why never mind here a little hand slipped into his and beth looked up at him with a face full of gratitude as she said in her earnest yet timid way 
 oh sir they do care very very much are you the musical girl he asked without any startling hey as he looked down at her very kindly 
 beth i love it dearly and come if you are quite sure nobody will hear me and be disturbed she added fearing to be rude and trembling at her own boldness as she spoke 
 not a soul my dear the house is empty half the day so come and drum away as much as you like and i shall be obliged toyou 
 how kind you are sir 
 beth blushed like a rose under the friendly look he wore but she was not frightened now and gave the hand a grateful squeeze because she had no words to thank him for the precious gift he had given her the old gentleman softly stroked the hair off her forehead and stooping down he kissed herr saying in a tone few people ever heard 
 i had a little girl once with eyes like these god bless you my dear good day madam and away he went in a great hurry 
 beth had a rapture with her mother and then rushed up to impart the glorious news to her family of invalids as the girls were not home how blithely she sang that evening and how they all laughed at her because she woke amy in the night by playing the piano on her face in her sleep next day having seen both the old and young gentleman out of the house beth after two or three retreats fairly got in at the side door and made her way as noiselessly as any mouse to the drawing room where her idol stood quite by accident of course some pretty easy music lay on the piano and with trembling fingers and frequent stops to listen and look about beth at last touched the great instrument and straightway forgot her fear herself and everything else but the unspeakable delight which the music gave her for it was like the voice of a beloved friend 
 she stayed till hannah came to take her home to dinner but she had no appetite and could only sit and smile upon everyone in a general state of beatitude 
 after that the little brown hood slipped through the hedge nearly every day and the great drawing room was haunted by a tuneful spirit that came and went unseen she never knew that mr laurence opened his study door to hear the airs he liked she never saw laurie mount guard in the hall to warn the servants away she never suspected that the exercise books and new songs which she found in the rack were put there for her especial benefit and when he talked to her about music at home she only thought how kind he was to tell things that helped her so much so she enjoyed herself heartily and found what always the case that her granted wish was all she had hoped perhaps it was because she was so grateful for this blessing that a greater was given her at any rate she deserved both mother going to work mr laurence a pair of slippers he is so kind to me i must thank him and i know any other way can i do it asked beth a few weeks after that eventful call of his 
 yes dear it will please him very much and be a nice way of thanking him the girls will help you about them and i will pay for the making up replied mrs march who took peculiar pleasure in granting requests because she so seldom asked anything for herself 
 after many serious discussions with meg and jo the pattern was chosen the materials bought and the slippers begun a cluster ofgrave yet cheerful pansies on a deeper purple ground was pronounced very appropriate and pretty and beth worked away early and late with occasional lifts over hard parts she was a nimble little needlewoman and they were finished before anyone got tired of them then she wrote a short simple note and with help got them smuggled onto the study table one morning before the old gentleman was up 
 when this excitement was over beth waited to see what would happen all day passed a a part of the next before any acknowledgement arrived and she was beginning to fear she had offended her crochety friend on the afternoon of the second day she went out to do an errand and give poor joanna the invalid doll her daily exercise as she came up the street on her return she saw three yes four heads popping in and out of the parlor windows and the moment they saw her several hands were waved and several joyful voices screamed 
 a letter from the old gentleman come quick and read it 
 oh beth sent you began amy gesticulating with unseemly energy but she got no further for jo quenched her by slamming down the window 
 beth hurried on in a flutter of suspense at the door her sisters seized and bore her to the parlor in a triumphal procession all pointing and all saying at once look there look there beth did look and turned pale with delight and surprise for there stood a little cabinet piano with a letter lying on the glossy lid directed like a sign board to miss elizabeth march 
 for me gasped beth holding onto jo and feeling as if she should tumble down it was such an overwhelming thing altogether 
 yes all for you my precious it splendid of him you think the dearest old man in the world the key in the letter we open it but we are dying to know what he says cried jo hugging her sister and offering the note 
 you read it i i feel so queer oh it is too lovely and beth hid her face in apron quite upset by her present 
 jo opened the paper and began to laugh for the first worked she saw were 
 miss march 
 dear madam 
 how nice it sounds i wish someone would write to me so said amy who thought the address very elegant 
 i have had many pairs of slippers in my life but i never had any that suited me so well as yours continues jo heartsease is my favorite flower and these will always remind me of the gentle giver i like to pay my debts so i know you will allow the old gentleman to send you something which once belonged to the little grand daughter he lost with hearty thanks and best wishes i remain your grateful friend and humble servant 
 james laurence 
 there beth an honor to be proud of sure laurie told me how fond used to be of the child who died and how he kept all her little things carefully just think given you her piano that comes of having big blue eyes and loving music said jo trying to soothe beth who trembled and looked more excited than she had ever been before 
 see the cunning brackets to hold candles and the nice green sild puckered up with a gold rose in the middle and the pretty rack and stool all complete added meg opening the instrument and displaying its beauties 
 your humble servant james laurence only think of his writing that to you tell the girls think splendid said amy much impressed by the note 
 try it honey hear the sound of the baby pianny said hannah who always took a share in the family joys and sorrows 
 so beth tried it and everyone pronounced it the most remarkable piano ever heard it had evidently been newly tuned and put in apple pie order but perfect as it was i think the real charm lay in the happiest of all happy faces which leaned over it as beth lovingly touched the beautiful black and white keys and pressed the bright pedals 
 have to go and thank him said jo by way of a joke for the idea of the really going never entered her head 
 yes i mean to i guess go no before i get frightened thinking about it and to the utter amazement of the assembled family beth walked deliberately down the garden through the hedge and in at the laurences door 
 well i wish i may die if it the queerest thing i ever see the pianny has turned her head never have gone in her right mind cried hannah staring after her while the girls were rendered quite speechless by the miracle 
 they would have been still more amazed if they had seen what beth did afterward if you will believe me she went and knocked at the study door before she gave herself time to think and when a gruff voice called out come in she did go in right up to mr laurence who looked quite taken aback and held out her hand saying with only a small quaver in her voice i came to thank you sir for but she finish for he looked so friendly that she forgot her speech and only remembering that he had lost the little girl he loved she put both arms round his neck and kissed him 
 if the roof of the house had suddenly flown off the old gentleman have been more astonished but he liked it oh dear yes he liked it amazingly and was so touched and pleased by that confiding little kiss that all his crustiness vanished and he just set her on his knee and laid his wrinkled cheek against her rosy one feeling as if he had got his own little grand daughter back again beth ceased to fear him from that moment and sat there talking to him as cozily as if she had known him all her life for love casts out fear and gratitude can conquer pride when she went home he walked with her to her own gate shook hands cordially and touched his hat as he marched back again looking very stately and erect like a handsome soldierly old gentleman as he was 
 when the girls saw that performance jo began to dance a jig by way of expressing her satisfaction amy nearly fell out of the window in her surprise and meg exclaimed with hands well i do believe the world is coming to an end

 fellow when they planted him

 evelyn 
 according to my readings our 
 friend suffered the the 
 worst of all ancient egyptian 
 curses one reserved for only 
 the most evil blasphemers in 
 all of my research never 
 read of this curse actually 
 having been performed 
 
 that bad huh 
 evelyn 
 yes they never used it because 
 they feared it so written 
 that if a victim of the 
 should ever arise he would bring 
 with him the ten plagues of egypt 
 
 the ten plagues you mean all 
 ten plagues 
 beni 
 like what that moses guy did 
 to that pharaoh guy 
 evelyn 
 one way of putting it 
 jonathan 
 see there was frogs flies 
 locusts 
 burns 
 hail and fire 
 henderson 
 the sun turning black 
 daniels 
 water turning to blood 
 jonathan 
 and my personal favorite people 
 covered in boils and sores

 chapter 
 
 for the love of a man 
 
 
 
 when john thornton froze his feet in the previous december his partners had made him comfortable and left him to get well going on themselves up the river to get out a raft of for dawson he was still limping slightly at the time he rescued buck but with the continued warm weather even the slight limp left him and here lying by the river bank through the long spring days watching the running water listening lazily to the songs of birds and the hum of nature buck slowly won back his strength 
 a rest comes very good after one has traveled three thousand miles and it must be confessed that buck waxed lazy as his wounds healed his muscles swelled out and the flesh came back to cover his bones for that matter they were all john thornton and skeet and for the raft to come that was to carry them down to dawson skeet was a little irish setter who early made friends with buck who in a dying condition was unable to resent her first advances she had the doctor trait which some dogs possess and as a mother cat washes her kittens so she washed and cleansed wounds regularly each morning after he had finished his breakfast she performed her task till he came to look for her ministrations as much as he did for nig equally friendly though less demonstrative was a huge black dog and with eyes that laughed and a boundless good nature 
 to surprise these dogs manifested no jealousy toward him they seemed to share the kindliness and largeness of john thornton as buck grew stronger they enticed him into all sorts of ridiculous games in which thornton himself could not forbear to join and in this fashion buck romped through his convalescence and into a new existence love genuine passionate love was his for the first time this he had never experienced at judge down in the santa clara valley with the sons hunting and tramping it had been a working partnership with the grandsons a sort of pompous guardianship and with the judge himself a stately and dignified friendship but love that was feverish and burning that was adoration that was madness it had taken john thornton to arouse 
 this man had saved his life which was something but further he was the ideal master other men saw to the welfare of their dogs from a sense of duty and business expediency he saw to the welfare of his as if they were his own children because he could not help it and he saw further he never forgot a kindly greeting or a cheering word and to sit down for a long talk with he called as much his delight as theirs he had a way of taking head roughly between his hands and resting his own head upon of shaking him back and forth the while calling him ill names that to buck were love names buck knew no greater joy than that rough embrace and the sound of murmured oaths and at each jerk back and forth it seemed that his heart would be shaken out of his body so great was its ecstasy and when released he sprang to his feet his mouth laughing his eyes eloquent his throat vibrant with unuttered sound and in that fashion remained without movement john thornton would reverently exclaim god you can all but speak 
 buck had a trick of love expression that was akin to hurt he would often seize hand in his mouth and close so fiercely that the flesh bore the impress of his teeth for some time afterward and as buck understood the oaths to be love words so the man understood this feigned bite for a caress 
 for the most part however love was expressed in adoration while he went wild with happiness when thornton touched him or spoke to him he did not seek these tokens unlike skeet who was wont to shove her nose under hand and nudge and nudge till petted or nig who would stalk up and rest his great head on knee buck was content to adore at a distance he would lie by the hour eager alert at feet looking up into his face dwelling upon it studying it following with keenest interest each fleeting expression every movement or change of feature or as chance might have it he would lie farther away to the side or rear watching the outlines of the man and the occasional movements of his body and often such was the communion in which they lived the strength of gaze would draw john head around and he would return the gaze without speech his heart shining out of his eyes as heart shone out 
 for a long time after his rescue buck did not like thornton to get out of his sight from the moment he left the tent to when he entered it again buck would follow at his heels his transient masters since he had come into the northland had bred in him a fear that no master could be permanent he was afraid that thornton would pass out of his life as perrault and francois and the scotch had passed out even in the night in his dreams he was haunted by this fear at such times he would shake off sleep and creep through the chill to the flap of the tent where he would stand and listen to the sound of his breathing 
 but in spite of this great love he bore john thornton which seemed to bespeak the soft civilizing influence the strain of the primitive which the northland had aroused in him remained alive and active faithfulness and devotion things born of fire and roof were his yet he retained his wildness and wiliness he was a thing of the wild come in from the wild to sit by john fire rather than a dog of the soft southland stamped with the marks of generations of civilization because of his very great love he could not steal from this man but from any other man in any other camp he did not hesitate an instant while the cunning with which he stole enabled him to escape detection 
 his face and body were scored by the teeth of many dogs and he fought as fiercely as ever and more shrewdly skeet and nig were too for they belonged to john thornton but the strange dog no matter what the breed or valor swiftly acknowledged supremacy or found himself struggling for life with a terrible antagonist and buck was merciless he had learned well the law of club and fang and he never forewent an advantage or drew back from a foe he had started on the way to death he had lessoned from spitz and from the chief fighting dogs of the police and mail and knew there was no middle course he must master or be mastered while to show mercy was a weakness mercy did not exist in the primordial life it was misunderstood for fear and such misunderstandings made for death kill or be killed eat or be eaten was the law and this mandate down out of the depths of time he obeyed 
 he was older than the days he had seen and the breaths he had drawn he linked the past with the present and the eternity behind him throbbed through him in a mighty rhythm to which he swayed as the tides and seasons swayed he sat by john fire a dog and but behind him were the shades of all manner of dogs half wolves and wild wolves urgent and prompting tasting the savor of the meat he ate thirsting for the water he drank scenting the wind with him listening with him and telling him the sounds made by the wild life in the forest dictating his moods directing his actions lying down to sleep with him when he lay down and dreaming with him and beyond him and becoming themselves the stuff of his dreams 
 so peremptorily did these shades beckon him that each day mankind and the claims of mankind slipped farther from him deep in the forest a call was sounding and as often as he heard this call mysteriously thrilling and luring he felt compelled to turn his back upon the fire and the beaten earth around it and to plunge into the forest and on and on he knew not where or why nor did he wonder where or why the call sounding imperiously deep in the forest but as often as he gained the soft unbroken earth and the green shade the love for john thornton drew him back to the fire again 
 thornton alone held him the rest of mankind was as nothing chance travelers might praise or pet him but he was cold under it all and from a too demonstrative man he would get up and walk away when partners hans and pete arrived on the raft buck refused to notice them till he learned they were close to thornton after that he tolerated them in a passive sort of way accepting favors from them as though he favored them by accepting they were of the same large type as thornton living close to the earth thinking simply and seeing clearly and ere they swung the raft into the big eddy by the at dawson they understood buck and his ways and did not insist upon an intimacy such as obtained with skeet and nig 
 for thornton however his love seemed to grow and grow he alone among men could put a pack upon back in the summer traveling nothing was too great for buck to do when thornton commanded one day they had themselves from the proceeds of the raft and left dawson for the head waters of the tanana the men and dogs were sitting on the crest of a cliff which fell away straight down to naked bedrock three hundred feet below john thornton was sitting near the edge buck at his shoulder a thoughtless whim seized thornton and he drew the attention of hans and pete to the experiment he had in mind jump buck he commanded sweeping his arm out and over the chasm the next instant he was grappling with buck on the extreme edge while hans and pete were dragging them back into safety 
 uncanny pete said after it was over and they had caught their speech 
 thornton shook his head no it is splendid and it is terrible too do you know it sometimes makes me afraid 
 not hankering to be the man that lays hands on you while around pete announced conclusively nodding his head toward buck 
 py jingo was contribution not mineself either 
 it was at circle city ere the year was out that apprehensions were realized black burton a man evil tempered and malicious had been picking a quarrel with a tenderfoot at the bar when thornton stepped good naturedly between buck as was his custom was lying in a corner head on paws watching his every action burton struck out without warning straight from the shoulder thornton was sent spinning and saved himself from falling only by clutching the rail of the bar 
 those who were looking on heard what was neither bark nor yelp but a something which is best described as a roar and they saw body rise up in the air as he left the floor for throat the man saved his life by instinctively throwing out his arm but was hurled backward to the floor with buck on top of him buck loosed his teeth from the flesh of the arm and drove in again for the throat this time the man succeeded only in partly blocking and his throat was torn open then the crowd was upon buck and he was driven off but while a surgeon checked the bleeding he prowled up and down growling furiously attempting to rush in and being forced back by an array of hostile clubs a miners meeting called on the spot decided that the dog had sufficient provocation and buck was discharged but his reputation was made and from that day his name spread through every camp in alaska 
 later on in the fall of the year he saved john life in quite another fashion the three partners were lining a long and narrow poling boat down a bad stretch of rapids on the forty mile creek hans and pete moved along the bank snubbing with a thin manila rope from tree to tree while thornton remained in the boat helping its descent by means of a pole and shouting directions to the shore buck on the bank worried and anxious kept abreast of the boat his eyes never off his master 
 at a particularly bad spot where a ledge of barely submerged rocks jutted out into the river hans cast off the rope and while thornton poled the boat out into the stream ran down the bank with the end in his hand to snub the boat when it had cleared the ledge this it did and was flying in a current as swift as a when hans checked it with the rope and checked too suddenly the boat flirted over and snubbed in to the bank bottom up while thornton flung sheer out of it was carried toward the worst part of the rapids a stretch of wild water in which no swimmer could live 
 buck had sprung in on the instant and at the end of three hundred yards amid a mad swirl of water he thornton when he felt him grasp his tail buck headed for the bank swimming with all his splendid strength but the progress shoreward was slow the progress amazingly rapid from below came the fatal roaring where the wild current went wilder and was rent in shreds and spray by the rocks which thrust through like the teeth of an enormous comb the suck of the water as it took the beginning of the last steep pitch was frightful and thornton knew that the shore was impossible he scraped furiously over a rock bruised across a second and struck a third with crushing force he clutched its slippery top with both hands releasing buck and above the roar of the churning water shouted go buck go 
 buck could not hold his own and swept on downstream struggling desperately but unable to win back when he heard command repeated he partly reared out of the water throwing his head high as though for a last look then turned obediently toward the bank he swam powerfully and was dragged ashore by pete and hans at the very point where swimming ceased to be possible and destruction began 
 they knew that the time a man could cling to a slippery rock in the face of that driving current was a matter of minutes and they ran as fast as they could up the bank to a point far above where thornton was hanging on they attached the line with which they had been snubbing the boat to neck and shoulders being careful that it should neither strangle him nor impede his swimming and launched him into the stream he struck out boldly but not straight enough into the stream he discovered the mistake too late when thornton was abreast of him and a bare strokes away while he was being carried helplessly past 
 hans promptly snubbed with the rope as though buck were a boat the rope thus tightening on him in the sweep of the current he was jerked under the surface and under the surface he remained till his body struck against the bank and he was hauled out he was half drowned and hans and pete threw themselves upon him pounding the breath into him and the water out of him he staggered to his feet and fell down the faint sound of voice came to them and though they could not make out the words of it they knew that he was in his extremity his voice acted on buck like an electric shock he sprang to his feet and ran up the bank ahead of the men to the point of his previous departure 
 again the rope was attached and he was launched and again he struck out but this time straight into the stream he had miscalculated once but he would not be guilty of it a second time hans paid out the rope permitting no slack while pete kept it clear of coils buck held on till he was on a line straight above thornton then he turned and with the speed of an express train headed down upon him thornton saw him coming and as buck struck him like a battering ram with the whole force of the current behind him he reached up and closed with both arms around the shaggy neck hans snubbed the rope around the tree and buck and thornton were jerked under the water strangling suffocating sometimes one uppermost and sometimes the other dragging over the jagged bottom smashing against rocks and snags they veered in to the bank 
 thornton came to belly downward and being violently propelled back and forth across a drift log by hans and pete his first glance was for buck over whose limp and apparently lifeless body nig was setting up a howl while skeet was licking the wet face and closed eyes thornton was himself bruised and battered and he went carefully over body when he had been brought around finding three broken ribs 
 that settles it he announced we camp right here and camp they did till ribs knitted and he was able to travel 
 that winter at dawson buck performed another exploit not so heroic perhaps but one that puts his name many notches higher on the totem pole of alaskan fame this exploit was particularly gratifying to the three men for they stood in need of the outfit which it furnished and were enabled to make a trip into the virgin east where miners had not yet appeared it was brought about by a conversation in the eldorado saloon in which men waxed boastful of their favorite dogs buck because of his record was the target for these men and thornton was driven stoutly to defend him at the end of half an hour one man stated that his dog could start a sled with five hundred pounds and walk off with it a second bragged six hundred for his dog and a third seven hundred 
 pooh pooh said john thornton buck can start a thousand pounds 
 and break it out and walk off with it for a hundred yards demanded matthewson a bonanza king he of the seven hundred vaunt 
 and break it out and walk off with it for a hundred yards john thornton said cooly 
 well matthewson said slowly and deliberately so that all could hear got a thousand dollars that says he and there it is so saying he slammed a sack of gold dust of the size of a bologna sausage down upon the bar 
 nobody spoke bluff if bluff it was had been called he could feel a flush of warm blood creeping up his face his tongue had tricked him he did not know whether buck could start a thousand pounds half a ton the enormousness of it appalled him he had great faith in strength and had often thought him capable of starting such a load but never as now had he faced the possibility of it the eyes of a dozen men fixed upon him silent and waiting further he had no thousand dollars nor had hans and pete 
 got a sled standing outside now with twenty sacks of flour on it matthewson went on with brutal directness so let that hinder you 
 thornton did not reply he did not know what to say he glanced from face to face in the absent way of a man who has lost the power of thought and is seeking somewhere to find the thing that will start it going again the face of jim a mastodon king and comrade caught his eyes it was a cue to him seeming to rouse him to do what he would never have dreamed of doing 
 can you lend me a thousand he asked almost in a whisper 
 sure answered thumping down a plethoric sack by the side of though little faith having john that the beast can do the trick 
 the eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test the tables were deserted and the dealers and gamekeepers came forth to see the outcome of the wager and to lay odds several hundred men furred and mittened banked around the sled within easy distance sled loaded with a thousand pounds of flour had been standing for a couple of hours and in the intense cold it was sixty below runners had frozen fast to the snow men offered odds of two to one that buck could not budge the sled a quibble arose concerning the phrase break out contended it was privilege to knock the runners loose leaving buck to break it out from a dead standstill matthewson insisted that the phrase included breaking the runners from the frozen grip of the snow a majority of the men who had witnessed the making of the bet decided in his favor whereat the odds went up to three to one against buck 
 there were no takers not a man believed him capable of the feat thornton had been hurried into the wager heavy with doubt and now that he looked at the sled itself the concrete fact with the regular team of ten dogs curled up in the snow before it the more impossible the task appeared matthewson waxed jubilant 
 three to one he proclaimed lay you another thousand at that figure thornton what do you say 
 doubt was strong in his face but his fighting spirit was fighting spirit that soars above odds fails to recognize the impossible and is deaf to all save the clamor for battle he called hans and pete to him their sacks were slim and with his own the three partners could rake together only two hundred dollars in the ebb of their fortunes this sum was their total capital yet they laid it unhesitatingly against six hundred 
 the team of ten dogs was unhitched and buck with his own harness was put into the sled he had caught the contagion of the excitement and he felt that in some way he must do a great thing for john thornton murmurs of admiration at his splendid appearance went up he was in perfect condition without an ounce of superfluous flesh and the one hundred and fifty pounds that he weighed were so many pounds of grit and virility his furry coat shone with the sheen of silk down the neck and across the shoulders his mane in repose as it was half bristled and seemed to lift with every movement as though excess of vigor made each particular hair alive and active the great breast and heavy fore legs were no more than in proportion with the rest of his body where the muscles showed in tight rolls underneath the skin men felt these muscles and proclaimed them hard as iron and the odds went down to two to one 
 gad sir gad sir stuttered a member of the latest dynasty a king of the skookum benches i offer you eight hundred for him sir before the test eight hundred just as he stands 
 thornton shook his head and stepped over to side 
 you must stand off from him matthewson protested free play and plenty of room 
 the crowd fell silent only could be heard the voices of the gamblers vainly offering two to one everybody acknowledged buck a magnificent animal but twenty sacks of flour bulked too large in their eyes for them to loosen their pouch strings 
 thornton knelt down by side he took his head in his hands and rested cheek on cheek he did not playfully shake him as was his wont or murmur soft love curses but he whispered in his ear as you love me buck as you love me was what he whispered buck whined with suppressed eagerness 
 the crowd was watching curiously the affair was growing mysterious it seemed like a conjuration as thornton got to his feet buck seized his mittened hand between his jaws pressing in with his teeth and releasing slowly it was the answer in terms not of speech but of love thornton stepped well back 
 now buck he said 
 buck tightened the traces then slacked them for a matter of several inches it was the way he had learned 
 gee voice rang out sharp in the tense silence 
 buck swung to the right ending the movement in a plunge that took up the slack and with a sudden jerk arrested his one hundred and fifty pounds the load quivered and from under the runners arose a crisp crackling 
 haw thornton commanded 
 buck duplicated the maneuver this time to the left the crackling turned into a snapping the sled pivoting and the runners slipping and grating several inches to the side the sled was broken out men were holding their breaths intensely unconscious of the fact 
 now mush 
 command cracked out like a pistol shot buck threw himself forward tightening the traces with a jarring lunge his whole body was gathered compactly together in the tremendous effort the muscles writhing and knotting like live things under the silky fur his great chest was low to the ground his head forward and down while his feet were flying like mad the claws scarring the snow in parallel grooves the sled swayed and trembled forward one of his feet slipped and one man groaned aloud the sled lurched ahead in what appeared a rapid succession of jerks though it never really came to a dead stop again half an inch an inch two inches the jerks perceptibly diminished as the sled gained momentum he caught them up till it was moving steadily along 
 men gasped and began to breathe again unaware that for a moment they had ceased to breathe thornton was running behind encouraging buck with short cheery words the distance had been measured off and as he neared the pile of firewood which marked the end of the hundred yards a cheer began to grow and grow which burst into a roar as he passed the firewood and halted at command every man was tearing himself loose even matthewson hats and mittens were flying in the air men were shaking hands it did not matter with whom and bubbling over in a general incoherent babel 
 but thornton fell on his knees beside buck head was against head and he was shaking him back and forth those who hurried up heard him cursing buck and he cursed him long and fervently and softly and lovingly 
 gad sir gad sir sputtered the skookum bench king give you a thousand for him sir a thousand hundred sir 
 thornton rose to his feet his eyes were wet the tears were streaming frankly down his cheeks sir he said to the skookum bench king no sir you can go to hell sir the best i can do for you sir 
 buck seized hand in his teeth thornton shook him back and forth as though animated by a common impulse the onlookers drew back to a respectful distance nor were they again indiscreet enough to interrupt

lionfish nov chapter six gilderoy lockhartcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 the next day however harry barely grinned once things started to go downhill from breakfast in the great hall the four long house tables were laden with tureens of porridge plates of kippers mountains of toast and dishes of eggs and bacon beneath the enchanted ceiling today a dull cloudy gray harry and ron sat down at the gryffindor table next to hermione who had her copy of voyages with vampires propped open against a milk jug there was a slight stiffness in the way she said morning which told harry that she was still disapproving of the way they had arrived neville longbottom on the other hand greeted them cheerfully neville was a and boy with the worst memory of anyone harry had ever met 
 
 due any minute i think sending a few things i forgot 
 
 harry had only just started his porridge when sure enough there was a rushing sound overhead and a hundred or so owls streamed in circling the hall and dropping letters and packages into the chattering crowd a big lumpy package bounced off head and a second later something large and gray fell into jug spraying them all with milk and feathers 
 
 errol said ron pulling the bedraggled owl out by the feet errol slumped unconscious onto the table his legs in the air and a damp red envelope in his beak 
 
 oh no ron gasped 
 
 all right still alive said hermione prodding errol gently with the tip of her finger 
 
 not that that 
 
 ron was pointing at the red envelope it looked quite ordinary to harry but ron and neville were both looking at it as though they expected it to explode 
 
 the matter said harry 
 
 sent me a howler said ron faintly 
 
 better open it ron said neville in a timid whisper be worse if you my gran sent me one once and i ignored it and he gulped it was horrible 
 
 harry looked from their petrified faces to the red envelope 
 
 a howler he said 
 
 but whole attention was fixed on the letter which had begun to smoke at the corners 
 
 open it neville urged all be over in a few minutes 
 
 ron stretched out a shaking hand eased the envelope from beak and slit it open neville stuffed his fingers in his ears a split second later harry knew why he thought for a moment it had exploded a roar of sound filled the huge hall shaking dust from the ceiling 
 
 stealing the car i have been surprised if expelled you you wait till i get hold of you i suppose you stopped to think what your father and i went through when we saw it was gone 
 
 mrs weasleys yells a hundred times louder than usual made the plates and spoons rattle on the table and echoed deafeningly off the stone walls people throughout the hall were swiveling around to see who had received the howler and ron sank so low in his chair that only his crimson forehead could be seen 
 
 letter from dumbledore last night i thought your father would die of shame we bring you up to behave like this you and harry could both have died 
 
 harry had been wondering when his name was going to crop up he tried very hard to look as though he hear the voice that was making his eardrums throb 
 
 absolutely disgusted your facing an inquiry at work entirely your fault and if you put another toe out of line bring you straight back home 
 
 a ringing silence fell the red envelope which had dropped from hand burst into flames and curled into ashes harry and ron sat stunned as though a tidal wave had just passed over them a few people laughed and gradually a babble of talk broke out again 
 
 hermione closed voyages with vampires and looked down at the top of head 
 
 well i know what you expected ron but you 
 
 tell me i deserved it snapped ron 
 
 harry pushed his porridge away his insides were burning with guilt mr weasley was facing an inquiry at work after all mr and mrs weasley had done for him over the summer 
 
 but he had no time to dwell on this professor mcgonagall was moving along the gryffindor table handing out course schedules harry took his and saw that they had double herbology with the hufflepuffs first 
 
 harry ron and hermione left the castle together crossed the vegetable patch and made for the greenhouses where the magical plants were kept at least the howler had done one good thing hermione seemed to think they had now been punished enough and was being perfectly friendly again 
 
 as they neared the greenhouses they saw the rest of the class standing outside waiting for professor sprout harry ron and hermione had only just joined them when she came striding into view across the lawn accompanied by gilderoy lockhart professor arms were full of bandages and with another twinge of guilt harry spotted the whomping willow in the distance several of its branches now in slings 
 
 professor sprout was a squat little witch who wore a patched hat over her flyaway hair there was usually a large amount of earth on her clothes and her fingernails would have made aunt petunia faint gilderoy lockhart however was immaculate in sweeping robes of turquoise his golden hair shining under a perfectly positioned turquoise hat with gold trimming 
 
 oh hello there he called beaming around at the assembled students just been showing professor sprout the right way to doctor a whomping willow but i want you running away with the idea that better at herbology than she is i just happen to have met several of these exotic plants on my travels 
 
 greenhouse three today chaps said professor sprout who was looking distinctly disgruntled not at all her usual cheerful self 
 
 there was a murmur of interest they had only ever worked in greenhouse one before greenhouse three housed far more interesting and dangerous plants professor sprout took a large key from her belt and unlocked the door harry caught a whiff of damp earth and fertilizer mingling with the heavy perfume of some giant flowers dangling from the ceiling he was about to follow ron and hermione inside when hand shot out 
 
 harry been wanting a word you mind if a couple of minutes late do you professor sprout 
 
 judging by professor scowl she did mind but lockhart said the ticket and closed the greenhouse door in her face 
 
 harry said lockhart his large white teeth gleaming in the sunlight as he shook his head harry harry harry 
 
 completely nonplussed harry said nothing 
 
 when i heard well of course it was all my fault could have kicked myself 
 
 harry had no idea what he was talking about he was about to say so when lockhart went on know when been more shocked flying a car to hogwarts well of course i knew at once why done it stood out a mile harry harry harry 
 
 it was remarkable how he could show every one of those brilliant teeth even when he talking 
 
 gave you a taste for publicity i said lockhart gave you the bug you got onto the front page of the paper with me and you wait to do it again 
 
 oh no professor see 
 
 harry harry harry said lockhart reaching out and grasping his shoulder i understand natural to want a bit more once had that first taste and i blame myself for giving you that because it was bound to go to your head but see here young man you start flying cars to try and get yourself noticed just calm down all right plenty of time for all that when older yes yes i know what thinking all right for him an internationally famous wizard when i was twelve i was just as much of a nobody as you are now in fact say i was even more of a nobody i mean a few people have heard of you they all that business with he glanced at the lightning scar on forehead i know i know not quite as good as winning witch most charming smile award five times in a row as i have but a start harry a start 
 
 he gave harry a hearty wink and strode off harry stood stunned for a few seconds then remembering he was supposed to be in the greenhouse he opened the door and slid inside 
 
 professor sprout was standing behind a trestle bench in the center of the greenhouse about twenty pairs of ear muffs were lying on the bench when harry had taken his place between ron and hermione she said be repotting mandrakes today now who can tell me the properties of the mandrake 
 
 to surprise hand was first into the air 
 
 mandrake or mandragora is a powerful restorative said hermione sounding as usual as though she had swallowed the textbook it is used to return people who have been transfigured or cursed to their original state 
 
 excellent ten points to gryffindor said professor sprout the mandrake forms an essential part of most antidotes it is also however dangerous who can tell me why 
 
 hand narrowly missed glasses as it shot up again 
 
 the cry of the mandrake is fatal to anyone who hears it she said promptly 
 
 precisely take another ten points said professor sprout now the mandrakes we have here are still very young 
 
 she pointed to a row of deep trays as she spoke and everyone shuffled forward for a better look a hundred or so tufty little plants purplish green in color were growing there in rows they looked quite unremarkable to harry who have the slightest idea what hermione meant by the cry of the mandrake 
 
 everyone take a pair of earmuffs said professor sprout 
 
 there was a scramble as everyone tried to seize a pair that pink and fluffy 
 
 when i tell you to put them on make sure your ears are completely covered said professor sprout when it is safe to remove them i will give you the right earmuffs on 
 
 harry snapped the earmuffs over his ears they shut out sound completely professor sprout put the pink fluffy pair over her own ears rolled up the sleeves of her robes grasped one of the tufty plants firmly and pulled hard 
 
 harry let out a gasp of surprise that no one could hear 
 
 instead of roots a small muddy and extremely ugly baby popped out of the earth the leaves were growing right out of his head he had pale green mottled skin and was clearly bawling at the top of his lungs 
 
 professor sprout took a large plant pot from under the table and plunged the mandrake into it burying him in dark damp compost until only the tufted leaves were visible professor sprout dusted off her hands gave them all the and removed her own earmuffs 
 
 as our mandrakes are only seedlings their cries kill yet she said calmly as though just done nothing more exciting than water a begonia however they will knock you out for several hours and as sure none of you want to miss your first day back make sure your earmuffs are securely in place while you work i will attract your attention when it is time to pack up 
 
 four to a tray there is a large supply of pots here compost in the sacks over there and be careful of the venemous tentacula teething 
 
 she gave a sharp slap to a spiky dark red plant as she spoke making it draw in the long feelers that had been inching sneakily over her shoulder 
 
 harry ron and hermione were joined at their tray by a hufflepuff boy harry knew by sight but had never spoken to 
 
 justin he said brightly shaking harry by the hand know who you are of course the famous harry potter and hermione granger always top in everything hermione beamed as she had her hand shaken too and ron weasley that your flying car 
 
 ron smile the howler was obviously still on his mind 
 
 that something he said justin happily as they began filling their plant pots with dragon dung compost awfully brave chap have you read his books have died of fear if id been cornered in a telephone booth by a werewolf but he stayed cool and zap just fantastic 
 
 my name was down for eton you know i tell you how glad i am i came here instead of course mother was slightly disappointed but since i made her read books i think begun to see how useful be to have a fully trained wizard in the family 
 
 after that they have much chance to talk their earmuffs were back on and they needed to concentrate on the mandrakes professor sprout had made it look extremely easy but it the mandrakes like coming out of the earth but seem to want to go back into it either they squirmed kicked flailed their sharp little fists and gnashed their teeth harry spent ten whole minutes trying to squash a particularly fat one into a pot 
 
 by the end of the class harry like everyone else was sweaty aching and covered in earth everyone traipsed back to the castle for a quick wash and then the gryffindors hurried off to transfiguration 
 
 professor classes were always hard work but today was especially difficult everything harry had learned last year seemed to have leaked out of his head during the summer he was supposed to be turning a beetle into a button but all he managed to do was give his beetle a lot of exercise as it scuttled over the desktop avoiding his wand 
 
 ron was having far worse problems he had patched up his wand with some borrowed spellotape but it seemed to be damaged beyond repair it kept crackling and sparking at odd moments and every time ron tried to transfigure his beetle it engulfed him in thick gray smoke that smelled of rotten eggs unable to see what he was doing ron accidentally squashed his beetle with his elbow and had to ask for a new one professor mcgonagall pleased 
 
 harry was relieved to hear the lunch bell his brain felt like a wrung sponge everyone filed out of the classroom except him and ron who was whacking his wand furiously on the desk 
 
 stupid useless thing 
 
 write home for another one harry suggested as the wand let off a volley of bangs like a firecracker 
 
 oh yeah and get another howler back said ron stuffing the now hissing wand into his bag your own fault your wand got snapped 
 
 they went down to lunch where mood was not improved by showing them the handful of perfect coat buttons she had produced in transfiguration 
 
 we got this afternoon said harry hastily changing the subject 
 
 defense against the dark arts said hermione at once 
 
 why demanded ron seizing her schedule have you outlined all lessons in little hearts 
 
 hermione snatched the schedule back blushing furiously 
 
 they finished lunch and went outside into the overcast courtyard hermione sat down on a stone step and buried her nose in voyages with vampires again harry and ron stood talking about quidditch for several minutes before harry became aware that he was being closely watched looking up he saw the very small boy seen trying on the sorting hat last night staring at harry as though transfixed he was clutching what looked like an ordinary muggle camera and the moment harry looked at him he went bright red 
 
 all right harry colin creevey he said breathlessly taking a tentative step forward in gryffindor too think would it be all right if can i have a picture he said raising the camera hopefully 
 
 a picture harry repeated blankly 
 
 so i can prove met you said colin creevey eagerly edging further forward i know all about you told me about how you survived when tried to kill you and how he disappeared and everything and how still got a lightning scar on your forehead his eyes raked hairline and a boy in my dormitory said if i develop the film in the right potion the move colin drew a great shuddering breath of excitement and said amazing here it i never knew all the odd stuff i could do was magic till i got the letter from hogwarts my a milkman he believe it either so taking loads of pictures to send home to him and be really good if i had one of you he looked imploringly at harry maybe your friend could take it and i could stand next to you and then could you sign it 
 
 signed photos giving out signed photos potter 
 
 loud and scathing draco voice echoed around the courtyard he had stopped right behind colin flanked as he always was at hogwarts by his large and thuggish cronies crabbe and goyle 
 
 everyone line up malfoy roared to the crowd harry giving out signed photos 
 
 no not said harry angrily his fists clenching shut up malfoy 
 
 just jealous piped up colin whose entire body was about as thick as neck 
 
 jealous said malfoy who need to shout anymore half the courtyard was listening in of what i want a foul scar right across my head thanks i think getting your head cut open makes you that special myself 
 
 crabbe and goyle were sniggering stupidly 
 
 eat slugs malfoy said ron angrily crabbe stopped laughing and started rubbing his knuckles in a menacing way 
 
 be careful weasley sneered malfoy you want to start any trouble or your have to come and take you away from school he put on a shrill piercing voice if you put another toe out of line 
 
 
 
 a knot of slytherin nearby laughed loudly at this 
 
 weasley would like a signed photo potter smirked malfoy be worth more than his whole house 
 
 ron whipped out his spellotaped wand but hermione shut voyages with vampires with a snap and whispered look out 
 
 all this all this gilderoy lockhart was striding toward them his turquoise robes swirling behind him giving out signed photos 
 
 harry started to speak but he was cut short as lockhart flung an arm around his shoulders and thundered jovially have asked we meet again harry 
 
 pinned to side and burning with humiliation harry saw malfoy slide smirking back into the crowd 
 
 come on then mr creevey said lockhart beaming at colin a double portrait do better than that and both sign it for you 
 
 colin fumbled for his camera and took the picture as the bell rang behind them signaling the start of afternoon classes 
 
 off you go move along there lockhart called to the crowd and he set off back to the castle with harry who was wishing he knew a good vanishing spell still clasped to his side 
 
 a word to the wise harry said lockhart paternally as they entered the building through a side door i covered up for you back there with young creevey if he was photographing me too your schoolmates think setting yourself up so much 
 
 deaf to stammers lockhart swept him down a corridor lined with staring students and up a staircase 
 
 let me just say that handing out signed pictures at this stage of your career sensible looks a tad bigheaded harry to be frank there may well come a time when like me need to keep a stack handy wherever you go but he gave a little chortle i think quite there yet 
 
 they had reached classroom and he let harry go at last harry yanked his robes straight and headed for a seat at the very back of the class where he busied himself with piling all seven of books in front of him so that he could avoid looking at the real thing 
 
 the rest of the class came clattering in and ron and hermione sat down on either side of harry 
 
 you fried an egg on your face said ron better hope creevey meet ginny or be starting a harry potter fan club 
 
 shut up snapped harry the last thing he needed was for lockhart to hear the phrase harry potter fan club 
 
 when the whole class was seated lockhart cleared his throat loudly and silence fell he reached forward picked up neville copy of travels with trolls and held it up to show his own winking portrait on the front 
 
 me he said pointing at it and winking as well gilderoy lockhart order of merlin third class honorary member of the dark force defense league and winner of witch most charming smile award but i talk about that i get rid of the bandon banshee by smiling at her 
 
 he waited for them to laugh a few people smiled weakly 
 
 i see all bought a complete set of my books well done i thought start today with a little quiz nothing to worry about just to check how well read them how much taken in 
 
 when he had handed out the test papers he returned to the front of the class and said you have thirty minutes start now 
 
 harry looked down at his paper and read 
 
 
 what is gilderoy lockhart s favorite color 
 
 what is gilderoy secret ambition 
 
 what in your opinion is gilderoy greatest achievement to date 
 
 on and on it went over three sides of paper right down to 
 
 when is gilderoy birthday and what would his ideal gift be 
 
 half an hour later lockhart collected the papers and rifled through them in front of the class 
 
 tut tut hardly any of you remembered that my favorite color is lilac i say so in year with the yeti and a few of you need to read wanderings with werewolves more carefully i clearly state in chapter twelve that my ideal birthday gift would be harmony between all magic and peoples though i say no to a large bottle of ogdeds old firewhisky 
 
 he gave them another roguish wink ron was now staring at lockhart with an expression of disbelief on his face seamus finnigan and dean thomas who were sitting in front were shaking with silent laughter hermione on the other hand was listening to lockhart with rapt attention and gave a start when he mentioned her name 
 
 but miss hermione granger knew my secret ambition is to rid the world of evil and market my own range of potions good girl in fact he flipped her paper over full marks where is miss hermione granger 
 
 hermione raised a trembling hand 
 
 excellent beamed lockhart quite excellent take ten points for gryffindor and so to business 
 
 he bent down behind his desk and lifted a large covered cage onto it 
 
 now be warned it is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind you may find yourselves facing your worst fears in this room know only that no harm can befall you whilst i am here all i ask is that you remain calm 
 
 in spite of himself harry leaned around his pile of books for a better look at the cage lockhart placed a hand on the cover dean and seamus had stopped laughing now neville was cowering in his front row seat 
 
 i must ask you not to scream said lockhart in a low voice it might provoke them 
 
 as the whole class held its breath lockhart whipped off the cover 
 
 yes he said dramatically freshly caught cornish pixies 
 
 seamus finnigan control himself he let out a snort of laughter that even lockhart mistake for a scream of terror 
 
 yes he smiled at seamus 
 
 well not not very dangerous are they seamus choked 
 
 be so sure said lockhart waggling a finger annoyingly at seamus devilish tricky little blighters they can be 
 
 the pixies were electric blue and about eight inches high with pointed faces and voices so shrill it was like listening to a lot of budgies arguing the moment the cover had been removed they had started jabbering and rocketing around rattling the bars and making bizarre faces at the people nearest them 
 
 right then lockhart said loudly see what you make of them and he opened the cage 
 
 it was pandemonium the pixies shot in every direction like rockets two of them seized neville by the ears and lifted him into the air several shot straight through the window showering the back row with broken glass the rest proceeded to wreck the classroom more effectively than a rampaging rhino they grabbed ink bottles and sprayed the class with them shredded books and papers tore pictures from the walls the waste basket grabbed bags and books and threw them out of the smashed window within minutes half the class was sheltering under desks and neville was swinging from the iron chandelier in the ceiling 
 
 come on now round them up round them up only pixies lockhart shouted 
 
 he rolled up his sleeves brandished his wand and bellowed peskipiksi pesternomi 
 
 it had absolutely no effect one of the pixies seized his wand and threw it out of the window too lockhart gulped and dived under his own desk narrowly avoiding being squashed by neville who fell a second later as the chandelier gave way 
 
 the bell rang and there was a mad rush toward the exit in the relative calm that followed lockhart straightened up caught sight of harry ron and hermione who were almost at the door and said well ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage he swept past them and shut the door quickly behind him 
 
 can you believe him roared ron as one of the remaining pixies bit him painfully on the ear 
 
 he just wants to give us some experience said hermione immobilizing two pixies at once with a clever freezing charm and stuffing them back into their cage 
 
 hands on said harry who was trying to grab a pixie dancing out of reach with its tongue out hermione he have a clue what he was doing 
 
 rubbish said hermione read his books look at all those amazing things done 
 
 he says done ron muttered 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the chamber of secrets 
 

lionfish nov chapter six talons and tea leavescontents prev chapter next chapter 
 when harry ron and hermione entered the great hall for breakfast the next day the first thing they saw was draco malfoy who seemed to be entertaining a large group of slytherins with a very funny story as they passed malfoy did a ridiculous impression of a swooning fit and there was a roar of laughter 
 
 ignore him said hermione who was right behind harry just ignore him not worth it 
 
 hey potter shrieked pansy parkinson a slytherin girl with a face like a pug potter the dementors are coming potter woooooooooo 
 
 harry dropped into a seat at the gryffindor table next to george weasley 
 
 new course schedules said george passing then over up with you harry 
 
 malfoy said ron sitting down on other side and glaring over at the slytherin table 
 
 george looked up in time to see malfoy pretending to faint with terror again 
 
 that little git he said calmly he so cocky last night when the dementors were down at our end of the train came running into our compartment he fred 
 
 nearly wet himself said fred with a contemptuous glance at malfoy 
 
 i too happy myself said george horrible things those dementors 
 
 sort of freeze your insides they said fred 
 
 you pass out though did you said harry in a low voice 
 
 forget it harry said george bracingly dad had to go out to azkaban one time remember fred and he said it was the worst place ever been he came back all weak and shakingthey suck the happiness out of a place dementors most of the prisoners go mad in there 
 
 anyway see how happy malfoy looks after our first quidditch match said fred gryffindor versus slytherin first game of the season remember 
 
 the only time harry and malfoy had faced each other in a quidditch match malfoy had definitely come off worse feeling slightly more cheerful harry helped himself to sausages and fried tomatoes 
 
 hermione was examining her new schedule 
 
 ooh good starting some new subjects today she said happily 
 
 hermione said ron frowning as he looked over her shoulder messed up your timetable look got you down for about ten subjects a day there enough time 
 
 manage fixed it all with professor mcgonagall 
 
 but look said ron laughing see this morning nine divination and underneath nine muggle studies and ron leaned closer to the timetable disbelieving look underneath that arithmancy nine i mean i know good hermione but no that good you supposed to be in three classes at once 
 
 be silly said hermione shortly of course i be in three classes at once 
 
 well then 
 
 pass the marmalade said hermione 
 
 but 
 
 oh ron it to you if my a bit full hermione snapped i told you fixed it all with professor mcgonagall 
 
 just then hagrid entered the great hall he was wearing his long moleskin overcoat and was swinging a dead polecat from one enormous hand 
 
 all righ he said eagerly pausing on his way to the staff table yer in my firs ever lesson right after lunch bin up since five getting everthin readyhope okme a 
 
 he grinned broadly at them and headed off to the staff table still swinging the polecat 
 
 wonder what been getting ready said ron a note of anxiety in his voice 
 
 the hall was starting to empty as people headed off towards their first lesson ron checked his schedule 
 
 better go look at the top of north tower take us ten minutes to get there 
 
 they finished breakfast hastily said goodbye to fred and george and walked back through the hall as they passed the slytherin table malfoy did yet another impression of a fainting fit the shouts of laughter followed harry into the entrance hall 
 
 the journey through the castle to north tower was a long one two years at hogwarts taught them everything about the castle and they had never been inside north tower before 
 
 got to be a short cut ron panted as they climbed the seventh long staircase and emerged on an unfamiliar landing where there was nothing but a large painting of a bare stretch of grass hanging on the stone wall 
 
 i think this way said hermione peering down the empty passage to the right 
 
 be said ron south look you can see a bit of the lake outside the window 
 
 harry was watching the painting a fat pony had just ambled onto the grass and was grazing nonchalantly harry was used to the subjects of hogwarts paintings moving around and leaving their frames to visit each other but he always enjoyed watching them a moment later a short squat knight in a suit of armour had clanked into the picture after his pony by the look of the grass stains on his metal knees he had just fallen off 
 
 aha he yelled seeing harry ron and hermione what villains are these that trespass upon my private lands come to scorn at my fall perchance draw you knaves you dogs 
 
 they watched in astonishment as the little knight tugged his sword out of its scabbard and began brandishing it violently hopping up and down in rage but the sword was too long for him a particularly wild swing made him overbalance and he landed facedown in the grass 
 
 are you all right said harry moving closer to the picture 
 
 get back you scurvy braggart back you rogue 
 
 the knight seized his sword again and used it to push himself back up but the blade sank deeply into the grass and though he pulled with all his might he get it out again finally he had to flop back down onto the grass and push up his visor to mop his sweating face 
 
 listen said harry taking advantage of the exhaustion looking for the north tower you know the way do you 
 
 a quest the rage seemed to vanish instantly he clanked to his feet and shouted come follow me dear friends and we shall find our goal or else shall perish bravely in the charge 
 
 he gave the sword another fruitless tug tried and failed to mount the fat pony gave up and cried on foot then good sirs and gentle lady on on 
 
 and he ran clanking loudly into the left side of the frame and out of sight 
 
 they hurried after him along the corridor following the sound of his armor every now and then they spotted him running through a picture ahead 
 
 be of stout heart the worst is yet to come yelled the knight and they saw him reappear in front of an alarmed group of women in crinolines whose picture hung on the wall of a narrow spiral staircase 
 
 puffing loudly harry ron and hermione climbed the tightly spiraling steps getting dizzier and dizzier until at last they heard the murmur of voices above them and knew they had reached the classroom 
 
 farewell cried the knight popping his head into a painting of some monks farewell my if ever you have need of noble heart and steely sinew call upon sir cadogan 
 
 yeah call you muttered ron as the knight disappeared if we ever need someone mental 
 
 they climbed the last few steps and emerged onto a tiny landing where most of the class was already assembled there were no doors off this landing but ron nudged harry and pointed at the ceiling where there was a circular trapdoor with a brass plaque on it 
 
 sibyll trelawney divination teacher harry read we supposed to get up there 
 
 as though in answer to his question the trapdoor suddenly opened and a silvery ladder descended right at feet everyone got quiet 
 
 after you said ron grinning so harry climbed the ladder first 
 
 he emerged into the classroom he had ever seen in fact it look like a classroom at all more like a cross between attic and an tea shop at least twenty small circular tables were crammed inside it all surrounded by chintz armchairs and fat little poufs everything was lit with a dim crimson light the curtains at the windows were all closed and the many lamps were draped with dark red scarves it was stiflingly warm and the fire that was burning under the crowded mantelpiece was giving off a heavy sickly sort of perfume as it heated a large copper kettle the shelves running around the circular walls were crammed with feathers stubs of candles many packs of tattered playing cards countless silvery crystal balls and a huge array of teacups 
 
 ron appeared at shoulder as the class assembled around them all talking in whispers 
 
 where is she ron said 
 
 a voice came suddenly out of the shadows a soft misty sort of voice 
 
 welcome it said how nice to see you in the physical world at last 
 
 immediate impression was of a large glittering insect professor trelawney moved into the firelight and they saw that she was very thin her large glasses magnified her eyes to several times their natural size and she was draped in a gauzy spangled shawl innumerable chains and beads hung around her spindly neck and her arms and hands were encrusted with bangles and rings 
 
 sit my children sit she said and they all climbed awkwardly into armchairs or sank onto poufs harry ron and hermione sat themselves around the same round table 
 
 welcome to divination said professor trelawney who had seated herself in a winged armchair in front of the fire my name is professor trelawney you may not have seen me before i find that descending too often into the hustle and bustle of the main school clouds my inner eye 
 
 nobody said anything to this extraordinary pronouncement professor trelawney delicately rearranged her shawl and continued so you have chosen to study divination the most difficult of all magical arts i must warn you at the outset that if you do not have the sight there is very little i will be able to teach youbooks can take you only so far in this field 
 
 at these words both harry and ron glanced grinning at hermione who looked startled at the news that books be much help in this subject 
 
 many witches and wizards talented though they are in the area of loud bangs and smells and sudden disappearings are yet unable to penetrate the veiled mysteries of the future professor trelawney went on her enormous gleaming eyes moving from face to nervous face it is a gift granted to few you boy she said suddenly to neville who almost toppled off his pouf is your grandmother well 
 
 i think so said neville tremulously 
 
 i be so sure if i were you dear said professor trelawney the firelight glinting on her long emerald earrings neville gulped professor trelawney continued placidly we will be covering the basic methods of divination this year the first term will be devoted to reading the tea leaves next term we shall progress to palmistry by the way my dear she shot suddenly at parvati patil beware a man 
 
 parvati gave a startled look at ron who was right behind her and edged her chair away from him 
 
 in the second term professor trelawney went on we shall progress to the crystal ball if we have finished with fire omens that is unfortunately classes will be disrupted in february by a nasty bout of flu i myself will lose my voice and around easter one of our number will leave us for ever 
 
 a very tense silence followed this pronouncement but professor trelawney seemed unaware of it 
 
 i wonder dear she said to lavender brown who was nearest and shrank back in her chair if you could pass me the largest silver teapot 
 
 lavender looking relieved stood up took an enormous teapot from the shelf and put it down on the table in front of professor trelawney 
 
 thank you my dear incidentally that thing you are dreading it will happen on friday the sixteenth of october 
 
 lavender trembled 
 
 now i want you all to divide into pairs collect a teacup from the shelf come to me and i will fill it then sit down and drink drink until only the dregs remain swill these around the cup three times with the left hand then turn the cup upside down on its saucer wait for the last of the tea to drain away then give your cup to your partner to read you will interpret the patterns using pages five and six of unfogging the future i shall move among you helping and instructing oh and dear she caught neville by the arm as he made to stand up after broken your first cup would you be so kind as to select one of the blue patterned ones rather attached to the pink 
 
 sure enough neville had no sooner reached the shelf of teacups when there was a tinkle of breaking china professor trelawney swept over to him holding a dustpan and brush and said one of the blue ones then dear if you mindthank you 
 
 when harry and ron had had their teacups filled they went back to their table and tried to drink the scalding tea quickly they swilled the dregs around as professor trelawney had instructed then drained the cups and swapped over 
 
 right said ron as they both opened their books at pages five and six what can you see in mine 
 
 a load of soggy brown stuff said harry the heavily perfumed smoke in the room was making him feel sleepy and stupid 
 
 broaden your minds my dears and allow your eyes to see past the mundane professor trelawney cried through the gloom 
 
 harry tried to pull himself together 
 
 right got a crooked sort of cross he consulted unfogging the future that means going to have trials and suffering sorry about that but a thing that could be the sun hang onthat means great going to suffer but be very happy 
 
 you need your inner eye tested if you ask me said ron and they both had to stifle their laughs as professor trelawney gazed in their direction 
 
 my turn ron peered into teacup his forehead wrinkled with effort a blob a bit like a bowler hat he said maybe going to work for the ministry of magic 
 
 he turned the teacup the other way up 
 
 but this way it looks more like an that he scanned his copy of unfogging the future a windfall unexpected gold excellent you can lend me some and a thing here he turned the cup again that looks like an animalyeah if that was its headit looks like a hippono a sheep 
 
 professor trelawney whirled around as harry let out a snort of laughter 
 
 let me see that my dear she said reprovingly to ron sweeping over and snatching cup from him everyone went quiet to watch 
 
 professor trelawney was staring into the teacup rotating it counterclockwise 
 
 the falconmy dear you have a deadly enemy 
 
 but everyone knows that said hermione in a loud whisper professor trelawney stared at her 
 
 well they do said hermione everybody knows about harry and 
 
 harry and ron stared at her with a mixture of amazement and admiration they had never heard hermione speak to a teacher like that before professor trelawney chose not to reply she lowered her huge eyes to cup again and continued to turn it 
 
 the cluban attack dear dear this is not a happy cup 
 
 i thought that was a bowler hat said ron sheepishly 
 
 the skulldanger in your path my dear 
 
 everyone was staring transfixed at professor trelawney who gave the cup a final turn gasped and then screamed 
 
 there was another tinkle of breaking china neville had smashed his second cup professor trelawney sank into a vacant armchair her glittering hand at her heart and her eyes closed 
 
 my dear boy my poor dear boy no it is kinder not to say no ask me 
 
 what is it professor said dean thomas at once everyone had got to their feet and slowly they crowded around harry and table pressing close to professor chair to get a good look at cup 
 
 my dear professor huge eyes opened dramatically you have the grim 
 
 the what said harry 
 
 he could tell that he the only one who understand dean thomas shrugged at him and lavender brown looked puzzled but nearly everybody else clapped their hands to their mouths in horror 
 
 the grim my dear the grim cried professor trelawney who looked shocked that harry understood the giant spectral dog that haunts churchyards my dear boy it is an omen the worst omen of death 
 
 stomach lurched that dog on the cover of death omens in flourish and blotts the dog in the shadows of magnolia crescentlavender brown clapped her hands to her mouth too everyone was looking at harry everyone except hermione who had gotten up and moved around to the back of professor chair 
 
 i think it looks like a grim she said flatly 
 
 professor trelawney surveyed hermione with mounting dislike 
 
 forgive me for saying so my dear but i perceive very little aura around you very little receptivity to the resonances of the future 
 
 seamus finnigan was tilting his head from side to side 
 
 it looks like a grim if you do this he said with his eyes almost shut but it looks more like a donkey from here he said leaning to the left 
 
 when all finished deciding whether going to die or not said harry taking even himself by surprise now nobody seemed to want to look at him 
 
 i think we will leave the lesson here for today said professor trelawney in her mistiest voice yesplease pack away your things 
 
 silently the class took their teacups back to professor trelawney packed away their books and closed their bags even ron was avoiding eyes 
 
 until we meet again said professor trelawney faintly fair fortune be yours oh and dear she pointed at neville be late next time so mind you work to catch up 
 
 harry ron and hermione descended professor ladder and the winding stair in silence then set off for professor transfiguration lesson it took them so long to find her classroom that early as they had left divination they were only just in time 
 
 harry chose a seat right at the back of the room feeling as though he were sitting in a very bright spotlight the rest of the class kept shooting furtive glances at him as though he were about to drop dead at any moment he hardly heard what professor mcgonagall was telling them about animagi wizards who could transform at will into animals and even watching when she transformed herself in front of their eyes into a tabby cat with spectacle markings around her eyes 
 
 really what has got into you all today said professor mcgonagall turning back into herself with a faint pop and staring around at them all not that it matters but the first time my not got applause from a class 
 
 heads turned toward harry again but nobody spoke then hermione raised her hand 
 
 please professor just had our first divination class and we were reading the tea leaves and 
 
 ah of course said professor mcgonagall suddenly frowning there is no need to say any more miss granger tell me which of you will be dying this year 
 
 everyone stared at her 
 
 me said harry finally 
 
 i see said professor mcgonagall fixing harry with her beady eyes then you should know potter that sibyll trelawney has predicted the death of one student a year since she arrived at this school none of them has died yet seeing death omens is her favorite way of greeting a new class if it were not for the fact that i never speak ill of my colleagues professor mcgonagall broke off and they saw that her nostrils had gone white she went on more calmly divination is one of the most imprecise branches of magic i shall not conceal from you that i have very little patience with it true seers are very rare and professor trelawney 
 
 she stopped again and then said in a very tone you look in excellent health to me potter so you will excuse me if i let you off homework today i assure you that if you die you need not hand it in 
 
 hermione laughed harry felt a bit better it was harder to feel scared of a lump of tea leaves away from the dim red light and befuddling perfume of professor classroom not everyone was convinced however ron still looked worried and lavender whispered but what about cup 
 
 when the transfiguration class had finished they joined the crowd thundering toward the great hall for lunch 
 
 ron cheer up said hermione pushing a dish of stew toward him you heard what professor mcgonagall said 
 
 ron spooned stew onto his plate and picked up his fork but start 
 
 harry he said in a low serious voice you seen a great black dog anywhere have you 
 
 yeah i have said harry i saw one the night i left the dursleys 
 
 ron let his fork fall with a clatter 
 
 probably a stray said hermione calmly 
 
 ron looked at hermione as though she had gone mad 
 
 hermione if seen a grim bad he said my my uncle bilius saw one and and he died hours later 
 
 coincidence said hermione airily pouring herself some pumpkin juice 
 
 you know what talking about said ron starting to get angry grims scare the living daylights out of most wizards 
 
 there you are then said hermione in a superior tone they see the grim and die of fright the not an omen the cause of death and still with us because not stupid enough to see one and think right well better kick the bucket then 
 
 ron mouthed wordlessly at hermione who opened her bag took out her new arithmancy book and propped it open against the juice jug 
 
 i think divination seems very woolly she said searching for her page a lot of guesswork if you ask me 
 
 there was nothing woolly about the grim in that cup said ron hotly 
 
 you seem quite so confident when you were telling harry it was a sheep said hermione coolly 
 
 professor trelawney said you have the right aura you just like being bad at something for a change 
 
 he had touched a nerve hermione slammed her arithmancy book down on the table so hard that bits of meat and carrot flew everywhere 
 
 if being good at divination means i have to pretend to see death omens in a lump of tea leaves not sure be studying it much longer that lesson was absolute rubbish compared with my arithmancy class 
 
 she snatched up her bag and stalked away 
 
 ron frowned after her 
 
 she talking about he said to harry she been to an arithmancy class yet 
 
 
 
 harry was pleased to get out of the castle after lunch rain had cleared the sky was a clear pale gray and the grass was springy and damp underfoot as they set off for their first ever care of magical creatures class 
 
 ron and hermione speaking to each other harry walked beside them in silence as they went down the sloping lawns to hut on the edge of the forbidden forest it was only when he spotted three backs ahead of them that he realized they must be having these lessons with the slytherins malfoy was talking animatedly to crabbe and goyle who were chortling harry was quite sure he knew what they were talking about 
 
 hagrid was waiting for his class at the door of his hut he stood in his moleskin overcoat with fang the boarhound at his heels looking impatient to start 
 
 now get a move on he called as the class approached got a real treat for yeh today great lesson comin up everyone here right follow me 
 
 for one nasty moment harry thought that hagrid was going to lead them into the forest harry had had enough unpleasant experiences in there to last him a lifetime however hagrid strolled off around the edge of the trees and five minutes later they found themselves outside a kind of paddock there was nothing in there 
 
 everyone gather round the fence here he called it make sure yeh can see now firs thing want ter do is open yer books 
 
 how said the cold drawling voice of draco malfoy 
 
 eh said hagrid 
 
 how do we open our books malfoy repeated he took out his copy of the monster book of monsters which he had bound shut with a length of rope other people took theirs out too some like harry had belted their book shut others had crammed them inside tight bags or clamped them together with binder clips 
 
 hasn hasn anyone bin able ter open their books said hagrid looking crestfallen 
 
 the class all shook their heads 
 
 got ter stroke em said hagrid as though this was the most obvious thing in the world look 
 
 he took copy and ripped off the spellotape that bound it the book tried to bite but hagrid ran a giant forefinger down its spine and the book shivered and then fell open and lay quiet in his hand 
 
 oh how silly all been malfoy sneered we should have stroked them why we guess 
 
 i i thought they were funny hagrid said uncertainly to hermione 
 
 oh tremendously funny said malfoy really witty giving us books that try and rip our hands off 
 
 shut up malfoy said harry quietly hagrid was looking downcast and harry wanted first lesson to be a success 
 
 righ then said hagrid who seemed to have lost his thread so so got yer books yeh need the magical creatures yeah so go an get em hang on 
 
 he strode away from them into the forest and out of sight 
 
 god this place is going to the dogs said malfoy loudly that oaf teaching classes my have a fit when i tell him 
 
 shut up malfoy harry repeated 
 
 careful potter a dementor behind you 
 
 oooooooh squealed lavender brown pointing toward the opposite side of the paddock 
 
 trotting toward them were a dozen of the most bizarre creatures harry had ever seen they had the bodies hind legs and tails of horses but the front legs wings and heads of what seemed to be giant eagles with cruel beaks and large brilliantly orange eyes the talons on their front legs were half a foot long and deadly looking each of the beasts had a thick leather collar around its neck which was attached to a long chain and the ends of all of these were held in the vast hands of hagrid who came jogging into the paddock behind the creatures 
 
 gee up there he roared shaking the chains and urging the creatures toward the fence where the class stood everyone drew back slightly as hagrid reached them and tethered the creatures to the fence 
 
 hippogriffs hagrid roared happily waving a hand at them aren they 
 
 harry could sort of see what hagrid meant once you got over the first shock of seeing something that was half horse half bird you started to appreciate the hippogriffs gleaming coats changing smoothly from feather to hair each of them a different color stormy gray bronze pinkish roan gleaming chestnut and inky black 
 
 so said hagrid rubbing his hands together and beaming around if yeh wan ter come a bit nearer 
 
 no one seemed to want to harry ron and hermione however approached the fence cautiously 
 
 now firs thing yeh gotta know abou hippogriffs is proud said hagrid easily offended hippogriffs are never insult one cause it might be the last thing yeh do 
 
 malfoy crabbe and goyle listening they were talking in an undertone and harry had a nasty feeling they were plotting how best to disrupt the lesson 
 
 yeh always wait fer the hippogriff ter make the firs move hagrid continued polite see yeh walk toward him and yeh bow an yeh wait if he bows back allowed ter touch him if he doesn bow then get away from him sharpish cause those talons hurt 
 
 right who wants ter go first 
 
 most of the class backed farther away in answer even harry ron and hermione had misgivings the hippogriffs were tossing their fierce heads and flexing their powerful wings they seem to like being tethered like this 
 
 no one said hagrid with a pleading look 
 
 do it said harry 
 
 there was an intake of breath from behind him and both lavender and parvati whispered oooh no harry remember your tea leaves 
 
 harry ignored them he climbed over the paddock fence 
 
 good man harry roared hagrid right then see how yeh get on with buckbeak 
 
 he untied one of the chains pulled the gray hippogriff away from its fellows and slipped off its leather collar the class on the other side of the paddock seemed to be holding its breath eyes were narrowed maliciously 
 
 easy now harry said hagrid quietly got eye contact now try not ter blinkhippogriffs don trust yeh if yeh blink too much 
 
 eyes immediately began to water but he shut them buckbeak had turned his great sharp head and was staring at harry with one fierce orange eye it said hagrid it harrynow bow 
 
 harry feel much like exposing the back of his neck to buckbeak but he did as he was told he gave a short bow and then looked up 
 
 the hippogriff was still staring haughtily at him it move 
 
 ah said hagrid sounding worried right back away now harry easy does it 
 
 but then to enormous surprise the hippogriff suddenly bent its scaly front knees and sank into what was 
 
 an unmistakable bow 
 
 well done harry said hagrid ecstatic right yeh can touch him pat his beak go on 
 
 feeling that a better reward would have been to back away harry moved slowly toward the hippogriff and reached out toward it he patted the beak several times and the hippogriff closed its eyes lazily as though enjoying it 
 
 the class broke into applause all except for malfoy crabbe and goyle who were looking deeply disappointed 
 
 righ then harry said hagrid i reckon he migh let yeh ride him 
 
 this was more than harry had bargained for he was used to a broomstick but he sure a hippogriff would be quite the same 
 
 yeh climb up there jus behind the wing joint said hagrid an mind yeh don pull any of his feathers out he won like that 
 
 harry put his foot on the top of wing and hoisted himself onto its back buckbeak stood up harry sure where to hold on everything in front of him was covered with feathers 
 
 go on then roared hagrid slapping the hippogriffs hindquarters 
 
 without warning wings flapped open on either side of harry he just had time to seize the hippogriff around the neck before he was soaring upward it was nothing like a broomstick and harry knew which one he preferred the wings beat uncomfortably on either side of him catching him under his legs and making him feel he was about to be thrown off the glossy feathers slipped under his fingers and he dare get a stronger grip instead of the smooth action of his nimbus two thousand he now felt himself rocking backward and forward as the hindquarters of the hippogriff rose and fell with its wings 
 
 buckbeak flew him once around the paddock and then headed back to the ground this was the bit harry had been dreading he leaned back as the smooth neck lowered feeling he was going to slip off over the beak then felt a heavy thud as the four feet hit the ground he just managed to hold on and push himself straight again 
 
 good work harry roared hagrid as everyone except malfoy crabbe and goyle cheered okay who else wants a go 
 
 emboldened by success the rest of the class climbed cautiously into the paddock hagrid untied the hippogriffs one by one and soon people were bowing nervously all over the paddock neville ran repeatedly backward from his which seem to want to bend its knees ron and hermione practiced on the chestnut while harry watched 
 
 malfoy crabbe and goyle had taken over buckbeak he had bowed to malfoy who was now patting his beak looking disdainful 
 
 this is very easy malfoy drawled loud enough for harry to hear him i knew it must have been if potter could do iti bet not dangerous at all are you he said to the hippogriff are you you great ugly brute 
 
 it happened in a flash of steely talons malfoy let out a high pitched scream and next moment hagrid was wrestling buckbeak back into his collar as he strained to get at malfoy who lay curled in the grass blood blossoming over his robes 
 
 dying malfoy yelled as the class panicked dying look at me killed me 
 
 yer not dyin said hagrid who had gone very white someone help me gotta get him outta here 
 
 hermione ran to hold open the gate as hagrid lifted malfoy easily as they passed harry saw that there was a long deep gash on arm blood splattered the grass and hagrid ran with him up the slope toward the castle 
 
 very shaken the care of magical creatures class followed at a walk the slytherins were all shouting about hagrid 
 
 they should sack him straight away said pansy parkinson who was in tears 
 
 it was fault snapped dean thomas crabbe and goyle flexed their muscles threateningly 
 
 they all climbed the stone steps into the deserted entrance hall 
 
 going to see if okay said pansy and they all watched her run up the marble staircase the slytherins still muttering about hagrid headed away in the direction of their dungeon common room harry ron and hermione proceeded upstairs to gryffindor tower 
 
 you think be all right said hermione nervously 
 
 course he will madam pomfrey can mend cuts in about a second said harry who had had far worse injuries mended magically by the nurse 
 
 that was a really bad thing to happen in first class though it said ron looking worried trust malfoy to mess things up for him 
 
 they were among the first to reach the great hall at dinnertime hoping to see hagrid but he there 
 
 they fire him would they said hermione anxiously not touching her pudding 
 
 better not said ron who eating either 
 
 harry was watching the slytherin table a large group including crabbe and goyle was huddled together deep in conversation harry was sure they were cooking up their own version of how malfoy had been injured 
 
 well you say it an interesting first day back said ron gloomily 
 
 they went up to the crowded gryffindor common room after dinner and tried to do the homework professor mcgonagall had given them but all three of them kept breaking off and glancing out of the tower window 
 
 a light on in window harry said suddenly 
 
 ron looked at his watch 
 
 if we hurried we could go down and see him still quite early 
 
 i know hermione said slowly and harry saw her glance at him 
 
 allowed to walk across the grounds he said pointedly sirius black got past the dementors yet has he 
 
 so they put their things away and headed out of the portrait hole glad to meet nobody on their way to the front doors as they entirely sure they were supposed to be out 
 
 the grass was still wet and looked almost black in the twilight when they reached hut they knocked and a voice growled 
 
 hagrid was sitting in his shirtsleeves at his scrubbed wooden table his boarhound fang had his head in lap one look told them that hagrid had been drinking a lot there was a pewter tankard almost as big as a bucket in front of him and he seemed to be having difficulty getting them into focus 
 
 spect a record he said thickly when he recognized them don reckon ever had a teacher who lasted a day before 
 
 you been fired hagrid gasped hermione 
 
 not yet said hagrid miserably taking a huge gulp of whatever was in the tankard only a matter o time after malfoy 
 
 how is he said ron as they all sat down it serious was it 
 
 madam pomfrey fixed him best she could said hagrid dully but sayin still agonycovered in bandagesmoanin

 all fault hagrid said hermione earnestly 
 
 witnesses said harry you said hippogriffs attack if you insult them problem that he listening tell dumbledore what really happened 
 
 yeah worry hagrid back you up said ron 
 
 tears leaked out of the crinkled corners of eyes he grabbed both harry and ron and pulled them into a hug 
 
 i think had enough to drink hagrid said hermione firmly she took the tankard from the table and went outside to empty it 
 
 ah maybe right said hagrid letting go of harry and ron who both staggered away rubbing their ribs hagrid heaved himself out of his chair and followed hermione unsteadily outside they heard a loud splash 
 
 he done said harry nervously as hermione came back in with the empty tankard 
 
 stuck his head in the water barrel said hermione putting the tankard away 
 
 hagrid came back his long hair and beard sopping wet wiping the water out of his eyes 
 
 better he said shaking his head like a dog and drenching them all listen it was good of yeh ter come an see me i really 
 
 hagrid stopped dead staring at harry as though only just realized he was there 
 
 what think doin eh he roared so suddenly that they jumped a foot in the air not to go wanderin around after dark harry an you two lettin him 
 
 hagrid strode over to harry grabbed his arm and pulled him to the door

 harry felt as though he had barely lain down to steep in room when he was being shaken awake by mrs weasley 
 
 time to go harry dear she whispered moving away to wake ron 
 
 harry felt around for his glasses put them on and sat up it was still dark outside ron muttered indistinctly as his mother roused him at the foot of mattress he saw two large disheveled shapes emerging from tangles of blankets 
 
 s time already said fred groggily 
 
 they dressed in silence too sleepy to talk then yawning and stretching the four of them headed downstairs into the kitchen 
 
 mrs weasley was stirring the contents of a large pot on the stove while mr weasley was sitting at the table checking a sheaf of large parchment tickets he looked up as the boys entered and spread his arms so that they could see his clothes more clearly he was wearing what appeared to be a golfing sweater and a very old pair of jeans slightly too big for him and held up with a thick leather belt 
 
 what think he asked anxiously supposed to go incognito do i look like a muggle harry 
 
 yeah said harry smiling very good 
 
 bill and charlie and said george failing to stifle a huge yawn 
 
 well apparating they said mrs weasley heaving the large pot over to the table and starting to ladle porridge into bowls so they can have a bit of a 
 
 harry knew that apparating meant disappearing from one place and reappearing almost instantly in another but had never known any hogwarts student to do it and understood that it was very difficult 
 
 so still in bed said fred grumpily pulling his bowl of porridge toward him why we apparate too 
 
 because not of age and you passed your test snapped mrs weasley and where have those girls got to 
 
 she bustled out of the kitchen and they heard her climbing the stairs 
 
 you have to pass a test to apparate harry asked 
 
 oh yes said mr weasley tucking the tickets safely into the back pocket of his jeans the department of magical transportation had to fine a couple of people the other day for apparating without a license not easy apparition and when not done property it can lead to nasty complications this pair talking about went and splinched themselves 
 
 everyone around the table except harry winced 
 
 er splinched said harry 
 
 they left half of themselves behind said mr weasley now spooning large amounts of treacle onto his porridge so of course they were stuck move either way had to wait for the accidental magic reversal squad to sort them out meant a fair old bit of paperwork i can tell you what with the muggles who spotted the body parts left behind 
 
 harry had a sudden vision of a pair of legs and an eyeball lying abandoned on the pavement of privet drive 
 
 were they okay he asked startled 
 
 oh yes said mr weasley but they got a heavy fine and i think be trying it again in a hurry you mess around with apparition there are plenty of adult wizards who bother with it prefer brooms slower but safer 
 
 but bill and charlie and percy can all do it 
 
 charlie had to take the test twice said fred grinning he failed the first time apparated five miles south of where he meant to right on top of some poor old dear doing her shopping remember 
 
 yes well he passed the second time said mrs weasley marching back into the kitchen amid hearty sniggers 
 
 percy only passed two weeks ago said george been apparating downstairs every morning since just to prove he can 
 
 there were footsteps down the passageway and hermione and ginny came into the kitchen both looking pale and drowsy 
 
 why do we have to be up so early ginny said rubbing her eyes and sitting down at the table 
 
 got a bit of a walk said mr weasley 
 
 walk said harry what are we walking to the world cup 
 
 no no miles away said mr weasley smiling we only need to walk a short way just that very difficult for a large number of wizards to congregate without attracting muggle attention we have to be very careful about how we travel at the best of times and on a huge occasion like the quidditch world cup 
 
 george said mrs weasley sharply and they all jumped 
 
 what said george in an innocent tone that deceived nobody 
 
 what is that in your pocket 
 
 nothing 
 
 you lie to me 
 
 mrs weasley pointed her wand at pocket and said accio 
 
 several small brightly colored objects zoomed out of pocket he made a grab for them but missed and they sped right into mrs outstretched hand 
 
 we told you to destroy them said mrs weasley furiously holding up what were unmistakably more toffees we told you to get rid of the lot empty your pockets go on both of you 
 
 it was an unpleasant scene the twins had evidently been trying to smuggle as many toffees out of the house as possible and it was only by using her summoning charm that mrs weasley managed to find them all 
 
 accio accio accio she shouted and toffees zoomed from all sorts of unlikely places including the lining of jacket and the of jeans 
 
 we spent six months developing those fred shouted at his mother as she threw the toffees away 
 
 oh a fine way to spend six months she shrieked no wonder you get more 
 
 all in all the atmosphere was not very friendly as they took their departure mrs weasley was still glowering as she kissed mr weasley on the cheek though not nearly as much as the twins who had each hoisted their rucksacks onto their backs and walked out without a word to her 
 
 well have a lovely time said mrs weasley and behave yourselves she called after the twins retreating backs but they did not look back or answer send bill charlie and percy along around midday mrs weasley said to mr weasley as he harry ron hermione and ginny set off across the dark yard after fred and george 
 
 it was chilly and the moon was still out only a dull greenish tinge along the horizon to their right showed that daybreak was drawing closer harry having been thinking about thousands of wizards speeding toward the quidditch world cup sped up to walk with mr weasley 
 
 so how does everyone get there without all the muggles noticing he asked 
 
 been a massive organizational problem sighed mr weasley the trouble is about a hundred thousand wizards turn up at the world cup and of course we just got a magical site big enough to accommodate them all there are places muggles penetrate but imagine trying to pack a hundred thousand wizards into diagon alley or platform nine and so we had to find a nice deserted moor and set up as many precautions as possible the whole been working on it for months first of course we have to stagger the arrivals people with cheaper tickets have to arrive two weeks beforehand a limited number use muggle transport but we have too many clogging up their buses and trains remember wizards are coming from all over the world some apparate of course but we have to set up safe points for them to appear well away from muggles i believe a handy wood using as the apparition point for those who want to apparate or we use portkeys objects that are used to transport wizards from one spot to another at a prearranged time you can do large groups at a time if you need to there have been two hundred portkeys placed at strategic points around britain and the nearest one to us is up at the top of stoatshead hill so where headed 
 
 mr weasley pointed ahead of them where a large black mass rose beyond the village of ottery st catchpole 
 
 what sort of objects are portkeys said harry curiously 
 
 well they can be anything said mr weasley unobtrusive things obviously so muggles go picking them up and playing with themstuff just think is litter 
 
 they trudged down the dark dank lane toward the village the silence broken only by their footsteps the sky lightened very slowly as they made their way through the village its inky blackness diluting to deepest blue hands and feet were freezing mr weasley kept checking his watch 
 
 they have breath to spare for talking as they began to climb stoatshead hill stumbling occasionally in hidden rabbit holes slipping on thick black tuffets of grass each breath harry took was sharp in his chest and his legs were starting to seize up when at last his feet found level ground 
 
 whew panted mr weasley taking off his glasses and wiping them on his sweater well made good time got ten minutes 
 
 hermione came over the crest of the hill last clutching a stitch in her side 
 
 now we just need the portkey said mr weasley replacing his glasses and squinting around at the ground it be on 
 
 they spread out searching they had only been at it for a couple of minutes however when a shout rent the still air 
 
 over here arthur over here son got it 
 
 two tall figures were silhouetted against the starry sky on the other side of the hilltop 
 
 amos said mr weasley smiling as he strode over to the man who had shouted the rest of them followed 
 
 mr weasley was shaking hands with a wizard with a scrubby brown beard who was holding a old boot in his other hand 
 
 this is amos diggory everyone said mr weasley he works for the department for the regulation and control of magical creatures and i think you know his son cedric 
 
 cedric diggory was an extremely handsome boy of around seventeen he was captain and seeker of the hufflepuff house quidditch team at hogwarts 
 
 hi said cedric looking around at them all 
 
 everybody said hi back except fred and george who merely nodded they had never quite forgiven cedric for beating their team gryffindor in the first quidditch match of the previous year 
 
 long walk arthur father asked not too bad said mr weasley we live just on the other side of the village there you 
 
 had to get up at two we ced i tell you be glad when got his apparition test stillnot complainingquidditch world cup miss it for a sackful of galleons and the tickets cost about that mind you looks like i got off easy amos diggory peered around at the three weasley boys harry hermione and ginny all these yours arthur 
 
 oh no only the redheads said mr weasley pointing out his children this is hermione friend of and harry another friend 
 
 beard said amos diggory his eyes widening harry harry potter 
 
 er yeah said harry 
 
 harry was used to people looking curiously at him when they met him used to the way their eyes moved at once to the lightning scar on his forehead but it always made him feel uncomfortable 
 
 talked about you of course said amos diggory told us all about playing against you last yeari said to him i said ced be something to tell your grandchildren that beat harry potter 
 
 harry think of any reply to this so he remained silent fred and george were both scowling again cedric looked slightly embarrassed 
 
 harry fell off his broom dad he muttered i told youit was an accident 
 
 yes but you fall off did you roared amos genially slapping his son on his back always modest our ced always the gentlemanbut the best man won sure say the same you eh one falls off his broom one stays on you need to be a genius to tell which the better flier 
 
 must be nearly time said mr weasley quickly pulling out his watch again do you know whether waiting for any more amos 
 
 no the lovegoods have been there for a week already and the fawcetts get tickets said mr diggory there any more of us in this area are there 
 
 not that i know of said mr weasley yes a minute better get ready 
 
 he looked around at harry and hermione 
 
 you just need to touch the portkey all a finger will do 
 
 with difficulty owing to their bulky backpacks the nine of them crowded around the old boot held out by amos diggory 
 
 they all stood there in a tight circle as a chill breeze swept over the hilltop nobody spoke it suddenly occurred to harry how odd this would look if a muggle were to walk up here nownine people two of them grown men clutching this manky old boot in the semidarkness waiting 
 
 three muttered mr weasley one eye still on his watch twoone 
 
 it happened immediately harry felt as though a hook just behind his navel had been suddenly jerked irresistibly forward his feet left the ground he could feel ron and hermione on either side of him their shoulders banging into his they were all speeding forward in a howl of wind and swirling color his forefinger was stuck to the boot as though it was pulling him magnetically onward and then 
 
 his feet slammed into the ground ron staggered into him and he fell over the portkey hit the ground near his head with a heavy thud 
 
 harry looked up mr weasley mr diggory and cedric were still standing though looking very windswept everybody else was on the ground 
 
 seven past five from stoatshead hill said a voice 
 
 rowling

lionfish nov chapter six the noble and most ancient house of blackcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 mrs weasley followed them upstairs looking grim 
 
 i want you all to go straight to bed no talking she said as they reached the first landing got a busy day tomorrow i expect asleep she added to hermione so try not to wake her up 
 
 asleep yeah right said fred in an undertone after hermione bade them goodnight and they were climbing to the next floor if not lying awake waiting for hermione to tell her everything they said downstairs then a flobberworm 
 
 all right ron harry said mrs weasley on the second landing pointing them into their bedroom off to bed with you 
 
 night harry and ron said to the twins 
 
 sleep tight said fred winking 
 
 mrs weasley closed the door behind harry with a sharp snap the bedroom looked if anything even danker and gloomier than it had on first sight the blank picture on the wall was now breathing very slowly and deeply as though its invisible occupant was asleep harry put on his pyjamas took off his glasses and climbed into his chilly bed while ron threw owl treats up on top of the wardrobe to pacify hedwig and pigwidgeon who were clattering around and rustling their wings restlessly 
 
 we let them out to hunt every night ron explained as he pulled on his maroon pyjamas dumbledore want too many owls swooping around the square thinks look suspicious oh yeah i forgot 
 
 he crossed to the door and bolted it 
 
 you doing that for 
 
 kreacher said ron as he turned off the light first night i was here he came wandering in at three in the morning trust me you want to wake up and find him prowling around your room anyway he got into his bed settled down under the covers then turned to look at harry in the darkness harry could see his outline by the moonlight filtering in through the grimy window what reckon 
 
 harry need to ask what ron meant 
 
 well they tell us much we have guessed did they he said thinking of all that had been said downstairs i mean all really said is that the trying to stop people joining vol 
 
 there was a sharp intake of breath from ron 
 
 demort said harry firmly when are you going to start using his name sirius and lupin do 
 
 ron ignored this last comment 
 
 yeah right he said we already knew nearly everything they told us from using the extendable ears the only new bit was 
 
 crack 
 
 ouch 
 
 keep your voice down ron or be back up here 
 
 you two just apparated on my knees 
 
 yeah well harder in the dark 
 
 harry saw the blurred outlines of fred and george leaping down from bed there was a groan of bedsprings and mattress descended a few inches as george sat down near his feet 
 
 so got there yet said george eagerly 
 
 the weapon sirius mentioned said harry 
 
 let slip more like said fred with relish now sitting next to ron we hear about that on the old extendables did we 
 
 what reckon it is said harry 
 
 could be anything said fred 
 
 but there be anything worse than the avada kedavra curse can there said ron worse than death 
 
 maybe something that can kill loads of people at once suggested george 
 
 maybe some particularly painful way of killing people said ron learfully 
 
 got the cruciatus curse for causing pain said harry he need anything more efficient than that 
 
 there was a pause and harry knew that the others like him were wondering what horrors this weapon could perpetrate 
 
 so who got it now asked george 
 
 i hope our side said ron sounding slightly nervous 
 
 if it is probably keeping it said fred 
 
 where said ron quickly hogwarts 
 
 bet it is said george where he hid the stone 
 
 a going to be a lot bigger than the stone though said ron 
 
 not necessarily said fred 
 
 yeah size is no guarantee of power said george look at ginny 
 
 what mean said harry 
 
 never been on the receiving end of one of her hexes have you 
 
 shhh said fred from the bed listen 
 
 they fell silent footsteps were coming up the stairs 
 
 mum said george and without further ado there was a loud crack and harry felt the weight vanish from the end of his bed a few seconds later they heard the floorboard creak outside their door mrs weasley was plainly listening to check whether or not they were talking 
 
 hedwig and pigwidgeon hooted dolefully the floorboard creaked again and they heard her heading upstairs to check on fred and george 
 
 she trust us at all you know said ron regretfully 
 
 harry was sure he would not be able to fall asleep the evening had been so packed with things to think about that he fully expected to lie awake for hours mulling it all over he wanted to continue talking to ron but mrs weasley was now creaking back downstairs again and once she had gone he distinctly heard others making their way upstairs in fact creatures were cantering softly up and down outside the bedroom door and hagrid the care of magical creatures teacher was saying beauties they eh harry be studyin weapons this term and harry saw that the creatures had cannons for heads and were wheeling to face him he ducked 
 
 the next thing he knew he was curled into a warm ball under his bedclothes and loud voice was filling the room 
 
 mum says get up your breakfast is in the kitchen and then she needs you in the drawing room there are loads more doxys than she thought and found a nest of dead puffskeins under the sofa 
 
 half an hour later harry and ron who had dressed and breakfasted quickly entered the drawing room a long room on the first floor with walls covered in dirty tapestries the carpet exhaled little clouds of dust every time someone put their foot on it and the long velvet curtains were buzzing as though swarming with invisible bees it was around these that mrs weasley hermione ginny fred and george were grouped all looking rather peculiar as they had each tied a cloth over their nose and mouth each of them was also holding a large bottle of black liquid with a nozzle at the end 
 
 cover your faces and take a spray mrs weasley said to harry and ron the moment she saw them pointing to two more bottles of black liquid standing on a table doxycide never seen an infestation this badwhat that been doing for the last ten years 
 
 face was half concealed by a tea towel but harry distinctly saw her throw a reproachful look at mrs weasley 
 
 really old he probably manage 
 
 be surprised what kreacher can manage when he wants to hermione said sirius who had just entered the room carrying a bloodstained bag of what appeared to be dead rats just been feeding buckbeak he added in reply to enquiring look i keep him upstairs in my bedroom anyway this writing desk 
 
 he dropped the bag of rats into an armchair then bent over to examine the locked cabinet which harry now noticed for the first time was shaking slightly 
 
 well molly pretty sure this is a boggart said sirius peering through the keyhole but perhaps we ought to let have a shifty at it before we let it outknowing my mother it could be something much worse 
 
 right you are sirius said mrs weasley 
 
 they were both speaking in carefully light polite voices that told harry quite plainly that neither had forgotten their disagreement of the night before 
 
 a loud clanging bell sounded from downstairs followed at once by the cacophony of screams and wails that had been triggered the previous night by tonks knocking over the umbrella stand 
 
 i keep telling them not to ring the doorbell said sirius exasperatedly hurrying out of the room they heard him thundering clown the stairs as mrs screeches echoed up through the house once more stains of dishonour filthy blood traitors children of flith 
 
 close the door please harry said mrs weasley 
 
 harry took as much time as he dared to close the door he wanted to listen to what was going on downstairs sirius had obviously managed to shut the curtains over his mothers portrait because she had stopped screaming he heard sirius walking down the hall then the clattering of the chain on the front door and then a deep voice he recognised as kingsley saying just relieved me so got cloak now thought leave a report for dumbledore 
 
 feeling mrs eyes on the back of his head harry regretfully closed the door and rejoined the doxy party 
 
 mrs weasley was bending over to check the page on doxys in gilderoy guide to household pests which was lying open on the sofa 
 
 right you lot you need to be careful because doxys bite and their teeth are poisonous got a bottle of antidote here but rather nobody needed it 
 
 she straightened up positioned herself squarely in front of the curtains and beckoned them all forward 
 
 when i say the word start spraying immediately she said come flying out at us i expect but it says on the sprays one good squirt will paralyse them when immobilized just throw them in this bucket 
 
 she stepped carefully out of their line of fire and raised her own spray 
 
 all rightsquirt 
 
 harry had been spraying only a few seconds when a doxy came soaring out of a fold in the material shiny wings whirring tiny teeth bared its body covered with thick black hair and its four tiny fists clenched with fury harry caught it full in the face with a blast of doxycide it froze in midair and fell with a surprisingly loud thunk on to the worn carpet below harry picked it up and threw it in the bucket 
 
 fred what are you doing said mrs weasley sharply spray that at once and throw it away 
 
 harry looked round fred was holding a struggling doxy between his forefinger and thumb 
 
 fred said brightly spraying the doxy quickly in the face so that it fainted but the moment mrs back was turned he pocketed it with a wink 
 
 we want to experiment with doxy venom for our skiving snackboxes george told harry under his breath 
 
 deftly spraying two doxys at once as they soared straight for his nose harry moved closer to george and muttered out of the corner of his mouth what are skiving snackboxes 
 
 range of sweets to make you ill george whispered keeping a wary eye on mrs back not seriously ill mind just ill enough to get you out of a class when you feel like it fred and i have been developing them this summer chews if you eat the orange half of the puking pastilles you throw up moment been rushed out of the lesson for the hospital wing you swallow the purple half 
 
 which restores you to full fitness enabling you to pursue the leisure activity of your own choice during an hour that would otherwise have been devoted to unprofitable boredom what putting in the adverts anyway whispered fred who had edged over out of mrs line of vision and was now sweeping a few stray doxys from the floor and adding them to his pocket but they still need a bit of work at the moment our testers are having a bit of trouble stopping themselves puking long enough to swallow the purple end 
 
 testers 
 
 us said fred we take it in turns george did the fainting fancieswe both tried the nosebleed nougat 
 
 mum thought been duelling said george 
 
 joke shop still on then harry muttered pretending to be adjusting the nozzle on his spray 
 
 well we had a chance to get premises yet said fred dropping his voice even lower as mrs weasley mopped her brow with her scarf before returning to the attack so running it as a service at the moment we put advertisements in the daily prophet last week 
 
 all thanks to you mate said george but worry mum got a clue she read the daily prophet any more cause of it telling lies about you and dumbledore 
 
 harry grinned he had forced the weasley twins to take the prize money he had won in the triwizard tournament to help them realise their ambition to open a joke shop but he was still glad to know that his part in furthering their plans was unknown to mrs weasley she did not think running a joke shop was a suitable career for two of her sons 
 
 the of the curtains took most of the morning it was past midday when mrs weasley finally removed her protective scarf sank into a sagging armchair and sprang up again with a cry of disgust having sat on the bag of dead rats the curtains were no longer buzzing they hung limp and damp from the intensive spraying unconscious doxys lay crammed in the bucket at the foot of them beside a bowl of their black eggs at which crookshanks was now sniffing and fred and george were shooting covetous looks 
 
 i think tackle those after lunch 
 
 mrs weasley pointed at the dusty cabinets standing on either side of the mantelpiece they were crammed with an odd assortment of objects a selection of rusty daggers claws a coiled snakeskin a number of tarnished silver boxes inscribed with languages harry could not understand and least pleasant of all an ornate crystal bottle with a large opal set into the stopper full of what harry was quite sure was blood 
 
 the clanging doorbell rang again everyone looked at mrs weasley 
 
 stay here she said firmly snatching up the bag of rats as mrs blacks screeches started up again from down below bring up some sandwiches 
 
 she left the room closing the door carefully behind her at once everyone dashed over to the window to look down on the doorstep they could see the top of an unkempt gingery head and a stack of precariously balanced cauldrons 
 
 mundungus said hermione he brought all those cauldrons for 
 
 probably looking for a safe place to keep them said harry that what he was doing the night he was supposed to be tailing me picking up dodgy cauldrons 
 
 yeah right said fred as the front door opened mundungus heaved his cauldrons through it and disappeared from view blimey mum like that 
 
 he and george crossed to the door and stood beside it listening closely mrs screaming had stopped 
 
 mundungus is talking to sirius and kingsley fred muttered frowning with concentration hear properly reckon we can risk the extendable ears 
 
 might be worth it said george i could sneak upstairs and get a pair 
 
 but at that precise moment there was an explosion of sound from downstairs that rendered extendable ears quite unnecessary all of them could hear exactly what mrs weasley was shouting at the top of her voice 
 
 we are not running a hideout for stolen goods 
 
 i love hearing mum shouting at someone else said fred with a satisfied smile on his face as he opened the door an inch or so to allow mrs voice to permeate the room better it makes such a nice change 
 
 completely irresponsible as if we got enough to worry about without you dragging stolen cauldrons into the house 
 
 the idiots are letting her get into her stride said george shaking his head got to head her off early otherwise she builds up a head of steam and goes on for hours and been dying to have a go at mundungus ever since he sneaked off when he was supposed to be following you harryand there goes mum again 
 
 mrs voice was lost amid fresh shrieks and screams from the portraits in the hall 
 
 george made to shut the door to drown the noise but before he could do so a edged into the room 
 
 except for the filthy rag tied like a loincloth around its middle it was completely naked it looked very old its skin seemed to be several times too big for it and though it was bald like all there was a quantity of white hair growing out of its large batlike ears its eyes were a bloodshot and watery grey and its fleshy nose was large and rather snoutlike 
 
 the elf took absolutely no notice of harry and the rest acting as though it could not see them it shuffled hunchbacked slowly and doggedly towards the far end of the room all the while muttering under its breath in a hoarse deep voice like a smells like a drain and a criminal to boot but no better nasty old blood traitor with her brats messing up my house oh my poor mistress if she knew if she knew the scum let into her house what would she say to old kreacher oh the shame of it mudbloods and werewolves and traitors and thieves poor old kreacher what can he do 
 
 hello kreacher said fred very loudly closing the door with a snap 
 
 the froze in his tracks stopped muttering and gave a very pronounced and very unconvincing start of surprise 
 
 kreacher did not see young master he said turning around and bowing to fred still lacing the carpet he added perfectly audibly nasty little brat of a blood traitor it is 
 
 sorry said george catch that last bit 
 
 kreacher said nothing said the elf with a second bow to george adding in a clear undertone and its twin unnataral little beasts they are 
 
 harry know whether to laugh or not the elf straightened up eyeing them all malevolently and apparently convinced that they could not hear him as he continued to mutter 
 
 and the mudblood standing there bold as brass oh if my mistress knew oh how cry and a new boy kreacher know his name what is he doing here kreacher know 
 
 this is harry kreacher said hermione tentatively harry potter 
 
 pale eyes widened and he muttered faster and more furiously than ever 
 
 the mudblood is talking to kreacher as though she is my friend if mistress saw him in such company oh what would she say 
 
 call her a mudblood said ron and ginny together very angrily 
 
 it matter hermione whispered not in his right mind he know what 
 
 kid yourself hermione he knows exactly what saying said fred eyeing kreacher with great dislike 
 
 kreacher was still muttering his eyes on harry 
 
 is it true is it harry potter kreacher can see the scar it must be true the boy who stopped the dark lord kreacher wonders how he did it 
 
 we all kreacher said fred 
 
 what do you want anyway george asked 
 
 huge eyes darted towards george 
 
 kreacher is cleaning he said evasively 
 
 a likely story said a voice behind harry 
 
 sirius had come back he was glowering at the elf from the doorway the noise in the hall had abated perhaps mrs weasley and mundungus had moved their argument down into the kitchen 
 
 at the sight of sirius kreacher flung himself into a ridiculously low bow that flattened his snoutlike nose on the floor 
 
 stand up straight said sirius impatiently now what are you up to 
 
 kreacher is cleaning the elf repeated kreacher lives to serve the noble house of black 
 
 and getting blacker every day filthy said sirius 
 
 master always liked his little joke said kreacher bowing again and continuing in an undertone master was a nasty ungrateful swine who broke his heart 
 
 my mother have a heart kreacher snapped sirius she kept herself alive out of pure spite 
 
 kreacher bowed again as he spoke 
 
 whatever master says he muttered furiously master is not fit to wipe slime from his boots oh my poor mistress what would she say if she saw kreacher serving him how she hated him what a disappointment he was 
 
 i asked you what you were up to said sirius coldly every time you show up pretending to be cleaning you sneak something off to your room so we throw it out 
 
 kreacher would never move anything from its proper place in house said the elf then muttered very fast mistress would never forgive kreacher if the tapestry was thrown out seven centuries been in the family kreacher must save it kreacher will not let master and the blood traitors and the brats destroy it 
 
 i thought it might be that said sirius casting a disdainful look at the opposite wall have put another permanent sticking charm on the back of it i doubt but if i can get rid of it i certainly will now go away kreacher 
 
 it seemed that kreacher did not dare disobey a direct order nevertheless the look he gave sirius as he shuffled out past him was full of deepest loathing and he muttered all the way out of the room 
 
 comes back from azkaban ordering kreacher around oh my poor mistress what would she say if she saw the house now scum living in it her treasures thrown out she swore he was no son of hers and back they say a murderer too 
 
 keep muttering and i will be a murderer said sirius irritably as he slammed the door shut on the elf 
 
 sirius not right in the head hermione pleaded i think he realises we can hear him 
 
 been alone too long said sirius taking mad orders from my portrait and talking to himself but he was always a foul little 
 
 if you could just set him free said hermione hopefully maybe 
 
 we set him free he knows too much about the order said sirius curtly and anyway the shock would kill him you suggest to him that he leaves this house see how he takes it 
 
 sirius walked across the room to where the tapestry kreacher had been trying to protect hung the length of the wall harry and the others followed 
 
 the tapestry looked immensely old it was faded and looked as though doxys had gnawed it in places nevertheless the golden thread with which it was embroidered still glinted brightly enough to show them a sprawling family tree dating back as far as harry could tell to the middle ages large words at the very top of the tapestry read 
 
 the noble and most ancient house of pur 
 
 not on here said harry after scanning the bottom of the tree closely 
 
 i used to be there said sirius pointing at a small round charred hole in the tapestry rather like a cigarette burn my sweet old mother blasted me off after i ran away from home quite fond of muttering the story under his breath 
 
 you ran away from home 
 
 when i was about sixteen said sirius had enough 
 
 where did you go asked harry staring at him 
 
 your place said sirius your grandparents were really good about it they sort of adopted me as a second son yeah i camped out at your in the school holidays and then when i was seventeen i got a place of my own my uncle alphard had left me a decent bit of been wiped off here too probably whyanyway after that i looked after myself i was always welcome at mr and mrs potters for sunday lunch though 
 
 but why did you 
 
 leave sirius smiled bitterly and ran his fingers through his long unkempt hair because i hated the whole lot of them my parents with their mania convinced that to be a black made you practically royal my idiot brother soft enough to believe them him 
 
 sirius jabbed a finger at the very bottom of the tree at the name regulus black a date of death some fifteen years previously followed the date of birth 
 
 he was younger than me said sirius and a much better son as i was constantly reminded 
 
 but he died said harry 
 
 yeah said sirius stupid idiot he joined the death eaters 
 
 kidding 
 
 come on harry you seen enough of this house to tell what kind of wizards my family were said sirius testily 
 
 werewere your parents death eaters as well 
 
 no no but believe me they thought voldemort had the right idea they were all for the purification of the wizarding race getting rid of and having in charge they alone either there were quite a few people before voldemort showed his true colours who thought he had the right idea about things they got cold feet when they saw what he was prepared to do to get power though but i bet my parents thought regulus was a right little hero for joining up at first 
 
 was he killed by an auror harry asked tentatively 
 
 oh no said sirius no he was murdered by voldemort or on orders more likely i doubt regulus was ever important enough to be killed by voldemort in person from what i found out after he died he got in so far then panicked about what he was being asked to do and tried to back out well you just hand in your resignation to voldemort a lifetime of service or death 
 
 lunch said mrs voice 
 
 she was holding her wand high in front of her balancing a huge tray loaded with sandwiches and cake on its tip she was very red in the face and still looked angry the others moved over to her eager for some food but harry remained with sirius who had bent closer to the tapestry 
 
 i looked at this for years phineas nigellus my see least popular headmaster hogwarts ever had and araminta meliflua cousin of my tried to force through a ministry bill to make legal and dear aunt elladora she started the family tradition of beheading when they got too old to carry tea trays of course any time the family produced someone halfway decent they were disowned i see tonks on here maybe why kreacher take orders from supposed to do whatever anyone in the family asks him 
 
 you and tonks are related harry asked surprised 
 
 oh yeah her mother andromeda was my favourite cousin said sirius examining the tapestry closely no not on here either look 
 
 he pointed to another small round burn mark between two names bellatrix and narcissa 
 
 sisters are still here because they made lovely respectable marriages but andromeda married a ted tonks so 
 
 sirius mimed blasting the tapestry with a wand and laughed sourly harry however did not laugh he was too busy staring at the names to the right of burn mark a double line of gold embroidery linked narcissa black with lucius malfoy and a single vertical gold line from their names led to the name draco 
 
 related to the malfoys 
 
 the families are all interrelated said sirius if only going to let your sons and daughters marry our choice is very limited there are hardly any of us left molly and i are cousins by marriage and something like my second cousin once removed but no point looking for them on hereif ever a family was a bunch of blood traitors the weasleys 
 
 but harry was now looking at the name to the left of burn bellatrix black which was connected by a double line to rodolphus lestrange 
 
 lestrange harry said aloud the name had stirred something in his memory he knew it from somewhere but for a moment he think where though it gave him an odd creeping sensation in the pit of his stomach 
 
 in azkaban said sirius shortly 
 
 harry looked at him curiously 
 
 bellatrix and her husband rodolphus came in with barty crouch junior said sirius in the same brusque voice brother rabastan was with them too 
 
 then harry remembered he had seen bellatrix lestrange inside pensieve the strange device in which thoughts and memories could be stored a tall dark woman with eyes who had stood at her trial and proclaimed her continuing allegiance to lord voldemort her pride that she had tried to find him after his downfall and her conviction that she would one day be rewarded for her loyalty 
 
 you never said she was your 
 
 does it matter if my cousin snapped sirius as far as concerned not my family certainly not my family i seen her since i was your age unless you count a glimpse of her coming into azkaban think proud of having a relative like her 
 
 sorry said harry quickly i meani was just surprised all 
 
 it matter apologise sirius mumbled he turned away from the tapestry his hands deep in his pockets i like being back here he said staring across the drawing room i never thought be stuck in this house again 
 
 harry understood completely he knew how he would feel when he was grown up and thought he was free of the place for ever to return and live at number four privet drive 
 
 ideal for headquarters of course sirius said my father put every security measure known to wizardkind on it when he lived here unplottable so muggles could never come and callas if ever have wanted toand now added his protection be hard put to find a safer house anywhere for the order you knownobody can find headquarters unless he tells them personally where it isthat note moody showed you last night that was from dumbledore sirius gave a short laugh if my parents could see the use their house was being put to now well my mothers portrait should give you some idea 
 
 he scowled for a moment then sighed 
 
 i mind if i could just get out occasionally and do something useful asked dumbledore whether i can escort you to your hearingas snuffles obviouslyso i can give you a bit of moral support what think 
 
 harry felt as though his stomach had sunk through the dusty carpet he had not thought about the hearing once since dinner the previous evening in the excitement of being back with the people he liked best and hearing everything that was going on it had completely flown his mind at words however the crushing sense of dread returned to him he stared at hermione and the weasleys all tucking into their sandwiches and thought how he would feel if they went back to hogwarts without him 
 
 worry sirius said harry looked up and realised that sirius had been watching him sure clear you definitely something in the international statute of secrecy about being allowed to use magic to save your own life 
 
 but if they do expel me said harry quietly can i come back here and live with you 
 
 sirius smiled sadly 
 
 see 
 
 feel a lot better about the hearing if i knew i have to go back to the dursleys harry pressed him 
 
 they must be bad if you prefer this place said sirius gloomily 
 
 hurry up you two or there be any food left mrs weasley called 
 
 sirius heaved another great sigh cast a dark look at the tapestry then he and harry went to join the others 
 
 harry tried his best not to think about the hearing while he emptied the cabinets that afternoon fortunately for him it was a job that required a lot of concentration as many of the objects in there seemed very reluctant to leave their dusty shelves sirius sustained a bad bite from a silver snuffbox within seconds his bitten hand had developed an unpleasant crusty covering like a tough brown glove 
 
 ok he said examining the hand with interest before tapping it lightly with his wand and restoring its skin to normal must be wartcap powder in there 
 
 he threw the box aside into the sack where they were depositing the debris from the cabinets harry saw george wrap his own hand carefully in a cloth moments later and sneak the box into his already pocket 
 
 they found an silver instrument something like a pair of tweezers which scuttled up arm like a spider when he picked it up and attempted to puncture his skin sirius seized it and smashed it with a heavy book entitled nobility a wizarding genealogy there was a musical box that emitted a faintly sinister tinkling tune when wound and they all found themselves becoming curiously weak and sleepy until ginny had the sense to slam the lid shut a heavy locket that none of them could open a number of ancient seals and in a dusty box an order of merlin first class that had been awarded to grandfather for services to the ministry 
 
 it means he gave them a load of gold said sirius contemptuously throwing the medal into the rubbish sack 
 
 several times kreacher sidled into the room and attempted to smuggle things away under his loincloth muttering horrible curses every time they caught him at it when sirius wrested a large golden ring bearing the black crest from his grip kreacher actually burst into furious tears and left the room sobbing under his breath and calling sirius names harry had never heard before 
 
 it was my said sirius throwing the ring into the sack kreacher quite as devoted to him as to my mother but i still caught him snogging a pair of my old trousers last week 
 
 mrs weasley kept them all working very hard over the next few days the drawing room took three days to decontaminate finally the only undesirable things left in it were the tapestry of the black family tree which resisted all their attempts to remove it from the wall and the rattling writing desk moody had not dropped by headquarters yet so they could not be sure what was inside it 
 
 they moved from the drawing room to a dining room on the ground floor where they found spiders as large as saucers lurking in the dresser ron left the room hurriedly to make a cup of tea and did not return for an hour and a half the china which bore the black crest and motto was all thrown unceremoniously into a sack by sirius and the same fate met a set of old photographs in tarnished silver frames all of whose occupants squealed shrilly as the glass covering them smashed 
 
 snape might refer to their work as cleaning but in opinion they were really waging war on the house which was putting up a very good fight aided and abetted by kreacher the kept appearing wherever they were congregated his muttering becoming more and more offensive as he attempted to remove anything he could from the rubbish sacks sirius went as far as to threaten him with clothes but kreacher fixed him with a watery stare and said master must do as master wishes before turning away and muttering very loudly but master will not turn kreacher away no because kreacher knows what they are up to oh yes he is plotting against the dark lord yes with these mudblood and traitors and scum 
 
 at which sirius ignoring protests seized kreacher by the back of his loincloth and threw him bodily from the room 
 
 the doorbell rang several times a day which was the cue for mother to start shrieking again and for harry and the others to attempt to eavesdrop on the visitor though they gleaned very little from the brief glimpses and snatches of conversation they were able to sneak before mrs weasley recalled them to their tasks snape flitted in and out of the house several times more though to relief they never came face to face harry also caught sight of his transfiguration teacher professor mcgonagall looking very odd in a muggle dress and coat and she also seemed too busy to linger sometimes however the visitors stayed to help tonks joined them for a memorable afternoon in which they found a murderous old ghoul lurking in an upstairs toilet and lupin who was staying in the house with sirius but who left it for long periods to do mysterious work for the order helped them repair a grandfather clock that had developed the unpleasant habit of shooting heavy bolts at mundungus redeemed himself slightly in mrs eyes by rescuing ron from an ancient set of purple robes that had tried to strangle him when he removed them from their wardrobe 
 
 despite the fact that he was still sleeping badly still having dreams about corridors and locked doors that made his scar prickle harry was managing to have fun for the first time all summer as long as he was busy he was happy when the action abated however whenever he dropped his guard or lay exhausted in bed watching blurred shadows move across the ceiling the thought of the looming ministry hearing returned to him fear jabbed at his insides like needles as he wondered what was going to happen to him if he was expelled the idea was so terrible that he did not dare voice it aloud not even to ron and hermione who though he often saw them whispering together and casting anxious looks in his direction followed his lead in not mentioning it sometimes he could not prevent his imagination showing him a faceless ministry official who was snapping his wand in two and ordering him back to the dursleys but he would not go he was determined on that he would come back here to grimmauld place and live with sirius 
 
 he felt as though a brick had dropped into his stomach when mrs weasley turned to him during dinner on wednesday evening and said quietly ironed your best clothes for tomorrow morning harry and i want you to wash your hair tonight too a good first impression can work wonders 
 
 ron hermione fred george and ginny all stopped talking and looked over at him harry nodded and tried to keep eating his chop but his mouth had become so dry he could not chew 
 
 how am i getting there he asked mrs weasley trying to sound unconcerned 
 
 taking you to work with him said mrs weasley gently 
 
 mr weasley smiled encouragingly at harry across the table 
 
 you can wait in my office until time for the hearing he said 
 
 harry looked over at sirius but before he could ask the question mrs weasley had answered it 
 
 professor dumbledore think a good idea for sirius to go with you and i must say i 
 
 think quite right said sirius through clenched teeth 
 
 mrs weasley pursed her lips 
 
 when did dumbledore tell you that harry said staring at sirius 
 
 he came last night when you were in bed said mr weasley 
 
 sirius stabbed moodily at a potato with his fork harry lowered his own eyes to his plate the thought that dumbledore had been in the house on the eve of his hearing and not asked to see him made him feel if it were possible even worse 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter six detourcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry remained within the confines of the garden over the next few weeks he spent most of his days playing quidditch in the weasleys orchard he and hermione against ron and ginny hermione was dreadful and ginny good so they were reasonably well matched and his evenings eating triple helpings of everything mrs weasley put in front of him 
 
 it would have been a happy peaceful holiday had it not been for the stories of disappearances odd accidents even of deaths now appearing almost daily in the prophet sometimes bill and mr weasley brought home news before it even reached the paper to mrs displeasure sixteenth birthday celebrations were marred by grisly tidings brought to the party by remus lupin who was looking gaunt and grim his brown hair streaked liberally with gray his clothes more ragged and patched than ever 
 
 there have been another couple of dementor attacks he announced as mrs weasley passed him a large slice of birthday cake and found igor body in a shack up north the dark mark had been set over it well frankly surprised he stayed alive for even a year after deserting the death eaters brother regulus only managed a few days as far as i can remember 
 
 yes well said mrs weasley frowning perhaps we should talk about something diff 
 
 did you hear about florean fortescue remus asked bill who was being plied with wine by fleur the man who ran 
 
 the place in diagon alley harry interrupted with an unpleasant hollow sensation in the pit of his stomach he used to give me free ice creams happened to him 
 
 dragged off by the look of his place 
 
 why asked ron while mrs weasley pointedly glared at bill 
 
 who knows he upset them somehow he was a good man florean 
 
 talking of diagon alley said mr weasley looks like gone too 
 
 the said ginny looking startled 
 
 the one empty no sign of a struggle no one knows whether he left voluntarily or was kidnapped 
 
 but people do for wands 
 
 make do with other makers said lupin but ollivander was the best and if the other side have got him not so good for us 
 
 the day after this rather gloomy birthday tea their letters and booklists arrived from hogwarts included a surprise he had been made quidditch captain 
 
 that gives you equal status with prefects cried hermione happily you can use our special bathroom now and everything 
 
 wow i remember when charlie wore one of these said ron examining the badge with glee harry this is so cool my captain if you let me back on the team i suppose ha ha 
 
 well i suppose we can put off a trip to diagon alley much longer now got these sighed mrs weasley looking down booklist go on saturday as long as your father have to go into work again not going there without him 
 
 mum honestly think going to be hiding behind a bookshelf in flourish and blotts sniggered ron 
 
 fortescue and ollivander went on holiday did they said mrs weasley firing up at once if you think a laughing matter you can stay behind and get your things myself 
 
 no i wanna come i want to see fred and shop said ron hastily 
 
 then you just buck up your ideas young man before i decide too immature to come with us said mrs weasley angrily snatching up her clock all nine hands of which were still pointing at mortal peril and balancing it on top of a pile of towels and that goes for returning to hogwarts as well 
 
 ron turned to stare incredulously at harry as his mother hoisted the laundry basket and the teetering clock into her arms and stormed out of the room 
 
 blimey you even make a joke round here anymore 
 
 but ron was careful not to be flippant about voldemort over the next few days saturday dawned without any more outbursts from mrs weasley though she seemed very tense at breakfast bill who would be staying at home with fleur much to hermione and pleasure passed a full money bag across the table to harry 
 
 mine demanded ron at once his eyes wide 
 
 already idiot said bill i got it out of your vault for you harry because taking about five hours for the public to get to their gold at the moment the goblins have tightened security so much two days ago arkie philpott had a probity probe stuck up his well trust me this easier 
 
 thanks bill said harry pocketing his gold 
 
 e is always so thoughtful purred fleur adoringly stroking nose ginny mimed vomiting into her cereal behind fleur harry choked over his cornflakes and ron thumped him on the back 
 
 it was an overcast murky day one of the special ministry of magic cars in which harry had ridden once before was awaiting them in the front yard when they emerged from the house pulling on their cloaks 
 
 good dad can get us these again said ron appreciatively stretching luxuriously as the car moved smoothly away from the burrow bill and fleur waving from the kitchen window he harry hermione and ginny were all sitting in roomy comfort in the wide backseat 
 
 get used to it only because of harry said mr weasley over his shoulder he and mrs weasley were in front with the ministry driver the front passenger seat had obligingly stretched into what resembled a sofa been given security status and be joining up with additional security at the leaky cauldron too 
 
 harry said nothing he did not much fancy doing his shopping while surrounded by a battalion of aurors he had stowed his invisibility cloak in his backpack and felt that if that was good enough for dumbledore it ought to be good enough for the ministry though now he came to think of it he was not sure the ministry knew about his cloak 
 
 here you are then said the driver a surprisingly short while later speaking for the first time as he slowed in charing cross road and stopped outside the leaky cauldron to wait for you any idea how long be 
 
 a couple of hours i expect said mr weasley ah good here 
 
 harry imitated mr weasley and peered through the window his heart leapt there were no aurors waiting outside the inn but instead the gigantic form of rubeus hagrid the hogwarts gamekeeper wearing a long beaverskin coat beaming at the sight of face and oblivious to the startled stares of passing muggles 
 
 harry he boomed sweeping harry into a hug the moment harry had stepped out of the car buckbeakwitherwings i meanyeh should see him harry so happy ter be back in the open air 
 
 glad pleased said harry grinning as he massaged his ribs we know security meant you 
 
 i know jus like old times innit see the ministry wanted ter send a bunch o aurors but dumbledore said do said hagrid proudly throwing out his chest and tucking his thumbs into his pockets lets get goin thenafter yeh molly arthur 
 
 the leaky cauldron was for the first time in memory completely empty only tom the landlord wizened and toothless remained of the old crowd he looked up hopefully as they entered but before he could speak hagrid said importantly jus passin through today tom sure yeh understand hogwarts business yeh know 
 
 tom nodded gloomily and returned to wiping glasses harry hermione hagrid and the weasleys walked through the bar and out into the chilly little courtyard at the back where the dustbins stood hagrid raised his pink umbrella and rapped a certain brick in the wall which opened at once to form an archway onto a winding cobbled street they stepped through the entrance and paused looking around 
 
 diagon alley had changed the colorful glittering window displays of spellbooks potion ingredients and cauldrons were lost to view hidden behind the large ministry of magic posters that had been pasted over them most of these somber purple posters carried versions of the security advice on the ministry pamphlets that had been sent out over the summer but others bore moving photographs of death eaters known to be on the loose bellatrix lestrange was sneering from the front of the nearest apothecary a few windows were boarded up including those of florean ice cream parlor on the other hand a number of stalls had sprung up along the street the nearest one which had been erected outside flourish and blotts under a striped stained awning had a cardboard sign pinned to its front 
 
 amulets effective against werewolves dementors and inferi 
 a little wizard was rattling armfuls of silver symbols on chains at passersby 
 
 one for your little girl madam he called at mrs weasley as they passed leering at ginny protect her pretty neck 
 
 if i were on duty said mr weasley glaring angrily at the amulet seller 
 
 yes but go arresting anyone now dear in a hurry said mrs weasley nervously consulting a list i think better do madam first hermione wants new dress robes and showing much too much ankle in his school robes and you must need new ones too harry grown so much come on everyone 
 
 molly it make sense for all of us to go to madam said mr weasley why those three go with hagrid and we can go to flourish and blotts and get school books 
 
 i know said mrs weasley anxiously clearly torn between a desire to finish the shopping quickly and the wish to stick together in a pack hagrid do you think 
 
 don fret be fine with me molly said hagrid soothingly waving an airy hand the size of a dustbin lid mrs weasley did not look entirely convinced but allowed the separation scurrying off toward flourish and blotts with her husband and ginny while harry ron hermione and hagrid set off for madam 
 
 harry noticed that many of the people who passed them had the same harried anxious look as mrs weasley and that nobody was stopping to talk anymore the shoppers stayed together in their own tightly knit groups moving intently about their business nobody seemed to be shopping alone 
 
 migh be a bit of a squeeze in there with all o us said hagrid stopping outside madam and bending down to peer through the window stand guard outside all righ 
 
 so harry ron and hermione entered the little shop together it appeared at first glance to be empty but no sooner had the door swung shut behind them than they heard a familiar voice issuing from behind a rack of dress robes in spangled green and blue 
 
 not a child in case you noticed mother i am perfectly capable of doing my shopping alone 
 
 there was a clucking noise and a voice harry recognized as that of madam malkin the owner said now dear your quite right none of us is supposed to go wandering around on our own anymore nothing to do with being a child 
 
 watch where sticking that pin will you 
 
 a teenage boy with a pale pointed face and hair appeared from behind the rack wearing a handsome set of dark green robes that glittered with pins around the hem and the edges of the sleeves he strode to the mirror and examined himself it was a few moments before he noticed harry ron and hermione reflected over his shoulder his light gray eyes narrowed 
 
 if wondering what the smell is mother a mudblood just walked in said draco malfoy 
 
 i think any need for language like that said madam malkin scurrying out from behind the clothes rack holding a tape measure and a wand and i want wands drawn in my shop either she added hastily for a glance toward the door had shown her harry and ron both standing there with their wands out and pointing at malfoy 
 
 hermione who was standing slightly behind them whispered no honestly not worth it 
 
 yeah like dare do magic out of school sneered malfoy who blacked your eye granger i want to send them flowers 
 
 quite enough said madam malkin sharply looking over her shoulder for support madamplease 
 
 narcissa malfoy strolled out from behind the clothes rack 
 
 put those away she said coldly to harry and ron if you attack my son again i shall ensure that it is the last thing you ever do 
 
 really said harry taking a step forward and gazing into the smoothly arrogant face that for all its pallor still resembled her he was as tall as she was now going to get a few death eater pals to do us in are you 
 
 madam malkin squealed and clutched at her heart 
 
 really you accuse dangerous thing to say wands away please 
 
 but harry did not lower his wand narcissa malfoy smiled unpleasantly 
 
 i see that being favorite has given you a false sense of security harry potter but dumbledore always be there to protect you 
 
 harry looked mockingly all around the shop wow look at that not here now so why not have a go they might be able to find you a double cell in azkaban with your loser of a husband 
 
 malfoy made an angry movement toward harry but stumbled over his overlong robe ron laughed loudly 
 
 you dare talk to my mother like that potter malfoy snarled 
 
 all right draco said narcissa restraining him with her thin white fingers upon his shoulder i expect potter will be reunited with dear sirius before i am reunited with lucius 
 
 harry raised his wand higher 
 
 harry no moaned hermione grabbing his arm and attempting to push it down by his side think you be in such trouble 
 
 madam malkin dithered for a moment on the spot then seemed to decide to act as though nothing was happening in the hope that it she bent toward malfoy who was still glaring at harry 
 
 i think this left sleeve could come up a little bit more dear let me just 
 
 ouch bellowed malfoy slapping her hand away watch where putting your pins woman mother i think i want these anymore 
 
 he pulled the robes over his head and threw them onto the floor at madam feet 
 
 right draco said narcissa with a contemptuous glance at hermione now i know the kind of scum that shops here do better at twilfitt and 
 
 and with that the pair of them strode out of the shop malfoy taking care to bang as hard as he could into ron on the way out 
 
 well really said madam malkin snatching up the fallen robes and moving the tip of her wand over them like a vacuum cleaner so that it removed all the dust 
 
 she was distracted all through the fitting of and new robes tried to sell hermione dress robes instead of and when she finally bowed them out of the shop it was with an air of being glad to see the back of them 
 
 got asked hagrid brightly when they reappeared at his side 
 
 just about said harry did you see the malfoys 
 
 yeah said hagrid unconcerned but they wouldn dare make trouble in the middle o diagon alley harry don worry about them 
 
 harry ron and hermione exchanged looks but before they could disabuse hagrid of this comfortable notion mr and mrs weasley and ginny appeared all clutching heavy packages of books 
 
 everyone all right said mrs weasley got your robes right then we can pop in at the apothecary and eeylops on the way to fred and stick close now 
 
 neither harry nor ron bought any ingredients at the apothecary seeing that they were no longer studying potions but both bought large boxes of owl nuts for hedwig and pigwidgeon at eeylops owl emporium then with mrs weasley checking her watch every minute or so they headed farther along the street in search of weasleys wizard wheezes the joke shop run by fred and george 
 
 we really got too long mrs weasley said so just have a quick look around and then back to the car we must be close number 
 
 ron stopping in his tracks 
 
 set against the dull shop fronts around them fred and georges windows hit the eye like a firework display casual passersby were looking back over their shoulders at the windows and a few rather people had actually come to a halt transfixed the window was dazzlingly full of an assortment of goods that revolved popped flashed bounced and shrieked eyes began to water just looking at it the window was covered with a gigantic poster purple like those of the ministry but emblazoned with flashing yellow letters 
 
 why are you worrying about 
 you should be worrying about 
 
 the constipation sensation gripping the nation 
 harry started to laugh he heard a weak sort of moan beside him and looked around to see mrs weasley gazing dumbfounded at the poster her lips moved silently mouthing the name 
 
 be murdered in their beds she whispered 
 
 no they said ron who like harry was laughing this is brilliant 
 
 and he and harry led the way into the shop it was packed with customers harry could not get near the shelves he stared around looking up at the boxes piled to the ceiling here were the skiving snackboxes that the twins had perfected during their last unfinished year at hogwarts harry noticed that the nosebleed nougat was most popular with only one battered box left on the shelf there were bins full of trick wands the cheapest merely turning into rubber chickens or pairs of briefs when waved the most expensive beating the unwary user around the head and neck and boxes of quills which came in and varieties a space cleared in the crowd and harry pushed his way toward the counter where a gaggle of delighted was watching a tiny little wooden man slowly ascending the steps to a real set of gallows both perched on a box that read reusable hangmanspell it or swing 
 
 patented daydream charms 
 
 hermione had managed to squeeze through to a large display near the counter and was reading the information on the back of a box bearing a highly colored picture of a handsome youth and a swooning girl who were standing on the deck of a pirate ship 
 
 one simple incantation and you will enter a highly realistic daydream easy to fit into the average school lesson and virtually undetectable side effects include vacant expression and minor drooling not for sale to you know said hermione looking up at harry that really is extraordinary magic 
 
 for that hermione said a voice behind them you can have one for free 
 
 a beaming fred stood before them wearing a set of magenta robes that clashed magnificently with his flaming hair 
 
 how are you harry they shook hands and happened to your eye hermione 
 
 your punching telescope she said ruefully 
 
 oh blimey i forgot about those said fred here 
 
 he pulled a tub out of his pocket and handed it to her she unscrewed it gingerly to reveal a thick yellow paste 
 
 just dab it on that be gone within the hour said fred we had to find a decent testing most of our products on ourselves 
 
 hermione looked nervous it is safe it she asked 
 
 course it is said fred bracingly come on harry give you a tour 
 
 harry left hermione dabbing her black eye with paste and followed fred toward the back of the shop where he saw a stand of card and rope tricks 
 
 muggle magic tricks said fred happily pointing them out for freaks like dad you know who love muggle stuff not a big earner but we do fairly steady business great novelties oh george 
 
 twin shook hand energetically 
 
 giving him the tour come through the back harry where making the real money pocket anything you and pay in more than galleons he added warningly to a small boy who hastily whipped his hand out of the tub labeled edible dark make anyone sick 
 
 george pushed back a curtain beside the muggle tricks and harry saw a darker less crowded room the packaging on the products lining these shelves was more subdued 
 
 just developed this more serious line said fred funny how it happened 
 
 you believe how many people even people who work at the ministry do a decent shield charm said george course they have you teaching them harry 
 
 right well we thought shield hats were a bit of a laugh you know challenge your mate to jinx you while wearing it and watch his face when the jinx just bounces off but the ministry bought five hundred for all its support staff and still getting massive orders 
 
 so expanded into a range of shield cloaks shield gloves 
 
 i mean they help much against the unforgivable curses but for minor to moderate hexes or jinxes 
 
 and then we thought get into the whole area of defense against the dark arts because such a money spinner continued george enthusiastically this is cool look instant darkness powder importing it from peru handy if you want to make a quick escape 
 
 and our decoy detonators are just walking off the shelves look said fred pointing at a number of black objects that were indeed attempting to scurry out of sight you just drop one surreptitiously and run off and make a nice loud noise out of sight giving you a diversion if you need one 
 
 handy said harry impressed 
 
 here said george catching a couple and throwing them to harry 
 
 a young witch with short blonde hair poked her head around the curtain harry saw that she too was wearing magenta staff robes 
 
 a customer out here looking for a joke cauldron mr weasley and mr weasley she said 
 
 harry found it very odd to hear fred and george called mr weasley but they took it in their stride 
 
 right you are verity coming said george promptly harry you help yourself to anything you want all right no charge 
 
 i do that said harry who had already pulled out his money bag to pay for the decoy detonators 
 
 you pay here said fred firmly waving away gold 
 
 but 
 
 you gave us our loan we forgotten said george sternly take whatever you like and just remember to tell people where you got it if they ask 
 
 george swept off through the curtain to help with the customers and fred led harry back into the main part of the shop to find hermione and ginny still poring over the patented daydream charms 
 
 you girls found our special wonderwitch products yet asked fred follow me ladies 
 
 near the window was an array of violently pink products around which a cluster of excited girls was giggling enthusiastically hermione and ginny both hung back looking wary 
 
 there you go said fred proudly best range of love potions find anywhere 
 
 ginny raised an eyebrow skeptically do they work she asked 
 
 certainly they work for up to hours at a time depending on the weight of the boy in question 
 
 and the attractiveness of the girl said george reappearing suddenly at their side but not selling them to our sister he added becoming suddenly stern not when already got about five boys on the go from what 
 
 whatever heard from ron is a big fat lie said ginny calmly leaning forward to take a small pink pot off the shelf this 
 
 guaranteed pimple vanisher said fred excellent on everything from boils to blackheads but change the subject are you or are you not currently going out with a boy called dean thomas 
 
 yes i am said ginny and last time i looked he was definitely one boy not five what are those 
 
 she was pointing at a number of round balls of fluff in shades of pink and purple all rolling around the bottom of a cage and emitting squeaks 
 
 pygmy puffs said george miniature puffskeins we breed them fast enough so what about michael corner 
 
 i dumped him he was a bad loser said ginny putting a finger through the bars of the cage and watching the pygmy puffs crowd around it really cute 
 
 fairly cuddly yes conceded fred but moving through boyfriends a bit fast you 
 
 ginny turned to look at him her hands on her hips there was such a mrs glare on her face that harry was surprised fred recoil 
 
 none of your business and thank you she added angrily to ron who had just appeared at elbow laden with merchandise not to tell tales about me to these two 
 
 three galleons nine sickles and a knut said fred examining the many boxes in arms cough up 
 
 your brother 
 
 and our stuff nicking three galleons nine sickles knock off the knut 
 
 but i got three galleons nine sickles 
 
 better put it back then and mind you put it on the right shelves 
 
 ron dropped several boxes swore and made a rude hand gesture at fred that was unfortunately spotted by mrs weasley who had chosen that moment to appear 
 
 if i see you do that again jinx your fingers together she said sharply 
 
 mum can i have a pygmy puff said ginny at once 
 
 a what said mrs weasley warily 
 
 look so sweet 
 
 mrs weasley moved aside to look at the pygmy puffs and harry ron and hermione momentarily had an unimpeded view out of the window draco malfoy was hurrying up the street alone as he passed weasleys wizard wheezes he glanced over his shoulder seconds later he moved beyond the scope of the window and they lost sight of him 
 
 wonder where his mummy is said harry frowning 
 
 given her the slip by the looks of it said ron 
 
 why though said hermione 
 
 harry said nothing he was thinking too hard narcissa malfoy would not have let her precious son out of her sight willingly malfoy must have made a real effort to free himself from her clutches 
 
 harry knowing and loathing malfoy was sure the reason could not be innocent 
 
 he glanced around mrs weasley and ginny were bending over the pygmy puffs mr weasley was delightedly examining a pack of muggle marked playing cards fred and george were both helping customers on the other side of the glass hagrid was standing with his back to them looking up and down the street 
 
 get under here quick said harry pulling his invisibility cloak out of his bag 
 
 ohi know harry said hermione looking uncertainly toward mrs weasley 
 
 come on said ron 
 
 she hesitated for a second longer then ducked under the cloak with harry and ron nobody noticed them vanish they were all too interested in fred and products harry ron and hermione squeezed their way out of the door as quickly as they could but by the time they gained the street malfoy had disappeared just as successfully as they had 
 
 he was going in that direction murmured harry as quietly as possible so that the humming hagrid would not hear them 
 
 they scurried along peering left and right through shop windows and doors until hermione pointed ahead 
 
 him it she whispered turning left 
 
 big surprise whispered ron 
 
 for malfoy had glanced around then slid into knockturn alley and out of sight 
 
 quick or lose him said harry speeding up 
 
 our be seen said hermione anxiously as the cloak flapped a little around their ankles it was much more difficult hiding all three of them under the cloak nowadays 
 
 it matter said harry impatiently just hurry 
 
 but knockturn alley the side street devoted to the dark arts looked completely deserted they peered into windows as they passed but none of the shops seemed to have any customers at all harry supposed it was a bit of a giveaway in these dangerous and suspicious times to buy dark artifacts or at least to be seen buying them 
 
 hermione gave his arm a hard pinch 
 
 ouch 
 
 shh look in there she breathed in ear 
 
 they had drawn level with the only shop in knockturn alley that harry had ever visited borgin and burkes which sold a wide variety of sinister objects there in the midst of the cases full of skulls and old bottles stood draco malfoy with his back to them just visible beyond the very same large black cabinet in which harry had once hidden to avoid malfoy and his father judging by the movements of hands he was talking animatedly the proprietor of the shop mr borgin an stooping man stood facing malfoy he was wearing a curious expression of mingled resentment and fear 
 
 if only we could hear what saying said hermione 
 
 we can said ron excitedly hang ondamn 
 
 he dropped a couple more of the boxes he was still clutching as he fumbled with the largest 
 
 extendable ears look 
 
 fantastic said hermione as ron unraveled the long strings and began to feed them toward the bottom of the door oh i hope the door imperturbable 
 
 no said ron gleefully listen 
 
 they put their heads together and listened intently to the ends of the strings through which voice could be heard loud and clear as though a radio had been turned on 
 
 you know how to fix it 
 
 possibly said borgin in a tone that suggested he was unwilling to commit himself need to see it though why you bring it into the shop 
 
 i said malfoy got to stay put i just need you to tell me how to do it 
 
 harry saw borgin lick his lips nervously 
 
 well without seeing it i must say it will be a very difficult job perhaps impossible i guarantee anything 
 
 no said malfoy and harry knew just by his tone that malfoy was sneering perhaps this will make you more confident 
 
 he moved toward borgin and was blocked from view by the cabinet harry ron and hermione shuffled sideways to try and keep him in sight but all they could see was borgin looking very frightened 
 
 tell anyone said maifoy and there will be retribution you know fenrir greyback a family friend be dropping in from time to time to make sure giving the problem your full attention 
 
 there will be no need for 
 
 decide that said malfoy well better be off and forget to keep that one safe need it 
 
 perhaps like to take it now 
 
 no of course i you stupid little man how would i look carrying that down the street just sell it 
 
 of course not sir 
 
 borgin made a bow as deep as the one harry had once seen him give lucius malfoy 
 
 not a word to anyone borgin and that includes my mother understand 
 
 naturally naturally murmured borgin bowing again 
 
 next moment the bell over the door tinkled loudly as malfoy stalked out of the shop looking very pleased with himself he passed so close to harry ron and hermione that they felt the cloak flutter around their knees again inside the shop borgin remained frozen his unctuous smile had vanished he looked worried 
 
 what was that about whispered ron reeling in the extendable ears 
 
 dunno said harry thinking hard he wants something mended and he wants to reserve something in there could you see what he pointed at when he said that one 
 
 no he was behind that cabinet 
 
 you two stay here whispered hermione 
 
 what are you 
 
 but hermione had already ducked out from under the cloak she checked her hair in the reflection in the glass then marched into the shop setting the bell tinkling again ron hastily fed the extendable ears back under the door and passed one of the strings to harry 
 
 hello horrible morning it hermione said brightly to borgin who did not answer but cast her a suspicious look humming cheerily hermione strolled through the jumble of objects on display 
 
 is this necklace for sale she asked pausing beside a case 
 
 if got one and a half thousand galleons said mr borgin coldly 
 
 oherno i got quite that much said hermione walking on and what about this lovelyumskull 
 
 sixteen galleons 
 
 so for sale then it being kept for anyone 
 
 mr borgin squinted at her harry had the nasty feeling he knew exactly what hermione was up to apparently hermione felt she had been rumbled too because she suddenly threw caution to the winds 
 
 the thing is thaterboy who was in here just now draco malfoy well a friend of mine and i want to get him a birthday present but if already reserved anything i obviously want to get him the same thing so um 
 
 it was a pretty lame story in opinion and apparently borgin thought so too 
 
 out he said sharply get out 
 
 hermione did not wait to be asked twice but hurried to the door with borgin at her heels as the bell tinkled again borgin slammed the door behind her and put up the closed sign 
 
 ah well said ron throwing the cloak back over hermione worth a try but you were a bit obvious 
 
 well next time you can show me how done master of mystery she snapped 
 
 ron and hermione bickered all the way back to weasleys wizard wheezes where they were forced to stop so that they could dodge undetected around a very mrs weasley and hagrid who had clearly noticed their absence once in the shop harry whipped off the invisibility cloak hid it in his bag and joined in with the other two when they insisted in answer to mrs weasleys accusations that they had been in the back room all along and that she could not have looked properly

lionfish nov chapter six the ghoul in pajamascontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 the shock of losing hung over the house in the days that followed harry kept expecting to see him stumping in through the back door like the other order members who passed in and out to relay news harry felt that nothing but action would assuage his feelings of guilt and grief and that he ought to set out on his mission to find and destroy horcruxes as soon as possible 
 
 well you cant do anything about the c ron mouthed the word horcruxes c till youre seventeen youve still got the trace on you and we can plan here as well as anywhere cant we or he dropped his voice to a whisper dyou reckon you already know where the are 
 
 no harry admitted 
 
 i think hermiones been doing a bit of research said ron she said she was saving it for when you got here 
 
 they were sitting at the breakfast table mr weasley and bill had just left for work mrs weasley had gone upstairs to wake hermione and ginny while fleur had drifted off to take a bath 
 
 the tracell break on the said harry that means i only need to stay here four days then i can c 
 
 five days ron corrected him firmly weve got to stay for the wedding theyll kill us if we miss it 
 
 harry understood they to mean fleur and mrs weasley 
 
 its one extra day said ron when harry looked mutinous 
 
 dont they realize how important c 
 
 course they dont said ron they havent got a clue and now you mention it i wanted to talk to you about that 
 
 ron glanced toward the door into the hall to check that mrs weasley was not returning yet then leaned in closer to harry 
 
 mums been trying to get it out of hermione and me what were off to do shell try you next so brace yourself dad and lupinve both asked as well but when we said dumbledore told you not to tell anyone except us they dropped it not mum though shes determined 
 
 rons prediction came true within hours shortly before lunch mrs weasley detached harry from the others by asking him to help identify a lone mans sock that she thought might have come out of his rucksack once she had him cornered in the tiny scullery off the kitchen she started 
 
 ron and hermione seem to think that the three of you are dropping out of hogwarts she began in a light casual tone 
 
 oh said harry well yeah we are 
 
 the mangle turned of its own accord in a corner wringing out what looked like one of mr weasleys vests 
 
 may i ask why you are abandoning your education said mrs weasley 
 
 well dumbledore left me stuff to do mumbled harry ron and hermione know about it and they want to come too 
 
 what sort of stuff 
 
 im sorry i cant c 
 
 well frankly i think arthur and i have a right to know and im sure mr and mrs granger would agree said mrs weasley harry had been afraid of the concerned parent attack he forced himself to look directly into her eyes noticing as he did so that they were precisely the same shade of brown as ginnys this did not help 
 
 dumbledore didnt want anyone else to know mrs weasley im sorry ron and hermione dont have to come its their choice c 
 
 i dont see that you have to go either she snapped dropping all pretense now youre barely of age any of you its utter nonsense if dumbledore needed work doing he had the whole order at his command harry you must have misunderstood him probably he was telling you something he wanted done and you took it to mean that he wanted youc 
 
 i didnt misunderstand said harry flatly its got to be me 
 
 he handed her back the single sock he was supposed to be identifying which was patterned with golden bulrushes 
 
 and thats not mine i dont support puddlemere united 
 
 oh of course not said mrs weasley with a sudden and rather unnerving return to her casual tone i should have realized well harry while weve still got you here you wont mind helping with the preparations for bill and fleurs wedding will you theres still so much to do 
 
 no c i c of course not said harry disconcerted by this sudden change of subject 
 
 sweet of you she replied and she smiled as she left the scullery 
 
 from that moment on mrs weasley kept harry ron and hermione so busy with preparations for the wedding that they hardly had any time to think the kindest explanation of this behavior would have been that mrs weasley wanted to distract them all from thoughts of and the terrors of their recent journey after two days of nonstop cutlery cleaning of favors ribbons and flowers of the garden and helping mrs weasley cook vast batches of canaps however harry started to suspect her of a different motive all the jobs she handed out seemed to keep him ron and hermione away from one another he had not had a chance to speak to the two of them alone since the first night when he had told them about voldemort torturing ollivander 
 
 i think mum thinks that if she can stop the three of you getting together and planning shell be able to delay you leaving ginny told harry in an undertone as they laid the table for dinner on the third night of his stay 
 
 and then what does she thinks going to happen harry muttered someone else might kill off voldemort while shes holding us here making 
 
 he had spoken without thinking and saw ginnys face whiten 
 
 so its true she said thats what youre trying to do 
 
 i c not c i was joking said harry evasively 
 
 they stared at each other and there was something more than shock in ginnys expression suddenly harry became aware that this was the first time that he had been alone with her since those stolen hours in secluded corners of the hogwarts grounds he was sure she was remembering them too both of them jumped as the door opened and mr weasley kingsley and bill walked in 
 
 they were often joined by other order members for dinner now because the burrow had replaced number twelve grimmauld place as the headquarters mr weasley had explained that after the death of dumbledore their each of the people to whom dumbledore had confided grimmauld places location had become a in turn 
 
 and as there are around twenty of us that greatly dilutes the power of the fidelius charm twenty times as many opportunities for the death eaters to get the secret out of somebody we cant expect it to hold much longer 
 
 but surely snape will have told the death eaters the address by now asked harry 
 
 well set up a couple of curses against snape in case he turns up there again we hope theyll be strong enough both to keep him out and to bind his tongue if he tries to talk about the place but we cant be sure it would have been insane to keep using the place as headquarters now that its protection has become so shaky 
 
 the kitchen was so crowded that evening it was difficult to maneuver knives and forks harry found himself crammed beside ginny the unsaid things that had just passed between them made him wish they had been separated by a few more people he was trying so hard to avoid brushing her arm he could barely cut his chicken 
 
 no news about harry asked bill 
 
 nothing replied bill 
 
 they had not been able to hold a funeral for moody because bill and lupin had failed to recover his body it had been difficult to know where he might have fallen given the darkness and the confusion of the battle 
 
 the daily prophet hasnt said a word about him dying or about finding the body bill went on but that doesnt mean much its keeping a lot quiet these days 
 
 and they still havent called a hearing about all the underage magic i used escaping the death eaters harry called across the table to mr weasley who shook his head 
 
 because they know i had no choice or because they dont want me to tell the world voldemort attacked me 
 
 the latter i think scrimgeour doesnt want to admit that is as powerful as he is nor that azkabans seen a mass breakout 
 
 yeah why tell the public the truth said harry clenching his knife so tightly that the faint scars on the back of his right hand stood out white against his skin i must not tell lies 
 
 isnt anyone at the ministry prepared to stand up to him asked ron angrily 
 
 of course ron but people are terrified mr weasley replied terrified that they will be next to disappear their children the next to be attacked there are nasty rumors going around i for one dont believe the muggle studies professor at hogwarts resigned she hasnt been seen for weeks now meanwhile scrimgeour remains shut up in his office all day i just hope hes working on a plan 
 
 there was a pause in which mrs weasley magicked the empty plates onto the work surface and served apple tart 
 
 we must decide ow you will be disguised arry said fleur once everyone had pudding for ze wedding she added when he looked confused of course none of our guests are death eaters but we cannot guarantee zat zey will not let something slip after zey ave ad champagne 
 
 from this harry gathered that she still suspected hagrid 
 
 yes good point said mrs weasley from the top of the table where she sat spectacles perched on the end of her nose scanning an immense list of jobs that she had scribbled on a very long piece of parchment now ron have you cleaned out your room yet 
 
 why exclaimed ron slamming his spoon down and glaring at his mother why does my room have to be cleaned out harry and i are fine with it the way it is 
 
 we are holding your brothers wedding here in a few days time young man c 
 
 and are they getting married in my bedroom asked ron furiously no so why in the name of merlins saggy left c 
 
 dont talk to your mother like that said mr weasley firmly and do as youre told 
 
 ron scowled at both his parents then picked up his spoon and attacked the last few mouthfuls of his apple tart 
 
 i can help some of its my mess harry told ron but mrs weasley cut across him 
 
 no harry dear id much rather you helped arthur much out the chickens and hermione id be ever so grateful if youd change the sheets for monsieur and madame delacour you know theyre arriving at eleven tomorrow morning 
 
 but as it turned out there was very little to do for the chickens theres no need to er mention it to molly mr weasley told harry blocking his access to the coop but er ted tonks sent me most of what was left of siriuss bike and er im hiding c thats to say keeping c it in here fantastic stuff theres an exhaust gaskin as i believe its called the most magnificent battery and itll be a great opportunity to find out how brakes work im going to try and put it all back together again when mollys not c i mean when ive got time 
 
 when they returned to the house mrs weasley was nowhere to be seen so harry slipped upstairs to rons attic bedroom 
 
 im doing it im doing c oh its you said ron in relief as harry entered the room ron lay back down on the bed which he had evidently just vacated the room was just as messy as it had been all week the only chance was that hermione was now sitting in the far corner her fluffy ginger cat crookshanks at her feet sorting books some of which harry recognized as his own into two enormous piles 
 
 hi harry she said as he sat down on his camp bed 
 
 and how did you manage to get away 
 
 oh rons mum forgot that she asked ginny and me to change the sheets yesterday said hermione she threw numerology and grammatica onto one pile and the rise and fall of the dark arts onto the other 
 
 we were just talking about ron told harry i reckon he might have survived 
 
 but bill saw him hit by the killing curse said harry 
 
 yeah but bill was under attack too said ron how can he be sure what he saw 
 
 even if the killing curse missed still fell about a thousand feet said hermione now weight quidditch teams of britain and ireland in her hand 
 
 he could have used a shield charm c 
 
 fleur said his wand was blasted out of his hand said harry 
 
 well all right if you want him to be dead said ron grumpily punching his pillow into a more comfortable shape 
 
 of course we dont want him to be dead said hermione looking shocked its dreadful that hes dead but were being realistic 
 
 for the first time harry imagined body broken as dumbledores had been yet with that one eye still whizzing in its socket he felt a stab of revulsion mixed with a bizarre desire to laugh 
 
 the death eaters probably tidied up after themselves thats why no ones found him said ron wisely 
 
 yeah said harry like barty crouch turned into a bone and buried in hagrids front garden they probably transfigured moody and stuffed him c 
 
 dont squealed hermione startled harry looked over just in time to see her burst into tears over her copy of spellmans syllabary 
 
 oh no said harry struggling to get up from the old camp bed hermione i wasnt trying to upset c 
 
 but with a great creaking of rusty bedsprings ron bounded off the bed and got there first one arm around hermione he fished in his jeans pocket and withdrew a handkerchief that he had used to clean out the oven earlier hastily pulling out his wand he pointed it at the rag and said tergeo 
 
 the wand siphoned off most of the grease looking rather pleased with himself ron handed the slightly smoking handkerchief to hermione 
 
 oh thanks ron im sorry she blew her nose and hiccupped its just so isnt it after dumbledore i imagined dying somehow he seemed so tough 
 
 yeah i know said ron giving her a squeeze but you know what hed say to us if he was here 
 
 vigilance said hermione mopping her eyes 
 
 thats right said ron nodding hed tell us to learn from what happened to him and what ive learned is not to trust that cowardly little squit mundungus 
 
 hermione gave a shaky laugh and leaned forward to pick up two more books a second later ron had snatched his arm back from around her shoulders she had dropped the monster of monsters on his foot the book had broken free from its restraining belt and snapped viciously at rons ankle 
 
 im sorry im sorry hermione cried as harry wrenched the book from rons leg and retied it shit 
 
 what are you doing with all those books anyway ron asked limping back to his bed 
 
 just trying to decide which ones to take with us said hermione when were looking for the horcruxes 
 
 oh of course said ron clapping a hand to his forehead i forgot well be hunting down voldemort in a mobile library 
 
 ha ha said hermione looking down at spellmans syllabary i wonder will we need to translate runes its possible i think wed better take it to be safe 
 
 she dropped the syllabary onto the larger of the two piles and picked up hogwarts a history 
 
 listen said harry 
 
 he had sat up straight ron and hermione looked at him with similar mixtures of resignation and defiance 
 
 i know you said after dumbledores funeral that you wanted to come with me harry began 
 
 here he goes ron said to hermione rolling his eyes 
 
 as we knew he would he sighed turning back to the books you know i think i will take hogwarts a history even if were not going back there i dont think id feel right if i didnt have it with c 
 
 listen said harry again 
 
 no harry you listen said hermione were coming with you that was decided months ago c years really 
 
 but c 
 
 shut up ron advised him 
 
 c are you sure youve thought this through harry persisted 
 
 lets see said hermione slamming travels with trolls onto the discarded pile with a rather fierce look ive been packing for days so were ready to leave at a moments notice which for your information has included doing some pretty difficult magic not to mention smuggling whole stock of polyjuice potion right under rons mums nose 
 
 ive also modified my parents memories so that theyre convinced theyre really called wendell and monica wilkins and that their lifes ambition is to move to australia which they have now done thats to make it more difficult for voldemort to track them down and interrogate them about me c or you because unfortunately ive told them quite a bit about you 
 
 assuming i survive our hunt for the horcruxes ill find mum and dad and lift the enchantment if i dont c well i think ive cast a good enough charm to keep them safe and happy wendell and monica wilkins dont know that theyve got a daughter you see 
 
 hermiones eyes were swimming with tears again ron got back off the bed put his arm around her once more and frowned at harry as though reproaching him for lack of tact harry could not think of anything to say not least because it was highly unusual for ron to be teaching anyone else tact 
 
 i c hermione im sorry c i didnt c 
 
 didnt realize that ron and i know perfectly well what might happen if we come with you well we do ron show harry what youve done 
 
 nah hes just eaten said ron 
 
 go on he needs to know 
 
 oh all right harry come here 
 
 for the second time ron withdrew his arm from around hermione and stumped over to the door 
 
 cmon 
 
 why harry asked following ron out of the room onto the tiny landing 
 
 descendo muttered ron pointing his wand at the low ceiling a hatch opened right over their heads and a ladder slid down to their feet a horrible sound came out of the square hole along with an unpleasant smell like open drains 
 
 thats your ghoul isnt it asked harry who had never actually met the creature that sometimes disrupted the nightly silence 
 
 yeah it is said ron climbing the ladder come and have a look at him 
 
 harry followed ron up the few short steps into the tiny attic space his head and shoulders were in the room before he caught sight of the creature curled up a few feet from him fast asleep in the gloom with its large mouth wide open 
 
 but it it looks do ghouls normally wear pajamas 
 
 no said ron nor have they usually got red hair or that number of pustules 
 
 harry contemplated the thing slightly revolted it was human in shape and size and was wearing what now that harrys eyes became used to the darkness was clearly an old pair of rons pajamas he was also sure that ghouls were generally rather slimy and bald rather than distinctly hairy and covered in angry purple blisters 
 
 hes me see said ron 
 
 no said harry i dont 
 
 ill explain it back in my room the smells getting to me said ron they climbed back down the ladder which ron returned to the ceiling and rejoined hermione who was still sorting books 
 
 once weve left the ghouls going to come and live down here in my room said ron i think hes really looking forward to it c well its hard to tell because all he can do is moan and drool c but he nods a lot when you mention it anyway hes going to be me with spattergroit good eh 
 
 harry merely looked his confusion 
 
 it is said ron clearly frustrated that harry had not grasped the brilliance of the plan look when we three dont turn up at hogwarts again everyones going to think hermione and i must be with you right which means the death eaters will go straight for our families to see if theyve got information on where you are 
 
 but hopefully itll look like ive gone away with mum and dad a lot of are talking about going into hiding at the moment said hermione 
 
 we cant hide my whole family itll look too fishy and they cant all leave their jobs said ron so were going to put out the story that im seriously ill with spattergroit which is why i cant go back to school if anyone comes calling to investigate mum or dad can show them the ghoul in my bed covered in pustules spattergroits really contagious so theyre not going to want to go near him it wont matter that he cant say anything either because apparently you cant once the fungus has spread to your uvula 
 
 and your mum and dad are in on this plan asked harry 
 
 dad is he helped fred and george transform the ghoul mum well youve seen what shes like she wont accept were going till were gone 
 
 there was silence in the room broken only by gentle thuds as hermione continued to throw books onto one pile or the other ron sat watching her and harry looked from one to the other unable to say anything the measure they had taken to protect their families made him realize more than anything else could have done that they really were going to come with him and that they knew exactly how dangerous that would be he wanted to tell them what that meant to him but he simply could not find words important enough 
 
 through the silence came the muffled sounds of mrs weasley shouting from four floors below 
 
 ginnys probably left a speck of dust on a poxy napkin ring said ron i dunno why the delacours have got to come two days before the wedding 
 
 fleurs sisters a bridesmaid she needs to be here for the rehearsal and shes too young to come on her own said hermione as she pored indecisively over break with a banshee 
 
 well guests arent going to help mums stress levels said ron 
 
 what we really need to decide said hermione tossing defensive magical theory into the bin without a second glance and picking up an appraisal of magical education in europe is where were going after we leave here i know you said you wanted to go to godrics hollow first harry and i understand why but well shouldnt we make the horcruxes our priority 
 
 if we knew where any of the horcruxes were id agree with you said harry who did not believe that hermione really understood his desire to return to godrics hollow his parents graves were only part of the attraction he had a strong though inexplicable feeling that the place held answers for him perhaps it was simply because it was there that he had survived voldemorts killing curse now that he was facing the challenge of repeating the feat harry was drawn to the place where it had happened wanting to understand 
 
 dont you think theres a possibility that voldemorts keeping a watch on godrics hollow hermione asked he might expect you to go back and visit your parents graves once youre free to go wherever you like 
 
 this had not occurred to harry while he struggled to find a counterargument ron spoke up evidently following his own train of thought 
 
 this person he said you know the one who stole the real locket 
 
 hermione nodded 
 
 he said in his note he was going to destroy it didnt he 
 
 harry dragged his rucksack toward him and pulled out the fake horcrux in which note was still folded 
 
 i have stolen the real horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as i can harry read out 
 
 well what if he did finish it off said ron 
 
 or she interposed hermione 
 
 whichever said ron itd be one less for us to do 
 
 yes but were still going to have to try and trace the real locket arent we said hermione to find out whether or not its destroyed 
 
 and once we get hold of it how do you destroy a horcrux asked ron 
 
 well said hermione ive been researching that 
 
 how asked harry i didnt think there were any books on horcruxes in the library 
 
 there werent said hermione who had turned pink dumbledore removed them all but he c he didnt destroy them 
 
 ron sat up straight 
 
 how in the name of merlins pants have you managed to get your hands on those horcrux books 
 
 it c it wasnt stealing said hermione looking from harry to ron with a kind of desperation they were still library books even if dumbledore had taken them off the shelves anyway if he really didnt want anyone to get at them im sure he would have made it much harder to c 
 
 get to the point said ron 
 
 well it was easy said hermione in a small voice i just did a summoning charm you know c accio and c they zoomed out of dumbledores study window right into the girls dormitory 
 
 but when did you do this harry asked regarding hermione with a mixture of admiration and incredulity 
 
 just after his c dumbledores c funeral said hermione in an even smaller voice right after we agreed wed leave school and go and look for the horcruxes when i went back upstairs to get my things it c it just occurred to me that the more we knew about them the better it would be and i was alone in there so i tried and it worked they flew straight in through the open window and i c i packed them 
 
 she swallowed and then said imploringly i cant believe dumbledore would have been angry its not as though were going to use the information to make a horcrux is it 
 
 can you hear us complaining said ron where are these books anyway 
 
 hermione rummaged for a moment and then extracted from the pile a large volume bound in faded black leather she looked a little nauseated and held it as gingerly as if it were something recently dead 
 
 this is the one that gives explicit instructions on how to make a horcrux secrets of the darkest art c its a horrible book really awful full of evil magic i wonder when dumbledore removed it from the library if he didnt do it until he was headmaster i bet voldemort got all the instruction he needed from here 
 
 why did he have to ask slughorn how to make a horcrux then if hed already read that asked ron 
 
 he only approached slughorn to find out what would happen if you split your soul into seven said harry dumbledore was sure riddle already knew how to make a horcrux by the time he asked slughorn about them i think youre right hermione that could easily have been where he got the information 
 
 and the more ive read about them said hermione the more horrible they seem and the less i can believe that he actually made six it warns in this book how unstable you make the rest of your soul by ripping it and thats just by making one horcrux 
 
 harry remembered what dumbledore had said about voldemort moving beyond usual evil 
 
 isnt there any way of putting yourself back together ron asked 
 
 yes said hermione with a hollow smile but it would be excruciatingly painful 
 
 why how do you do it asked harry 
 
 remorse said hermione youve got to really feel what youve done theres a footnote apparently the pain of it can destroy you i cant see voldemort attempting it somehow can you 
 
 no said ron before harry could answer so does it say how to destroy horcruxes in that book 
 
 yes said hermione now turning the fragile pages as if examining rotting entrails because it warns dark wizards how strong they have to make the enchantments on them from all that ive read what harry did to riddles diary was one of the few really foolproof ways of destroying a horcrux 
 
 what stabbing it with a basilisk fang asked harry 
 
 oh well lucky weve got such a large supply of basilisk fangs then said ron i was wondering what we were going to do with them 
 
 it doesnt have to be a basilisk fang said hermione patiently it has to be something so destructive that the horcrux cant repair itself basilisk venom only has one antidote and its incredibly rare c 
 
 c phoenix tears said harry nodding 
 
 exactly said hermione our problem is that there are very few substances as destructive as basilisk venom and theyre all dangerous to carry around with you thats a problem were going to have to solve though because ripping smashing or crushing a horcrux wont do the trick youve got to put it beyond magical repair 
 
 but even if we wreck the thing it lives in said ron why cant the bit of soul in it just go and live in something else 
 
 because a horcrux is the complete opposite of a human being 
 
 seeing that harry and ron looked thoroughly confused hermione hurried on look if i picked up a sword right now ron and ran you through with it i wouldnt damage your soul at all 
 
 which would be a real comfort to me im sure said ron harry laughed 
 
 it should be actually but my point is that whatever happens to your body your soul will survive untouched said hermione but its the other way round with a horcrux the fragment of soul inside it depends on its container its enchanted body for survival it cant exist without it 
 
 that diary sort of died when i stabbed it said harry remembering ink pouring like blood from the punctured pages and the screams of the piece of voldemorts soul as it vanished 
 
 and once the diary was properly destroyed the bit of soul trapped in it could no longer exist ginny tried to get rid of the diary before you did flushing it away but obviously it came back good as new 
 
 hang on said ron frowning the bit of soul in that diary was possessing ginny wasnt it how does that work then 
 
 while the magical container is still intact the bit of soul inside it can flit in and out of someone if they get too close to the object i dont mean holding it for too long its nothing to do with touching it she added before ron could speak i mean close emotionally ginny poured her heart out into that diary she made herself incredibly vulnerable youre in trouble if you get too fond of or dependent on the horcrux 
 
 i wonder how dumbledore destroyed the ring said harry why didnt i ask him i never really 
 
 his voice trailed away he was thinking of all the things he should have asked dumbledore and of how since the headmaster had died it seemed to harry that he had wasted so many opportunities when dumbledore had been alive to find out more to find out everything 
 
 the silence was shattered as the bedroom door flew open with a crash hermione shrieked and dropped secrets of the darkest art crookshanks streaked under the bed hissing indignantly ron jumped off the bed skidded on a discarded chocolate frog wrapper and smacked his head on the opposite wall and harry instinctively dived for his wand before realizing that he was looking up at mrs weasley whose hair was disheveled and whose face was contorted with rage 
 
 im so sorry to break up this cozy little gathering she said her voice trembling im sure you all need your rest but there are wedding presents stacked in my room that need sorting out and i was under the impression that you had agreed to help 
 
 oh yes said hermione looking terrified as she leapt to her feet sending books flying in every direction we will were sorry 
 
 with an anguished look at harry and ron hermione hurried out of the room after mrs weasley 
 
 its like being a complained ron in an undertone still massaging his head as he and harry followed except without the job satisfaction the sooner this weddings over the happier ill be 
 
 yeah said harry then well have nothing to do except find horcruxes itll be like a holiday wont it 
 
 ron started to laugh but at the sight of the enormous pile of wedding presents waiting for them in mrs weasleys room stopped quite abruptly 
 
 the delacours arrived the following morning at eleven o clock harry ron hermione and ginny were feeling quite resentful toward fleurs family by this time and it was with ill grace that ron stumped back upstairs to put on matching socks and harry attempted to flatten his hair once they had all been deemed smart enough they trooped out into the sunny backyard to await the visitors 
 
 harry had never seen the place looking so tidy the rusty cauldrons and old wellington boots that usually littered the steps by the back door were gone replaced by two new flutterby bushes standing either side of the door in large pots though there was no breeze the leaves waved lazily giving an attractive rippling effect the chickens had been shut away the yard had been swept and the nearby garden had been pruned plucked and generally spruced up although harry who liked it in its overgrown state thought that it looked rather forlorn without its usual contingent of capering gnomes 
 
 he had lost track of how many security enchantments had been placed upon the burrow by both the order and the ministry all he knew was that it was no longer possible for anybody to travel by magic directly into the place mr weasley had therefore gone to meet the delacours on top of a nearby hill where they were to arrive by portkey the first sound of their approach was an unusually laugh which turned out to be coming from mr weasley who appeared at the gate moments later laden with luggage and leading a beautiful blonde woman in long leaf green robes who could be fleurs mother 
 
 maman cried fleur rushing forward to embrace her papa 
 
 monsieur delacour was nowhere near as attractive as his wife he was a head shorter and extremely plumb with a little pointed black beard however he looked bouncing towards mrs weasley on boots he kissed her twice on each cheek leaving her flustered 
 
 you ave been so much trouble he said in a deep voice fleur tells us you ave been working very ard 
 
 oh its been nothing nothing trilled mrs weasley no trouble at all 
 
 ron relieved his feelings by aiming a kick at a gnome who was peering out from behind one of the new flutterby bushes 
 
 dear lady said monsieur delacour still holding mrs weasleys hand between his own two plump ones and beaming we are most honored at the approaching union of our two families let me present my wife apolline 
 
 madame delacour glided forward and stooped to kiss mrs weasley too 
 
 enchante she said your usband as been telling us such amusing stories 
 
 mr weasley gave a maniacal laugh mrs weasley threw him a look upon which he became immediately silent and assumed an expression appropriate to the sickbed of a close friend 
 
 and of course you ave met my leetle daughter gabrielle said monsieur delacour gabrielle was fleur in miniature eleven years old with hair of pure silvery blonde she gave mrs weasley a dazzling smile and hugged her then threw harry a glowing look batting her eyelashes ginny cleared her throat loudly 
 
 well come in do said mrs weasley brightly and she ushered the delacours into the house with many no and after and not at 
 
 the delacours it soon transpired were helpful pleasant guests they were pleased with everything and keen to assist with the preparations for the wedding monsieur delacour pronounced everything from the seating plan to the bridesmaids shoes charmant madame delacour was most accomplished at household spells and had the oven properly cleaned in a trice gabrielle followed her elder sister around trying to assist in any way she could and jabbering away in rapid french 
 
 on the downside the burrow was not built to accommodate so many people mr and mrs weasley were now sleeping in the sitting room having shouted down monsieur and madame delacours protests and insisted they take their bedroom gabrielle was sleeping with fleur in percys old room and bill would be sharing with charlie his best man once charlie arrived from romania opportunities to make plans together became virtually nonexistent and it was in desperation that harry ron and hermione took to volunteering to feed the chickens just to escape the overcrowded house 
 
 but she still wont leave us alone snarled ron and their second attempt at a meeting in the yard was foiled by the appearance of mrs weasley carrying a large basket of laundry in her arms 
 
 oh good youve fed the chickens she called as she approached them wed better shut them away again before the men arrive tomorrow to put up the tent for the wedding she explained pausing to lean against the henhouse she looked exhausted millamants magic marquees theyre very good bills escorting them youd better stay inside while theyre here harry i must say it does complicate organizing a wedding having all these security spells around the place 
 
 im sorry said harry humbly 
 
 oh dont be silly dear said mrs weasley at once i didnt mean c well your safetys much more important actually ive been wanting to ask you how you want to celebrate your birthday harry seventeen after all its an important day 
 
 i dont want a fuss said harry quickly envisaging the additional strain this would put on them all really mrs weasley just a normal dinner would be fine its the day before the wedding 
 
 oh well if youre sure dear ill invite remus and tonks shall i and how about hagrid 
 
 thatd be great said harry but please dont go to loads of trouble 
 
 not at all not at all its no trouble 
 
 she looked at him a long searching look then smiled a little sadly straightened up and walked away harry watched as she waved her wand near the washing line and the damp clothes rose into the air to hang themselves up and suddenly he felt a great wave of remorse for the inconvenience and the pain he was giving her

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 a story 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 in the garden all the were in blossom they had 
 hastened to bring forth flowers before they got green leaves and in 
 the yard all the ducklings walked up and down and the cat too it 
 basked in the sun and licked the sunshine from its own paws and 
 when one looked at the fields how beautifully the corn stood and 
 how green it shone without comparison and there was a twittering and a fluttering of all the little birds as if the day were a great 
 festival and so it was for it was sunday all the bells were 
 ringing and all the people went to church looking cheerful and 
 dressed in their best clothes there was a look of cheerfulness on 
 everything the day was so warm and beautiful that one might well have said kindness to us men is beyond all limits but inside 
 the church the pastor stood in the pulpit and spoke very loudly and 
 angrily he said that all men were wicked and god would punish them for their sins and that the wicked when they died would be cast into hell to burn for ever and ever he spoke very excitedly 
 saying that their evil propensities would not be destroyed nor 
 would the fire be extinguished and they should never find rest 
 
 that was terrible to hear and he said it in such a tone of 
 conviction he described hell to them as a miserable hole where all 
 the refuse of the world gathers there was no air beside the hot 
 burning sulphur flame and there was no ground under their feet they 
 the wicked ones sank deeper and deeper while eternal silence 
 surrounded them it was dreadful to hear all that for the preacher 
 spoke from his heart and all the people in the church were terrified 
 meanwhile the birds sang merrily outside and the sun was shining 
 so beautifully warm it seemed as though every little flower said 
 god thy kindness towards us all is without limits indeed 
 outside it was not at all like the sermon 
 
 the same evening upon going to bed the pastor noticed his wife 
 sitting there quiet and pensive 
 
 what is the matter with you he asked her 
 well the matter with me is she said that i cannot collect my 
 thoughts and am unable to grasp the meaning of what you said in church that there are so many wicked people and that they 
 should burn eternally alas eternally how long i am only a woman 
 and a sinner before god but i should not have the heart to let even 
 the worst sinner burn for ever and how could our lord to do so who is so infinitely good and who knows how the wickedness comes from without and within no i am unable to imagine that although you say so 
 it was autumn the trees dropped their leaves the earnest and 
 severe pastor sat at the bedside of a dying person a pious 
 faithful soul closed her eyes for ever she was the wife 
 if any one shall find rest in the grave and mercy before our 
 lord you shall certainly do so said the pastor he folded her 
 hands and read a psalm over the dead woman 
 
 she was buried two large tears rolled over the cheeks of the 
 earnest man and in the parsonage it was empty and still for its 
 sun had set for ever she had gone home 
 
 it was night a cold wind swept over the head he 
 opened his eyes and it seemed to him as if the moon was shining 
 into his room it was not so however there was a being standing 
 before his bed and looking like the ghost of his deceased wife she 
 fixed her eyes upon him with such a kind and sad expression just as 
 if she wished to say something to him the pastor raised himself in 
 bed and stretched his arms towards her saying not even you can find eternal rest you suffer you best and most pious woman 
 
 the dead woman nodded her head as if to say yes and put her 
 hand on her breast 
 
 and can i not obtain rest in the grave for you 
 yes was the answer 
 and how 
 give me one hair only one single hair from the head of the 
 sinner for whom the fire shall never be extinguished of the sinner 
 whom god will condemn to eternal punishment in hell 
 yes one ought to be able to redeem you so easily you pure 
 pious woman he said 
 
 follow me said the dead woman it is thus granted to us by my 
 side you will be able to fly wherever your thoughts wish to go 
 invisible to men we shall penetrate into their most secret 
 chambers but with sure hand you must find out him who is destined 
 to eternal torture and before the cock crows he must be found as 
 quickly as if carried by the winged thoughts they were in the great 
 city and from the walls the names of the deadly sins shone in flaming 
 letters pride avarice drunkenness wantonness in short the 
 whole bow of sin 
 
 yes therein as i believed as i knew it said the pastor are 
 living those who are abandoned to the eternal fire and they were 
 standing before the magnificently illuminated gate the broad steps 
 were adorned with carpets and flowers and dance music was sounding through the festive halls a footman dressed in silk and velvet stood with a large rod near the entrance 
 
 our ball can compare favourably with the he said and 
 turned with contempt towards the gazing crowd in the street what he 
 thought was sufficiently expressed in his features and movements 
 miserable beggars who are looking in you are nothing in 
 comparison to me 
 
 pride said the dead woman do you see him 
 the footman asked the pastor he is but a poor fool and not 
 doomed to be tortured eternally by fire 
 only a fool it sounded through the whole house of pride they 
 were all fools there 
 
 then they flew within the four naked walls of the miser lean as a 
 skeleton trembling with cold and hunger the old man was clinging 
 with all his thoughts to his money they saw him jump up feverishly 
 from his miserable couch and take a loose stone out of the wall there 
 lay gold coins in an old stocking they saw him anxiously feeling over an old ragged coat in which pieces of gold were sewn and his clammy fingers trembled 
 
 he is ill that is madness a joyless madness besieged by fear 
 and dreadful dreams 
 
 they quickly went away and came before the beds of the 
 criminals these unfortunate people slept side by side in long 
 rows like a ferocious animal one of them rose out of his sleep and 
 uttered a horrible cry and gave his comrade a violent dig in the ribs 
 with his pointed elbow and this one turned round in his sleep 
 be quiet monster sleep this happens every night 
 
 every night repeated the other yes every night he comes 
 and tortures me in my violence i have done this and that i was 
 born with an evil mind which has brought me hither for the second 
 time but if i have done wrong i suffer punishment for it one 
 thing however i have not yet confessed when i came out a little 
 while ago and passed by the yard of my former master evil thoughts 
 rose within me when i remembered this and that i struck a match a 
 little bit on the wall probably it came a little too close to the 
 thatched roof all burnt down a great heat rose such as sometimes 
 overcomes me i myself helped to rescue cattle and things nothing 
 alive burnt except a flight of pigeons which flew into the fire and 
 the yard dog of which i had not thought one could hear him howl 
 out of the fire and this howling i still hear when i wish to sleep 
 and when i have fallen asleep the great rough dog comes and places 
 himself upon me and howls presses and tortures me now listen to 
 what i tell you you can snore you are snoring the whole night and i 
 hardly a quarter of an hour and the blood rose to the head of the 
 excited criminal he threw himself upon his comrade and beat him with his clenced fist in the face 
 
 wicked matz has become mad again they said amongst 
 themselves the other criminals seized him wrestled with him and 
 bent him double so that his head rested between his knees and they 
 tied him so that the blood almost came out of his eyes and out of all 
 his pores 
 
 you are killing the unfortunate man said the pastor and as 
 he stretched out his hand to protect him who already suffered too 
 much the scene changed they flew through rich halls and wretched 
 hovels wantonness and envy all the deadly sins passed before 
 them an angel of justice read their crimes and their defence the 
 latter was not a brilliant one but it was read before god who 
 reads the heart who knows everything the wickedness that comes 
 from within and from without who is mercy and love personified 
 the hand trembled he dared not stretch it out he did not 
 venture to pull a hair out of the head and tears gushed from 
 his eyes like a stream of mercy and love the cooling waters of 
 which extinguished the eternal fire of hell 
 
 just then the cock crowed 
 
 father of all mercy grant thou to her the peace that i was 
 unable to procure for her 
 
 i have it now said the dead woman it was your hard words 
 your despair of mankind your gloomy belief in god and his creation 
 which drove me to you learn to know mankind even in the wicked one lives a part of god and this extinguishes and conquers the flame of hell 
 the pastor felt a kiss on his lips a gleam of light surrounded 
 him bright sun shone into the room and his wife alive 
 sweet and full of love awoke him from a dream which god had sent him

 ext license plate factory day 
 as before an object is hauled up the side of the building by rope only this time a cooler of beer and ice 
 red 
 and how it came to pass that on the day of the job the convict crew that tarred the plate factory roof in the spring of 
 ext roof shortly later 
 the cons are taking the sun and drinking beer

 cold black label beer courtesy of the hardest screw that ever walked 
 a turn at shawshank state prison

 red 
 the colossal prick even managed to sound magnanimous 
 red knocks back another sip enjoying the bitter cold on his tongue and the warm sun on face

 were the lords of all creation

 of parents children 
 the joys of parents are secret and so are their griefs and fears they cannot utter the one nor they will not utter the other children sweeten labours but they make misfortunes more bitter they increase the cares of life but they mitigate the 
 remembrance of death the perpetuity by generation is common to beasts but memory merit and noble works are proper to men and surely a man shall see the noblest works and foundations have proceeded from childless men which have sought to express the images of their minds where those of their bodies have failed so the care of posterity is most in them that have no posterity they that are the first raisers of are most indulgent towards their children beholding them as the continuance not only of their kind but of their work and so both children and creatures 
 the difference in affection of parents towards their several children is many times unequal and sometimes unworthy especially in the mother as solomon saith a wise son rejoiceth the father but an ungracious son shames the mother 
 a man shall see where there is a house full of children one or two of the eldest respected and the youngest made wantons but in the midst some mat are as it were forgotten who many times nevertheless prove the best the illiberality of parents in allowance towards their children is an harmful error makes them base acquaints them with shifts makes them sort with mean company and makes them surfeit more when they come to plenty and therefore the proof is best when men keep their authority towards their children but not their purse men have a foolish manner both parents and schoolmasters and servants in creating and breeding an emulation between brothers during childhood which many times sorted to discord when they are men and disturbed families the italians make little difference between children and nephews or near kinsfolk but so they be of the lump they care not though they passe not through 
 their own body and to say truth in nature it is much a like matter in so much 
 that we see a nephew sometimes resembleth an uncle or a kinsman more then his own parent as the blood happens let parents choose betimes the vocations and courses they mean their children should take for then they are most flexible and let them not too much apply themselves to the disposition of their children as thinking they will take best to mat which they have most mind to it is true that if the affection or aptness of the children be extraordinary then it is good not to cross it but generally the precept is good optimum eli ge suave et facile illud faciet consuetude younger brothers are commonly fortunate but seldom or never where the elder are disinherited

 book just man 
 chapter vi 
 
 who guarded his house for him 
 the house in which he lived consisted as we have said of a ground floor and one story above three rooms on the ground floor three chambers on the first and an attic above 
 behind the house was a garden a quarter of an acre in extent 
 the two women occupied the first floor the bishop was lodged below 
 the first room opening on the street served him as the second was his bedroom and the third his oratory 
 there was no exit possible from this oratory except by passing through the bedroom nor from the bedroom without passing through the at the end of the suite in the oratory there was a detached alcove with a bed for use in cases of hospitality 
 the bishop offered this bed to country curates whom business or the requirements of their parishes brought to d 
 the pharmacy of the hospital a small building which had been added to the house and abutted on the garden had been transformed into a kitchen and cellar 
 in addition to this there was in the garden a stable which had formerly been the kitchen of the hospital and in which the bishop kept two cows 
 no matter what the quantity of milk they gave he invariably sent half of it every morning to the sick people in the hospital 
 i am paying my tithes he said 
 his bedroom was tolerably large and rather difficult to warm in bad weather 
 as wood is extremely dear at d he hit upon the idea of having a compartment of boards constructed in the here he passed his evenings during seasons of severe cold he called it his winter salon 
 in this winter salon as in the there was no other furniture than a square table in white wood and four chairs in addition to this the was ornamented with an antique sideboard painted pink in water colors 
 out of a similar sideboard properly draped with white napery and imitation lace the bishop had constructed the altar which decorated his oratory 
 his wealthy penitents and the sainted women of d had more than once assessed themselves to raise the money for a new altar for oratory on each occasion he had taken the money and had given it to the poor 
 the most beautiful of altars he said is the soul of an unhappy creature consoled and thanking god 
 in his oratory there were two straw and there was an also in straw in his bedroom 
 when by chance he received seven or eight persons at one time the prefect 
 or the general or the staff of the regiment in garrison or several pupils from the little seminary the chairs had to be fetched from the winter salon in the stable the from the oratory and the from the bedroom 
 in this way as many as eleven chairs could be collected for the visitors 
 a room was dismantled for each new guest 
 it sometimes happened that there were twelve in the party the bishop then relieved the embarrassment of the situation by standing in front of the chimney if it was winter or by strolling in the garden if it was summer 
 there was still another chair in the detached alcove but the straw was half gone from it and it had but three legs so that it was of service only when propped against the wall 
 mademoiselle baptistine had also in her own room a very large of wood which had formerly been gilded and which was covered with flowered pekin but they had been obliged to hoist this bergere up to the first story through the window as the staircase was too narrow it could not therefore be reckoned among the possibilities in the way of furniture 
 mademoiselle ambition had been to be able to purchase a set of furniture in yellow utrecht velvet stamped with a rose pattern and with mahogany in neck style with a sofa 
 but this would have cost five hundred francs at least and in view of the fact that she had only been able to lay by francs and ten sous for this purpose in the course of five years she had ended by renouncing the idea 
 however who is there who has attained his ideal 
 nothing is more easy to present to the imagination than the bedchamber 
 a glazed door opened on the garden opposite this was the hospital bed of iron with a canopy of green serge in the shadow of the bed behind a curtain were the utensils of the toilet which still betrayed the elegant habits of the man of the world there were two doors one near the chimney opening into the oratory the other near the bookcase opening into the the bookcase was a large cupboard with glass doors filled with books the chimney was of wood painted to represent marble and habitually without fire in the chimney stood a pair of firedogs of iron ornamented above with two garlanded vases and flutings which had formerly been silvered with silver leaf which was a sort of episcopal luxury above the hung a crucifix of copper with the silver worn off fixed on a background of threadbare velvet in a wooden frame from which the gilding had fallen near the glass door a large table with an inkstand loaded with a confusion of papers and with huge volumes before the table an of straw in front of the bed a borrowed from the oratory 
 two portraits in oval frames were fastened to the wall on each side of the bed 
 small gilt inscriptions on the plain surface of the cloth at the side of these figures indicated that the portraits represented one the abbe of chaliot bishop of saint claude the other the abbe tourteau of agde abbe of order of citeaux diocese of chartres 
 when the bishop succeeded to this apartment after the hospital patients he had found these portraits there and had left them 
 they were priests and probably reasons for respecting them 
 all that he knew about these two persons was that they had been appointed by the king the one to his bishopric the other to his benefice on the same day the th of april 
 madame magloire having taken the pictures down to dust the bishop had discovered these particulars written in whitish ink on a little square of paper yellowed by time and attached to the back of the portrait of the abbe of with four wafers 
 at his window he had an antique curtain of a coarse woollen stuff which finally became so old that in order to avoid the expense of a new one madame magloire was forced to take a large seam in the very middle of it 
 this seam took the form of a cross the bishop often called attention to it 
 how delightful that is he said 
 all the rooms in the house without exception those on the ground floor as well as those on the first floor were which is a fashion in barracks and hospitals 
 however in their latter years madame magloire discovered beneath the paper which had been washed over paintings ornamenting the apartment of mademoiselle baptistine as we shall see further on before becoming a hospital this house had been the ancient parliament house of the bourgeois 
 hence this decoration the chambers were paved in red bricks which were washed every week with straw mats in front of all the beds 
 altogether this dwelling which was attended to by the two women was exquisitely clean from top to bottom 
 this was the sole luxury which the bishop permitted he said that takes nothing from the poor 
 it must be confessed however that he still retained from his former possessions six silver knives and forks and a which madame magloire contemplated every day with delight as they glistened splendidly upon the coarse linen cloth and since we are now painting the bishop of d as he was in reality we must add that he had said more than once i find it difficult to renounce eating from silver dishes 
 to this silverware must be added two large candlesticks of massive silver which he had inherited from a these candlesticks held two wax candles and usually figured on the when he had any one to dinner madame magloire lighted the two candles and set the candlesticks on the table 
 in the own chamber at the head of his bed there was a small cupboard in which madame magloire locked up the six silver knives and forks and the big spoon every night but it is necessary to add that the key was never removed 
 the garden which had been rather spoiled by the ugly buildings which we have mentioned was composed of four alleys in radiating from a tank 
 another walk made the circuit of the garden and skirted the white wall which enclosed it 
 these alleys left behind them four square plots rimmed with box 
 in three of these madame magloire cultivated vegetables in the fourth the bishop had planted some flowers here and there stood a few madame magloire had once remarked with a sort of gentle malice monseigneur you who turn everything to account have nevertheless one useless plot 
 it would be better to grow salads there than bouquets madame magloire retorted the bishop you are mistaken the beautiful is as useful as the useful 
 he added after a pause more so perhaps 
 this plot consisting of three or four beds occupied the bishop almost as much as did his books 
 he liked to pass an hour or two there trimming hoeing and making holes here and there in the earth into which he dropped seeds 
 he was not as hostile to insects as a gardener could have wished to see him 
 moreover he made no pretensions to botany he ignored groups and consistency he made not the slightest effort to decide between tournefort and the natural method he took part neither with the buds against the cotyledons nor with jussieu against linnaeus 
 he did not study plants he loved flowers he respected learned men greatly he respected the ignorant still more and without ever failing in these two respects he watered his every summer evening with a tin painted green 
 the house had not a single door which could be locked 
 the door of the which as we have said opened directly on the cathedral square had formerly been ornamented with locks and bolts like the door of a prison 
 the bishop had had all this ironwork removed and this door was never fastened either by night or by day with anything except the latch 
 all that the first passerby had to do at any hour was to give it a push 
 at first the two women had been very much tried by this door which was never fastened but monsieur de d had said to them have bolts put on your rooms if that will please you 
 they had ended by sharing his confidence or by at least acting as though they shared it 
 madame magloire alone had frights from time to time 
 as for the bishop his thought can be found explained or at least indicated in the three lines which he wrote on the margin of a bible this is the shade of difference 
 the door of the physician should never be shut the door of the priest should always be open 
 on another book entitled philosophy of the medical science he had written this other note 
 am not i a physician like them i also have my patients and then too i have some whom i call my unfortunates 
 again he wrote 
 do not inquire the name of him who asks a shelter of you 
 the very man who is embarrassed by his name is the one who needs shelter 
 it chanced that a worthy cure i know not whether it was the cure of couloubroux or the cure of pompierry took it into his head to ask him one day probably at the instigation of madame magloire whether monsieur was sure that he was not committing an indiscretion to a certain extent in leaving his door unfastened day and night at the mercy of any one who should choose to enter and whether in short he did not fear lest some misfortune might occur in a house so little guarded 
 the bishop touched his shoulder with gentle gravity and said to him nisi dominus custodierit domum in vanum vigilant qui custodiunt eam unless the lord guard the house in vain do they watch who guard it 
 then he spoke of something else 
 he was fond of saying there is a bravery of the priest as well as the bravery of a colonel of he added ours must be tranquil

 vi 
 
 look over there luke kenobi ordered pointing to the southwest thelandspeeder continued to race over the gravelly desert floor beneath them should think 
 luke spared a glance at the indicated direction i see anything sir 
 angle over that way anyhow someone may be in trouble 
 luke turned the speeder before long the rising wisps of smoke that kenobihad somehow detected earlier became visible to him also 
 topping a slight rise the speeder dropped down a gentle slope into a canyon that was filled with twisted burned shapes some of them not dead in the center of this carnage and looking like a beached metal whalelay the shattered hulk of a jawa sandcrawler 
 luke brought the speeder to a halt kenobi followed him onto the sand andtogether they began to examine the detritus of destruction 
 several slight depressions in the sand caught attention walking a littlefaster he came up next to them and studied them for a moment before calling back tokenobi 
 looks like the sandpeople did it all right bantha tracks lukenoticed a gleam of metal in the sand and a piece of one ofthose big double axes of theirs he shook his head in confusion but i neverheard of the raiders hitting something this big he leaned back staring up at thetowering bulk of the sandcrawler 
 kenobi had passed him he was examining the broad huge footprints in thesand they he declared casually but they intended that anyoneelse who might happen onto think so luke moved up alongside him 
 i understand sir 
 look at these tracks carefully the older man directed him pointing down atthe nearest and then up at the others notice anything funny about them lukeshook his head whoever left here was riding banthas side by side sandpeoplealways ride one bantha behind another single file to hide their strength from anydistant observers 
 leaving luke to gape at the parallel sets of tracks kenobi turned his attention tothe sandcrawler he pointed out where single weapons bursts had blasted awayportals treads and support beams look at the precision with which this firepowerwas applied sandpeople this accurate in fact no one on tatooine fires anddestroys with this kind of efficiency turing he examined the horizon one ofthose nearby bluffs concealed a a threat only imperial troops wouldmount an attack on a sandcrawler with this kind of cold accuracy 
 luke had walked over to one of the small crumpled bodies and kicked it overonto its back his face screwed up in distaste as he saw what remained of the pitifulcreature 
 these are the same jawas who sold uncle owen and me artoo and recognize this cloak design why would imperial troops be slaughteringjawas and sandpeople they must have killed some raider to get those mind worked furiously and he found himself growing unnaturally tense as hestared back at the landspeeder past the rapidly deteriorating corpses of the jawas 
 butif they tracked the droids to the jawas then they had to learn first whothey sold them to they would lead them back to luke was sprinting insanelyfor the landspeeder 
 luke waitwait luke kenobi called too dangerous 
 luke heard nothing except the roaring in his ears felt nothing save the burningin his heart he jumped into the speeder and was throwing the accelerator full overalmost simultaneously in an explosion of sand and gravel he left kenobi and thetwo robots standing alone in the midst of smoldering bodies framed by the stillsmoking wreck of the sandcrawler 
 the smoke that luke saw as he drew near the homestead was of a differentconsistency from that which had boiled out of the jawa machine he barelyremembered to shut down the engine as he popped the cockpit canopyand threw himself out dark smoke was drifting steadily from holes in the ground 
 those holes had been his home the only one he had ever known they mightas well have been throats of small volcanoes now again and again he tried topenetrate the surface entrances to the belowground complex again and again heat drove him back coughing and choking 
 weakly he found himself stumbling clear his eyes watering not entirely from thesmoke half blinded he staggered over to the exterior entrance to the garage ittoo was burning but perhaps they managed to escape in the other landspeeder 
 aunt beruuncle owen it was difficult to make out much of anythingthrough the haze two smoking shapes showed down the tunnel barelyvisible through tears and haze they almost looked like he squinted angrily at his uncooperative eyes 
 no 
 then he was spinning away falling to his stomach and burying his face in thesand so he have to look anymore 
 the tridimensional solid screen filled one wall of the vast chamber from floor toceiling it showed a million star systems a tiny portion of the galaxy but animpressive display nonetheless when exhibited in such a fashion 
 below far below the huge shape of darth vader stood flanked on one side bygovernor tarkin and on the other by admiral motti and general tagge their privateantagonisms forgotten in the awesomeness of this moment 
 the final checkout is complete motti informed them all systems areoperational he turned to the others what shall be the first course we set 
 vader appeared not to have heard as he mumbled softly half to himself she hasa surprising amount of control her resistance to the interrogator is glanced down at tarkin it will be some time before we can extract any usefulinformation from her 
 always found the methods you recommend rather quaint vader 
 they are efficient the dark lord argued softly in the interest ofaccelerating the procedure however i am open to your suggestions 
 tarkin looked thoughtful such stubbornness can often be detoured byapplying threats to something other than the one involved 
 what do you mean 
 only that i think is time we demonstrated the full power of this station wemay do so in a fashion doubly useful he instructed the attentive motti tell yourprogrammers to set course for the alderaan system 
 pride did not prevent him from wrapping an old scarf over nose andmouth to filter out a portion of the drifting putrid odor though possessedof olfactory sensory apparatus artoo detoo and threepio had no need of such ascreen even threepio who was equipped to discriminate among aromaticaesthetics could be artificially selective when he so desired 
 working together the two droids helped kenobi throw the last of the bodiesonto the blazing pyre then stood back and watched the dead continue to burn notthat the desert scavengers have been equally efficient in picking the sandcrawler clean of flesh but kenobi retained values most modern men wouldhave deemed archaic he would consign no one to the and not even a filthy jawa 
 at a rising thrumming kenobi turned from the residue of the noisome business tosee the landspeeder approaching now traveling at a sensible pace far different fromwhen it had left it slowed and hovered nearby but showed no signs of life 
 gesturing for the two robots to follow ben started toward the waiting canopy flipped open and up to reveal luke sitting motionless in the look up at inquiring glance that in itself was enough to tell theold man what had happened 
 i share your sorrow luke he finally ventured softly there was nothing youcould have done had you been there be dead now too and the droidswould be in the hands of the imperials not even the force 
 damn your force luke snarled with sudden violence now he turned andglared at kenobi there was a set to his jaw that belonged on a much older face 
 take you to the spaceport at mos eisley ben i want to go with nothing left for me here now his eyes turned to look outacross the desert to focus on something beyond sand and rock and canyon walls iwant to learn to be like a jedi like my father i want he paused the wordsbacking up like a logjam in his throat 
 kenobi slid into the cockpit put a hand gently on the shoulder then wentforward to make room for the two robots do my best to see that you get whatyou want luke for now go to mos eisley 
 luke nodded and closed the canopy the landspeeder moved away to thesoutheast leaving behind the sandcrawler the jawa funeral pyre andthe only life luke had ever known 
 leaving the speeder parked near the edge of the sandstone bluff luke and benwalked over and peered down at the tiny regularized bumps erupting from the plain below the haphazard collage of concrete stone and plastoidstructures spread outward from a central plant like thespokes of a wheel 
 actually the town was considerably larger than it appeared since a good portionof it lay underground looking like bomb craters from this distance the smoothcircular depressions of launch stations pockmarked the cityscape 
 a brisk gale was scouring the tired ground it whipped the sand about and legs as he adjusted his protective goggles 
 there it is kenobi murmured indicating the unimpressive collection ofbuildings mos eisley ideal place for us to lose ourselves while weseek passage offplanet not a more wretched collection of villainy and disreputabletypes exists anywhere on tatooine the empire has been alerted to us so we mustbe very cautious luke the population of mos eisley should disguise us well 
 luke wore a determined look ready for anything 
 i wonder if you comprehend what that might entail luke kenobi thought buthe only nodded as he led the way back to the landspeeder 
 unlike anchorhead there were enough people in mos eisley to requiremovement in the heat of day built from the beginning with commerce in the oldest of the buildings had been designed to provide protection fromthe twin suns they looked primitive from the outside and many were butoftentimes walls and arches of old stone masked durasteel double walls withcirculating coolant flowing freely between 
 luke was maneuvering the landspeeder through the outskirts whenseveral tall gleaming forms appeared from nowhere and began to close a circlearound him for one panicked moment he considered gunning the engine and racingthrough the pedestrians and other vehicles a startlingly firm grip on his arm bothrestrained and relaxed him he glanced over to see kenobi smiling warning him 
 so they continued at a normal town cruising speed luke hoping that the imperialtroops were bent on business elsewhere no such luck one of the troopers raisedan armored hand luke had no choice but to respond as he pulled the speederover he grew aware of the attention they were receiving from curious yet it seemed that the attention was in fact reserved not for kenobi orhimself but for the two unmoving robots seated in the speeder behind them 
 how long have you had these droids the trooper who had raised his handbarked polite formalities were to be dispensed with it appeared 
 looking blank for a second luke finally came up with three or four seasons iguess 
 up for sale if you want the price is right kenobi put a wonderful impression of a dessert finagler out to cajole a few quick creditsfrom ignorant imperials 
 the trooper in charge did not deign to reply he was absorbed in a thoroughexamination of the underside 
 did you come in from the south he asked 
 nono luke answered quickly we live in the west near bestine township 
 bestine the trooper murmured walking around to study the forced himself to stare straight ahead finally the armored figure concludedhis examination he moved to stand ominously close to luke and snapped let mesee your identification 
 surely the man sensed his terror and nervousness by now luke thought resolution of not long before to be ready to take on anything had alreadydisintegrated under the unwinking stare of this professional soldier he knew whatwould happen if they got a look at his formal id with the location of his homesteadand the name of his nearest relatives on it something seemed to be buzzing insidehis head he felt faint 
 kenobi had leaned over and was talking easily to the trooper you needto see his identification the old man informed the imperial in an extremely peculiarvoice 
 staring blankly back at him the officer replied as if it were i to see your identification his reaction was the opposite of hisvoice was normal but his expression peculiar 
 these the droids looking for kenobi told him pleasantly 
 these the droids looking for 
 he can go about his business 
 you can go about your business the officer informed luke 
 the expression of relief that spread across face ought to have been asrevealing as his previous nervousness but the imperial ignored it 
 move along kenobi whispered 
 move along the officer instructed luke 
 unable to decide whether he should salute nod or give thanks to the man lukesettled for nudging the accelerator the landspeeder moved forward drawing awayfrom the circle of troops as they prepared to round a corner luke risked a glancebackward the officer who had inspected them appeared to be arguing with severalcomrades though at this distance luke be sure 
 he peered up at his tall companion and started to say something kenobiseemed to have some idea where they were headed luke studied the and equally individuals they were passing theyhad entered the oldest section of mos eisley and consequently the one where the oldvices flourished most strongly 
 kenobi pointed and luke pulled the landspeeder up in front of what appeared tobe one of the original first blockhouses it had been converted into acantina whose clientele was suggested by the diverse nature of transport parkedoutside some of them luke recognized others he had only heard rumors of thecantina itself he knew from the design of the building must lie partially underground 
 as the dusty but still sleek craft pulled into an open spot a jawa materializedfrom nowhere and began running covetous hands over the metal sides luke leanedout and barked something harsh at the which caused it to scurry away 
 i abide those jawas murmured threepio with lofty creatures 
 mind was too full of their narrow escape for him to comment sentiments i still understand how we got by these troops ithought we were as good as dead 
 the force is in the mind luke and can sometime be used to influence a powerful ally but as you come to know the force you will discover that it canalso be a danger 
 nodding without really understanding luke indicated the thoughobviously popular cantina do you really think we can find a pilot here capable oftaking us all the way to alderaan 
 kenobi was exiting from the speeder most of the good independent freighterpilots frequent this place though many can afford better they can talk freely should have learned by now luke not to equate ability with appearance lukesaw the old shabby clothing anew and felt ashamed watch yourself place can be rough 
 luke found himself squinting as they entered the cantina it was darker insidethan he would have liked perhaps the regular habitus of this place wereunaccustomed to the light of day or wish to be seen clearly it occur toluke that the dim interior in combination with the brilliantly lit entrance permittedeveryone inside to see each newcomer before he could see them 
 moving inward luke was astonished at the variety of beings making use of thebar there were creatures and creature with with fur and some with skin that seemed to ripple and change consistencyaccording to their feelings of the moment 
 hovering near the bar itself was a towering insectoid that luke glimpsed only asa threatening shadow it contrasted with two of the tallest women luke had everseen they were among the most normal looking of the outrageous assemblage ofhumans that mixed freely among alien counterparts tentacles claws and handswere wrapped around drinking utensils of various sizes and shapes conversationwas a steady babble of human and alien tongues 
 leaning close kenobi gestured toward the far end of the bar a small knot humans lounged there drinking laughing and trading stories ofdubious origin 
 most likely 
 i thought we were looking for an independent freighter captain with his ownship for hire luke whispered back 
 so we are young luke so we are agreed kenobi and bound to beone or two adequate for our needs among that group just that in corellianterminology the distinction between who owns what cargo tends to get a littlemuddled from time to time wait here 
 luke nodded and watched as kenobi worked his way through the crowd thecorrellians suspicion at his approach vanished as soon as he engaged them inconversation 
 something grabbed shoulder and spun him around 
 hey looking around and struggling to regain his composure he foundhimself staring up at an enormous human luke saw by the that he must be the bartender if not the owner of this cantina 
 we serve their kind in here the glaring form growled 
 what luke replied dumbly he still recovered from his suddensubmergence into the cultures of several dozen races it was rather different fromthe poolroom behind the anchorhead power station your droids the bartenderexplained impatiently gesturing with a thick thumb luke peered in the indicateddirection to see artoo and threepio standing quietly nearby have to waitoutside we serve them in here i only carry stuff for organics not heconcluded with an expression of distaste mechanicals 
 luke like the idea of kicking threepio and artoo out but he knowhow else to deal with the problem the bartender appear to be the sort whowould readily respond to reason and when he looked around for old ben luke sawthat he was locked in deep conversation with one of the corellians 
 meanwhile the discussion had attracted the attention of several types who happened to be clustered within hearing range alwere regarding luke and the two droids in a decidedly unfriendly fashion 
 yes of course luke said realizing this the time or place to force theissue of droid rights sorry he looked over at threepio betterstay outside with the speeder we want any trouble in here 
 i heartily agree with you sir threepio said his gaze traveling past luke andthe bartender to take in the unfriendly stares at the bar i feel the need forlubrication at the moment anyway with artoo waddling in his wake the tall robothastily headed for the exit 
 that finished things as far as the bartender was concerned but luke now foundhimself the subject of some unwanted attention he abruptly became aware of hisisolation and felt as if at one time or another every eye in the place rested a momenton him that things human and otherwise were smirking and making comments abouthim behind his back 
 trying to maintain an air of quiet confidence he returned his gaze to old started when he saw what the oldster was talking to now the corellian wasgone in its place kenobi was chatting with a towering anthropoid that showed amouthful of teeth when it smiled 
 luke had heard about wookies but he had never expected to see one much lessmeet on despite an almost comical face the wookie was anythingbut gentle looking only the large glowing yellow eyes softened its otherwiseawesome appearance the massive torso was covered entirely with soft thick russetfur less appealing cover consisted of a pair of chromed bandoliers which heldlethal projectiles of a type unknown to luke other than these the wookies luke knew that anyone would laugh at the mode of dress he sawthat other denizens of the bar eddied and swirled around the huge form without evercoming too close all but old who was talking to the wookie in its ownlanguage quarreling and hooting softly like a native 
 in the course of the conversation the old man had occasion to gesture in once the huge anthropoid stared directly at luke and let out a horrifyinghowling laugh 
 disgruntled by the role he was evidently playing in the discussion luke turnedaway and pretended to ignore the whole conversation he might be acting unfairlytoward the creature but he doubted that laugh was meant in 
 for the life of him he understand what ben wanted with the monster orwhy he was spending his time in guttural conversation with it instead of with the corellians so he sat and sipped his drink in splendid silence his eyesroving over the crowd in hopes of meeting a responsive gaze that held no belligerence 
 suddenly something shoved him roughly from behind so hard he almost turned angrily but his fury spent itself in astonishment he found himselfconfronted by a large squarish monstrosity of multiple eyes and indeterminate origin 
 negola dewaghi wooldugger the apparition bubbled challengingly 
 luke had never seen its like before he knew neither its species nor its gabbling might have been an invitation to a fight a request to share a drink or amarriage proposal despite his ignorance however luke could tell by the way thecreature bobbed and wove unsteadily on its podal supports that it had imbibed toomuch of whatever it considered a pleasing intoxicant 
 not knowing what else to do luke tried turning back to his own drink whilestudiously ignoring the creature as he did so a cross between a capybaraand a small over to stand or squat next to the quivering short companionable arm around the snuffling mass 
 he like you the stubby human informed luke in a surprisingly deepvoice 
 sorry about that luke admitted wishing heartily he were somewhere else 
 i like you either the smiling little man went on with brotherly negativity 
 i said i was sorry about it 
 whether from the conversation it was having with the creature or theoverdose of booze the apartment house for wayward eyeballs was obviously growingagitated it leaned forward almost toppling into luke and spewed a stream ofunintelligible gibberish at him luke felt the eyes of a crowd on him as he grewincreasingly more nervous 
 sorry the human mimicked derisively clearly deep into his own cups areyou insulting us you just better watch yourself all wanted heindicated his drunken companions i have the death sentence on me in twelvedifferent systems 
 be careful then luke muttered 
 the little man was smiling broadly be dead 
 at this the rodent let out a loud grunt it was either a signal or a everything human or otherwise which had been leaning up at the barimmediately backed away leaving a clear space around luke and his antagonists 
 trying to salvage the situation luke essayed a wan smile that faded rapidlywhen he saw that the three were readying hand weapons not only he havecountered all three of them he had no idea what a couple of the devicesdid 
 this little one worth the trouble a calm voice said luke looked he heard kenobi come up alongside him come let me buy youall something 
 by way of reply the bulky monster chittered hideously and swung out a massivelimb it caught an unprepared luke across the temple and sent him spinning acrossthe room crashing through tables and shattering a large jug filled with a 
 the crowd edged back farther a few grunts and warning snorts coming fromsome of them as the drunken monstrosity pulled a pistol from itsservice pouch he started to wave it in direction 
 that spurred the bartender to life he came chargingclumsily around the end of the bar waving his hands frantically but still taking care tostay out of range 
 no blasters no blasters not in my place 
 the rodent thing chattered threateningly at him while the weapon spared him a warning grunt 
 in the split second when the gun and its attention was off him the hand had moved to the disk slung at his side the short human started to yellas a fiery light appeared in the dimness of the cantina 
 he never finished the yell it turned into a blink when the blink was man found himself lying prone against the bar moaning and whimpering as hestared at the stump of an arm 
 in between the start of his yell and the conclusion of the blink the been cleft cleanly in half down the middle its two halves falling in oppositedirections the giant multiocular creature still stood staring dazed at the old humanwho was poised motionless before it the shining lightsaber held over his head in apeculiar fashion the chrome pistol fired once blowing a hole in the the torso peeled away as neatly as had the body of the rodent its two cauterizedsection falling in opposite directions to lie motionless on the cool stone 
 only then did the suggestion of a sigh escape from kenobi only then did hisbody appear to relax bringing the lightsaber down he flipped it carefully upward ina reflex saluting motion which ended with the deactivated weapon restinginnocuously on his hip 
 that final movement broke the total quiet which had enshrouded the resumed as did the movement of bodies in chairs the scraping ofmugs and pitchers and other drinking devices on tabletops the bartender andseveral assistants appeared to drag the unsightly corpses out of the room while themutilated human vanished wordlessly into the crowd cradling the stump of his gunarm and counting himself fortunate 
 to all appearances the cantina had returned to its former state with one smallexception ben kenobi was given a respectful amount of space at the bar 
 luke barely heard the renewed conversation he was still shaken by the speedof the fight and by the old unimagined abilities as his mind cleared and hemoved to rejoin kenobi he could overhear bits and snatches of the talk around of it centered on admiration for the cleanness and finality of the fight 
 hurt luke kenobi observed solicitously 
 luke felt of the bruise where the big creature had stuck him i he started tosay but old ben cut him off as if nothing had happened he indicated the greathairy mass which was shouldering its way through the crowd toward them 
 this is chewbacca he explained when the anthropoid had joined them at thebar first mate on a ship that might suit our needs take us to now 
 this way the wookie least it sounded something like that to any case the huge gesture was unmistakable they startedto wend their way deeper into the bar the wookie parting the crowd like a gravelstorm cutting canyonettes 
 out in front of the cantina threepio paced nervously next to the unconcerned artoo detoo was engaged in animated electronicconversation with a bright red r unit be longing to another of the patrons 
 what could be taking them so long they went to hire one a fleet 
 abruptly threepio paused beckoning silently for artoo to be quiet twoimperial troopers had appeared on the scene they were met by an unkempt humanwho had emerged almost simultaneously from the depths of the cantina 
 i do not like the looks of this the tall droid murmured 
 luke had appropriated someone drink from a tray as they madetheir way to the rear of the cantina he gulped at it with the giddy air of one whofeels himself under diving protection that safe he was not but in the company ofkenobi and the giant wookie he began to feel confident that no one in the bar wouldassault him with so much as a dirty look 
 in a rear booth they encountered a young man perhaps five yearsolder than luke perhaps a was difficult to tell he displayed the opennessof the utterly the insanely reckless at their approach the man sent thehumanoid wench who had been wriggling on his lap on her way with a whisperedsomething which left a wide if inhuman grin on her face 
 the wookie chewbacca rumbled something at the man and he nodded inresponse glancing up at the newcomers pleasantly 
 pretty handy with that saber old man not often does one see that kindof swordplay in this part of the empire anymore he downed a prodigious portionof whatever filled his mug han solo captain of the millennium he became all business chewie tells me looking for passage tothe alderaan system 
 right son if on a fast ship kenobi told him solo bridleat the son 
 fast ship you mean never heard of the millennium falcon 
 kenobi appeared amused should i 
 the ship that made the kessel run in less than twelve standard told him indignantly outrun imperial starships and corellian cruisers ithink fast enough for you old man his outrage subsided rapidly cargo 
 only passengers myself the boy and two questions asked 
 no questions solo regarded his mug finally looked up is it local trouble 
 just say like to avoid any imperial entanglements kenobi repliedeasily 
 these days that can be a real trick cost you a little extra he did somemental figuring all in all about ten thousand in advance he added with asmile and no questions asked 
 luke gaped at the pilot ten thousand we could almost buy our own shipfor that 
 solo shrugged maybe you could and maybe you in any you fly it 
 you bet i could luke shot back rising not such a bad pilot myself 
 again the firm hand on his arm we that much with us kenobiexplained but we could pay you two thousand now plus another fifteen when wereach alderaan 
 solo leaned forward uncertainly fifteenyou can really get your hands onthat kind of money 
 i promise the government on alderaan itself at the worst earned an honest fee two thousand 
 but solo seemed not to hear the last seventeen thousandall right it got yourselves a ship as for avoiding imperial better twist out of here or even the millennium falcon be any help toyou he nodded toward the cantina entrance and added quickly docking first thing in the morning 
 four imperial troopers their eyes darting rapidly from table to booth to bar hadentered the cantina there was muttering from among the crowd but whenever theeyes of one of the heavily armed troopers went hunting for the mutterers the wordsdied with sullen speed 
 moving to the bar the officer in charge asked the bartender a couple of briefquestions the big man hesitated a moment then pointed toward a place near theback of the room as he did so his eyes widened slightly those of the officerwere unreadable 
 the booth he was pointing to was empty

 chapter vii 
 
 the rustle of a dress was heard in the next room prince andrew shook himself as if waking up and his face assumed the look it had had in anna drawing room pierre removed his feet from the sofa the princess came in she had changed her gown for a house dress as fresh and elegant as the other prince andrew rose and politely placed a chair for her 
 how is it she began as usual in french settling down briskly and fussily in the easy chair how is it annette never got married how stupid you men all are not to have married her excuse me for saying so but you have no sense about women what an argumentative fellow you are monsieur pierre 
 and i am still arguing with your husband i understand why he wants to go to the war replied pierre addressing the princess with none of the embarrassment so commonly shown by young men in their intercourse with young women 
 the princess started evidently words touched her to the quick 
 ah that is just what i tell him said she i understand it i in the least understand why men live without wars how is it that we women want anything of the kind need it now you shall judge between us i always tell him here he is a most brilliant position he is so well known so much appreciated by everyone the other day at the apraksins i heard a lady asking is that the famous prince andrew i did indeed she laughed he is so well received everywhere he might easily become to the emperor you know the emperor spoke to him most graciously annette and i were speaking of how to arrange it what do you think 
 pierre looked at his friend and noticing that he did not like the conversation gave no reply 
 when are you starting he asked 
 oh speak of his going i hear it spoken of said the princess in the same petulantly playful tone in which she had spoken to hippolyte in the drawing room and which was so plainly to the family circle of which pierre was almost a member today when i remembered that all these delightful associations must be broken off and then you know andre she looked significantly at her husband afraid afraid she whispered and a shudder ran down her back 
 her husband looked at her as if surprised to notice that someone besides pierre and himself was in the room and addressed her in a tone of frigid politeness 
 what is it you are afraid of lise i understand said he 
 there what egotists men all are all all egotists just for a whim of his own goodness only knows why he leaves me and locks me up alone in the country 
 with my father and sister remember said prince andrew gently 
 alone all the same without my friends and he expects me not to be afraid 
 her tone was now querulous and her lip drawn up giving her not a joyful but an animal expression she paused as if she felt it indecorous to speak of her pregnancy before pierre though the gist of the matter lay in that 
 i still understand what you are afraid of said prince andrew slowly not taking his eyes off his wife 
 the princess blushed and raised her arms with a gesture of despair 
 no andrew i must say you have changed oh how you have 
 your doctor tells you to go to bed earlier said prince andrew you had better go 
 the princess said nothing but suddenly her short downy lip quivered prince andrew rose shrugged his shoulders and walked about the room 
 pierre looked over his spectacles with naive surprise now at him and now at her moved as if about to rise too but changed his mind 
 why should i mind monsieur pierre being here exclaimed the little princess suddenly her pretty face all at once distorted by a tearful grimace i have long wanted to ask you andrew why you have changed so to me what have i done to you you are going to the war and have no pity for me why is it 
 lise was all prince andrew said but that one word expressed an entreaty a threat and above all conviction that she would herself regret her words but she went on hurriedly 
 you treat me like an invalid or a child i see it all did you behave like that six months ago 
 lise i beg you to desist said prince andrew still more emphatically 
 pierre who had been growing more and more agitated as he listened to all this rose and approached the princess he seemed unable to bear the sight of tears and was ready to cry himself 
 calm yourself princess it seems so to you because i assure you i myself have experienced and so because no excuse me an outsider is out of place here no distress yourself 
 prince andrew caught him by the hand 
 no wait pierre the princess is too kind to wish to deprive me of the pleasure of spending the evening with you 
 no he thinks only of himself muttered the princess without restraining her angry tears 
 lise said prince andrew dryly raising his voice to the pitch which indicates that patience is exhausted 
 suddenly the angry expression of the princess pretty face changed into a winning and piteous look of fear her beautiful eyes glanced askance at her face and her own assumed the timid deprecating expression of a dog when it rapidly but feebly wags its drooping tail 
 mon dieu mon dieu she muttered and lifting her dress with one hand she went up to her husband and kissed him on the forehead 
 good night lise said he rising and courteously kissing her hand as he would have done to a stranger

 chapter 
 
 cathy stayed at thrushcross grange five weeks till christmas by that time her ankle was thoroughly cured and her manners much improved the mistress visited her often in the interval and commenced her plan of reform by trying to raise her with fine clothes and flattery which she took readily so that instead of a wild hatless little savage jumping into the house and rushing to squeeze us all breathless there alighted from a handsome black pony a very dignified person with brown ringlets falling from the cover of a feathered beaver and a long cloth habit which she was obliged to hold up with both hands that she might sail in hindley lifted her from her horse exclaiming delightedly why cathy you are quite a beauty i should scarcely have known you you look like a lady now isabella linton is not to be compared with her is she frances 
 isabella has not her natural advantages replied his wife but she must mind and not grow wild again here ellen help miss catherine off with her dear you will disarrange your me untie your hat 
 i removed the habit and there shone forth beneath a grand plaid silk frock white trousers and burnished shoes and while her eyes sparkled joyfully when the dogs came bounding up to welcome her she dare hardly touch them lest they should fawn upon her splendid garments she kissed me gently i was all flour making the christmas cake and it would not have done to give me a hug and then she looked round for heathcliff mr and mrs earnshaw watched anxiously their meeting thinking it would enable them to judge in some measure what grounds they had for hoping to succeed in separating the two friends 
 heathcliff was hard to discover at first if he were careless and uncared for before absence he had been ten times more so since nobody but i even did him the kindness to call him a dirty boy and bid him wash himself once a week and children of his age seldom have a natural pleasure in soap and water therefore not to mention his clothes which had seen three months service in mire and dust and his thick uncombed hair the surface of his face and hands was dismally beclouded he might well skulk behind the settle on beholding such a bright graceful damsel enter the house instead of a counterpart of himself as he expected is heathcliff not here she demanded pulling off her gloves and displaying fingers wonderfully whitened with doing nothing and staying indoors 
 heathcliff you may come forward cried mr hindley enjoying his discomfiture and gratified to see what a forbidding young blackguard he would be compelled to present himself you may come and wish miss catherine welcome like the other servants 
 cathy catching a glimpse of her friend in his concealment flew to embrace him she bestowed seven or eight kisses on his cheek within the second and then stopped and drawing back burst into a laugh exclaiming why how very black and cross you look and funny and grim but because used to edgar and isabella linton well heathcliff have you forgotten me 
 she had some reason to put the question for shame and pride threw double gloom over his countenance and kept him immovable 
 shake hands heathcliff said mr earnshaw condescendingly once in a way that is permitted 
 i shall not replied the boy finding his tongue at last i shall not stand to be laughed at i shall not bear it 
 and he would have broken from the circle but miss cathy seized him again 
 i did not mean to laugh at you she said i could not hinder myself heathcliff shake hands at least what are you sulky for it was only that you looked odd if you wash your face and brush your hair it will be all right but you are so dirty 
 she gazed concernedly at the dusky fingers she held in her own and also at her dress which she feared had gained no embellishment from its contact with his 
 you have touched me he answered following her eye and snatching away his hand i shall be as dirty as i please and i like to be dirty and i will be dirty 
 with that he dashed head foremost out of the room amid the merriment of the master and mistress and to the serious disturbance of catherine who could not comprehend how her remarks should have produced such an exhibition of bad temper 
 after playing to the newcomer and putting my cakes in the oven and making the house and kitchen cheerful with great fires befitting christmas eve i prepared to sit down and amuse myself by singing carols all alone regardless of affirmations that he considered the merry tunes i chose as next door to songs he had retired to private prayer in his chamber and mr and mrs earnshaw were engaging attention by sundry gay trifles bought for her to present to the little lintons as an acknowledgment of their kindness they had invited them to spend the morrow at wuthering heights and the invitation had been accepted on one condition mrs linton begged that her darlings must be kept carefully apart from that naughty swearing boy 
 under these circumstances i remained solitary i smelt the rich scent of the heating spices and admired the shining kitchen utensils the polished clock decked in holly the silver mugs ranged on a tray ready to be filled with mulled ale for supper and above all the speckless purity of my particular scoured and floor i gave due inward applause to every object and then i remembered how old earnshaw used to come in when all was tidied and call me a cant lass and slip a shilling into my hand as a christmas box and from that i went on to think of his fondness for heathcliff and his dread lest he should suffer neglect after death had removed him and that naturally led me to consider the poor situation now and from singing i changed my mind to crying it struck me soon however there would be more sense in endeavouring to repair some of his wrongs than shedding tears over them i got up and walked into the court to seek him he was not far i found him smoothing the glossy coat of the new pony in the stable and feeding the other beasts according to custom 
 make haste heathcliff i said the kitchen is so comfortable and joseph is upstairs make haste and let me dress you smart before miss cathy comes out and then you can sit together with the whole hearth to yourselves and have a long chatter till bedtime 
 he proceeded with his task and never turned his head towards me 
 you coming i continued a little cake for each of you nearly enough and need half an donning 
 i waited five minutes but getting no answer left him catherine supped with her brother and joseph and i joined in an unsociable meal seasoned with reproofs on one side and sauciness on the other his cake and cheese remained on the table all night for the fairies he managed to continue work till nine and then marched dumb and dour to his chamber cathy sat up late having a world of things to order for the reception of her new friends she came into the kitchen once to speak to her old one but he was gone and she only stayed to ask what was the matter with him and then went back in the morning he rose early and as it was a holiday carried his ill humour on to the moors not reappearing till the family were departed for church fasting and reflection seemed to have brought him to a better spirit he hung about me for a while and having screwed up his courage exclaimed abruptly 
 nelly make me decent going to be good 
 high time heathcliff i said you have grieved catherine sorry she ever came home i dare say it looks as if you envied her because she is more thought of than you 
 the notion of envying catherine was incomprehensible to him but the notion of grieving her he understood clearly enough 
 did she say she was grieved he inquired looking very serious she cried when i told her you were off again this morning 
 well i cried last night he returned and i had more reason to cry than she 
 yes you had the reason of going to bed with a proud heart and an empty stomach said i proud people breed sad sorrows for themselves but if you be ashamed of your touchiness you must ask pardon mind when she comes in you must go up and offer to kiss her and know best what to say only do it heartily and not as if you thought her converted into a stranger by her grand dress and now though i have dinner to get ready steal time to arrange you so that edgar linton shall look quite a doll beside you and that he does you are younger and yet be bound you are taller and twice as broad across the shoulders you could knock him down in a twinkling you feel that you could 
 face brightened a moment then it was overcast afresh and he sighed 
 but nelly if i knocked him down twenty times that make him less handsome or me more so i wish i had light hair and a fair skin and was dressed and behaved as well and had a chance of being as rich as he will be 
 and cried for mamma at every turn i added and trembled if a country lad heaved his fist against you and sat at home all day for a shower of rain oh heathcliff you are showing a poor spirit come to the glass and let you see what you should wish do you mark those two lines between your eyes and those thick brows that instead of rising arched sink in the middle and that couple of black fiends so deeply buried who never open their windows boldly but lurk glinting under them like spies wish and learn to smooth away the surly wrinkles to raise your lids frankly and change the fiends to confident innocent angels suspecting and doubting nothing and always seeing friends where they are not sure of foes get the expression of a vicious cur that appears to know the kicks it gets are its desert and yet hates all the world as well as the kicker for what it suffers 
 in other words i must wish for edgar great blue eyes and even forehead he replied i that help me to them 
 a good heart will help you to a bonny face my lad i continued if you were a regular black and a bad one will turn the bonniest into something worse than ugly and now that done washing and combing and me whether you think yourself rather handsome tell you i do fit for a prince in disguise who knows but your father was emperor of china and your mother an indian queen each of them able to buy up with one income wuthering heights and thrushcross grange together and you were kidnapped by wicked sailors and brought to england were i in your place i would frame high notions of my birth and the thoughts of what i was should give me courage and dignity to support the oppressions of a little farmer 
 so i chattered on and heathcliff gradually lost his frown and began to look quite pleasant when all at once our conversation was interrupted by a rumbling sound moving up the road and entering the court he ran to the window and i to the door just in time to behold the two lintons descend from the family carriage smothered in cloaks and furs and the earnshaws dismount from their horses they often rode to church in winter catherine took a hand of each of the children and brought them into the house and set them before the fire which quickly put colour into their white faces 
 i urged my companion to hasten now and show his amiable humour and he willingly obeyed but ill luck would have it that as he opened the door leading from the kitchen on one side hindley opened it on the other they met and the master irritated at seeing him clean and cheerful or perhaps eager to keep his promise to mrs linton shoved him back with a sudden thrust and angrily bade joseph keep the fellow out of the him into the garret till dinner is over be cramming his fingers in the tarts and stealing the fruit if left alone with them a minute 
 nay sir i could not avoid answering touch nothing not he and i suppose he must have his share of the dainties as well as we 
 he shall have his share of my hand if i catch him downstairs again till dark cried hindley begone you vagabond what you are attempting the coxcomb are you wait till i get hold of those elegant if i pull them a bit longer 
 they are long enough already observed master linton peeping from the doorway i wonder they make his head ache like a mane over his eyes 
 he ventured his remark without any intention to insult but violent nature was not prepared to endure the appearance of impertinence from one whom he seemed to hate even then as a rival he seized a tureen of hot apple sauce the first thing that came under his gripe and dashed it full against the face and neck who instantly commenced a lament that brought isabella and catherine hurrying to the place mr earnshaw snatched up the culprit directly and conveyed him to his chamber where doubtless he administered a rough remedy to cool the fit of passion for he reappeared red and breathless i got the and rather spitefully scrubbed nose and mouth affirming it served him right for meddling his sister began weeping to go home and cathy stood by confounded blushing for all 
 you should not have spoken to him she expostulated with master linton he was in a bad temper and now spoilt your visit and be flogged i hate him to be flogged i eat my dinner why did you speak to him edgar 
 i sobbed the youth escaping from my hands and finishing the remainder of the purification with his cambric pocket handkerchief i promised mamma that i say one word to him and i 
 well cry replied catherine contemptuously not killed make more mischief my brother is coming be quiet give over isabella has anybody hurt you 
 there there your seats cried hindley bustling in that brute of a lad has warmed me nicely next time master edgar take the law into your own will give you an appetite 
 the little party recovered its equanimity at sight of the fragrant feast they were hungry after their ride and easily consoled since no real harm had befallen them mr earnshaw carved bountiful platefuls and the mistress made them merry with lively talk i waited behind her chair and was pained to behold catherine with dry eyes and an indifferent air commence cutting up the wing of a goose before her an unfeeling child i thought to myself how lightly she dismisses her old troubles i could not have imagined her to be so selfish she lifted a mouthful to her lips then she set it down again her cheeks flushed and the tears gushed over them she slipped her fork to the floor and hastily dived under the cloth to conceal her emotion i did not cal her unfeeling long for i perceived she was in purgatory through out the day and wearying to find an opportunity of getting by herself or paying a visit to heathcliff who had been locked up b the master as i discovered on endeavouring to introduce to him private mess of victuals 
 in the evening we had a dance cathy begged that he might b liberated then as isabella linton had no partner her entreaties were vain and i was appointed to supply the deficiency we got rid of all gloom in the excitement of the exercise and our pleasure was increased by the arrival of the gimmerton band mustering fifteen strong a trumpet a trombone clarionets bassoon french horns and a bass viol besides singers they go the rounds of all the respectable houses and receive contributions every christmas and we esteemed it a treat to hear them after the usual carols had been sung we set them to songs and glees mrs earnshaw loved the music and so they gave us plenty 
 catherine loved it too but she said it sounded sweetest at the top of the steps and she went up in the dark i followed they shut the house door below never noting our absence it was so full people she made no stay at the head but mounted farther to the garret where heathcliff was confined and called him i stubbornly declined answering for a while she persevered and finally persuaded him to hold communion with her through the boards i let the poor things converse unmolested till i supposed the songs were going to cease and the singers to get some refreshment then i clambered up the ladder to warn her instead of finding her outside i heard her voice within the little monkey had crept by the skylight of one garret along the roof into the skylight of the other and it was with the utmost difficulty i could coax her out again when she did come heathcliff came with her and she insisted that i should take him into the kitchen as my had gone to a to be removed from the sound of our psalmody as it pleased him to call it i told them i intended by no means to encourage their tricks but as the prisoner had never broken his fast since dinner i would wink at his cheating mr hindley that once he went down i set him a stool by the fire and offered him a quantity of good things but he was sick and could eat little and my attempts to entertain him were thrown away he leant his two elbows on his knees and his chin on his hands and remained wrapt in dumb meditation on my inquiring the subject of his thoughts he answered gravely 
 trying to settle how i shall pay hindley back i care how long i wait if i can only do it at last i hope he will not die before i do 
 for shame heathcliff said i it is for god to punish wicked people we should learn to forgive 
 no god have the satisfaction that i shall he returned i only wish i knew the best way let me alone and plan it out while thinking of that i feel pain 
 but mr lockwood i forget these tales cannot divert you annoyed how i should dream of chattering on at such a rate and your gruel cold and you nodding for bed i could have told heathcliffs history all that you need hear in half a dozen words 
 thus interrupting herself the housekeeper rose arid proceeded to lay aside her sewing but i felt incapable of moving from the hearth and i was very far from nodding sit still mrs dean i cried do sit still another done just right to tell the story leisurely that is the method i like and you must finish it in the same style i am interested in every character you have mentioned more or less 
 the clock is on the stroke of eleven sir 
 no not accustomed to go to bed in the long hours one or two is early enough for a person who lies till ten 
 you lie till ten the very prime of the morning gone long before that time a person who has not done one half his work by ten runs a chance of leaving the other half undone 
 nevertheless mrs dean resume your chair because to morrow i intend lengthening the night till afternoon i prognosticate for myself an obstinate cold at least 
 i hope not sir well you must allow me to leap over some three years during that space mrs earnshaw 
 no no allow nothing of the sort are you acquainted with the mood of mind in which if you were seated alone and the cat licking its kitten on the rug before you you would watch the operation so intently that neglect of one ear would put you seriously out of temper 
 a terribly lazy mood i should say 
 on the contrary a tiresomely active one it is mine at present and therefore continue minutely i perceive that people in these regions acquire over people in towns the value that the spider in a dungeon does over a spider in a cottage to their various occupants and yet the deepened attraction is not entirely owing to the situation of the they do live more in earnest more in themselves and less in surface change and frivolous external things i could fancy a love for life here almost possible and i was a fixed unbeliever in any love of a standing one state resembles setting a hungry man down to a single dish on which he may concentrate his entire appetite and do it justice the other introducing him to a table laid out by french cooks he can perhaps extract as much enjoyment from the whole but each part is a mere atom in his regard and remembrance 
 oh here we are the same as anywhere else when you get to know us observed mrs dean somewhat puzzled at my speech 
 excuse me i responded you my good friend are a striking evidence against that assertion excepting a few provincialisms of slight consequence you have no marks of the manners which i am habituated to consider as peculiar to your class i am sure you have thought a great deal more than the generality of servants think you have been compelled to cultivate your reflective faculties for want of occasions for frittering your life away in silly trifles 
 mrs dean laughed 
 i certainly esteem myself a steady reasonable kind of body she said not exactly from living among the hills and seeing one set of faces and one series of actions from end to end but i have undergone sharp discipline which has taught me wisdom and then i have read more than you would fancy mr lockwood you could not open a book in this library that i have not looked into and got something out of also unless it be that range of greek and latin and that of french and those i know one from another it is as much as you can expect of a poor daughter however if i am to follow my story in true fashion i had better go on and instead of leaping three years i will be content to pass to the next summer of that is nearly years ago

 chapter seven 
 
 that boy is a perfect cyclops he said amy one day as laurie clattered by on horseback with a flourish of his whip as he passed 
 how dare you say so when got both his eyes and very handsome ones they are too cried jo who resented any slighting remarks about her friend 
 i day anything about his eyes and i see why you need fire up when i admire his riding 
 oh my goodness that little goose means a centaur and she called him a cyclops exclaimed jo with a burst of laughter you be so rude only a lapse of lingy as mr davis says retorted amy finishing jo with her latin i just wish i had a little of the money laurie spends on that horse she added as if to herself yet hoping her sisters would hear 
 why asked meg kindly for jo had gone off in another laugh at second blunder 
 i need it so much dreadfully in debt and it be my turn to have the rag money for a month 
 in debt amy what do you mean and meg looked sober 
 why i owe at least a dozen pickled limes and i pay them you know till i have money for marmee forbade my having anything charged at the shop 
 tell me all about it are limes the fashion now it used to be pricking bits of rubber to make balls and meg tried to keep her countenance amy looked so grave and important 
 why you see the girls are always buying them and unless you want to be thought mean you must do it too nothing but limes now for everyone is sucking them in their desks in schooltime and trading them off for pencils bead rings paper dolls or something else at recess if one girl likes another she gives her a lime if mad with her she eats one before her face and offer even a suck they treat by turns and had ever so many but returned them and i ought for they are debts of honor you know 
 how much will pay them off and restore your credit asked meg taking out her purse 
 a quarter would more than do it and leave a few cents over for a treat for you you like limes 
 not much you may have my share the money make it last as long as you can for it very plenty you know 
 oh thank you it must be so nice to have pocket money have a grand feast for i tasted a lime this week i felt delicate about taking any as i return them and actually suffering for one 
 next day amy was rather late at school but could not resist the temptation of displaying with pardonable pride a moist parcel before she consigned it to the inmost recesses of her desk during the next few minutes the rumor that amy march had got twenty four delicious limes she ate one on the way and was going to treat circulated through her set and the attentions of her friends became quite overwhelming katy brown invited her to her next party on the spot mary kinglsey insisted on lending her her watch till recess and jenny snow a satirical young lady who had basely twitted amy upon her limeless state promptly buried the hatchet and offered to furnish answers to certain appalling sums but amy had not forgotten miss cutting remarks about some persons whose noses were not too flat to smell other limes and people who were not too proud to ask for them and she instantly crushed that snow hopes by the withering telegram you be so polite all of a sudden for you get any 
 a distinguished personage happened to visit the school that morning and beautifully drawn maps received praise which honor to her foe rankled in the soul of miss snow and caused miss march to assume the airs of a studious young peacock but alas alas pride goes before a fall and the revengeful snow turned the tables with disastrous success no sooner had the guest paid the usual stale compliments and bowed himself out than jenny under pretense of asking an important question informed mr davis the teacher that amy march had pickled limes in her desk 
 now mr davis had declared limes a contraband article and solemnly vowed to publicly ferrule the first person who was found breaking the law this man had succeeded in banishing chewing gum after a long and stormy war had made a bonfire of the confiscated novels and newspapers had suppressed a private post office had forbidden distortions of the face nicknames and caricatures and done all that one man could do to keep half a hundred rebellious girls in order boys are trying enough to human patience goodness knows but girls are infinitely more so especially to nervous gentlemen with tyrannical tempers and no more talent for teaching than dr blimber mr davis knew any quantity of greek latin algebra and ologies of all sorts so he was called a fine teacher and manners morals feelings and examples were not considered of any particular importance it was a most unfortunate moment for denouncing amy and jenny knew it mr davis had evidently taken his coffee too strong that morning there was an east wind which always affected his neuralgia and his pupils had not done him the credit which he felt he deserved therefore to use the expressive if not elegant language of a schoolgirl he was as nervous as a witch and as cross as a bear the word limes was like fire to powder his yellow face flushed and he rapped on his desk with an energy which made jenny skip to her seat with unusual rapidity 
 young ladies attention if you please 
 at the stern order the buzz ceased and fifty pairs of blue black gray and brown eyes were obediently fixed upon his awful countenance 
 miss march come to the desk 
 amy rose to comply with outward composure but a secret fear oppressed her for the limes weighed upon her conscience 
 bring with you the limes you have in your desk was the unexpected command which arrested her before she got out of her seat 
 take all whispered her neighbor a young lady of great presence of mind 
 amy hastily shook out half a dozen and laid the rest down before mr davis feeling that any man possessing a human heart would relent when that delicious perfume met his nose unfortunately mr davis particularly detested the odor of the fashionable pickle and disgust added to his wrath 
 is that all 
 not quite stammered amy 
 bring the rest immediately 
 with a despairing glance at her set she obeyed 
 you are sure there are no more 
 i never lie sir 
 so i see now take these disgusting things two by two and throw them out of the window 
 there was a simultaneous sigh which created quite a little gust as the last hope fled and the treat was ravished from their longing lips scarlet with shame and anger amy went to and fro six dreadful times and as each doomed couple looking oh so plump and juicy fell from her reluctant hands a shout from the street completed the anguish of the girls for it told them that their feast was being exulted over by the little irish children who were their sworn foes was too much all flashed indignant or appealing glances at the inexorable davis and one passionate lime lover burst into tears 
 as amy returned from her last trip mr davis gave a portentous hem and said in his most impressive manner 
 young ladies you remember what i said to you a week ago i am sorry this has happened but i never allow my rules to be infringed and i never break my word miss march hold out your hand 
 amy started and put both hands behind her turning on him an imploring look which pleaded for her better than the words she could not utter she was rather a favorite with old davis as of course he was called and my private belief that he would have broken his word if the indignation of one irrepressible young lady had not found vent in a hiss that hiss faint as it was irritated the irascible gentleman and sealed the fate 
 your hand miss march was the only answer her mute appeal received and too proud to cry or beseech amy set her teeth threw bach her head defiantly and bore without flinching several tingling blows on her little palm they were neither many nor heavy but that made no difference to her for the first time in her life she had been struck and the disgrace in her eyes was as deep as if he had knocked her down 
 you will now stand on the platform till recess said mr davis resolved to do the thing thoroughly since he had begun 
 that was dreadful it would have been bad enough to go to her seat and see the pitying faces of her friends or the satisfied ones of her few enemies but to face the whole school with that shame fresh upon her seemed impossible and for a second she felt as if she could only drop down where she stood and break her heart with crying a bitter sense of wrong and the thought of jenny snow helped her to bear it and taking the ignominious place she fixed her eyes on the stove funnel above what now seemed a sea of faces and stood there so motionless and white that the girls found it hard to study with that pathetic figure before them 
 during the fifteen minutes that followed the proud and sensitive little girl suffered a shame and pain which she never forgot to others it might seem a ludicrous or trivial affair but to her it was a hard experience for during the twelve years of her life she had been governed by love alone and a blow of that sort had never touched her before the smart of her hand and the ache of her heart were forgotten in the sting of the thought i shall have to tell at home and they will be so disappointed in me 
 the fifteen minutes seemed an hour but they came to an end at last and the word recess had never seemed so welcome to her before 
 you can go miss march said mr davis looking as he felt uncomfortable 
 he did not soon forget the reproachful glance amy gave him as she went without a word to anyone straight into the anteroom snatched her things and left the place forever as she passionately declared to herself she was in a sad state when she got home and when the older girls arrived some time later an indignation meeting was held at once mrs march did not say much but looked disturbed and comforted her afflicted little daughter in her tenderest manner meg bathed the insulted hand with glycerine and tears beth felt that even her beloved kittens would fail as a balm for griefs like this jo wrathfully proposed that mr davis be arrested without delay and hannah shook her fist at the villain and pounded potatoes for dinner as if she had him under her pestle 
 no notice was taken of flight except by her mates but the demoiselles discovered that mr davis was quite benignant in the afternoon also unusually nervous just before school closed jo appeared wearing a grim expression as she stalked up to the desk and delivered a letter from her mother then collected property and departed carefully scraping the mud from her boots on the door mat as if she shook that dust of the place off her feet 
 yes you can have a vacation from school but i want you to study a little every day with beth said mrs march that evening i approve of corporal punishment especially for girls i dislike mr manner of teaching and think the girls you associate with are doing you any good so i shall ask your advice before i send you anywhere else 
 good i wish all the girls would leave and spoil his old school perfectly maddening to think of those lovely limes sighed amy with the air of a martyr 
 i am not sorry you lost them for you broke the rules and deserved some punishment for disobedience was the severe reply which rather disappointed the young lady who expected nothing but sympathy 
 do you mean you are glad i was disgraced before the whole school cried amy 
 i should not have chosen that way of mending a fault replied her mother but not sure that it do you more good than a molder method you are getting to be rather conceited my dear and it is quite time you set about correcting it you have a good many little gifts and virtues but there is no need of parading them for conceit spoils the finest genius there is not much danger that real talent or goodness will be overlooked long even if it is the consciousness of possessing and using it well should satisfy one and the great charm of all power is modesty 
 so it is cried laurie who was playing chess in a corner with jo i knew a girl once who had a really remarkable talent for music and she know it never guessed what sweet little things she composed when she was alone and have believed it if anyone had told her 
 i wish known that nice girl maybe she would have helped me so stupid said beth who stood beside him listening eagerly 
 you do know her and she helps you better than anyone else could answered laurie looking at her with such mischievous meaning in his merry black eyes that beth suddenly turned very red and hid her face in the sofa cushion quite overcome by such an unexpected discovery 
 jo let laurie win the game to pay for that praise of her beth who could not be prevailed upon to play for them after her compliment so laurie did his best and sang delightfully being in a particularly lively humor for to the marches he seldom showed the moody side of his character when he was gone amy who had been pensive all evening said suddenly as if busy over some new idea is laurie an accomplished boy 
 yes he has had an excellent education and has much talent he will make a fine man if not spoiled by petting replied her mother 
 and he conceited is he asked amy 
 not in the least that is why he is so charming and we all like him so much i see nice to have accomplishments and be elegant but not to show off or get perked up said amy thoughtfully 
 these things are always seen and felt in a manner and conversations if modestly used but it is not necessary to display them said mrs march 
 any more than proper to wear all your bonnets and gowns and ribbons at once that folks may know got them added jo and the lecture ended in a laugh

 imhotep glides sideways with them like a tiger cornering his 
 prey the sand around him swirls and dances burns starts to 
 crawl away whimpering as he goes imhotep suddenly stops and 
 unhinges his skeletal jaw his skinless mouth stretches to an 
 inhuman size and he lets out a horrific primordial shriek 
 imhotep 
 
 evelyn screams shudders then embarrassed by his 
 fear he opens his own mouth and roars right back at him 
 
 ahhhhhhhh 
 then blasts him with the elephant gun blam through the 
 smoke and flammage we see imhotep blown off his feet his 
 ribcage half torn away grabs evelyn and runs

 turns around imhotep is right there beni screams backs 
 away and opens fire six gunshots perforate imhotep but have 
 no effect except to splatter molten flesh rot onto the back 
 wall beni retreats into a corner scared shitless imhotep 
 moves forward his one hand trying to stop the molten mummy 
 guts from oozing out of the large shotgun hole in his side 
 beni drops his gun and grabs at the chains around his neck 
 religious symbols and icons dangle from each chain beni 
 holds the first one up a christian crucifix he quickly 
 makes the sign cross and blesses himself in english 
 beni 
 may the good lord protect and watch 
 over me as a shepherd watches over 
 his flock and may satan in all his 
 forms be vanquished forever 
 it has no effect on imhotep who continues forward beni 
 quickly grabs at the other symbols and icons holding them 
 out towards imhotep one after the other trying to slow his 
 progress an islamic sword and crescent moon necklace a 
 hindu brahma medallion a small buddhist bodhisattva statue 
 all while blessing himself in arabic hindi chinese and 
 latin nothing works skeletal hand reaches for 
 throat tears run down cheeks so freaked 
 and when he holds up the star of david and blesses 
 himself in hebrew imhotep stops in his tracks his hand 
 lowers his grotesque new eyeballs stare at beni 
 imhotep subtitled 
 
 the language of the slaves 
 
 looks at him quizzically imhotep takes a step back 
 imhotep in hebrew subtitled 
 i may have use for you and 
 the rewards will be great 
 imhotep reaches into his tattered robe and then holds out 
 his fetid hand filled with squirming maggots beni cringes 
 about to throw up but then the maggots part revealing a 
 tiny pile of little jewels eyes widen imhotep raises 
 his other hand it holds broken canopic jar 
 imhotep subtitled 
 where are the other sacred jars 
 ext crevice night 
 several mumia drag burns up he stares out with vacant 
 sockets daniels and henderson are especially horrified 
 daniels

 the sounding of the call 
 
 
 when buck earned sixteen hundred dollars in five minutes for john thornton he made it possible for his master to pay off certain debts and to journey with his partners into the east after a fabled lost mine the history of which was as old as the history of the country many men had sought it few had found it and more than a few there were who had never returned from the quest this lost mine was steeped in tragedy and shrouded in mystery no one knew of the first man the oldest tradition stopped before it got back to him from the beginning there had been an ancient and ramshackle cabin dying men had sworn to it and to the mine the site of which it marked clinching their testimony with nuggets that were unlike any known grade of gold in the northland 
 but no living man had looted this treasure house and the dead were dead wherefore john thornton and pete and hans with buck and half a dozen other dogs faced into the east on an unknown trail to achieve where men and dogs as good as themselves had failed they sledded seventy miles up the yukon swung to the left into the stewart river passed the mayo and the mcquestion and held on until the stewart itself became a streamlet threading the upstanding peaks which marked the backbone of the continent 
 
 john thornton asked little of man or nature he was unafraid of the wild with a handful of salt and a rifle he could plunge into the wilderness and fare wherever he pleased and as long as he pleased being in no haste indian fashion he hunted his dinner in the course of the traveling and if he failed to find it like the indian he kept on traveling secure in the knowledge that sooner or later he would come to it so on this great journey into the east straight meat was the bill of fare ammunition and tools principally made up the load on the sled and the timecard was drawn upon the limitless future 
 to buck it was boundless delight this hunting fishing and indefinite wandering through strange places for weeks at a time they would hold on steadily day after day and for weeks upon end they would camp here and there the dogs loafing and the men burning holes through frozen muck and gravel and washing countless pans of dirt by the heat of the fire sometimes they went hungry sometimes they feasted riotously all according to the abundance of game and the fortune of hunting summer arrived and dogs and men packs on their backs rafted across blue mountain lakes and descended or ascended unknown rivers in slender boats whipsawed from the standing forest 
 the months came and went and back and forth they twisted through the uncharted vastness where no men were and yet where men had been if the lost cabin were true they went across divides in summer blizzards shivered under the midnight sun on naked mountains between the timber line and the eternal snows dropped into summer valleys amid swarming gnats and flies and in the shadows of glaciers picked strawberries and flowers as ripe and fair as any the southland could boast in the fall of the year they penetrated a weird lake country sad and silent where wild fowl had been but where then there was no life nor sign of the blowing of chill winds the forming of ice in sheltered places and the melancholy rippling of waves on lonely beaches 
 and through another winter they wandered on the obliterated trails of men who had gone before once they came upon a path blazed throughout the forest an ancient path and the lost cabin seemed very near but the path began nowhere and ended nowhere and remained a mystery as the man who made it and the reason he made it remained a mystery another time they chanced upon the wreckage of a hunting lodge and amid the shreds of rotted blankets john thornton found a flintlock he knew it for a hudson bay company gun of the young days in the northwest when such a gun was worth its weight in beaver skins packed flat and that was hint as to the man who in an early day had reared the lodge and left the gun among the blankets 
 spring came on once more and at the end of all their wandering they found not the lost cabin but a shallow placer in a broad valley where the gold showed like yellow butter across the bottom of the washing pan they sought no farther each day they worked earned them thousands of dollars in clean dust and nuggets and they worked every day the gold was sacked in moosehide bags fifty pounds to the bag and piled like so much firewood outside the lodge like giants they toiled days flashing on the heels of days like dreams as they heaped the treasure up 
 there was nothing for the dogs to do save the hauling of meat now and again that thornton killed and buck spent long hours musing by the fire the vision of the hairy man came to him more frequently now that there was little work to be done and often blinking by the fire buck wandered with him in that other world which he remembered 
 the salient thing of this other world seemed fear when he watched the hairy man sleeping by the fire head between his knees and hands clasped above buck saw that he slept restlessly with many starts and awakenings at which times he would peer fearfully into the darkness and fling more wood upon the fire did they walk by the beach of a sea where the hairy man gathered shellfish and ate them as he gathered it was with eyes that roved everywhere for hidden danger and with legs prepared to run like the wind at its first appearance through the forest they crept noiselessly buck at the hairy heels and they were alert and vigilant the pair of them ears twitching and moving and nostrils quivering for the man heard and smelled as keenly as buck the hairy man could spring up into the trees and travel ahead as fast as on the ground swinging by the arms from limb to limb sometimes a dozen feet apart letting go and catching never falling never missing his grip in fact he seemed as much at home among the trees as on the ground and buck had memories of nights of vigil spent beneath the trees wherein the hairy man roosted holding on tightly as he slept 
 and closely akin to the visions of the hairy man was the call still sounding in the depths of the forest it filled him with a great unrest and strange desires it caused him to feel a vague sweet gladness and he was aware of wild yearnings and stirrings for he knew not what sometimes he pursued the call into the forest looking for it as though it were a tangible thing barking softly or defiantly as the mood might dictate he would thrust his nose into the cool wood moss or into the black soil where long grasses grew and snort with joy at the fat earth smells or he would crouch for hours as if in concealment behind fungus covered trunks of fallen trees and to all that moved and sounded about him it might be lying thus that he hoped to surprise this call he could not understand but he did not know why he did these various things he was impelled to do them and did not reason about them at all 
 irresistible impulses seized him he would be lying in camp dozing lazily in the heat of the day when suddenly his head would lift and his ears cock up intent and listening and he would spring to his feet and dash away and on and on for hours through the forest aisles and across the open spaces where the niggerheads bunched he loved to run down dry watercourses and to creep and spy upon the bird life in the woods for a day at a time he would lie in the underbrush where he could watch the partridges drumming and strutting up and down but especially he loved to run in the dim twilight of the summer midnights listening to the subdued and sleepy murmurs of the forest reading signs and sounds as man may read a book and seeking for the mysterious something that waking or sleeping at all times for him to come 
 one night he sprang from sleep with a start nostrils quivering and scenting his mane bristling in recurrent waves from the forest came the call or one note of it for the call was distinct and definite as never howl like yet unlike any noise made by husky dog and he knew it in the old familiar way as a sound heard before he sprang through the sleeping camp and in swift silence dashed through the woods as he drew closer to the cry he went more slowly with caution in every movement till he came to an open place among the trees and looking out saw erect on haunches with nose pointed to the sky a long lean timber wolf 
 he had made no noise yet it ceased from its howling and tried to sense his presence buck stalked into the open body gathered compactly together tail straight and stiff feet falling with unwonted care every movement advertised commingled threatening and overture of friendliness it was the menacing truce that marks the meeting of wild beasts that prey but the wolf fled at sight of him he followed with wild leapings in a frenzy to overtake he ran him into a blind channel in the bed of the creek where a timber jam barred the way the wolf whirled about pivoting on his hind legs after the fashion of joe and of all cornered husky dogs snarling and bristling clipping his teeth together in a continuous and rapid succession of snaps 
 buck did not attack but circled him about and hedged him in with friendly advances the wolf was suspicious and afraid for buck made three of him in weight while his head barely reached shoulder watching his chance he darted away and the chase was resumed time and again he was cornered and the thing repeated though he was in poor condition or buck could not so easily have overtaken him he would run till head was even with his flank when he would whirl around at bay only to dash away again at the first opportunity 
 but in the end pertinacity was rewarded for the wolf finding that no harm was intended finally sniffed noses with him then they became friendly and played about in the nervous way with which fierce beasts belie their fierceness after some time of this the wolf started off at an easy lope in a manner that plainly showed he was going somewhere he made it clear to buck that he was to come and they ran side by side through the somber twilight straight up the creek bed into the gorge from which it issued and across the bleak divide where it took its rise 
 on the opposite slope of the watershed they came down into a level country where were great stretches of forest and many streams and through these great stretches they ran steadily hour after hour the sun rising higher and the day growing warmer buck was wildly glad he knew he was at last answering the call running by the side of his wood brother toward the place from where the call surely came old memories were coming upon him fast and he was stirring to them as of old he stirred to the realities of which they were the shadows he had done this thing before somewhere in that other and dimly remembered world and he was doing it again now running free in the open the unpacked earth underfoot the wide sky overhead 
 they stopped by a running stream to drink and stopping buck remembered john thornton he sat down the wolf started on toward the place from where the call surely came then returned to him sniffing noses and making actions as though to encourage him but buck turned about and started slowly on the back track for the better part of an hour the wild brother ran by his side whining softly then he sat down pointed his nose upward and howled it was a mournful howl and as buck held steadily on his way he heard it grow faint and fainter until it was lost in the distance 
 john thornton was eating dinner when buck dashed into camp and sprang upon him in a frenzy of affection overturning him scrambling upon him licking his face biting his the general as john thornton characterized it the while he shook buck back and forth and cursed him lovingly 
 for two days and nights buck never left camp never let thornton out of his sight he followed him about at his work watched him while he ate saw him into his blankets at night and out of them in the morning but after two days the call in the forest began to sound more imperiously than ever restlessness came back on him and he was haunted by recollections of the wild brother and of the smiling land beyond the divide and the run side by side through the wide forest stretches once again he took to wandering in the woods but the wild brother came no more and though he listened through long vigils the mournful howl was never raised 
 he began to sleep out at night staying away from camp for days at a time and once he crossed the divide at the head of the creek and went down into the land of timber and streams there he wandered for a week seeking vainly for fresh sign of the wild brother killing his meat as he traveled and traveling with the long easy lope that seems never to tire he fished for salmon in a broad stream that emptied somewhere into the sea and by this stream he killed a large black bear blinded by the mosquitoes while likewise fishing and raging through the forest helpless and terrible even so it was a hard fight and it aroused the last latent remnants of ferocity and two days later when he returned to his kill and found a dozen wolverines quarreling over the spoil he scattered them like chaff and those that fled left two behind who would quarrel no more 
 the became stronger than ever before he was a killer a thing that preyed living on the things that lived unaided alone by virtue of his own strength and prowess surviving triumphantly in a hostile environment where only the strong survived because of all this he became possessed of a great pride in himself which communicated itself like a contagion to his physical being it advertised itself in all his movements was apparent in the play of every muscle spoke plainly as speech in the way he carried himself and made his glorious furry coat if anything more glorious but for the stray brown on his muzzle and above his eyes and for the splash of white hair that ran midmost down his chest he might well have been mistaken for a gigantic wolf larger than the largest of the breed from his st bernard father he had inherited size and weight but it was his shepherd mother who had given shape to that size and weight his muzzle was the long wolf muzzle save that it was larger than the muzzle of any wolf and his head somewhat broader was the wolf head on a massive scale 
 his cunning was wolf cunning and wild cunning his intelligence shepherd intelligence and st bernard intelligence and all this plus an experience gained in the fiercest of schools made him as formidable a creature as any that roamed the wild a carnivorous animal living on a straight meat diet he was in full flower at the high tide of his life with vigor and virility when thornton passed a caressing hand along his back a snapping and crackling followed the hand each hair discharging its pent magnetism at the contact every part brain and body nerve tissue and fiber was keyed to the most exquisite pitch and between all the parts there was a perfect equilibrium or adjustment to sights and sounds and events which required action he responded with rapidity quickly as a husky dog could leap to defend from attack or to attack he could leap twice as quickly he saw the movement or heard sound and responded in less time than another dog required to compass the mere seeing or hearing he perceived and determined and responded in the same instant in point of fact the three actions of perceiving determining and responding were sequential but so infinitesimal were the intervals of time between them that they appeared simultaneous his muscles were surcharged with vitality and snapped into play sharply like steel springs life streamed through him in splendid flood glad and rampant until it seemed that it would burst him asunder in sheer ecstasy and put forth generously over the world 
 never was there such a dog said john thornton one day as the partners watched buck marching out of camp 
 when he was made the mold was broke said pete 
 py jingo i think so mineself hans affirmed 
 they saw him marching out of camp but they did not see the instant and terrible transformation which took place as soon as he was within the secrecy of the forest he no longer marched at once he became a thing of the wild stealing along softly a passing shadow that appeared and disappeared among the shadows he knew how to take advantage of every cover to crawl on his belly like a snake and like a snake to leap and strike he could take a ptarmigan from its nest kill a rabbit as it slept and snap in the little chipmunks fleeing a second too late for the trees fish in open pools were not too quick for him nor were beaver mending their dams too wary he killed to eat not from wantonness but he preferred to eat what he killed himself so a lurking humor ran through his deeds and it was his delight to steal upon the squirrels and when he all but had them to let them go chattering in mortal fear to the 
 as the fall of the year came on the moose appeared in greater abundance moving slowly down to meet the winter in the lower and less rigorous valleys buck had already dragged down a stray calf but he wished strongly for larger and more formidable quarry and he came upon it one day on the divide at the head of the creek a band of twenty moose had crossed over from the land of streams and timber and chief among them was a great bull he was in a savage temper and standing over six feet from the ground was as formidable an antagonist as even buck could desire back and forth the bull tossed his great palmated antlers branching to fourteen points and embracing seven feet with the tips his small eyes burned with a vicious and bitter light while he roared with fury at sight of buck 
 from the side just forward of the flank protruded a feathered which accounted for his savageness guided by that instinct which came from the old hunting days of the primordial world buck proceeded to cut the bull out from the herd it was no slight task he would bark and dance about in front of the bull just out of reach of the great antlers and of the terrible splay hoofs which could have stamped his life out with a single blow unable to turn his back on the fanged danger and go on the bull would be driven into paroxysms of rage at such moments he charged buck who retreated craftily luring him on by a simulated inability to escape but when he was thus separated from his fellows two or three of the younger bulls would charge back upon buck and enable the wounded bull to rejoin the herd 
 there is a patience of the tireless persistent as life holds motionless for endless hours the spider in its web the snake in its coils the panther in its ambuscade this patience belongs peculiarly to life when it hunts its living food and it belonged to buck as he clung to the flank of the herd retarding its march irritating the young bulls worrying the cows with their calves and driving the wounded bull mad with helpless rage for half a day this continued buck multiplied himself attacking from all sides enveloping the herd in a whirlwind of menace cutting out his victim as fast as it could rejoin its mates wearing out the patience of creatures preyed upon which is a lesser patience than that of creatures preying 
 as the day wore along and the sun dropped to its bed in the northwest the darkness had come back and the fall nights were six hours long the young bulls retraced their steps more and more reluctantly to the aid of their beset leader the winter was hurrying them on to the lower levels and it seemed they could never shake off this tireless creature that held them back besides it was not the life of the herd or of the young bulls that was threatened the life of only one member was demanded which was a remoter interest than their lives and in the end they were content to pay the toll 
 as twilight fell the old bull stood with lowered head watching his cows he had known the calves he had fathered the bulls he had they shambled on at a rapid pace through the fading light he could not follow for before his nose leaped the merciless fanged terror that would not let him go three hundred weight more than half a ton he weighed he had lived a long strong life full of fight and struggle and at the end he faced death at the teeth of a creature whose head did not reach beyond his great knuckled knees 
 from then on night and day buck never left his prey never gave it a rest never permitted it to browse the leaves of trees or the shoots of young birch and willow nor did he give the wounded bull opportunity to slake his burning thirst in the slender trickling streams they crossed often in desperation he burst into long stretches of flight at such time buck did not attempt to stay him but loped easily at his heels satisfied with the way the game was played lying down when the moose stood still attacking him fiercely when he strove to eat or drink 
 the great head drooped more and more under its tree of horns and the shambling trot grew weaker and weaker he took to standing for long periods with nose to the ground and dejected ears dropped limply and buck found more time in which to get water for himself and in which to rest at such moments panting with red lolling tongue and with eyes fixed upon the big bull it appeared to buck that a change was coming over the face of things he could feel a new stir in the land as the moose were coming into the land other kinds of life were coming in forest and stream and air seemed palpitant with their presence the news of it was borne in upon him not by sight or sound or smell but by some other and subtler sense he heard nothing saw nothing yet knew that the land was somehow different that through it strange things were afoot and ranging and he resolved to investigate after he had finished the business in hand 
 at last at the end of the fourth day he pulled the great moose down for a day and a night he remained by the kill eating and sleeping turn and turn about then rested refreshed and strong he turned his face toward camp and john thornton he broke into the long easy lope and went on hour after hour never at loss for the tangled way heading straight home through strange country with a certitude of direction that put man and his magnetic needle to shame 
 as he held on he became more and more conscious of the new stir in the land there was life abroad in it different from the life which had been there throughout the summer no longer was this fact borne in upon him in some subtle mysterious way the birds talked of it the squirrels chattered about it the very breeze whispered of it several times he stopped and drew in the fresh morning air in great sniffs reading a message which made him leap on with greater speed he was oppressed with a sense of calamity happening if it were not calamity already happened and as he crossed the last watershed and dropped down into the valley toward camp he proceeded with greater caution 
 three miles away he came upon a fresh trail that sent his neck hair rippling and bristling it led straight toward camp and john thornton buck hurried on swiftly and stealthily every nerve straining and tense alert to the multitudinous details which told a but the end his nose gave him a varying description of the passage of the life on the heels of which he was traveling he remarked the pregnant silence of the forest the bird life had flitted the squirrels were in hiding one only he sleek gray fellow flattened against a gray dead limb so that he seemed a part of it a woody excrescence upon the wood itself 
 as buck slid along with the obscureness of a gliding shadow his nose was jerked suddenly to the side as though a positive force had gripped and pulled it he followed the new scent into a thicket and found nig he was lying on his side dead where he had dragged himself an arrow protruding head and feathers from either side of his body 
 a hundred yards farther on buck came upon one of the sled dogs thornton had bought in dawson this dog was thrashing about in a directly on the trail and buck passed around him without stopping from the camp came the faint sound of many voices rising and falling in a chant bellying forward to the edge of the clearing he found hans lying on his face feathered with arrows like a porcupine at the same instant buck peered out where the lodge had been and saw what made his hair leap straight up on his neck and shoulders a gust of overpowering rage swept over him he did not know that he growled but he growled aloud with a terrible ferocity for the last time in his life he allowed passion to usurp cunning and reason and it was because of his great love for john thornton that he lost his head 
 the yeehats were dancing about the wreckage of the lodge when they heard a fearful roaring and saw rushing upon them an animal the like of which they had never seen before it was buck a live hurricane of fury hurling himself upon them in a frenzy to destroy he sprang at the foremost was the chief of the the throat wide open till the rent jugular spouted a fountain of blood he did not pause to worry the victim but ripped in passing with the next bound tearing wide the throat of a second man there was no withstanding him he plunged about in their very midst tearing rending destroying in constant and terrific motion which defied the arrows they discharged at him in fact so inconceivably rapid were his movements and so closely were the indians tangled together that they shot one another with the arrows and one young hunter hurling a spear at buck in drove it through the chest of another hunter with such force that the point broke through the skin of the back and stood out beyond then a panic seized the yeehats and they fled in terror to the woods proclaiming as they fled the advent of the evil spirit 
 and truly buck was the fiend incarnate raging at their heels and dragging them down like deer as they raced through the trees it was a fateful day for the yeehats they scattered far and wide over the country and it was not till a week later that the last of the survivors gathered together in a lower valley and counted their losses as for buck wearying of the pursuit he returned to the desolated camp he found pete where he had been killed in his blankets in the first moment of surprise desperate struggle was on the earth and buck scented every detail of it down to the edge of a deep pool by the edge head and fore feet in the water lay skeet faithful to the last the pool itself muddy and discolored from the sluice boxes effectually hid what it contained and it contained john thornton for buck followed his trace into the water from which no trace led away 
 all day buck brooded by the pool or roamed restlessly about the camp death as a cessation of movement as a passing out and away from the lives of the living he knew and he knew john thornton was dead it left a great void in him somewhat akin to hunger but a void which ached and ached and which food could not fill at times when he paused to contemplate the carcasses of the yeehats he forgot the pain of it and at such times he was aware of a great pride in pride greater than any he had yet experienced he had killed man the noblest game of all and he had killed in the face of the law of club and fang he sniffed the bodies curiously they had died so easily it was harder to kill a husky dog than them they were no match at all were it not for their arrows and spears and clubs thenceforward he would be unafraid of them except when they bore in their hands their arrows spears and clubs 
 night came on and a full moon rose high over the trees into the sky lighting the land till it lay bathed in ghostly day and with the coming of the night brooding and mourning by the pool buck came alive to a stirring of the new life in the forest other than that which the yeehats had made he stood up listening and scenting from far away drifted a faint sharp yelp followed by a chorus of similar sharp yelps as the moments passed the yelps grew closer and louder again buck knew them as things heard in that other world which persisted in his memory he walked to the center of the open space and listened it was the call the call sounding more luringly and compelling than ever before and as never before he was ready to obey john thornton was dead the last tie was broken man and the claims of man no longer bound him 
 hunting their living meat as the yeehats were hunting it on the flanks of the migrating moose the wolf pack had at last crossed over from the land of streams and timber and invaded valley into the clearing where the moonlight streamed they poured in a silvery flood and in the center of the clearing stood buck motionless as a statue waiting their coming they were awed so still and large he stood and a pause fell till the boldest one leaped straight for him like a flash buck struck breaking the neck then he stood without movement as before the stricken wolf rolling in agony behind him three others tried it in sharp succession and one after the other they drew back streaming blood from slashed throats or shoulders 
 this was sufficient to fling the whole pack forward pellmell crowded together blocked and confused by its eagerness to pull down the prey marvelous quickness and agility stood him in good stead pivoting on his hind legs and snapping and gashing he was everywhere at once presenting a front which was apparently unbroken so swiftly did he whirl and guard from side to side but to prevent them from getting behind him he was forced back down past the pool and into the creek bed till he brought up against a high gravel bank he worked along to a right angle in the bank which the men had made in the course of mining and in this angle he came to bay protected on three sides and with nothing to do but face the front 
 and so well did he face it that at the end of half an hour the wolves drew back discomfited the tongues of all were out and lolling the white fangs showing cruelly white in the moonlight some were lying down with heads raised and ears pricked forward others stood on their feet watching him and still others were lapping water from the pool one wolf long and lean and gray advanced cautiously in a friendly manner and buck recognized the wild brother with whom he had run for a night and a day he was whining softly and as buck whined they touched noses 
 then an old wolf gaunt and came forward buck writhed his lips into the preliminary of a snarl but sniffed noses with him whereupon the old wolf sat down pointed nose at the moon and broke out the long wolf howl the others sat down and howled and now the call came to buck in unmistakable accents he too sat down and howled this over he came out of his angle and the pack crowded around him sniffing in manner the leaders lifted the yelp of the pack and sprang away into the woods the wolves swung in behind yelping in chorus and buck ran with them side by side with the wild brother yelping as he ran 
 and here may well end the story of buck the years were not many when the yeehats noted a change in the breed of timber wolves for some were seen with splashes of brown on head and muzzle and with a rift of white centering down the chest but more remarkable than this the yeehats tell of a ghost dog that runs at the head of the pack they are afraid of this ghost dog for it has cunning greater than they stealing from their camps in the fierce winters robbing their traps slaying their dogs and defying their bravest hunters 
 nay the tale grows worse hunters there are who fail to return to the camp and hunters there have been whom their tribesmen found with throats slashed cruelly open and with wolf prints about them in the snow greater than the prints of any wolf each fall when the yeehats follow the movement of the moose there is a certain valley which they never enter and women there are who become sad when the word goes over the fire of how the evil spirit came to select that valley for an 
 in the summers there is one visitor however to that valley of which the yeehats do not know it is a great gloriously coated wolf like and yet unlike all other wolves he crosses alone from the smiling timber land and comes down into an open space among the trees here a yellow stream flows from rotted sacks and sinks into the ground with long grasses growing through it and vegetable mold overrunning it and hiding its yellow from the sun and here he muses for a time howling once long and mournfully ere he departs 
 but he is not always alone when the long winter nights come on and the wolves follow their meat into the lower valleys he may be seen running at the head of the pack through the pale moonlight or glimmering borealis leaping gigantic above his fellows his great throat as he sings a song of the younger world which is the song of the pack

lionfish nov chapter seven mudbloods and murmurscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry spent a lot of time over the next few days dodging out of sight whenever he saw gilderoy lockhart coming down a corridor harder to avoid was colin creevey who seemed to have memorized schedule nothing seemed to give colin a bigger thrill than to say all right harry six or seven times a day and hear hello colin back however exasperated harry sounded when he said it 
 
 hedwig was still angry with harry about the disastrous car journey and wand was still malfunctioning surpassing itself on friday morning by shooting out of hand in charms and hitting tiny old professor flitwick squarely between the eyes creating a large throbbing green boil where it had struck so with one thing and another harry was quite glad to reach the weekend he ron and hermione were planning to visit hagrid on saturday morning harry however was shaken awake several hours earlier than he would have liked by oliver wood captain of the gryffindor quidditch team 
 
 whassamatter said harry groggily 
 
 quidditch practice said wood come on 
 
 harry squinted at the window there was a thin mist hanging across the sky now that he was awake he understand how he could have slept through the racket the birds were making 
 
 oliver harry croaked the crack of dawn 
 
 exactly said wood he was a tall and burly sixth year and at the moment his eyes were gleaming with a crazed enthusiasm part of our new training program come on grab your broom and go said wood heartily none of the other teams have started training yet going to be first off the mark this year 
 
 yawning and shivering slightly harry climbed out of bed and tried to find his quidditch robes 
 
 good man said wood meet you on the field in fifteen minutes 
 
 when found his scarlet team robes and pulled on his cloak for warmth harry scribbled a note to ron explaining where gone and went down the spiral staircase to the common room his nimbus two thousand on his shoulder he had just reached the portrait hole when there was a clatter behind him and colin creevey came dashing down the spiral staircase his camera swinging madly around his neck and something clutched in his hand 
 
 i heard someone saying your name on the stairs harry look what got here had it developed i wanted to show you 
 
 harry looked bemusedly at the photograph colin was brandishing under his nose 
 
 a moving lockhart was tugging hard on an arm harry recognized as his own he was pleased to see that his photographic self was putting up a good fight and refusing to be dragged into view as harry watched lockhart gave up and slumped panting against the white edge of the picture 
 
 will you sign it said colin eagerly 
 
 no said harry flatly glancing around to check that the room was really deserted sorry colin in a hurry quidditch practice 
 
 he climbed through the portrait hole 
 
 oh wow wait for me never watched a quidditch game before 
 
 colin scrambled through the hole after him 
 
 be really boring harry said quickly but colin ignored him his face shining with excitement 
 
 you were the youngest house player in a hundred years you harry you said colin trotting alongside him you must be brilliant never flown is it easy is that your own broom is that the best one there is 
 
 harry know how to get rid of him it was like having an extremely talkative shadow 
 
 i really understand quidditch said colin breathlessly is it true there are four balls and two of them fly around trying to knock people off their brooms 
 
 yes said harry heavily resigned to explaining the complicated rules of quidditch called bludgers there are two beaters on each team who carry clubs to beat the bludgers away from their side fred and george weasley are the gryffindor beaters 
 
 and what are the other balls for colin asked tripping down a couple of steps because he was gazing at harry 
 
 well the quaffle the biggish red one is the one that scores goals three chasers on each team throw the quaffle to each other and try and get it through the goal posts at the end of the pitch three long poles with hoops on the end 
 
 and the fourth ball 
 
 is the golden snitch said harry and very small very fast and difficult to catch but what the got to do because a game of quidditch end until the snitch has been caught and whichever seeker gets the snitch earns his team an extra hundred and fifty points 
 
 and the gryffindor seeker you said colin in awe 
 
 yes said harry as they left the castle and started across the grass and the keeper too he guards the goal posts it really 
 
 but colin stop questioning harry all the way down the sloping lawns to the quidditch field and harry only shook him off when he reached the changing rooms colin called after him in a piping voice go and get a good seat harry and hurried off to the stands 
 
 the rest of the gryffindor team were already in the changing room wood was the only person who looked truly awake fred and george weasley were sitting and touslehaired next to fourth year alicia spinnet who seemed to be nodding off against the wall behind her her fellow chasers katie bell and angelina johnson were yawning side by side opposite them 
 
 there you are harry what kept you said wood briskly now i wanted a quick talk with you all before we actually get onto the field because i spent the summer devising a whole new training program which i really think will make all the difference 
 
 wood was holding up a large diagram of a quidditch field on which were drawn many lines arrows and crosses in different colored inks he took out his wand tapped the board and the arrows began to wiggle over the diagram like caterpillars as wood launched into a speech about his new tactics fred head drooped right onto alicia shoulder and he began to snore 
 
 the first board took nearly twenty minutes to explain but there was another board under that and a third under that one harry sank into a stupor as wood droned on and on 
 
 so said wood at long last jerking harry from a wistful fantasy about what he could be eating for breakfast at this very moment up at the castle is that clear any questions 
 
 got a question oliver said george who had woken with a start why you have told us all this yesterday when we were awake 
 
 wood pleased 
 
 now listen here you lot he said glowering at them all we should have won the quidditch cup last year easily the best team but unfortunately owing to circumstances beyond our control 
 
 harry shifted guiltily in his seat he had been unconscious in the hospital wing for the final match of the previous year meaning that gryffindor had been a player short and had suffered their worst defeat in three hundred years 
 
 wood took a moment to regain control of himself their last defeat was clearly still torturing him 
 
 so this year we train harder than ever before okay go and put our new theories into practice wood shouted seizing his broomstick and leading the way out of the locker rooms and still yawning his team followed 
 
 they had been in the locker room so long that the sun was up completely now although remnants of mist hung over the grass in the stadium as harry walked onto the field he saw ron and hermione sitting in the stands 
 
 you finished yet called ron incredulously 
 
 even started said harry looking jealously at the toast and marmalade ron and hermione had brought out of the great hall been teaching us new moves 
 
 he mounted his broomstick and kicked at the ground soaring up into the air the cool morning air whipped his face waking him far more effectively than long talk it felt wonderful to be back on the quidditch field he soared right around the stadium at full speed racing fred and george 
 
 that funny clicking noise called fred as they hurtled around the corner 
 
 harry looked into the stands colin was sitting in one of the highest seats his camera raised taking picture after picture the sound strangely magnified in the deserted stadium 
 
 look this way harry this way he cried shrilly 
 
 that said fred 
 
 no idea harry lied putting on a spurt of speed that took him as far away as possible from colin 
 
 going on said wood frowning as he skimmed through the air toward them that first year taking pictures i like it he could be a slytherin spy trying to find out about our new training program 
 
 in gryffindor said harry quickly 
 
 and the slytherins need a spy oliver said george 
 
 what makes you say that said wood testily 
 
 because here in person said george pointing 
 
 several people in green robes were walking onto the field broomsticks in their hands 
 
 i believe it wood hissed in outrage i booked the field for today see about this 
 
 wood shot toward the ground landing rather harder than he meant to in his anger staggering slightly as he dismounted harry fred and george followed 
 
 flint wood bellowed at the slytherin captain this is our practice time we got up specially you can clear off now 
 
 marcus flint was even larger than wood he had a look of trollish cunning on his face as he replied plenty of room for all of us wood 
 
 angelina alicia and katie had come over too there were no girls on the slytherin team who stood shoulder to shoulder facing the gryffindors leering to a man 
 
 but i booked the field said wood positively spitting with rage i booked it 
 
 ah said flint but got a specially signed note here from professor snape i professor s snape give the slytherin team permission to practice today on the quidditch field owing to the need to train their new seeker 
 
 got a new seeker said wood distracted where 
 
 and from behind the six large figures before them came a seventh smaller boy smirking all over his pale pointed face it was draco malfoy 
 
 you lucius son said fred looking at malfoy with dislike 
 
 funny you should mention father said flint as the whole slytherin team smiled still more broadly let me show you the generous gift made to the slytherin team 
 
 all seven of them held out their broomsticks seven highly polished handles and seven sets of fine gold lettering spelling the words nimbus two thousand and one gleamed under the in the early morning sun 
 
 very latest model only came out last month said flint carelessly flicking a speck of dust from the end of his own i believe it outstrips the old two thousand series by a considerable amount as for the old cleansweeps he smiled nastily at fred and george who were both clutching cleansweep fives sweeps the board with them 
 
 none of the gryffindor team could think of anything to say for a moment malfoy was smirking so broadly his cold eyes were reduced to slits 
 
 oh look said flint a field invasion 
 
 ron and hermione were crossing the grass to see what was going on 
 
 happening ron asked harry why you playing and he doing here 
 
 he was looking at malfoy taking in his slytherin quidditch robes 
 
 the new slytherin seeker weasley said malfoy smugly just been admiring the brooms my bought our team 
 
 ron gaped at the seven superb broomsticks in front of him 
 
 good they said malfoy smoothly but perhaps the gryffindor team will be able to raise some gold and get new brooms too you could raffle off those cleansweep fives i expect a museum would bid for them 
 
 the slytherin team howled with laughter 
 
 at least no one on the gryffindor team had to buy their way in said hermione sharply they got in on pure talent 
 
 the smug look on face flickered 
 
 no one asked your opinion you filthy little mudblood he spat 
 
 harry knew at once that malfoy had said something really bad because there was an instant uproar at his words flint had to dive in front of malfoy to stop fred and george jumping on him alicia shrieked how dare you and ron plunged his hand into his robes pulled out his wand yelling pay for that one malfoy and pointed it furiously under arm at malfoys face 
 
 a loud bang echoed around the stadium and a jet of green light shot out of the wrong end of wand hitting him in the stomach and sending him reeling backward onto the grass 
 
 ron ron are you all right squealed hermione 
 
 ron opened his mouth to speak but no words came out instead he gave an almighty belch and several slugs dribbled out of his mouth onto his lap 
 
 the slytherin team were paralyzed with laughter flint was doubled up hanging onto his new broomstick for support malfoy was on all fours banging the ground with his fist the gryffindors were gathered around ron who kept belching large glistening slugs nobody seemed to want to touch him 
 
 better get him to nearest said harry to hermione who nodded bravely and the pair of them pulled ron up by the arms 
 
 what happened harry what happened is he ill but you can cure him you colin had run down from his seat and was now dancing alongside them as they left the field ron gave a huge heave and more slugs dribbled down his front 
 
 oooh said colin fascinated and raising his camera can you hold him still harry 
 
 get out of the way colin said harry angrily he and hermione supported ron out of the stadium and across the grounds toward the edge of the forest 
 
 nearly there ron said hermione as the cabin came into view be all right in a minute almost there 
 
 they were within twenty feet of house when the front door opened but it hagrid who emerged gilderoy lockhart wearing robes of palest mauve today came striding out 
 
 quick behind here harry hissed dragging ron behind a nearby bush hermione followed somewhat reluctantly 
 
 a simple matter if you know what doing lockhart was saying loudly to hagrid if you need help you know where i am let you have a copy of my book surprised you already got one sign one tonight and send it over well and he strode away toward the castle 
 
 harry waited until lockhart was out of sight then pulled ron out of the bush and up to front door they knocked urgently 
 
 hagrid appeared at once looking very grumpy but his expression brightened when he saw who it was 
 
 bin come ter see me come in come in thought you mighta bin professor lockhart back again 
 
 harry and hermione supported ron over the threshold into the cabin which had an enormous bed in one corner a fire crackling merrily in the other hagrid seem perturbed by slug problem which harry hastily explained as he lowered ron into a chair 
 
 better out than in he said cheerfully plunking a large copper basin in front of him get em all up ron 
 
 i think anything to do except wait for it to stop said hermione anxiously watching ron bend over the basin a difficult curse to work at the best of times but with a broken wand 
 
 hagrid was bustling around making them tea his boarhound fang was slobbering over harry 
 
 what did lockhart want with you hagrid harry asked scratching ears 
 
 advice on out of a well growled hagrid moving a rooster off his scrubbed table and setting down the teapot like i about some banshee he banished if one word of it was true eat my kettle 
 
 it was most unlike hagrid to criticize a and harry looked at him in surprise hermione however said in a voice somewhat higher than usual i think being a bit unfair professor dumbledore obviously thought he was the best man for the job 
 
 he was the man for the job said hagrid offering them a plate of treacle fudge while ron coughed squelchily into his basin mean the one difficult ter find anyone fer the dark arts job people too keen ter take it on see think jinxed no lasted long fer a while now so tell me said hagrid jerking his head at ron who was he curse 
 
 malfoy called hermione something it been really bad because everyone went wild 
 
 it was bad said ron hoarsely emerging over the tabletop looking pale and sweaty malfoy called her 
 
 ron dived out of sight again as a fresh wave of slugs made their appearance hagrid looked outraged 
 
 he didn he growled at hermione 
 
 he did she said but i know what it means i could tell it was really rude of course 
 
 about the most insulting thing he could think of gasped ron coming back up a really foul name for someone who is you know parents there are some wizards like family who think better than everyone else because what people call he gave a small burp and a single slug fell into his outstretched hand he threw it into the basin and continued i mean the rest of us know it make any difference at all look at neville longbottom and he can hardly stand a cauldron the right way up 
 
 invented a spell our hermione said hagrid proudly making hermione go a brilliant shade of magenta 
 
 a disgusting thing to call someone said ron wiping his sweaty brow with a shaking hand dirty blood see common blood ridiculous most wizards these days are anyway if we married muggles died out 
 
 he retched and ducked out of sight again 
 
 well i yeh fer curse him ron said hagrid loudly over the thuds of more slugs hitting the basin it was a good thing yer wand backfired spect lucius malfoy come ter school if cursed his son least yer not in trouble 
 
 harry would have pointed out that trouble come much worse than having slugs pouring out of your mouth but he treacle fudge had cemented his jaws together 
 
 harry said hagrid abruptly as though struck by a sudden thought gotta bone ter pick with yeh heard bin signed photos how come i got one 
 
 furious harry wrenched his teeth apart 
 
 i have not been giving out signed photos he said hotly if still spreading that around 
 
 but then he saw that hagrid was laughing 
 
 jokin he said patting harry genially on the back and sending him face first into the table i knew yeh really i told lockhart yeh teh yer more famous than him without tryin 
 
 bet he like that said harry sitting up and rubbing his chin 
 
 he did said hagrid his eyes twinkling i told him never read one books decided ter go treacle fudge ron he added as ron reappeared 
 
 no thanks said ron weakly better not risk it 
 
 come what bin growin said hagrid as harry and hermione finished the last of their tea 
 
 in the small vegetable patch behind house were a dozen of the largest pumpkins harry had ever seen each was the size of a large boulder 
 
 well they said hagrid happily fer the halloween feast should be big enough by then 
 
 you been feeding them said harry 
 
 hagrid looked over his shoulder to check that they were alone 
 
 well bin you know a bit 
 
 harry noticed flowery pink umbrella leaning against the back wall of the cabin harry had had reason to believe before now that this umbrella was not all it looked in fact he had the strong impression that old school wand was concealed inside it hagrid supposed to use magic he had been expelled from hogwarts in his third year but harry had never found out why any mention of the matter and hagrid would clear his throat loudly and become mysteriously deaf until the subject was changed 
 
 an engorgement charm i suppose said hermione halfway between disapproval and amusement well done a good job on them 
 
 what yer little sister said said hagrid nodding at ron met her hagrid looked sideways at harry his beard twitching said she was the grounds but i reckon she was might run inter someone else at my house he winked at harry if yeh ask me she no ter a signed 
 
 oh shut up said harry ron snorted with laughter and the ground was sprayed with slugs 
 
 watch it hagrid roared pulling ron away from his precious pumpkins 
 
 it was nearly lunchtime and as harry had only had one bit of treacle fudge since dawn he was keen to go back to school to eat they said to hagrid and walked back up to the castle ron hiccoughing occasionally but only bringing up two very small slugs 
 
 they had barely set foot in the cool entrance hall when a voice rang out there you are potter weasley professor mcgonagall was walking toward them looking stern you will both do your detentions this evening 
 
 we doing professor said ron nervously suppressing a burp 
 
 you will be polishing the silver in the trophy room with mr filch said professor mcgonagall and no magic weasley elbow grease 
 
 ron gulped argus filch the caretaker was loathed by every student in the school 
 
 and you potter will be helping professor lockhart answer his fan mail said professor mcgonagall 
 
 oh n professor i go and do the trophy room too said harry desperately 
 
 certainly not said professor mcgonagall raising her eyebrows professor lockhart requested you particularly eight sharp both of you 
 
 harry and ron slouched into the great hall in states of deepest gloom hermione behind them wearing a sort of expression harry enjoy his pie as much as thought both he and ron felt got the worse deal 
 
 have me there all night said ron heavily no magic there must be about a hundred cups in that room no good at muggle cleaning 
 
 swap anytime said harry hollowly had loads of practice with the dursleys answering fan mail be a nightmare 
 
 saturday afternoon seemed to melt away and in what seemed like no time it was five minutes to eight and harry was dragging his feet along the corridor to office he gritted his teeth and knocked 
 
 the door flew open at once lockhart beamed down at him 
 
 ah the scalawag he said come in harry come in 
 
 shining brightly on the walls by the light of many candles were countless framed photographs of lockhart he had even signed a few of them another large pile lay on his desk 
 
 you can address the envelopes lockhart told harry as though this was a huge treat 
 
 this first to gladys gudgeon bless her huge fan of mine 
 
 the minutes snailed by harry let voice wash over him occasionally saying mmm and right and yeah now and then he caught a phrase like a fickle friend harry or celebrity is as celebrity does remember that 
 
 the candles burned lower and lower making the light dance over the many moving faces of lockhart watching him harry moved his aching hand over what felt like the thousandth envelope writing out veronica address it must be nearly time to leave harry thought miserably please let it be nearly time 
 
 and then he heard something something quite apart from the spitting of the dying candles and prattle about his fans 
 
 it was a voice a voice to chill the bone marrow a voice of breathtaking venom 
 
 come come to me let me rip you let me tear you let me kill you 
 
 harry gave a huge jump and a large lilac blot appeared on veronica street 
 
 what he said loudly 
 
 i know said lockhart six solid months at the top of the list broke all records 
 
 no said harry frantically that voice 
 
 sorry said lockhart looking puzzled what voice 
 
 that that voice that said you hear it 
 
 lockhart was looking at harry in high astonishment 
 
 what are you talking about harry perhaps getting a little drowsy great scott look at the time been here nearly four hours never have believed it the flown it 
 
 harry answer he was straining his ears to hear the voice again but there was no sound now except for lockhart telling him he expect a treat like this every time he got detention feeling dazed harry left 
 
 it was so late that the gryffindor common room was almost empty harry went straight up to the dormitory ron back yet harry pulled on his pajamas got into bed and waited half an hour later ron arrived nursing his right arm and bringing a strong smell of polish into the darkened room 
 
 my muscles have all seized up he groaned sinking on his bed fourteen times he made me buff up that quidditch cup before he was satisfied and then i had another slug attack all over a special award for services to the school took ages to get the slime off how was it with lockhart 
 
 keeping his voice low so as not to wake neville dean and seamus harry told ron exactly what he had heard 
 
 and lockhart said he hear it said ron harry could see him frowning in the moonlight think he was lying but i get it even someone invisible had to open the door 
 
 i know said harry lying back in his and staring at the canopy above him i get it either 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the chamber of secrets 
 

lionfish nov chapter seven the boggart in the wardrobecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 malfoy reappear in classes until late on thursday morning when the slytherins and gryffindors were halfway through double potions he swaggered into the dungeon his right arm covered in bandages and bound up in a sling acting in opinion as though he were the heroic survivor of some dreadful battle 
 
 how is it draco simpered pansy parkinson does it hurt much 
 
 yeah said malfoy putting on a brave sort of grimace but harry saw him wink at crabbe and goyle when pansy had looked away 
 
 settle down settle down said professor snape idly 
 
 harry and ron scowled at each other snape have said settle down if walked in late have given them detention but malfoy had always been able to get away with anything in classes snape was head of slytherin house and generally favored his own students above all others 
 
 they were making a new potion today a shrinking solution malfoy set up his cauldron right next to harry and ron so that they were preparing their ingredients on the same table 
 
 sir malfoy called sir need help cutting up these daisy roots because of my arm 
 
 weasley cut up roots for him said snape without looking up 
 
 ron went brick red 
 
 nothing wrong with your arm he hissed at malfoy 
 
 malfoy smirked across the table 
 
 weasley you heard professor snape cut up these roots 
 
 ron seized his knife pulled roots toward him and began to chop them roughly so that they were all different sizes 
 
 professor drawled malfoy mutilating my roots sir 
 
 snape approached their table stared down his hooked nose at the roots then gave ron an unpleasant smile from beneath his long greasy black hair 
 
 change roots with malfoy weasley 
 
 but sir 
 
 ron had spent the last quarter of an hour carefully shredding his own roots into exactly equal pieces 
 
 now said snape in his most dangerous voice 
 
 ron shoved his own beautifully cut roots across the table at malfoy then took up the knife again 
 
 and sir need this shrivelfig skinned said malfoy his voice full of malicious laughter 
 
 potter you can skin shrivelfig said snape giving harry the look of loathing he always reserved just for him 
 
 harry took shrivelfig as ron began trying to repair the damage to the roots he now had to use harry skinned the shrivelfig as fast as he could and flung it back across the table at malfoy without speaking malfoy was smirking more broadly than ever 
 
 seen your pal hagrid lately he asked them quietly 
 
 none of your business said ron jerkily without looking up 
 
 afraid he be a teacher much longer said malfoy in a tone of mock sorrow not very happy about my injury 
 
 keep talking malfoy and give you a real injury snarled ron 
 
 c complained to the school governors and to the ministry of magic got a lot of influence you know and a lasting injury like this he gave a huge fake sigh who knows if my ever be the same again 
 
 so why putting it on said harry accidentally beheading a dead caterpillar because his hand was shaking in anger to try to get hagrid fired 
 
 well said malfoy lowering his voice to a whisper partly potter but there are other benefits too weasley slice my caterpillars for me 
 
 a few cauldrons away neville was in trouble neville regularly went to pieces in potions lessons it was his worst subject and his great fear of professor snape made things ten times worse his potion which was supposed to be a bright acid green had turned 
 
 orange longbottom said snape ladling some up and allowing to splash back into the cauldron so that everyone could see 
 
 orange tell me boy does anything penetrate that thick skull of yours you hear me say quite clearly that only one cat spleen was needed i state plainly that a dash of leech juice would suffice what do i have to do to make you understand longbottom 
 
 neville was pink and trembling he looked as though he was on the verge of tears 
 
 please sir said hermione please i could help neville put it right 
 
 i remember asking you to show off miss granger said snape coldly and hermione went as pink as neville longbottom at the end of this lesson we will feed a few drops of this potion to your toad and see what happens perhaps that will encourage you to do it properly 
 
 snape moved away leaving neville breathless with fear 
 
 help me he moaned to hermione 
 
 hey harry said seamus finnigan leaning over to borrow brass scales have you heard daily prophet this morning they reckon sirius been sighted 
 
 where said harry and ron quickly on the other side of the table malfoy looked up listening closely 
 
 not too far from here said seamus who looked excited it was a muggle who saw him course she really understand the muggles think just an ordinary criminal they so she phoned the telephone hot line by the time the ministry of magic got there he was gone 
 
 not too far from here ron repeated looking significantly at harry he turned around and saw malfoy watching closely what malfoy need something else skinned 
 
 but eyes were shining malevolently and they were fixed harry he leaned across the table 
 
 thinking of trying to catch black potter 
 
 yeah right said harry offhandedly 
 
 thin mouth was curving in a mean smile 
 
 of course if it was me he said quietly have done something before now i be staying in school like a good boy be out there looking for him 
 
 what are you talking about malfoy said ron roughly 
 
 you know potter breathed malfoy his pale eyes narrowed 
 
 know what 
 
 malfoy let out a low sneering laugh 
 
 maybe rather not risk your neck he said want to leave it to the dementors do you but if it was me want revenge hunt him down myself 
 
 what are you talking about said harry angrily but at that moment snape called you should have finished adding your ingredients by now this potion needs to stew before it can be drunk so clear away while it simmers and then test 
 
 crabbe and goyle laughed openly watching neville sweat as he stirred his potion feverishly hermione was muttering instructions to him out of the corner of her mouth so that snape see harry and ron packed away their unused ingredients and went to wash their hands and ladles in the stone basin in the corner 
 
 what did malfoy mean harry muttered to ron as he stuck his hands under the icy jet that poured from the mouth why would i want revenge on black he done anything to me yet 
 
 making it up said ron savagely trying to make you do something stupid 
 
 the end of the lesson in sight snape strode over to neville who was cowering by his cauldron 
 
 everyone gather round said snape his black eyes glittering and watch what happens to toad if he has managed to produce a shrinking solution it will shrink to a tadpole if as i doubt he has done it wrong his toad is likely to be poisoned 
 
 the gryffindors watched fearfully the slytherins looked excited snape picked up trevor the toad in his left hand and dipped a small spoon into potion which was now green he trickled a few drops down throat 
 
 there was a moment of hushed silence in which trevor gulped then there was a small pop and trevor the tadpole was wriggling in palm 
 
 the gryffindors burst into applause snape looking sour pulled a small bottle from the pocket of his robe poured a few drops on top of trevor and he reappeared suddenly fully grown 
 
 five points from gryffindor said snape which wiped the smiles from every face i told you not to help him miss granger class dismissed 
 
 harry ron and hermione climbed the steps to the entrance hall harry was still thinking about what malfoy had said while ron was seething about snape 
 
 five points from gryffindor because the potion was all right why you lie hermione you said neville did it all by himself 
 
 hermione answer ron looked around 
 
 where is she 
 
 harry turned too they were at the top of the steps now watching the rest of the class pass them heading for the great hall and lunch 
 
 she was right behind us said ron frowning 
 
 malfoy passed them walking between crabbe and goyle he smirked at harry and disappeared 
 
 there she is said harry 
 
 hermione was panting slightly hurrying up the stairs one hand clutched her bag the other seemed to be tucking something down the front of her robes 
 
 how did you do that said ron 
 
 what said hermione joining them 
 
 one minute you were right behind us the next moment you were back at the bottom of the stairs again 
 
 what hermione looked slightly confused oh i had to go back for something oh no 
 
 a seam had split on bag harry surprised he could see that it was crammed with at least a dozen large and heavy books 
 
 why are you carrying all these around with you ron asked her 
 
 you know how many subjects taking said hermione breathlessly hold these for me could you 
 
 but ron was turning over the books she had handed him looking at the covers you got any of these subjects today only defense against the dark arts this afternoon 
 
 oh yes said hermione vaguely but she packed all the books back into her bag just the same i hope something good for lunch starving she added and she marched off toward the great hall 
 
 get the feeling not telling us something ron asked harry 
 
 
 
 professor lupin there when they arrived at his first defense against the dark arts lesson they all sat down took out their books quills and parchment and were talking when he finally entered the room lupin smiled vaguely and placed his tatty old briefcase on the desk he was as shabby as ever but looked healthier than he had on the train as though he had had a few square meals 
 
 good afternoon he said would you please put all your books back in your bags will be a practical lesson you will need only your wands 
 
 a few curious looks were exchanged as the class put away their books they had never had a practical defense against the dark arts class before unless you counted the memorable class last year when their old teacher had brought a cageful of pixies to class and set them loose 
 
 right then said professor lupin when everyone was ready if follow me 
 
 puzzled but interested the class got to its feet and followed professor lupin out of the classroom he led them along the deserted corridor and around a corner where the first thing they saw was peeves the poltergeist who was floating upside down in midair and stuffing the nearest keyhole with chewing gum 
 
 peeves look up until professor lupin was two feet away then he wiggled his feet and broke into song 
 
 loony loopy lupin peeves sang loony loopy lupin loony loopy lupin 
 
 rude and unmanageable as he almost always was peeves usually showed some respect toward the teachers everyone looked quickly at professor lupin to see how he would take this to their surprise he was still smiling 
 
 take that gum out of the keyhole if i were you peeves he said pleasantly mr filch be able to get in to his brooms 
 
 filch was the hogwarts caretaker a failed wizard who waged a constant war against the students and indeed peeves however peeves paid no attention to professor words except to blow a loud wet raspberry 
 
 professor lupin gave a small sigh and took out his wand 
 
 this is a useful little spell he told the class over his shoulder please watch closely 
 
 he raised the wand to shoulder height said waddiwasi and pointed it at peeves 
 
 with the force of a bullet the wad of chewing gum shot out of the keyhole and straight down left nostril he whirled upright and zoomed away cursing 
 
 cool sir said dean thomas in amazement 
 
 thank you dean said professor lupin putting his wand away again shall we proceed 
 
 they set off again the class looking at shabby professor lupin with increased respect he led them down a second corridor and stopped right outside the staffroom door 
 
 inside please said professor lupin opening it and standing back 
 
 the staffroom a long paneled room full of old mismatched chairs was empty except for one teacher professor snape was sitting in a low armchair and he looked around as the class filed in his eyes were glittering and there was a nasty sneer playing around his mouth as professor lupin came in and made to close the door behind him snape said leave it open lupin rather not witness this he got to his feet and strode past the class his black robes billowing behind him at the doorway he turned on his heel and said possibly no warned you lupin but this class contains neville longbottom i would advise you not to entrust him with anything difficult not unless miss granger is hissing instructions in his ear 
 
 neville went scarlet harry glared at snape it was bad enough that he bullied neville in his own classes let alone doing it in front of other teachers 
 
 professor lupin had raised his eyebrows 
 
 i was hoping that neville would assist me with the first stage of the operation he said and i am sure he will perform it admirably 
 
 face went if possible even redder lip curled but he left shutting the door with a snap 
 
 now then said professor lupin beckoning the class toward the end of the room where there was nothing but an old wardrobe where the teachers kept their spare robes as professor lupin went to stand next to it the wardrobe gave a sudden wobble banging off the wall 
 
 nothing to worry about said professor lupin calmly because a few people had jumped backward in alarm a boggart in there 
 
 most people seemed to feel that this was something to worry about neville gave professor lupin a look of pure terror and seamus finnigan eyed the now rattling doorknob apprehensively 
 
 boggarts like dark enclosed spaces said professor lupin wardrobes the gap beneath beds the cupboards under sinks even met one that had lodged itself in a grandfather clock this one moved in yesterday afternoon and i asked the headmaster if the staff would leave it to give my third years some practice 
 
 so the first question we must ask ourselves is what is a boggart 
 
 hermione put up her hand 
 
 a she said it can take the shape of whatever it thinks will frighten us most 
 
 have put it better myself said professor lupin and hermione glowed so the boggart sitting in the darkness within has not yet assumed a form he does not yet know what will frighten the person on the other side of the door nobody knows what a boggart looks like when he is alone but when i let him out he will immediately become whatever each of us most fears 
 
 this means said professor lupin choosing to ignore small sputter of terror that we have a huge advantage over the boggart before we begin have you spotted it harry 
 
 trying to answer a question with hermione next to him bobbing up and down on the balls of her feet with her hand in the air was very but harry had a go 
 
 er because there are so many of us it know what shape it should be 
 
 precisely said professor lupin and hermione put her hand down looking a little disappointed always best to have company when dealing with a boggart he becomes confused which should he become a headless corpse or a slug i once saw a boggart make that very mistake tried to frighten two people at once and turned himself into half a slug not remotely frightening 
 
 the charm that repels a boggart is simple yet it requires force of mind you see the thing that really finishes a boggart is laughter what you need to do is force it to assume a shape that you find amusing 
 
 we will practice the charm without wands first after me pleaseriddikulus 
 
 riddikulus said the class together 
 
 good said professor lupin very good but that was the easy part afraid you see the word alone is not enough and this is where you come in neville 
 
 the wardrobe shook again though not as much as neville who walked forward as though he were heading for the gallows 
 
 right neville said professor lupin first things first what would you say is the thing that frightens you most in the world 
 
 lips moved but no noise came out 
 
 i catch that neville sorry said professor lupin cheerfully 
 
 neville looked around rather wildly as though begging someone to help him then said in barely more than a whisper professor snape 
 
 nearly everyone laughed even neville grinned apologetically professor lupin however looked thoughtful 
 
 professor snapehmmmneville i believe you live with your grandmother 
 
 er yes said neville nervously but i want the boggart to turn into her either 
 
 no no you misunderstand me said professor lupin now smiling i wonder could you tell us what sort of clothes your grandmother usually wears 
 
 neville looked startled but said wellalways the same hat a tall one with a stuffed vulture on top and a long dressgreen normallyand sometimes a scarf 
 
 and a handbag prompted professor lupin 
 
 a big red one said neville 
 
 right then said professor lupin can you picture those clothes very clearly neville can you see them in your eye 
 
 yes said neville uncertainty plainly wondering what was coming next 
 
 when the boggart bursts out of this wardrobe neville and sees you it will assume the form of professor snape said lupin and you will raise your wand thus and cry riddikulus and concentrate hard on your clothes if all goes well professor boggart snape will be forced into that hat and that green dress with that big red handbag 
 
 there was a great shout of laughter the wardrobe wobbled more violently 
 
 if neville is successful the boggart is likely to shift his attention to each of us in turn said professor lupin i would like all of you to take a moment now to think of the thing that scares you most and imagine how you might force it to look comical 
 
 the room went quiet harry thoughtwhat scared him most in the world 
 
 his first thought was lord voldemort a voldemort returned to full strength but before he had even started to plan a possible counterattack on a a horrible image came floating to the surface of his mind 
 
 a rotting glistening hand slithering back beneath a black cloaka long rattling breath from an unseen mouththen a cold so penetrating it felt like drowning 
 
 harry shivered then looked around hoping no one had noticed many people had their eyes shut tight ron was muttering to himself take its legs off harry was sure he knew what that was about greatest fear was spiders 
 
 everyone ready said professor lupin 
 
 harry felt a lurch of fear he ready how could you make a dementor less frightening but he want to ask for more time everyone else was nodding and rolling up their sleeves 
 
 neville going to back away said professor lupin let you have a clear field all right call the next person forwardeveryone back now so neville can get a clear shot 
 
 they all retreated backed against the walls leaving neville alone beside the wardrobe he looked pale and frightened but he had pushed up the sleeves of his robes and was holding his wand ready 
 
 on the count of three neville said professor lupin who was pointing his own wand at the handle of the wardrobe one two three now 
 
 a jet of sparks shot from the end of professor wand and hit the doorknob the wardrobe burst open and menacing professor snape stepped out his eyes flashing at neville 
 
 neville backed away his wand up mouthing wordlessly snape was bearing down upon him reaching inside his robes 
 
 r r riddikulus squeaked neville 
 
 there was a noise like a whip crack snape stumbled he was wearing a long dress and a towering hat topped with a vulture and he was swinging a huge crimson handbag 
 
 there was a roar of laughter the boggart paused confused and professor lupin shouted parvati forward 
 
 parvati walked forward her face set snape rounded on her there was another crack and where he had stood was a bloodstained bandaged mummy its sightless face was turned to parvati and it began to walk toward her very slowly dragging its feet its stiff arms rising 
 
 riddikulus cried parvati 
 
 a bandage unraveled at the feet it became entangled fell face forward and its head rolled off 
 
 seamus roared professor lupin 
 
 seamus darted past parvati 
 
 crack where the mummy had been was a woman with floorlength black hair and a skeletal face a banshee she opened her mouth wide and an unearthly sound filled the room a long wailing shriek that made the hair on head stand on end riddikulus shouted seamus 
 
 the banshee made a rasping noise and clutched her throat her voice was gone 
 
 crack the banshee turned into a rat which chased its tail in a circle then crack became a rattlesnake which slithered and writhed before crack becoming a single bloody eyeball 
 
 confused shouted lupin getting there dean 
 
 dean hurried forward 
 
 crack the eyeball became a severed hand which flipped over and began to creep along the floor like a crab 
 
 riddikulus yelled dean 
 
 there was a snap and the hand was trapped in a mousetrap 
 
 excellent ron you next 
 
 ron leapt forward 
 
 crack 
 
 quite a few people screamed a giant spider six feet tall and covered in hair was advancing on ron clicking its pincers menacingly for a moment harry thought ron had frozen then 
 
 riddikulus bellowed ron and the legs vanished it rolled over and over lavender brown squealed and ran out of its way and it came to a halt at feet he raised his wand ready but 
 
 here shouted professor lupin suddenly hurrying forward crack 
 
 the legless spider had vanished for a second everyone looked wildly around to see where it was then they saw a orb hanging in the air in front of lupin who said riddikulus almost lazily 
 
 crack 
 
 forward neville and finish him off said lupin as the boggart landed on the floor as a cockroach crack snape was back this time neville charged forward looking determined 
 
 riddikulus he shouted and they had a split view of snape in his lacy dress before neville let out a great ha of laughter and the boggart exploded burst into a thousand tiny wisps of smoke and was gone 
 
 excellent cried professor lupin as the class broke into applause excellent neville well done everyonelet me seefive points to gryffindor for every person to tackle the boggart ten for neville because he did it twiceand five each to hermione and harry 
 
 but i do anything said harry 
 
 you and hermione answered my questions correctly at the start of the class harry lupin said lightly very well everyone an excellent lesson homework kindly read the chapter on boggarts and summarize it for meto be handed in on monday that will be all 
 
 talking excitedly the class left the staffroom harry however feeling cheerful professor lupin had deliberately stopped him from tackling the boggart why was it because seen harry collapse on the train and thought he up to much had he thought harry would pass out again 
 
 but no one else seemed to have noticed anything 
 
 did you see me take that banshee shouted seamus 
 
 and the hand said dean waving his own around 
 
 and snape in that hat 
 
 and my mummy 
 
 i wonder why professor frightened of crystal balls said lavender thoughtfully 
 
 that was the best defense against the dark arts lesson ever had it said ron excitedly as they made their way back to the classroom to get their bags 
 
 he seems like a very good teacher said hermione approvingly but i wish i could have had a turn with the boggart 
 
 what would it have been for you said ron sniggering a piece of homework that only got nine out of ten 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the prisoner of azkaban 
 

lionfish nov chapter seven bagman and crouchcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry disentangled himself from ron and got to his feet they had arrived on what appeared to be a deserted stretch of misty moor in front of them was a pair of tired and wizards one of whom was holding a large gold watch the other a thick roll of parchment and a quill both were dressed as muggles though very inexpertly the man with the watch wore a tweed suit with galoshes his colleague a kilt and a poncho 
 
 morning basil said mr weasley picking up the boot and handing it to the kilted wizard who threw it into a large box of used portkeys beside him harry could see an old newspaper an empty drinks can and a punctured football 
 
 hello there arthur said basil wearily not on duty eh all right for been here all better get out of the way got a big party coming in from the black forest at five fifteen hang on find your he consulted his parchment list about a quarter of a walk over there first field you come to site called mr roberts diggorysecond fieldask for mr payne 
 
 thanks basil said mr weasley and he beckoned everyone to follow him 
 
 they set off across the deserted moor unable to make out much through the mist after about twenty minutes a small stone cottage next to a gate swam into view beyond it harry could just make out the ghostly shapes of hundreds and hundreds of tents rising up the gentle slope of a large field toward a dark wood on the horizon they said to the and approached the cottage door 
 
 a man was standing in the doorway looking out at the tents harry knew at a glance that this was the only real muggle for several acres when he heard their footsteps he turned his head to look at them 
 
 morning said mr weasley brightly 
 
 morning said the muggle 
 
 would you be mr roberts 
 
 aye i would said mr roberts and you 
 
 weasley two tents booked a couple of days ago 
 
 aye said mr roberts consulting a list tacked to the door got a space up by the wood there just the one night 
 
 it said mr weasley 
 
 be paying now then said mr roberts 
 
 ah right certainly said mr weasley he retreated a short distance from the cottage and beckoned harry toward him help me harry he muttered pulling a roll of muggle money from his pocket and starting to peel the notes apart this a a a ten ah yes i see the little number on it nowso this is a five 
 
 a twenty harry corrected him in an undertone uncomfortably aware of mr roberts trying to catch every word 
 
 ah yes so it know these little bits of paper 
 
 you foreign said mr roberts as mr weasley returned with the correct notes 
 
 foreign repeated mr weasley puzzled 
 
 not the first one had trouble with money said mr roberts scrutinizing mr weasley closely i had two try and pay me with great gold coins the size of hubcaps ten minutes ago 
 
 did you really said mr weasley nervously 
 
 mr roberts rummaged around in a tin for some change 
 
 never been this crowded he said suddenly looking out over the misty field again hundreds of people usually just turn up 
 
 is that right said mr weasley his hand held out for his change but mr roberts give it to him 
 
 aye he said thoughtfully people from all over loads of foreigners and not just foreigners weirdos you know a bloke walking round in a kilt and a poncho 
 
 he said mr weasley anxiously 
 
 like some sort ofi dunnolike some sort of rally said mr roberts they all seem to know each other like a big party 
 
 at that moment a wizard in appeared out of thin air next to mr front door 
 
 obliviate he said sharply pointing his wand at mr roberts 
 
 instantly mr eyes slid out of focus his brows unknitted and a took of dreamy unconcern fell over his face harry recognized the symptoms of one who had just had his memory modified 
 
 a map of the campsite for you mr roberts said placidly to mr weasley and your change 
 
 thanks very much said mr weasley 
 
 the wizard in accompanied them toward the gate to the campsite he looked exhausted his chin was blue with stubble and there were deep purple shadows under his eyes once out of earshot of mr roberts he muttered to mr weasley been having a lot of trouble with him needs a memory charm ten times a day to keep him happy and ludo not helping trotting around talking about bludgers and quaffles at the top of his voice not a worry about security blimey be glad when this is over see you later arthur 
 
 he disapparated 
 
 i thought mr bagman was head of magical games and sports said ginny looking surprised he should know better than to talk about bludgers near muggles he 
 
 he should said mr weasley smiling and leading them through the gates into the campsite but always been a bitwelllax about security you wish for a more enthusiastic head of the sports department though he played quidditch for england himself you know and he was the best beater the wimbourne wasps ever had 
 
 they trudged up the misty field between long rows of tents most looked almost ordinary their owners had clearly tried to make them as as possible but had slipped up by adding chimneys or bellpulls or weather vanes however here and there was a tent so obviously magical that harry could hardly be surprised that mr roberts was getting suspicious halfway up the field stood an extravagant confection of striped silk like a miniature palace with several live peacocks tethered at the entrance a little farther on they passed a tent that had three floors and several turrets and a short way beyond that was a tent that had a front garden attached complete with birdbath sundial and fountain 
 
 always the same said mr weasley smiling we resist showing off when we get together ah here we are look this is us 
 
 they had reached the very edge of the wood at the top of the field and here was an empty space with a small sign hammered into the ground that read weezly 
 
 have a better spot said mr weasley happily the field is just on the other side of the wood there as close as we could be he hoisted his backpack from his shoulders right he said excitedly no magic allowed strictly speaking not when out in these numbers on muggle land be putting these tents up by hand be too do it all the harry where do you reckon we should start 
 
 harry had never been camping in his life the dursleys had never taken him on any kind of holiday preferring to leave him with mrs figg an old neighbor however he and hermione worked out where most of the poles and pegs should go and though mr weasley was more of a hindrance than a help because he got thoroughly overexcited when it came to using the mallet they finally managed to erect a pair of shabby tents 
 
 all of them stood back to admire their handiwork nobody looking at these tents would guess they belonged to wizards harry thought but the trouble was that once bill charlie and percy arrived they would be a party of ten hermione seemed to have spotted this problem too she gave harry a quizzical look as mr weasley dropped to his hands and knees and entered the first tent 
 
 be a bit cramped he called but i think all squeeze in come and have a look 
 
 harry bent down ducked under the tent flap and felt his jaw drop he had walked into what looked like an three room flat complete with bathroom and kitchen oddly enough it was furnished in exactly the same sort of style as mrs house there were crocheted covers on the mismatched chairs and a strong smell of cats 
 
 well not for long said mr weasley mopping his bald patch with a handkerchief and peering in at the four bunk beds that stood in the bedroom i borrowed this from perkins at the office camp much anymore poor fellow got lumbago 
 
 he picked up the dusty kettle and peered inside it need water 
 
 a tap marked on this map the muggle gave us said ron who had followed harry inside the tent and seemed completely unimpressed by its extraordinary inner proportions on the other side of the field 
 
 well why you harry and hermione go and get us some water then mr weasley handed over the kettle and a couple of saucepans and the rest of us will get some wood for a fire 
 
 but got an oven said ron why we just 
 
 ron security said mr weasley his face shining with anticipation when real muggles camp they cook on fires outdoors seen them at it 
 
 after a quick tour of the girls tent which was slightly smaller than the boys though without the smell of cats harry ron and hermione set off across the campsite with the kettle and saucepans 
 
 now with the sun newly risen and the mist lifting they could see the city of tents that stretched in every direction they made their way slowly through the rows staring eagerly around it was only just dawning on harry how many witches and wizards there must be in the world he had never really thought much about those in other countries 
 
 their fellow campers were starting to wake up first to stir were the families with small children harry had never seen witches and wizards this young before a tiny boy no older than two was crouched outside a large tent holding a wand and poking happily at a slug in the grass which was swelling slowly to the size of a salami as they drew level with him his mother came hurrying out of the tent 
 
 how many times kevin you touch wand yecchh 
 
 she had trodden on the giant slug which burst her scolding carried after them on the still air mingling with the little yells you bust slug you bust slug 
 
 a short way farther on they saw two little witches barely older than kevin who were riding toy broomsticks that rose only high enough for the girls toes to skim the dewy grass a ministry wizard had already spotted them as he hurried past harry ron and hermione he muttered distractedly in broad daylight parents having a i suppose 
 
 here and there adult wizards and witches were emerging from their tents and starting to cook breakfast some with furtive looks around them conjured fires with their wands others were striking matches with dubious looks on their faces as though sure this work three african wizards sat in serious conversation all of them wearing long white robes and roasting what looked like a rabbit on a bright purple fire while a group of american witches sat gossiping happily beneath a spangled banner stretched between their tents that read the salem witches institute harry caught snatches of conversation in strange languages from the inside of tents they passed and though he understand a word the tone of every single voice was excited 
 
 er is it my eyes or has everything gone green said ron 
 
 it just eyes they had walked into a patch of tents that were all covered with a thick growth of shamrocks so that it looked as though small oddly shaped hillocks had sprouted out of the earth grinning faces could be seen under those that had their flaps open then from behind them they heard their names 
 
 harry ron hermione 
 
 it was seamus finnigan their fellow gryffindor fourth year he was sitting in front of his own tent with a woman who had to be his mother and his best friend dean thomas also of gryffindor 
 
 like the decorations said seamus grinning the not too happy 
 
 ah why we show our colors said mrs finnigan you should see what the bulgarians have got dangling all over their tents be supporting ireland of course she added eyeing harry ron and hermione beadily when they had assured her that they were indeed supporting ireland they set off again though as ron said like say anything else surrounded by that lot 
 
 i wonder what the bulgarians have got dangling all over their tents said hermione 
 
 go and have a look said harry pointing to a large patch of tents upfield where the bulgarian flag white green and red was fluttering in the breeze 
 
 the tents here had not been bedecked with plant life but each and every one of them had the same poster attached to it a poster of a very surly face with heavy black eyebrows the picture was of course moving but all it did was blink and scowl 
 
 krum said ron quietly 
 
 what said hermione 
 
 krum said ron viktor krum the bulgarian seeker 
 
 he looks really grumpy said hermione looking around at the many blinking and scowling at them 
 
 really grumpy ron raised his eyes to the heavens who cares what he looks like unbelievable really young too only just eighteen or something a genius you wait until tonight see 
 
 there was already a small queue for the tap in the corner of the field harry ron and hermione joined it right behind a pair of men who were having a heated argument one of them was a very old wizard who was wearing a long flowery nightgown the other was clearly a ministry wizard he was holding out a pair of pinstriped trousers and almost crying with exasperation 
 
 just put them on archie a good chap you walk around like that the muggle at the already getting suspicious 
 
 i bought this in a muggle shop said the old wizard stubbornly muggles wear them 
 
 muggle women wear them archie not the men they wear these said the ministry wizard and he brandished the pinstriped trousers 
 
 not putting them on said old archie in indignation i like a healthy breeze round my privates thanks 
 
 hermione was overcome with such a strong fit of the giggles at this point that she had to duck out of the queue and only returned when archie had collected his water and moved away 
 
 walking more slowly now because of the weight of the water they made their way back through the campsite here and there they saw more familiar faces other hogwarts students with their families oliver wood the old captain of house quidditch team who had just left hogwarts dragged harry over to his parents tent to introduce him and told him excitedly that he had just been signed to the puddlemere united reserve team next they were hailed by ernie macmillan a hufflepuff fourth year and a little farther on they saw cho chang a very pretty girl who played seeker on the ravenclaw team she waved and smiled at harry who slopped quite a lot of water down his front as he waved back more to stop ron from smirking than anything harry hurriedly pointed out a large group of teenagers whom he had never seen before 
 
 who reckon they are he said they go to hogwarts do they 
 
 spect they go to some foreign school said ron i know there are others never met anyone who went to one though bill had a penfriend at a school in brazilthis was years and years agoand he wanted to go on an exchange trip but mum and dad afford it his penfriend got all offended when he said he going and sent him a cursed hat it made his ears shrivel up 
 
 harry laughed but voice the amazement he felt at hearing about other wizarding schools he supposed now that he saw representatives of so many nationalities in the campsite that he had been stupid never to realize that hogwarts be the only one he glanced at hermione who looked utterly unsurprised by the information no doubt she had run across the news about other wizarding schools in some book or other 
 
 been ages said george when they finally got back to the weasleys tents 
 
 met a few people said ron setting the water down not got that fire started yet 
 
 having fun with the matches said fred 
 
 mr weasley was having no success at all in lighting the fire but it for lack of trying splintered matches littered the ground around him but he looked as though he was having the time of his life 
 
 oops he said as he managed to light a match and promptly dropped it in surprise 
 
 come here mr weasley said hermione kindly taking the box from him and showing him how to do it properly 
 
 at last they got the fire lit though it was at least another hour before it was hot enough to cook anything there was plenty to watch while they waited however their tent seemed to be pitched right alongside a kind of thoroughfare to the field and ministry members kept hurrying up and down it greeting mr weasley cordially as they passed mr weasley kept up a running commentary mainly for and benefit his own children knew too much about the ministry to be greatly interested 
 
 that was cuthbert mockridge head of the goblin liaison comes gilbert wimple with the committee on experimental charms had those horns for a while nowhello arniearnold peasegood an obliviator member of the accidental magic reversal squad you knowand bode and unspeakables 
 
 what 
 
 from the department of mysteries top secret no idea what they get up to 
 
 at last the fire was ready and they had just started cooking eggs and sausages when bill charlie and percy came strolling out of the woods toward them 
 
 just apparated dad said percy loudly ah excellent lunch 
 
 they were halfway through their plates of eggs and sausages when mr weasley jumped to his feet waving and grinning at a man who was striding toward them aha he said the man of the moment ludo 
 
 ludo bagman was easily the most noticeable person harry had seen so far even including old archie in his flowered nightdress he was wearing long quidditch robes in thick horizontal stripes of bright yellow and black an enormous picture of a wasp was splashed across his chest he had the look of a powerfully built man gone slightly to seed the robes were stretched tightly across a large belly he surely had not had in the days when he had played quidditch for england his nose was squashed probably broken by a stray bludger harry thought but his round blue eyes short blond hair and rosy complexion made him look like a very overgrown schoolboy 
 
 ahoy there bagman called happily he was walking as though he had springs attached to the balls of his feet and was plainly in a state of wild excitement 
 
 arthur old man he puffed as he reached the campfire what a day eh what a day could we have asked for more perfect weather a cloudless night comingand hardly a hiccough in the much for me to do 
 
 behind him a group of ministry wizards rushed past pointing at the distant evidence of some sort of a magical fire that was sending violet sparks twenty feet into the air 
 
 percy hurried forward with his hand outstretched apparently his disapproval of the way ludo bagman ran his department did not prevent him from wanting to make a good impression 
 
 ah yes said mr weasley grinning this is my son percy just started at the ministry and this is fred no george sorry fred bill charlie ron my daughter ginny and friends hermione granger and harry potter 
 
 bagman did the smallest of double takes when he heard name and his eyes performed the familiar flick upward to the scar on forehead 
 
 everyone mr weasley continued this is ludo bagman you know who he is thanks to him got such good tickets 
 
 bagman beamed and waved his hand as if to say it had been nothing 
 
 fancy a flutter on the match arthur he said eagerly jingling what seemed to be a large amount of gold in the pockets of his robes already got roddy pontner betting me bulgaria will score first i offered him nice odds considering front three are the strongest seen in years and little agatha timms has put up half shares in her eel farm on a weeklong match 
 
 ohgo on then said mr weasley seea galleon on ireland to win 
 
 a galleon ludo bagman looked slightly disappointed but recovered himself very well very wellany other takers 
 
 a bit young to be gambling said mr weasley molly like 
 
 bet galleons fifteen sickles three knuts said fred as he and george quickly pooled all their money that ireland wins but viktor krum gets the snitch oh and throw in a fake wand 
 
 you want to go showing mr bagman rubbish like that percy hissed but bagman seem to think the wand was rubbish at all on the contrary his boyish face shone with excitement as he took it from fred and when the wand gave a loud squawk and turned into a rubber chicken bagman roared with laughter 
 
 excellent i seen one that convincing in years pay five galleons for that 
 
 percy froze in an attitude of stunned disapproval 
 
 boys said mr weasley under his breath i want you all your mother 
 
 be a spoilsport arthur boomed ludo bagman rattling his pockets excitedly old enough to know what they want you reckon ireland will win but get the snitch not a chance boys not a give you excellent odds on that add five galleons for the funny wand then shall we 
 
 mr weasley looked on helplessly as ludo bagman whipped out a notebook and quill and began jotting down the twins names 
 
 cheers said george taking the slip of parchment bagman handed him and tucking it away into the front of his robes bagman turned most cheerfully back to mr weasley 
 
 do me a brew i suppose keeping an eye out for barty crouch my bulgarian opposite making difficulties and i understand a word saying be able to sort it out he speaks about a hundred and fifty languages 
 
 mr crouch said percy suddenly abandoning his look of disapproval and positively writhing with excitement he speaks over two hundred mermish and gobbledegook and troll 
 
 anyone can speak troll said fred dismissively all you have to do is point and grunt 
 
 percy threw fred an extremely nasty look and stoked the fire vigorously to bring the kettle back to the boil 
 
 any news of bertha jorkins yet ludo mr weasley asked as bagman settled himself down on the grass beside them all 
 
 not a dicky bird said bagman comfortably but turn up poor old berthamemory like a leaky cauldron and no sense of direction lost you take my word for it wander back into the office sometime in october thinking still july 
 
 you think it might be time to send someone to look for her mr weasley suggested tentatively as percy handed bagman his tea 
 
 barty crouch keeps saying that said bagman his round eyes widening innocently but we really spare anyone at the moment oh talk of the devil barty 
 
 a wizard had just apparated at their fireside and he could not have made more of a contrast with ludo bagman sprawled on the grass in his old wasp robes barty crouch was a stiff upright elderly man dressed in an impeccably crisp suit and tie the parting in his short gray hair was almost unnaturally straight and his narrow toothbrush mustache looked as though he trimmed it using a slide rule his shoes were very highly polished harry could see at once why percy idolized him percy was a great believer in rigidly following rules and mr crouch had complied with the rule about muggle dressing so thoroughly that he could have passed for a bank manager harry doubted even uncle vernon would have spotted him for what he really was 
 
 pull up a bit of grass barry said ludo brightly patting the ground beside him 
 
 no thank you ludo said crouch and there was a bite of impatience in his voice been looking for you everywhere the bulgarians are insisting we add another twelve seats to the top box 
 
 oh is that what after said bagman i thought the chap was asking to borrow a pair of tweezers bit of a strong accent 
 
 mr crouch said percy breathlessly sunk into a kind of halfbow that made him look like a hunchback would you like a cup of tea 
 
 oh said mr crouch looking over at percy in mild surprise yes thank you weatherby 
 
 fred and george choked into their own cups percy very pink around the ears busied himself with the kettle 
 
 oh and been wanting a word with you too arthur said mr crouch his sharp eyes falling upon mr weasley ali on the warpath he wants a word with you about your embargo on flying carpets 
 
 mr weasley heaved a deep sigh 
 
 i sent him an owl about that just last week if told him once told him a hundred times carpets are defined as a muggle artifact by the registry of proscribed charmable objects but will he listen 
 
 i doubt it said mr crouch accepting a cup from percy desperate to export here 
 
 well never replace brooms in britain will they said bagman 
 
 ali thinks a niche in the market for a family vehicle said mr crouch i remember my grandfather had an axminster that could seat twelve but that was before carpets were banned of course 
 
 he spoke as though he wanted to leave nobody in any doubt that all his ancestors had abided strictly by the law 
 
 so been keeping busy barty said bagman breezily 
 
 fairly said mr crouch dryly organizing portkeys across five continents is no mean feat ludo 
 
 i expect both be glad when this is over said mr weasley 
 
 ludo bagman looked shocked 
 
 glad know when had more not as though we got anything to took forward to eh barty eh plenty left to organize eh 
 
 mr crouch raised his eyebrows at bagman 
 
 we agreed not to make the announcement until all the details 
 
 oh details said bagman waving the word away like a cloud of midges signed they agreed they i bet you anything these know soon enough anyway i mean happening at hogwarts 
 
 ludo we need to meet the bulgarians you know said mr crouch sharply cutting remarks short thank you for the tea weatherby 
 
 he pushed his undrunk tea back at percy and waited for ludo to rise bagman struggled to his feet swigging down the last of his tea the gold in his pockets chinking merrily 
 
 see you all later he said be up in the top box with me commentating he waved barty crouch nodded curtly and both of them disapparated 
 
 happening at hogwarts dad said fred at once what were they talking about 
 
 find out soon enough said smiling 
 
 classified information until such time as the ministry decides to release it said percy stiffly mr crouch was quite right not to disclose it 
 
 oh shut up weatherby said fred 
 
 a sense of excitement rose like a palpable cloud over the campsite as the afternoon wore on by dusk the still summer air itself seemed to be quivering with anticipation and as darkness spread like a curtain over the thousands of waiting wizards the last vestiges of pretence disappeared the ministry seemed to have bowed to the inevitable and stopped fighting the signs of blatant magic now breaking out everywhere 
 
 salesmen were apparating every few feet carrying trays and pushing carts full of extraordinary merchandise there were luminous rosettes green for ireland red for bulgaria which were squealing the names of the players pointed green hats bedecked with dancing shamrocks bulgarian scarves adorned with lions that really roared flags from both countries that played their national anthems as they were waved there were tiny models of firebolts that really flew and collectible figures of famous players which strolled across the palm of your hand preening themselves 
 
 been saving my pocket money all summer for this ron told harry as they and hermione strolled through the salesmen buying souvenirs though ron purchased a dancing shamrock hat and a large green rosette he also bought a small figure of viktor krum the bulgarian seeker the miniature krum walked backward and forward over hand scowling up at the green rosette above him 
 
 wow look at these said harry hurrying over to a cart piled high with what looked like brass binoculars except that they were covered with all sorts of weird knobs and dials 
 
 omnioculars said the saleswizard eagerly you can replay actionslow everything downand they flash up a breakdown if you need it bargain ten galleons each 
 
 wish i bought this now said ron gesturing at his dancing shamrock hat and gazing longingly at the omnioculars 
 
 three pairs said harry firmly to the wizard 
 
 no bother said ron going red he was always touchy about the fact that harry who had inherited a small fortune from his parents had much more money than he did 
 
 you be getting anything for christmas harry told him thrusting omnioculars into his and hands for about ten years mind 
 
 fair enough said ron grinning 
 
 oooh thanks harry said hermione and get us some programs look 
 
 their money bags considerably lighter they went back to the tents bill charlie and ginny were all sporting green rosettes too and mr weasley was carrying an irish flag fred and george had no souvenirs as they had given bagman all their gold 
 
 and then a deep booming gong sounded somewhere beyond the woods and at once green and red lanterns blazed into life in the trees lighting a path to the field 
 
 time said mr weasley looking as excited as any of them come on go 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire 
 

lionfish nov chapter seven the ministry of magiccontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry awoke at five the next morning as abruptly and completely as if somebody had yelled in his ear for a few moments he lay immobile as the prospect of the disciplinary hearing filled every tiny particle of his brain then unable to bear it he leapt out of bed and put on his glasses mrs weasley had laid out his freshly laundered jeans and at the foot of his bed harry scrambled into them the blank picture on the wall sniggered 
 
 ron was lying sprawled on his back with his mouth wide open fast asleep he did not stir as harry crossed the room stepped out on to the landing and closed the door softly behind him trying not to think of the next time he would see ron when they might no longer be fellow students at hogwarts harry walked quietly down the stairs past the heads of ancestors and down into the kitchen 
 
 he had expected it to be empty but when he reached the door he heard the soft rumble of voices on the other side he pushed it open and saw mr and mrs weasley sirius lupin and tonks sitting there almost as though they were waiting for him all were fully dressed except mrs weasley who was wearing a quilted purple dressing gown she leapt to her feet the moment harry entered 
 
 breakfast she said as she pulled out her wand and hurried over to the fire 
 
 harry yawned tonks her hair was blonde and curly this morning sleep all right 
 
 yeah said harry 
 
 up all night she said with another shuddering yawn come and sit down 
 
 she drew out a chair knocking over the one beside it in the process 
 
 what do you want harry mrs weasley called porridge muffins kippers bacon and eggs toast 
 
 justjust toast thanks said harry 
 
 lupin glanced at harry then said to tonks what were you saying about scrimgeour 
 
 oh yeah well we need to be a bit more careful been asking kingsley and me funny questions 
 
 harry felt vaguely grateful that he was not required to join in the conversation his insides were squirming mrs weasley placed a couple of pieces of toast and marmalade in front of him he tried to eat but it was like chewing carpet mrs weasley sat down on his other side and started fussing with his tucking in the label and smoothing out the creases across his shoulders he wished she 
 
 and have to tell dumbledore i do night duty tomorrow just tired tonks finished yawning hugely again 
 
 cover for you said mr weasley ok got a report to finish anyway 
 
 mr weasley was not wearing wizards robes but a pair of pinstriped trousers and an old bomber jacket he turned from tonks to harry 
 
 how are you feeling 
 
 harry shrugged 
 
 all be over soon mr weasley said bracingly in a few hours time be cleared 
 
 harry said nothing 
 
 the on my floor in amelia office head of the department of magical law enforcement and the one be questioning you 
 
 amelia bones is ok harry said tonks earnestly fair hear you out 
 
 harry nodded still unable to think of anything to say 
 
 lose your temper said sirius abruptly be polite and stick to the facts 
 
 harry nodded again 
 
 the on your side said lupin quietly even underage wizards are allowed to use magic in situations 
 
 something very cold trickled down the back of neck for a moment he thought someone was putting a disillusionment charm on him then he realised that mrs weasley was attacking his hair with a wet comb she pressed hard on the top of his head 
 
 it ever lie flat she said desperately 
 
 harry shook his head 
 
 mr weasley checked his watch and looked up at harry i think go now he said a bit early but i think be better off at the ministry than hanging around here 
 
 ok said harry automatically dropping his toast and getting to his feet 
 
 be all right harry said tonks patting him on the arm 
 
 good luck said lupin sure it will be fine 
 
 and if not said sirius grimly see to amelia bones for you 
 
 harry smiled weakly mrs weasley hugged him 
 
 all got our fingers crossed she said 
 
 right said harry well see you later then 
 
 he followed mr weasley upstairs and along the hall he could hear mother grunting in her sleep behind her curtains mr weasley unbolted the door and they stepped out into the cold grey dawn 
 
 you normally walk to work do you harry asked him as they set off briskly around the square 
 
 no i usually apparate said mr weasley but obviously you and i think best we arrive in a thoroughly fashion makes a better impression given what being disciplined for 
 
 mr weasley kept his hand inside his jacket as they walked harry knew it was clenched around his wand the streets were almost deserted but when they arrived at the miserable little underground station they found it already lull of commuters as ever when he found himself in close proximity to muggles going about their daily business mr weasley was hard put to contain his enthusiasm 
 
 simply fabulous he whispered indicating the automatic ticket machines wonderfully ingenious 
 
 out of order said harry pointing at the sign 
 
 yes but even so said mr weasley beaming at them fondly 
 
 they bought their tickets instead from a guard harry handled the transaction as mr weasley was not very good with muggle money and five minutes later they were boarding an underground train that rattled them off towards the centre of london mr weasley kept anxiously checking and the underground map above the windows 
 
 four stops harry three stops left now two stops to go harry 
 
 they got off at a station in the very heart of london and were swept from the train in a tide of besuited men and women carrying briefcases up the escalator they went through the ticket barrier mr weasley delighted with the way the stile swallowed his ticket and emerged on to a broad street lined with buildings and already full of traffic 
 
 where are we said mr weasley blankly and for one moment harry thought they had got off at the wrong station despite mr continual references to the map but a second later he said ah yes this way harry and led him down a side road 
 
 sorry he said but i never come by train and it all looks rather different from a muggle perspective as a matter of fact never even used the visitors entrance before 
 
 the further they walked the smaller and less imposing the buildings became until finally they reached a street that contained several rather offices a pub and an overflowing skip harry had expected a rather more impressive location for the ministry of magic 
 
 here we are said mr weasley brightly pointing at an old red telephone box which was missing several panes of glass and stood before a heavily graffitied wall after you harry 
 
 he opened the door 
 
 harry stepped inside wondering what on earth this was about mr weasley folded himself in beside harry and closed the door it was a tight fit harry was jammed against the telephone apparatus which was hanging crookedly from the wall as though a vandal had tried to rip it off mr weasley reached past harry for the receiver 
 
 mr weasley i think this might be out of order too harry said 
 
 no no sure its fine said mr weasley holding the receiver above his head and peering at the dial see six he dialled the number two four and another four and another two 
 
 as the dial whirred smoothly back into place a cool female voice sounded inside the telephone box not from the receiver in mr hand but as loudly and plainly as though an invisible woman were standing right beside them 
 
 welcome to the ministry of magic please state your name and business 
 
 er said mr weasley clearly uncertain whether or not he should talk into the receiver he compromised by holding the mouthpiece to his ear arthur weasley misuse of muggle artefacts office here to escort harry potter who has been asked to attend a disciplinary hearing 
 
 thank you said the cool female voice visitor please take the badge and attach it to the front of your robes 
 
 there was a click and a rattle and harry saw something slide out of the metal chute where returned coins usually appeared he picked it up it was a square silver badge with harry potter disciplinary hearing on it he pinned it to the front of his as the female voice spoke again 
 
 visitor to the ministry you are required to submit to a search and present your wand for registration at the security desk which is located at the far end of the atrium 
 
 the floor of the telephone box shuddered they were sinking slowly into the ground harry watched apprehensively as the pavement seemed to rise up past the glass windows of the telephone box until darkness closed over their heads then he could see nothing at all he could hear only a dull grinding noise as the telephone box made its way down through the earth after about a minute though it felt much longer to harry a chink of golden light illuminated his feet and widening rose up his body until it hit him in the face and he had to blink to stop his eyes watering 
 
 the ministry of magic wishes you a pleasant day said the voice 
 
 the door of the telephone box sprang open and mr weasley stepped out of it followed by harry whose mouth had fallen open 
 
 they were standing at one end of a very long and splendid hall with a highly polished dark wood floor the peacock blue ceiling was inlaid with gleaming golden symbols that kept moving and changing like some enormous heavenly noticeboard the on each side were panelled in shiny dark wood and had many gilded fireplaces set into them every few seconds a witch or wizard would emerge from one of the fireplaces with a soft whoosh on the side short queues were forming before each fireplace waiting to depart 
 
 halfway down the hall was a fountain a group of golden statues larger than stood in the middle of a circular pool tallest of them all was a wizard with his wand pointing straight up in the air grouped around him were a beautiful witch a centaur a goblin and a the last three were all looking adoringly up at the witch and wizard glittering jets of water were flying from the ends of the two wands the point of the arrow the tip of the hat and each of the ears so that the tinkling hiss of falling water was added to the pops and cracks of the apparators and the clatter of footsteps as hundreds of witches and wizards most of whom were wearing glum looks strode towards a set of golden gates at the far end of the hall 
 
 this way said mr weasley 
 
 they joined the throng wending their way between the ministry workers some of whom were carrying tottering piles of parchment others battered briefcases still others were reading the daily prophet while they walked as they passed the fountain harry saw silver sickles and bronze knuts glinting up at him from the bottom of the pool a small smudged sign beside it read 
 
 all proceeds from the fountain of magical brethren will be given to st hospital for magical maladies and injuries 
 
 if not expelled from hogwarts put in ten galleons harry found himself thinking desperately 
 
 over here harry said mr weasley and they stepped out of the stream of ministry employees heading for the golden gates seated at a desk to the left beneath a sign saying security a wizard in robes looked up as they approached and put down his daily prophet 
 
 escorting a visitor said mr weasley gesturing towards harry 
 
 step over here said the wizard in a bored voice 
 
 harry walked closer to him and the wizard held up a long golden rod thin and flexible as a car aerial and passed it up and down front and back 
 
 wand grunted the security wizard at harry putting down the golden instrument and holding out his hand 
 
 harry produced his wand the wizard dropped it on to a strange brass instrument which looked something like a set of scales with only one dish it began to vibrate a narrow strip of parchment came speeding out of a slit in the base the wizard tore this off and read the writing on it 
 
 eleven inches core been in use four years that correct 
 
 yes said harry nervously 
 
 i keep this said the wizard impaling the slip of parchment on a small brass spike you get this back he added thrusting the wand at harry 
 
 thank you 
 
 hang on said the wizard slowly 
 
 his eyes had darted from the silver badge on chest to his forehead 
 
 thank you eric said mr weasley firmly and grasping harry by the shoulder he steered him away from the desk and back into the stream of wizards and witches walking through the golden gates 
 
 jostled slightly by the crowd harry followed mr weasley through the gates into the smaller hall beyond where at least twenty lifts stood behind wrought golden grilles harry and mr weasley joined the crowd around one of them nearby stood a big bearded wizard holding a large cardboard box which was emitting rasping noises 
 
 all right arthur said the wizard nodding at mr weasley 
 
 you got there bob asked mr weasley looking at the box 
 
 not sure said the wizard seriously we thought it was a chicken until it started breathing fire looks like a serious breach of the ban on experimental breeding to me 
 
 with a great jangling and clattering a lift descended in front of them the golden grille slid back and harry and mr weasley stepped into the lift with the rest of the crowd and harry found himself jammed against the back wall several witches and wizards were looking at him curiously he stared at his feet to avoid catching eye flattening his fringe as he did so the grilles slid shut with a crash and the lift ascended slowly chains rattling while the same cool female voice harry had heard in the telephone box rang out again 
 
 level seven department of magical games and sports incorporating the british and irish quidditch league headquarters official gobstones club and ludicrous patents office 
 
 the lift doors opened harry glimpsed an corridor with various posters of quidditch teams tacked lopsidedly on the walls one of the wizards in the lift who was carrying an armful of broomsticks extricated himself with difficulty and disappeared down the corridor the doors closed the lift juddered upwards again and the voice announced 
 
 level six department of magical transportation incorporating the floo network authority broom regulatory control portkey office and apparation test centre 
 
 once again the lift doors opened and four or five witches and wizards got out at the same time several paper aeroplanes swooped into the lift harry stared up at them as they flapped idly around above his head they were a pale violet colour and he could see ministry of magic stamped along the edge of their wings 
 
 just memos mr weasley muttered to him we used to use owls but the mess was unbelievable droppings all over the desks 
 
 as they clattered upwards again the memos flapped around the lamp swaying from the ceiling 
 
 level five department of international magical cooperation incorporating the international magical trading standards body the international magical office of law and the international confederation of wizards british seats 
 
 when the doors opened two of the memos zoomed out with a few more of the witches and wizards but several more memos zoomed in so that the light from the lamp flickered and flashed overhead as they darted around it 
 
 level four department for the regulation and control of magical creatures incorporating beast being and spirit divisions goblin liaison office and pest advisory bureau 
 
 said the wizard carrying the chicken and he left the lift pursued by a little flock of memos the doors clanged shut yet again 
 
 level three department of magical accidents and catastrophes including the accidental magic reversal squad obliviator headquarters and excuse committee 
 
 everybody left the lift on this floor except mr weasley harry and a witch who was reading an extremely long piece of parchment that was trailing on the floor the remaining memos continued to soar around the lamp as the lift juddered upwards again then the doors opened and the voice made its announcement 
 
 level two department of magical law enforcement including the improper use of magic office auror headquarters and wizengamot administration services 
 
 this is us harry said mr weasley and they followed the witch out of the lift into a corridor lined with doors my office is on the other side of the floor 
 
 mr weasley said harry as they passed a window through which sunlight was streaming we still underground 
 
 yes we are said mr weasley those are enchanted windows magical maintenance decide what weather get every day we had two months of hurricanes last time they were angling for a pay rise just round here harry 
 
 they turned a corner walked through a pair of heavy oak doors and emerged in a cluttered open area divided into cubicles which was buzzing with talk and laughter memos were zooming in and out of cubicles like miniature rockets a lopsided sign on the nearest cubicle read auror headquarters 
 
 harry looked surreptitiously through the doorways as they passed the aurors had covered their cubicle walls with everything from pictures of wanted wizards and photographs of their families to posters of their favourite quidditch teams and articles from the daily prophet a man with a ponytail longer than was sitting with his boots up on his desk dictating a report to his quill a little further along a witch with a patch over one eye was talking over the top of her cubicle wall to kingsley shacklebolt 
 
 morning weasley said kingsley carelessly as they drew nearer been wanting a word with you have you got a second 
 
 yes if it really is a second said mr weasley in rather a hurry 
 
 they were talking as though they hardly knew each other and when harry opened his mouth to say hello to kingsley mr weasly stood on his foot they followed kingsley along the row and into the very last cubicle 
 
 harry received a slight shock blinking down at him from every direction was face newspaper cuttings and old photographseven the one of sirius being best man at the potters weddingpapered the walls the only space was a map of the world in which little red pins were glowing like jewels 
 
 here said kingsley brusquely to mr weasley shoving a sheaf of parchment into his hand i need as much information as possible on flying muggle vehicles sighted in the last twelve months received information that black might still be using his old motorcycle 
 
 kingsley tipped harry an enormous wink and added in a whisper give him the magazine he might find it interesting then he said in normal tones and take too long weasley the delay on that firelegs report held our investigation up for a month 
 
 if you had read my report you would know that the term is firearms said mr weasley coolly and afraid have to wait for information on motorcycles extremely busy at the moment he dropped his voice and said if you can get away before seven making meatballs 
 
 he beckoned to harry and led him out of cubicle through a second set of oak doors into another passage turned left marched along another corridor turned right into a dimly lit and distinctly shabby corridor and finally reached a dead end where a door on the left stood ajar revealing a broom cupboard and a door on the right bore a tarnished brass plaque reading misuse of muggle artefacts 
 
 mr dingy office seemed to be slightly smaller than the broom cupboard two desks had been crammed inside it and there was barely space to move around them because of all the overflowing filing cabinets lining the walls on top of which were tottering piles of files the little wall space available bore witness to mr obsessions there were several posters of cars including one of a dismantled engine two illustrations of postboxes he seemed to have cut out of muggle books and a diagram showing how to wire a plug 
 
 sitting on top of mr overflowing was an old toaster that was hiccoughing in a disconsolate way and a pair of empty leather gloves that were twiddling their thumbs a photograph of the weasley family stood beside the harry noticed that percy appeared to have walked out of it 
 
 we got a window said mr weasley apologetically taking off his bomber jacket and placing it on the back of his chair asked but they seem to think we need one have a seat harry look as if perkins is in yet 
 
 harry squeezed himself into the chair behind desk while mr weasley riffled through the sheaf of parchment kingsley shacklebolt had given him 
 
 ah he said grinning as he extracted a copy of a magazine entitled the quibbler from its midst yes he flicked through it yes right sure sirius will find that very amusingoh dear this now 
 
 a memo had just zoomed in through the open door and fluttered to rest on top of the hiccoughing toaster mr weasley unfolded it and read aloud third regurgitating public toilet reported in bethnal green kindly investigate immediately this is getting ridiculous 
 
 a regurgitating toilet 
 
 pranksters said mr weasley frowning we had two last week one in wimbledon one in elephant and castle muggles are pulling the flush and instead of everything disappearingwell you can imagine the poor things keep calling in thosepumbles i think calledyou know the ones who mend pipes and things 
 
 plumbers 
 
 exactly yes but of course flummoxed i only hope we can catch doing it 
 
 will it be aurors who catch them 
 
 oh no this is too trivial for aurors be the ordinary magical law enforcement patrolah harry this is perkins 
 
 a stooped old wizard with fluffy white hair had just entered the room panting 
 
 oh arthur he said desperately without looking at harry thank goodness i know what to do for the best whether to wait here for you or not just sent an owl to your home but obviously missed itan urgent message came ten minutes ago 
 
 i know about the regurgitating toilet said mr weasley 
 
 no no not the toilet the potter changed the time and venueit starts at eight now and down in old courtroom ten 
 
 down in old but they told beard 
 
 mr weasley looked at his watch let out a yelp and leapt from his chair 
 
 quick harry we should have been there five minutes ago 
 
 perkins flattened himself against the filing cabinets as mr weasley left the office at a run harry close on his heels 
 
 why have they changed the time harry said breathlessly as they hurtled past the auror cubicles people poked out their heads and stared as they streaked past harry felt as though he had left all his insides back at desk 
 
 no idea but thank goodness we got here so early if missed it it would have been catastrophic 
 
 mr weasley skidded to a halt beside the lifts and jabbed impatiently at the down button 
 
 come on 
 
 the lift clattered into view and they hurried inside every time it stopped mr weasley cursed furiously and pummelled the number nine button 
 
 those courtrooms been used in years said mr weasley angrily i think why doing it down thereunlessbut no 
 
 a plump witch carrying a smoking goblet entered the lift at that moment and mr weasley did not elaborate 
 
 the atrium said the cool female voice and the golden grilles slid open showing harry a distant glimpse of the golden statues in the fountain the plump witch got out and a wizard with a very mournful face got in 
 
 morning arthur he said in a sepulchral voice as the lift began to descend often see you down here 
 
 urgent business bode said mr weasley who was bouncing on the balls of his feet and throwing anxious looks over at harry 
 
 ah yes said bode surveying harry unblinkingly of course 
 
 harry barely had emotion to spare for bode but his unfaltering gaze did not make him feel any more comfortable 
 
 department of mysteries said the cool female voice and left it at that 
 
 quick harry said mr weasley as the lift doors rattled open and they sped up a corridor that was quite different from those above the walls were bare there were no windows and no doors apart from a plain black one set at the very end of the corridor harry expected them to go through it but instead mr weasley seized him by the arm and dragged him to the left where there was an opening leading to a flight of steps 
 
 down here down here panted mr weasley taking two steps at a time the lift even come down this far why doing it down there 
 
 they reached the bottom of the steps and ran along yet another corridor which bore a great resemblance to the one that led to dungeon at hogwarts with rough stone walls and torches in brackets the doors they passed here were heavy wooden ones with iron bolts and keyholes 
 
 courtroom ten i think nearly yes 
 
 mr weasley stumbled to a halt outside a grimy dark door with an immense iron lock and slumped against the wall clutching at a stitch in his chest 
 
 go on he panted pointing his thumb at the door get in there 
 
 you coming with 
 
 no no not allowed good luck 
 
 heart was beating a violent tattoo against his apple he swallowed hard turned the heavy iron door handle and stepped inside the courtroom 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter seven the slug clubcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry spent a lot of the last week of the holidays pondering the meaning of behavior in knockturn alley what disturbed him most was the satisfied look on face as he had left the shop nothing that made malfoy look that happy could be good news to his slight annoyance however neither ron nor hermione seemed quite as curious about activities as he was or at least they seemed to get bored of discussing it after a few days 
 
 yes already agreed it was fishy harry said hermione a little impatiently she was sitting on the windowsill in fred and room with her feet up on one of the cardboard boxes and had only grudgingly looked up from her new copy of advanced rune translation but we agreed there could be a lot of explanations 
 
 maybe broken his hand of glory said ron vaguely as he attempted to straighten his bent tail twigs remember that arm malfoy had 
 
 but what about when he said forget to keep that one safe asked harry for the umpteenth time that sounded to me like got another one of the broken objects and malfoy wants both 
 
 you reckon said ron now trying to scrape some dirt off his broom handle 
 
 yeah i do said harry when neither ron nor hermione answered he said in azkaban you think like revenge 
 
 ron looked up blinking 
 
 malfoy revenge what can he do about it 
 
 my point i know said harry frustrated but up to something and i think we should take it seriously his a death eater and 
 
 harry broke off his eyes fixed on the window behind hermione his mouth open a startling thought had just occurred to him 
 
 harry said hermione in an anxious voice wrong 
 
 your not hurting again is it asked ron nervously 
 
 a death eater said harry slowly replaced his father as a death eater 
 
 there was a silence then ron erupted in laughter malfoy sixteen harry you think would let malfoy join 
 
 it seems very unlikely harry said hermione in a repressive sort of voice what makes you think 
 
 in madam she touch him but he yelled and jerked his arm away from her when she went to roll up his sleeve it was his left arm been branded with the dark mark 
 
 ron and hermione looked at each other 
 
 well said ron sounding thoroughly unconvinced 
 
 i think he just wanted to get out of there harry said hermione 
 
 he showed borgin something we see harry pressed on stubbornly something that seriously scared borgin it was the mark i know ithe was showing borgin who he was dealing with you saw how seriously borgin took him 
 
 ron and hermione exchanged another look 
 
 not sure harry 
 
 yeah i still reckon would let malfoy join 
 
 annoyed but absolutely convinced he was right harry snatched up a pile of filthy quidditch robes and left the room mrs weasley had been urging them for days not to leave their washing and packing until the last moment on the landing he bumped into ginny who was returning to her room carrying a pile of freshly laundered clothes 
 
 i go in the kitchen just now she warned him a lot of phlegm around 
 
 be careful not to slip in it harry smiled 
 
 sure enough when he entered the kitchen it was to find fleur sitting at the kitchen table in full flow about plans for her wedding to bill while mrs weasley kept watch over a pile of sprouts looking 
 
 bill and i ave almost decided on only two bridesmaids ginny and gabrielle will look very sweet togezzer i am theenking of dressing zem in pale goldpink would of course be orrible with air 
 
 ah harry said mrs weasley loudly cutting across monologue good i wanted to explain about the security arrangements for the journey to hogwarts tomorrow got ministry cars again and there will be aurors waiting at the station 
 
 is tonks going to be there asked harry handing over his quidditch things 
 
 no i think so been stationed somewhere else from what arthur said 
 
 she has let erself go zat tonks fleur mused examining her own stunning reflection in the back of a teaspoon a big mistake if you ask 
 
 yes thank you said mrs weasley tartly cutting across fleur again better get on harry i want the trunks ready tonight if possible so we have the usual scramble 
 
 and in fact their departure the following morning was smoother than usual the ministry cars glided up to the front of the burrow to find them waiting trunks packed cat crookshanks safely enclosed in his traveling basket and hedwig owl pigwidgeon and new purple pygmy puff arnold in cages 
 
 au revoir arry said fleur throatily kissing him goodbye ron hurried forward looking hopeful but ginny stuck out her foot and ron fell sprawling in the dust at feet furious and he hurried into the car without saying goodbye 
 
 there was no cheerful hagrid waiting for them at cross station instead two bearded aurors in dark muggle suits moved forward the moment the cars stopped and flanking the party marched them into the station without speaking 
 
 quick quick through the barrier said mrs weasley who seemed a little flustered by this austere efficiency harry had better go first with 
 
 she looked inquiringly at one of the aurors who nodded briefly seized upper arm and attempted to steer him toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten 
 
 i can walk thanks said harry irritably jerking his arm out of the grip he pushed his trolley directly at the solid barrier ignoring his silent companion and found himself a second later standing on platform nine and where the scarlet hogwarts express stood belching steam over the crowd 
 
 hermione and the weasleys joined him within seconds without waiting to consult his auror harry motioned to ron and hermione to follow him up the platform looking for an empty compartment 
 
 we harry said hermione looking apologetic ron and got to go to the prefects carriage first and then patrol the corridors for a bit 
 
 oh yeah i forgot said harry 
 
 better get straight on the train all of you only got a few minutes to go said mrs weasley consulting her watch well have a lovely term ron 
 
 mr weasley can i have a quick word said harry making up his mind on the spur of the moment 
 
 of course said mr weasley who looked slightly surprised but followed harry out of earshot of the others nevertheless 
 
 harry had thought it through carefully and come to the conclusion that if he was to tell anyone mr weasley was the right person firstly because he worked at the ministry and was therefore in the best position to make further investigations and secondly because he thought that there was not too much risk of mr weasley exploding with anger 
 
 he could see mrs weasley and the auror casting the pair of them suspicious looks as they moved away 
 
 when we were in diagon alley harry began but mr weasley forestalled him with a grimace 
 
 am i about to discover where you ron and hermione disappeared to while you were supposed to be in the back room of fred and shop 
 
 how did you 
 
 harry please talking to the man who raised fred and george 
 
 er yeah all right we in the back room 
 
 very well then hear the worst 
 
 well we followed draco malfoy we used my invisibility cloak 
 
 did you have any particular reason for doing so or was it a mere whim 
 
 because i thought malfoy was up to something said harry disregarding mr look of mingled exasperation and amusement given his mother the slip and i wanted to know why 
 
 of course you did said mr weasley sounding resigned well did you find out why 
 
 he went into borgin and burkes said harry and started bullying the bloke in there borgin to help him fix something and he said he wanted borgin to keep something else for him he made it sound like it was the same kind of thing that needed fixing like they were a pair and 
 
 harry took a deep breath 
 
 something else we saw malfoy jump about a mile when madam malkin tried to touch his left arm i think been branded with the dark mark i think replaced his father as a death eater 
 
 mr weasley looked taken aback after a moment he said harry i doubt whether would allow a 
 
 does anyone really know what would or do asked harry angrily mr weasley sorry but it worth investigating if malfoy wants something fixing and he needs to threaten borgin to get it done probably something dark or dangerous it 
 
 i doubt it to be honest harry said mr weasley slowly you see when lucius malfoy was arrested we raided his house we took away everything that might have been dangerous 
 
 i think you missed something said harry stubbornly 
 
 well maybe said mr weasley but harry could tell that mr weasley was humoring him 
 
 there was a whistle behind them nearly everyone had boarded the train and the doors were closing 
 
 better hurry said mr weasley as mrs weasley cried harry quickly 
 
 he hurried forward and mr and mrs weasley helped him load his trunk onto the train 
 
 now dear coming to us for christmas all fixed with dumbledore so see you quite soon said mrs weasley through the window as harry slammed the door shut behind him and the train began to move you make sure you look after yourself and 
 
 the train was gathering speed 
 
 be good and she was jogging to keep up now 
 
 stay safe 
 
 harry waved until the train had turned a corner and mr and mrs weasley were lost to view then turned to see where the others had got to he supposed ron and hermione were cloistered in the prefects carriage but ginny was a little way along the corridor chatting to some friends he made his way toward her dragging his trunk 
 
 people stared shamelessly as he approached they even pressed their faces against the windows of their compartments to get a look at him he had expected an upswing in the amount of gaping and gawping he would have to endure this term after all the chosen one rumors in the daily prophet but he did not enjoy the sensation of standing in a very bright spotlight he tapped ginny on the shoulder 
 
 fancy trying to find a compartment 
 
 i harry i said meet dean said ginny brightly see you later 
 
 right said harry he felt a strange twinge of annoyance as she walked away her long red hair dancing behind her he had become so used to her presence over the summer that he had almost forgotten that ginny did not hang around with him ron and hermione while at school then he blinked and looked around he was surrounded by mesmerized girls 
 
 hi harry said a familiar voice from behind him 
 
 neville said harry in relief turning to see a boy struggling toward him 
 
 hello harry said a girl with long hair and large misty eyes who was just behind neville 
 
 luna hi how are you 
 
 very well thank you said luna she was clutching a magazine to her chest large letters on the front announced that there was a pair of free spectrespecs inside 
 
 the quibbler still going strong then asked harry who felt a certain fondness for the magazine having given it an exclusive interview the previous year 
 
 oh yes well up said luna happily 
 
 find seats said harry and the three of them set off along the train through hordes of silently staring students at last they found an empty compartment and harry hurried inside gratefully 
 
 even staring at us said neville indicating himself and luna because with you 
 
 staring at you because you were at the ministry too said harry as he hoisted his trunk into the luggage rack our little adventure there was all over the daily prophet you seen it 
 
 yes i thought gran would be angry about all the publicity said neville but she was really pleased says starting to live up to my dad at long last she bought me a new wand look 
 
 he pulled it out and showed it to harry 
 
 cherry and unicorn hair he said proudly we think it was one of the last ollivander ever sold he vanished next dayoi come back here trevor 
 
 and he dived under the seat to retrieve his toad as it made one of its frequent bids for freedom 
 
 are we still doing meetings this year harry asked luna who was detaching a pair of psychedelic spectacles from the middle of the quibbler 
 
 no point now got rid of umbridge is there said harry sitting down neville bumped his head against the seat as he emerged from under it he looked most disappointed 
 
 i liked the i learned loads with you 
 
 i enjoyed the meetings too said luna serenely it was like having friends 
 
 this was one of those uncomfortable things luna often said and which made harry feel a squirming mixture of pity and embarrassment before he could respond however there was a disturbance outside their compartment door a group of girls was whispering and giggling together on the other side of the glass 
 
 you ask him 
 
 no you 
 
 do it 
 
 and one of them a girl with large dark eyes a prominent chin and long black hair pushed her way through the door 
 
 hi harry romilda romilda vane she said loudly and confidently why you join us in our compartment you have to sit with them she added in a stage whisper indicating bottom which was sticking out from under the seat again as he groped around for trevor and luna who was now wearing her free spectrespecs which gave her the look of a demented multicolored owl 
 
 friends of mine said harry coldly 
 
 oh said the girl looking very surprised oh okay 
 
 and she withdrew sliding the door closed behind her 
 
 people expect you to have cooler friends than us said luna once again displaying her knack for embarrassing honesty 
 
 you are cool said harry shortly none of them was at the ministry they fight with me 
 
 a very nice thing to say beamed luna then she pushed her spectrespecs farther up her nose and settled down to read the quibbler 
 
 we face him though said neville emerging from under the seat with fluff and dust in his hair and a trevor in his hand you did you should hear my gran talk about you that harry got more backbone than the whole ministry of magic put together give anything to have you as a grandson 
 
 harry laughed uncomfortably and changed the subject to results as soon as he could while neville recited his grades and wondered aloud whether he would be allowed to take a transfiguration with only an acceptable harry watched him without really listening 
 
 childhood had been blighted by voldemort just as much as had but neville had no idea how close he had come to having destiny the prophecy could have referred to either of them yet for his own inscrutable reasons voldemort had chosen to believe that harry was the one meant 
 
 had voldemort chosen neville it would be neville sitting opposite harry bearing the scar and the weight of the prophecy or would it would mother have died to save him as lily had died for harry surely she would but what if she had been unable to stand between her son and voldemort would there then have been no chosen one at all an empty seat where neville now sat and a scarless harry who would have been kissed goodbye by his own mother not 
 
 you all right harry you look funny said neville 
 
 harry started 
 
 sorryi 
 
 wrackspurt got you asked luna sympathetically peering at harry through her enormous colored spectacles 
 
 iwhat 
 
 a wrackspurt invisible they float in through your ears and make your brain go fuzzy she said i thought i felt one zooming around in here 
 
 she flapped her hands at thin air as though beating off large invisible moths harry and neville caught each eyes and hastily began to talk of quidditch 
 
 the weather beyond the train windows was as patchy as it had been all summer they passed through stretches of the chilling mist then out into weak clear sunlight it was during one of the clear spells when the sun was visible almost directly overhead that ron and hermione entered the compartment at last 
 
 wish the lunch trolley would hurry up starving said ron longingly slumping into the seat beside harry and rubbing his stomach hi neville hi luna guess what he added turning to harry not doing prefect duty just sitting in his compartment with the other slytherins we saw him when we passed 
 
 harry sat up straight interested it was not like malfoy to pass up the chance to demonstrate his power as prefect which he had happily abused all the previous year 
 
 what did he do when he saw you 
 
 the usual said ron indifferently demonstrating a rude hand gesture not like him though is it well that did the hand gesture why he out there bullying first years 
 
 dunno said harry but his mind was racing this look as though malfoy had more important things on his mind than bullying younger students 
 
 maybe he preferred the inquisitorial squad said hermione maybe being a prefect seems a bit tame after that 
 
 i think so said harry i think 
 
 but before he could expound on his theory the compartment door slid open again and a breathless girl stepped inside 
 
 supposed to deliver these to neville longbottom and harry she faltered as her eyes met and she turned scarlet she was holding out two scrolls of parchment tied with violet ribbon perplexed harry and neville took the scroll addressed to each of them and the girl stumbled back out of the compartment 
 
 what is it ron demanded as harry unrolled his 
 
 an invitation said harry 
 
 harry 
 i would be delighted if you would join me for a bite of lunch in compartment c 
 sincerely professor slughorn 
 professor slughorn asked neville looked perplexedly at his own invitation 
 
 new teacher said harry well i suppose have to go we 
 
 but what does he want me for asked neville nervously as though he was expecting detention 
 
 no idea said harry which was not entirely true though he had no proof yet that his hunch was correct listen he added seized by a sudden brain wave go under the invisibility cloak then we might get a good look at malfoy on the way see what up to 
 
 this idea however came to nothing the corridors which were packed with people on the lookout for the lunch trolley were impossible to negotiate while wearing the cloak harry stowed it regretfully back in his bag reflecting that it would have been nice to wear it just to avoid all the staring which seemed to have increased in intensity even since he had last walked down the train every now and then students would hurtle out of their compartments to get a better look at him the exception was cho chang who darted into her compartment when she saw harry coming as harry passed the window he saw her deep in determined conversation with her friend marietta who was wearing a very thick layer of makeup that did not entirely obscure the odd formation of pimples still etched across her face smirking slightly harry pushed on 
 
 when they reached compartment c they saw at once that they were not only invitees although judging by the enthusiasm of welcome harry was the most warmly anticipated 
 
 harry said slughorn jumping up at the sight of him so that his great belly seemed to fill all the remaining space in the compartment his shiny bald head and great silvery mustache gleamed as brightly in the sunlight as the golden buttons on his waistcoat good to see you good to see you and you must be mr longbottom 
 
 neville nodded looking scared at a gesture from slughorn they sat down opposite each other in the only two empty seats which were nearest the door harry glanced around at their fellow guests he recognized a slytherin from their year a tall black boy with high cheekbones and long slanting eyes there were also two boys harry did not know and squashed in the corner beside slughorn and looking as though she was not entirely sure how she had got there ginny 
 
 now do you know everyone slughorn asked harry and neville blaise zabini is in your year of course 
 
 zabini did not make any sign of recognition or greeting nor did harry or neville gryffindor and slytherin students loathed each other on principle 
 
 this is cormac mclaggen perhaps come across each other no 
 
 mclaggen a large youth raised a hand and harry and neville nodded back at him 
 
 and this is marcus belby i know whether 
 
 belby who was thin and gave a strained smile 
 
 and this charming young lady tells me she knows you slughorn finished 
 
 ginny grimaced at harry and neville from behind back 
 
 well now this is most pleasant said slughorn cozily a chance to get to know you all a little better here take a napkin packed my own lunch the trolley as i remember it is heavy on licorice wands and a poor old digestive system quite up to such things pheasant belby 
 
 belby started and accepted what looked like half a cold pheasant 
 
 i was just telling young marcus here that i had the pleasure of teaching his uncle damocles slughorn told harry and neville now passing around a basket of rolls outstanding wizard outstanding and his order of merlin most do you see much of your uncle marcus 
 
 unfortunately beiby had just taken a large mouthful of pheasant in his haste to answer slughorn he swallowed too fast turned purple and began to choke 
 
 anapneo said slughorn calmly pointing his wand at belby whose airway seemed to clear at once 
 
 not not much of him no gasped belby his eyes streaming 
 
 well of course i daresay busy said slughorn looking questioningly at belby i doubt he invented the wolfsbane potion without considerable hard work 
 
 i suppose said belby who seemed afraid to take another bite of pheasant until he was sure that slughorn had finished with him er he and my dad get on very well you see so i really know much about 
 
 his voice tailed away as slughorn gave him a cold smile and turned to mclaggen instead 
 
 now you cormac said slughorn i happen to know you see a lot of your uncle tiberius because he has a rather splendid picture of the two of you hunting nogtails in i think norfolk 
 
 oh yeah that was fun that was said mclaggen we went with bertie higgs and rufus scrimgeourthis was before he became minister obviously 
 
 ah you know bertie and rufus too beamed slughorn now offering around a small tray of pies somehow belby was missed out now tell me 
 
 it was as harry had suspected everyone here seemed to have been invited because they were connected to somebody or influential everyone except ginny zabini who was interrogated after mclaggen turned out to have a famously beautiful witch for a mother from what harry could make out she had been married seven times each of her husbands dying mysteriously and leaving her mounds of gold it was turn next this was a very uncomfortable ten minutes for parents aurors had been tortured into insanity by bellatrix lestrange and a couple of death eater cronies at the end of interview harry had the impression that slughorn was reserving judgment on neville yet to see whether he had any of his parents flair 
 
 and now said slughorn shifting massively in his seat with the air of a compere introducing his star act harry potter where to begin i feel i barely scratched the surface when we met over the summer 
 
 he contemplated harry for a moment as though he was a particularly large and succulent piece of pheasant then said the chosen one calling you now 
 
 harry said nothing belby mclaggen and zabini were all staring at him 
 
 of course said slughorn watching harry closely there have been rumors for years i remember whenwellafter that terrible nightlilyjamesand you survivedand the word was that you must have powers beyond the ordinary 
 
 zabini gave a tiny little cough that was clearly supposed to indicate amused skepticism an angry voice burst out from behind slughorn 
 
 yeah zabini because so talented at posing 
 
 oh dear chuckled slughorn comfortably looking around at ginny who was glaring at zabini around great belly you want to be careful blaise i saw this young lady perform the most marvelous hex as i was passing her carriage i cross her 
 
 zabini merely looked contemptuous 
 
 anyway said slughorn turning back to harry such rumors this summer of course one know what to believe the prophet has been known to print inaccuracies make mistakes but there seems little doubt given the number of witnesses that there was quite a disturbance at the ministry and that you were there in the thick of it all 
 
 harry who could not see any way out of this without flatly lying nodded but still said nothing slughorn beamed at him 
 
 so modest so modest no wonder dumbledore is so fondyou were there then but the rest of the storiesso sensational of course one know quite what to believethis fabled prophecy for instance 
 
 we never heard a prophecy said neville turning geranium pink as he said it 
 
 right said ginny staunchly neville and i were both there too and all this chosen one rubbish is just the prophet making things up as usual 
 
 you were both there too were you said slughorn with great interest looking from ginny to neville but both of them sat before his encouraging smile yes well it is true that the prophet often exaggerates of course slughorn said sounding a little disappointed i remember dear gwenog telling me gwenog jones i mean of course captain of the holyhead harpies 
 
 he meandered off into a reminiscence but harry had the distinct impression that slughorn had not finished with him and that he had not been convinced by neville and ginny 
 
 the afternoon wore on with more anecdotes about illustrious wizards slughorn had taught all of whom had been delighted to join what he called the slug club at hogwarts harry could not wait to leave but see how to do so politely finally the train emerged from yet another long misty stretch into a red sunset and slughorn looked around blinking in the twilight 
 
 good gracious getting dark already i notice that lit the lamps better go and change into your robes all of you mclaggen you must drop by and borrow that book on nogtails harry blaise any time passing same goes for you miss he twinkled at ginny well off you go off you go 
 
 as he pushed past harry into the darkening corridor zabini shot him a filthy look that harry returned with interest he ginny and neville followed zabini back along the train 
 
 glad over muttered neville strange man he 
 
 yeah he is a bit said harry his eyes on zabini how come you ended up in there ginny 
 
 he saw me hex zacharias smith said ginny you remember that idiot from hufflepuff who was in the he kept on and on asking about what happened at the ministry and in the end he annoyed me so much i hexed himwhen slughorn came in i thought i was going to got detention but he just thought it was a really good hex and invited me to lunch mad eh 
 
 better reason for inviting someone than because their famous said harry scowling at the back of head or because their uncle 
 
 but he broke off an idea had just occurred to him a reckless but potentially wonderful idea in a time zabini was going to the slytherin compartment and malfoy would be sitting there thinking himself unheard by anybody except fellow slytherins if harry could only enter unseen behind him what might he not see or hear true there was little of the journey lefthogsmeade station had to be less than half an hour away judging by the wildness of the scenery flashing by the windowsbut nobody else seemed prepared to take suspicions seriously so it was down to him to prove them 
 
 see you two later said harry under his breath pulling out his invisibility cloak and flinging it over himself 
 
 but you asked neville 
 
 later whispered harry darting after zabini as quietly as possible though the rattling of the train made such caution almost pointless 
 
 the corridors were almost completely empty now nearly everyone had returned to their carriages to change into their school robes and pack up their possessions though he was as close as he could get to zabini without touching him harry was not quick enough to slip into the compartment when zabini opened the door zabini was already sliding it shut when harry hastily stuck out his foot to prevent it closing 
 
 wrong with this thing said zabini angrily as he smashed the sliding door repeatedly into foot 
 
 harry seized the door and pushed it open hard zabini still clinging on to the handle toppled over sideways into gregory lap and in the ensuing ruckus harry darted into the compartment leapt onto temporarily empty seat and hoisted himself up into the luggage rack it was fortunate that goyle and zabini were snarling at each other drawing all eyes onto them for harry was quite sure his feet and ankles had been revealed as the cloak had flapped around them indeed for one horrible moment he thought he saw eyes follow his trainer as it whipped upward out of sight but then goyle slammed the door shut and flung zabini off him zabini collapsed into his own seat looking ruffled vincent crabbe returned to his comic and malfoy sniggering lay back down across two seats with his head in pansy lap harry lay curled uncomfortably under the cloak to ensure that every inch of him remained hidden and watched pansy stroke the sleek blond hair off forehead smirking as she did so as though anyone would have loved to have been in her place the lanterns swinging from the carriage ceiling cast a bright light over the scene harry could read every word of comic directly below him 
 
 so zabini said malfoy what did slughorn want 
 
 just trying to make up to people said zabini who was still glowering at goyle not that he managed to find many 
 
 this information did not seem to please malfoy 
 
 who else had he invited he demanded 
 
 mclaggen from gryffindor said zabini 
 
 oh yeah his big in the ministry said malfoy 
 
 someone else called belby from ravenclaw 
 
 not him a prat said pansy 
 
 and longbottom potter and that weasley girl finished zabini 
 
 malfoy sat up very suddenly knocking hand aside 
 
 he invited longbottom 
 
 well i assume so as longbottom was there said zabini indifferently 
 
 longbottom got to interest slughorn 
 
 zabini shrugged 
 
 potter precious potter obviously he wanted a look at the chosen one sneered malfoy but that weasley girl so special about her 
 
 a lot of boys like her said pansy watching malfoy out of the corner of her eyes for his reaction even you think you blaise and we all know how hard you are to please 
 
 i touch a filthy little blood traitor like her whatever she looked like said zabini coldly and pansy looked pleased malfoy sank back across her lap and allowed her to resume the stroking of his hair 
 
 well i pity taste maybe going a bit senile shame my father always said he was a good wizard in his day my father used to be a bit of a favorite of his slughorn probably heard on the train or 
 
 i bank on an invitation said zabini he asked me about father when i first arrived they used to be old friends apparently but when he heard been caught at the ministry he look happy and nott get an invitation did he i think interested in death eaters 
 
 malfoy looked angry but forced out a singularly humorless laugh 
 
 well who cares what interested in what is he when you come down to it just some stupid teacher malfoy yawned ostentatiously i mean i might not even be at hogwarts next year it matter to me if some fat old likes me or not 
 
 what do you mean you might not be at hogwarts next year said pansy indignantly ceasing grooming malfoy at once 
 
 well you never know said malfoy with the ghost of a smirk i might haveermoved on to bigger and better things 
 
 crouched in the luggage rack under his cloak heart began to race what would ron and hermione say about this crabbe and goyle were gawping at malfoy apparently they had had no inkling of any plans to move on to bigger and better things even zabini had allowed a look of curiosity to mar his haughty features pansy resumed the slow stroking of malfoy s hair looking dumbfounded 
 
 do you meanhim 
 
 malfoy shrugged 
 
 mother wants me to complete my education but personally i see it as that important these days i mean think about it when the dark lord takes over is he going to care how many or got of course he be all about the kind of service he received the level of devotion he was shown 
 
 and you think be able to do something for him asked zabini scathingly sixteen years old and not even fully qualified yet 
 
 just said i maybe he care if qualified maybe the job he wants me to do something that you need to be qualified for said malfoy quietly 
 
 crabbe and goyle were both sitting with their mouths open like gargoyles pansy was gazing down at malfoy as though she had never seen anything so 
 
 i can see hogwarts said malfoy clearly relishing the effect he had created as he pointed out of the blackened window better get our robes on 
 
 harry was so busy staring at malfoy he did not notice goyle reaching up for his trunk as he swung it down it hit harry hard on the side of the head he let out an involuntary gasp of pain and malfoy looked up at the luggage rack frowning 
 
 harry was not afraid of malfoy but he still did not much like the idea of being discovered hiding under his invisibility cloak by a group of unfriendly slytherins eyes still watering and head still throbbing he drew his wand careful not to disarrange the cloak and waited breath held to his relief malfoy seemed to decide that he had imagined the noise he pulled on his robes like the others locked his trunk and as the train slowed to a jerky crawl fastened a thick new traveling cloak round his neck 
 
 harry could see the corridors filling up again and hoped that hermione and ron would take his things out onto the platform for him he was stuck where he was until the compartment had quite emptied at last with a final lurch the train came to a complete halt goyle threw the door open and muscled his way out into a crowd of second years punching them aside crabbe and zabini followed 
 
 you go on malfoy told pansy who was waiting for him with her hand held out as though hoping he would hold it i just want to check something 
 
 pansy left now harry and malfoy were alone in the compartment people were filing past descending onto the dark platform malfoy moved over to the compartment door and let down the blinds so that people in the corridor beyond could not peer in he then bent down over his trunk and opened it again 
 
 harry peered down over the edge of the luggage rack his heart pumping a little faster what had malfoy wanted to hide from pansy was he about to see the mysterious broken object it was so important to mend 
 
 petrificus totalus 
 
 without warning malfoy pointed his wand at harry who was instantly paralyzed as though in slow motion he toppled out of the luggage rack and fell with an agonizing crash at feet the invisibility cloak trapped beneath him his whole body revealed with his legs still curled absurdly into the cramped kneeling position he move a muscle he could only gaze up at malfoy who smiled broadly 
 
 i thought so he said jubilantly i heard trunk hit you and i thought i saw something white flash through the air after zabini came back his eyes lingered for a moment upon trainers that was you blocking the door when zabini came back in i suppose 
 
 he considered harry a moment 
 
 you hear anything i care about potter but while got you here 
 
 and he stamped hard on face harry felt his nose break blood spurted everywhere 
 
 from my father now see 
 
 malfoy dragged the cloak out from under immobilized body and threw it over him 
 
 i reckon find you till the back in london he said quietly see you around potter or not 
 
 and taking care to tread on fingers malfoy left the compartment 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the half blood prince 
 

lionfish nov chapter seven the will of albus dumbledorecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 he was walking along a mountain road in the cool blue light of dawn far below swathed in mist was the shadow of a small town was the man he sought down there the man he needed so badly he could think of little else the man who held the answer the answer to his problem 
 
 oi wake up 
 
 harry opened his eyes he was lying again on the camp bed in rons dingy attic room the sun had not yet risen and the room was still shadowy pigwidgeon was asleep with his head under his tiny wing the scar on harrys forehead was prickling 
 
 you were muttering in your sleep 
 
 was i 
 
 yeah gregorovitch you kept saying gregorovitch 
 
 harry was not wearing his glasses rons face appeared slightly blurred 
 
 whos gregorovitch 
 
 i dunno do i you were the one saying it 
 
 harry rubbed his forehead thinking he had a vague idea he had heard the name before but he could not think where 
 
 i think voldemorts looking for him 
 
 poor bloke said ron fervently 
 
 harry sat up still rubbing his scar now wide awake he tried to remember exactly what he had seen in the dream but all that came back was a mountainous horizon and the outline of the little village cradled in a deep valley 
 
 i think hes abroad 
 
 who gregorovitch 
 
 voldemort i think hes somewhere abroad looking for gregorovitch it didnt look like anywhere in britain 
 
 you reckon you were seeing into his mind again 
 
 ron sounded worried 
 
 do me a favor and dont tell hermione said harry although how she expects me to stop seeing stuff in my sleep 
 
 he gazed up at little pigwidgeons cage thinkingwhy was the name gregorovitch familiar 
 
 i think he said slowly hes got something to do with quidditch theres some connection but i cantci cant think what it is 
 
 quidditch said ron sure youre not thinking of gorgovitch 
 
 who 
 
 dragomir gorgovitch chaser transferred to the chudley cannons for a record fee two years ago record holder for most quaffle drops in a season 
 
 no said harry im definitely not thinking of gorgovitch 
 
 i try not to either said ron well happy birthday anyway 
 
 wow c thats right i forgot im seventeen 
 
 harry seized the wand lying beside his camp bed pointed it at the cluttered desk where he had left his glasses and said accio glasses although they were only around a foot away there was something immensely satisfying about seeing them zoom toward him at least until they poked him in the eye 
 
 slick snorted ron 
 
 reveling in the removal of his trace harry sent rons possessions flying around the room causing pigwidgeon to wake up and flutter excitedly around his cage harry also tried tying the laces of his trainers by magic the resultant knot took several minutes to untie by hand and purely for the pleasure of it turned the orange robes on rons chudley cannons posters bright blue 
 
 id do your fly by hand though ron advised harry sniggering when harry immediately checked it heres your present unwrap it up here its not for my mothers eyes 
 
 a book said harry as he took the rectangular parcel bit of a departure from tradition isnt it 
 
 this isnt your average book said ron itd pure gold twelve ways to charm witches explains everything you need to know about girls if only id had this last year id have known exactly how to get rid of lavender and i wouldve known how to get going with well fred and george gave me a copy and ive learned a lot youd be surprised its not all about wandwork either 
 
 when they arrived in the kitchen they found a pile of presents waiting on the table bill and monsieur delacour were finishing their breakfasts while mrs weasley stood chatting to them over the frying pan 
 
 arthur told me to wish you a happy seventeenth harry said mrs weasley beaming at him he had to leave early for work but hell be back for dinner thats our present on top 
 
 harry sat down took the square parcel she had indicated and unwrapped it inside was a watch very like the one mr and mrs weasley had given ron for his seventeenth it was gold with stars circling around the race instead of hands 
 
 its traditional to give a wizard a watch when he comes of age said mrs weasley watching him anxiously from beside the cooker im afraid that one isnt new like rons it was actually my brother fabians and he wasnt terribly careful with his possessions its a bit dented on the back butc 
 
 the rest of her speech was lost harry had got up and hugged her he tried to put a lot of unsaid things into the hug and perhaps she understood them because she patted his cheek clumsily when he released her then waved her wand in a slightly random way causing half a pack of bacon to flop out of the frying pan onto the floor 
 
 happy birthday harry said hermione hurrying into the kitchen and adding her own present to the top of the pile its not much but i hope you like it what did you get him she added to ron who seemed not to hear her 
 
 come on then open hermiones said ron 
 
 she had bought him a new sneakoscope the other packages contained an enchanted razor from bill and fleur ah yes zis will give you ze smoothest shave you will ever ave monsieur delacour assured him but you must tell it clearly what you wantozzerwise you might find you ave a leetle less hair zan you would like chocolates from the delacours and an enormous box of the latest weasleys wizard wheezes merchandise from fred and george 
 
 harry ron and hermione did not linger at the table as the arrival of madame delacour fleur and gabrielle made the kitchen uncomfortably crowded 
 
 ill pack these for you hermione said brightly taking harrys presents out of his arms as the three of them headed back upstairs im nearly done im just waiting for the rest of your underpants to come out of the wash ronc 
 
 rons splutter was interrupted by the opening of a door on the landing 
 
 harry will you come in here a moment 
 
 it was ginny ron came to an abrupt halt but hermione took him by the elbow and tugged him on up the stairs feeling nervous harry followed ginny into her room 
 
 he had never been inside it before it was small but bright there was a large poster of the wizarding band the weird sisters on one wall and a picture of gwenog jones captain of the quidditch team the holyhead harpies on the other a desk stood facing the open window which looked out over the orchard where he and ginny had once played a quidditch with ron and hermione and which now housed a large pearly white marquee the golden flag on top was level with ginnys window 
 
 ginny looked up into harrys face took a deep breath and said happy seventeenth 
 
 yeahthanks 
 
 she was looking at him steadily he however found it difficult to look back at her it was like gazing into a brilliant light 
 
 nice view he said feebly pointing toward with window 
 
 she ignored this he could not blame her 
 
 i couldnt think what to get you she said 
 
 you didnt have to get me anything 
 
 she disregarded this too 
 
 i didnt know what would be useful nothing too big because you wouldnt be able to take it with you 
 
 he chanced a glance at her she was not tearful that was one of the many wonderful things about ginny she was rarely weepy he had sometimes thought that having six brothers must have toughened her up 
 
 she took a step closer to him 
 
 so then i thought id like you to have something to remember me by you know if you meet some veela when youre off doing whatever youre doing 
 
 i think dating opportunities are going to be pretty thin on the ground to be honest 
 
 theres the silver lining ive been looking for she whispered and then she was kissing him as she had never kissed him before and harry was kissing her back and it was blissful oblivion better than firewhisky she was the only real thing in the world ginny the feel of her one hand at her back and one in her long hairc the door banged open behind them and they jumped apart 
 
 oh said ron pointedly sorry 
 
 ron hermione was just behind him slight out of breath there was a strained silence then ginny had said in a flat little voice well happy birthday anyway harry 
 
 rons ears were scarlet hermione looked nervous harry wanted to slam the door in their faces but it felt as though a cold draft had entered the room when the door opened and his shining moment had popped like a soap bubble all the reasons for ending his relationship with ginny for staying well away from her seemed to have slunk inside the room with ron and all happy forgetfulness was gone 
 
 he looked at ginny wanting to say something though he hardly knew what but she had turned her back on him he thought that she might have succumbed for once to tears he could not do anything to comfort her in front of ron 
 
 ill see you later he said and followed the other two out of the bedroom 
 
 ron marched downstairs though the kitchen and into the yard and harry kept pace with him all the way hermione trotting along behind them looking scared 
 
 once he reached the seclusion of the freshly mown lawn ron rounded on harry 
 
 you ditched her what are you doing now messing her around 
 
 im not messing her around said harry as hermione caught up with them 
 
 ronc 
 
 but ron held up a hand to silence her 
 
 she was really cut up when you ended itc 
 
 so was i you know why i stopped it and it wasnt because i wanted to 
 
 yeah but you go snogging her now and shes just going to get her hopes up againc 
 
 shes not an idiot she knows it cant happen shes not expecting us tocto end up married orc 
 
 as he said it a vivid picture formed in harrys mind of ginny in a white dress marrying a tall faceless and unpleasant stranger 
 
 in one spiraling moment it seemed to hit him her future was free and unencumbered whereas hishe could see nothing but voldemort ahead 
 
 if you keep groping her every chance you getc 
 
 it wont happen again said harry harshly the day was cloudless but he felt as though the sun had gone in okay 
 
 ron looked half resentful half sheepish he rocked backward and forward on his feet for a moment then said right then well thatsyeah 
 
 
 
 
 ginny did not seek another meeting with harry for the rest of the day nor by any look or gesture did she show that they had shared more than polite conversation in her room nevertheless charlies arrival came as a relief to harry it provided a distraction watching mrs weasley force charlie into a chair raise her wand threateningly and announce that he was about to get a proper haircut 
 
 as harrys birthday dinner would have stretched the burrows kitchen to breaking point even before the arrival of charlie lupin tonks and hagrid several tables were placed end to end in the garden fred and george bewitched a number of purple lanterns all emblazoned with a large number to hang in midair over the guests thanks to mrs weasleys ministrations georges wound was neat and clean but harry was not yet used to the dark hole in the side of his head despite the twins many jokes about it 
 
 hermione made purple and gold streamers erupt from the end of her wand and drape themselves artistically over the trees and bushes 
 
 nice said ron as with one final flourish of her wand hermione turned the leaves on the crabapple tree to gold youve really got an eye for that sort of thing 
 
 thank you ron said hermione looking both pleased and a little confused harry turned away smiling to himself he had a funny notion that he would find a chapter on compliments when he found time to peruse his copy of twelve ways to charm witches he caught ginnys eye and grinned at her before remembering his promise to ron and hurriedly striking up a conversation with monsieur delacour 
 
 out of the way out of the way sang mrs weasley coming through the gate with what appeared to be a giant snitch floating in front of her seconds later harry realized that it was his birthday cake which mrs weasley was suspending with her wand rather than risk carrying it over the uneven ground when the cake had finally landed in the middle of the table harry said that looks amazing mrs weasley 
 
 oh its nothing dear she said fondly over her shoulder ron gave harry the and mouthed good one 
 
 by seven oclock all the guests had arrived led into the house by fred and george who had waited for them at the end of the lane hagrid had honored the occasion by wearing his best and horrible hairy brown suit although lupin smiled as he shook harrys hand harry thought he looked rather unhappy it was all very odd tonks beside him looked simply radiant 
 
 happy birthday harry she said hugging him tightly 
 
 seventeen eh said hagrid as he accepted a glass of wine from fred six years ter the day since we met harry dyeh remember it 
 
 vaguely said harry grinning up at him didnt you smash down the front door give dudley a pigs tail and tell me i was a wizard 
 
 i forge the details hagrid chortled all righ ron hermione 
 
 were fine said hermione how are you 
 
 ar not bad bin busy we got some newborn unicorns ill show yeh when yeh get backc harry avoided rons and hermiones gazes as hagrid rummaged in his pocket here harry c couldnt think what ter get teh but then i remembered this he pulled out a small slightly furry drawstring pouch with a long string evidently intended to be worn around the neck mokeskin hide anythin in there an no one but the owner can get it out theyre rare them 
 
 hagrid thanks 
 
 snothin said hagrid with a wave of a hand an theres charlie always liked him c hey charlie 
 
 charlie approached running his hand slightly ruefully over his new brutally short haircut he was shorter than ron thickset with a number of burns and scratches up his muscled arms 
 
 hi hagrid hows it going 
 
 bin meanin ter write fer ages hows norbert doin 
 
 norbert charlie laughed the norwegian ridgeback we call her norberta now 
 
 wha c norberts a girl 
 
 oh yeah said charlie 
 
 how can you tell asked hermione 
 
 theyre a lot more vicious said charlie he looked over his shoulder and dropped his voice wish dad would hurry up and get here mums getting edgy 
 
 they all looked over at mrs weasley she was trying to talk to madame delacour while glancing repeatedly at the gate 
 
 i think wed better start without arthur she called to the garden at large after a moment or two he must have been held up at c oh 
 
 they all saw it at the same time a streak of light that came flying across the yard and onto the table where it resolved itself into a bright silver weasel which stood on its hind legs and spoke with mr weasleys voice 
 
 minister of magic coming with me 
 
 the patronus dissolved into thin air leaving fleurs family peering in astonishment at the place where it had vanished 
 
 we shouldnt be here said lupin at once harry c im sorry c ill explain some other timec 
 
 he seized tonkss wrist and pulled her away they reached the fence climbed over it and vanished from sight mrs weasley looked bewildered 
 
 the minister c but whyc i dont understandc 
 
 but there was no time to discuss the matter a second later mr weasley had appeared out of thin air at the gate accompanied by rufus scrimgeour instantly recognizable by his mane of grizzled hair 
 
 the two newcomers marched across the yard toward the garden and the table where everybody sat in silence watching them draw closer as scrimgeour came within range of the lantern light harry saw that he looked much older than the last time that had met scraggy and grim 
 
 sorry to intrude said scrimgeour as he limped to a halt before the table especially as i can see that i am a party 
 
 his eyes lingered for a moment on the giant snitch cake 
 
 many happy returns 
 
 thanks said harry 
 
 i require a private word with you scrimgeour went on also with mr ronald weasley and miss hermione granger 
 
 us said ron sounding surprised why us 
 
 i shall tell you that when we are somewhere more private said scrimgeour is there such a place he demanded of mr weasley 
 
 yes of course said mr weasley who looked nervous the er sitting room why dont you use that 
 
 you can lead the way scrimgeour said to ron there will be no need for you to accompany us arthur 
 
 harry saw mr weasley exchange a worried look with mrs weasley as he ron and hermione stood up as they led the way back to the house in silence harry knew that the other two were thinking the same as he was scrimgeour must somehow had learned that the three of them were planning to drop out of hogwarts 
 
 scrimgeour did not speak as they all passed through the messed kitchen and into the burrows sitting room although the garden had been full of soft golden evening light it was already dark in here harry flicked his wand at the oil lamps as he entered and they illuminated the shabby but cozy room scrimgeour sat himself in the sagging armchair that mr weasley normally occupied leaving harry ron and hermione to squeeze side by side onto the sofa once they had done so scrimgeour spoke 
 
 i have some questions for the three of you and i think it will be best if we do it individually if you two c he pointed at harry and hermione c can wait upstairs i will start with ronald 
 
 were not going anywhere said harry while hermione nodded vigorously you can speak to us together or not at all 
 
 scrimgeour gave harry a cold appraising look harry had the impression that the minister was wondering whether it was worthwhile opening hostilities this early 
 
 very well then together he said shrugging he cleared his throat i am here as im sure you know because of albus dumbledores will 
 
 harry ron and hermione looked at one another 
 
 a surprise apparently you were not aware then that dumbledore had left you anything 
 
 of us said ron me and hermione too 
 
 yes all of c 
 
 but harry interrupted 
 
 dumbledore died over a month ago why has it taken this long to give us what he left us 
 
 isnt it obvious said hermione before scrimgeour could answer they wanted to examine whatever hes left us you had no right to do that she said and her voice trembled slightly 
 
 i had every right said scrimgeour dismissively the decree for justifiable confiscation gives the ministry the power the confiscate the contents of a willc 
 
 that law was created to stop wizards passing on dark artifacts said hermione and the ministry is supposed to have powerful evidence that the deceaseds possessions are illegal before seizing them are you telling me that you thought dumbledore was trying to pass us something cursed 
 
 are you planning to follow a career in magical law miss granger asked scrimgeour 
 
 no im not retorted hermione im hoping to do some good in the world 
 
 ron laughed scrimgeours eyes flickered toward him and away again as harry spoke 
 
 so why have you decided to let us have our things now cant think of a pretext to keep them 
 
 no itll be because days are up said hermione at once they cant keep the objects longer than that unless they can prove theyre dangerous right 
 
 would you say you were close to dumbledore ronald asked scrimgeour ignoring hermione ron looked startled 
 
 me not c not really it was always harry who 
 
 ron looked around at harry and hermione to see hermione giving him a sort of look but the damage was done scrimgeour looked as though he had heard exactly what he had expected and wanted to hear he swooped like a bird of prey upon rons answer 
 
 if you were not very close to dumbledore how do you account for the fact that he remembered you in his will he made exceptionally few personal bequests the vast majority of his possessions c his private library his magical instruments and other personal effects c were left to hogwarts why do you think you were singled out 
 
 idunno said ron iwhen i say we werent closei mean i think he liked me 
 
 youre being modest ron said hermione dumbledore was very fond of you 
 
 this was stretching the truth to breaking point as far as harry knew ron and dumbledore had never been alone together and direct contact between them had been negligible however scrimgeour did not seem to be listening he put his hand inside his cloak and drew out a drawstring pouch much larger than the one hagrid had given harry from it he removed a scroll of parchment which he unrolled and read aloud 
 
 the last will and testament of albus percival wulfric brian dumbledore yes here we are to ronald bilius weasley i leave my deluminator in the hope that he will remember me when he uses it 
 
 scrimgeour took from the bag an object that harry had seen before it looked something like a silver cigarette lighter but it had he knew the power to suck all light from a place and restore it with a simple click scrimgeour leaned forward and passed the deluminator to ron who took it and turned it over in the fingers looking stunned 
 
 that is a valuable object said scrimgeour watching ron it may even be unique certainly it is of dumbledores own design why would he have left you and item so rare 
 
 ron shook his head looking bewildered 
 
 dumbledore must have taught thousands of students scrimgeour persevered yet the only ones he remembered in his will are you three why is that to what use did he think you would put to the deluminator mr weasley 
 
 put out lights i spose mumbled ron what else could i do with it 
 
 evidently scrimgeour had no suggestions after squinting at ron for a moment or tow he turned back to dumbledores will 
 
 to miss hermione jean granger i leave my copy of the tales of beedle the bard in the hope that she will find it entertaining and instructive 
 
 scrimgeour now pulled out of the bag a small book that looked as ancient as the copy of secrets of the darkest art upstairs its binding was stained and peeling in places hermione took it from scrimgeour without a word she held the book in her lap and gazed at it harry saw that the title was in runes he had never learned to read them as he looked a tear splashed onto the embossed symbols 
 
 why do you think dumbledore left you that book miss granger asked scrimgeour 
 
 he he knew i liked books said hermione in a thick voice mopping her eyes with her sleeve 
 
 but why that particular book 
 
 i dont know he must have thought id enjoy it 
 
 did you ever discuss codes or any means of passing secret messages with dumbledore 
 
 no i didnt said hermione still wiping her eyes on her sleeve and if the ministry hasnt found any hidden codes in this book in days i doubt that i will 
 
 she suppressed a sob they were wedged together so tightly that ron had difficulty extracting his arm to put it around hermiones shoulders scrimgeour turned back to the will 
 
 to harry james potter he read and harrys insides contracted with a sudden excitement i leave the snitch he caught in his first quidditch match at hogwarts as a reminder of the rewards of perseverance and skill 
 
 as scrimgeour pulled out the tiny golden ball its silver wings fluttered rather feebly and harry could not help feeling a definite sense of anticlimax 
 
 why did dumbledore leave you this snitch asked scrimgeour 
 
 no idea said harry for the reasons you just read out i suppose to remind me what you can get if you persevere and whatever it was 
 
 you think this a mere symbolic keepsake then 
 
 i suppose so said harry what else could it be 
 
 im asking the questions said scrimgeour shifting his chair a little closer to the sofa dusk was really falling outside now the marquee beyond the windows towered ghostly white over the hedge 
 
 i notice that your birthday cake is in the shape of a snitch scrimgeour said to harry why is that 
 
 hermione laughed derisively 
 
 oh it cant be a reference to the fact harrys a great seeker thats way too obvious she said there must be a secret message from dumbledore hidden in the icing 
 
 i dont think theres anything hidden in the icing said scrimgeour but a snitch would be a very good hiding place for a small object you know why im sure 
 
 harry shrugged hermione however answered harry thought that answering questions correctly was such a deeply ingrained habit she could not suppress the urge 
 
 because snitches have flesh memories she said 
 
 what said harry and ron together both considered hermiones quidditch knowledge negligible 
 
 correct said scrimgeour a snitch is not touched by bare skin before it is released not even by the maker who wears gloves it carries an enchantment by which it can identify the first human to lay hands upon it in case of a disputed capture this snitch c he held up the tiny golden ball c will remember your touch potter 
 
 it occurs to me that dumbledore who had prodigious magical skill whatever his other faults might have enchanted this snitch so that it will open only for you 
 
 harrys heart was beating rather fast he was sure that scrimgeour was right how could he avoid taking the snitch with his bare hand in front of the minister 
 
 you dont say anything said scrimgeour perhaps you already know what the snitch contains 
 
 no said harry still wondering how he could appear to touch the snitch without really doing so if only he knew legilimency really knew it and could read hermiones mind he could practically hear her brain whizzing beside him 
 
 take it said scrimgeour quietly 
 
 harry met the ministers yellow eyes and knew he had no option but to obey he held out his hand and scrimgeour leaned forward again and place the snitch slowly and deliberately into harrys palm 
 
 nothing happened as harrys fingers closed around the snitch its tired wings fluttered and were still scrimgeour ron and hermione continued to gaze avidly at the now partially concealed ball as if still hoping it might transform in some way 
 
 that was dramatic said harry coolly both ron and hermione laughed 
 
 thats all then is it asked hermione making to raise herself off the sofa 
 
 not quite said scrimgeour who looked bad tempered now dumbledore left you a second bequest potter 
 
 what is it asked harry excitement rekindling 
 
 scrimgeour did not bother to read from the will this time 
 
 the sword of godric gryffindor he said hermione and ron both stiffened harry looked around for a sign of the hilt but scrimgeour did not pull the sword from the leather pouch which in any case looked much too small to contain it 
 
 so where is it harry asked suspiciously 
 
 unfortunately said scrimgeour that sword was not dumbledores to give away the sword of godric gryffindor is an important historical artifact and as such belongsc 
 
 it belongs to harry said hermione hotly it chose him he was the one who found it it came to him out of the sorting hatc 
 
 according to reliable historical sources the sword may present itself to any worthy gryffindor said scrimgeour that does not make it the exclusive property of mr potter whatever dumbledore may have decided scrimgeour scratched his badly shaven cheek scrutinizing harry why do you thinkc 
 
 cdumbledore wanted to give me the sword said harry struggling to keep his temper maybe he thought it would look nice on my wall 
 
 this is not a joke potter growled scrimgeour was it because dumbledore believed that only the sword of godric gryffindor could defeat the heir of slytherin did he wish to give you that sword potter because he believed as do many that you are the one destined to destroy 
 
 interesting theory said harry has anyone ever tried sticking a sword in voldemort maybe the ministry should put some people onto that instead of wasting their time stripping down deluminators or covering up breakouts from azkaban so this is what youve been doing minister shut up in your office trying to break open a snitch people are dying c i was nearly one of them c voldemort chased me across three countries he killed moody but theres no word about any of that from the ministry has there and you still expect us to cooperate with you 
 
 you go too far shouted scrimgeour standing up harry jumped to his feet too scrimgeour limped toward harry and jabbed him hard in the chest with the point of his wand it singed a hole in harrys like a lit cigarette 
 
 oi said ron jumping up and raising his own wand but harry said no dyou want to give him an excuse to arrest us 
 
 remembered youre not at school have you said scrimgeour breathing hard into harrys face remembered that i am not dumbledore who forgave your insolence and insubordination you may wear that scar like a crown potter but it is not up to a boy to tell me how to do my job its time you learned some respect 
 
 its time you earned it said harry 
 
 the floor trembled there was a sound of running footsteps then the door to the sitting room burst open and mr and mrs weasley ran in 
 
 we c we thought we heard c began mr weasley looking thoroughly alarmed at the sight of harry and the minister virtually nose to nose 
 
 c raised voices panted mrs weasley 
 
 scrimgeour took a couple of steps back from harry glancing at the hole he had made in harrys he seemed to regret his loss of temper 
 
 it c it was nothing he growled i regret your attitude he said looking harry full in the face once more you seem to think that the ministry does not desire what you c what dumbledore c desired we ought to work together 
 
 i dont like your methods minister said harry remember 
 
 for the second time he raised his right fist and displayed to scrimgeour the scar that still showed white on the back of it spelling i must not tell lies scrimgeours expression hardened he turned away without another word and limped from the room mrs weasley hurried after him harry heard her stop at the back door after a minute or so she called hes gone 
 
 what did he want mr weasley asked looking around at harry ron and hermione as mrs weasley came hurrying back to them 
 
 to give us what dumbledore left us said harry theyve only just released the content of his will 
 
 outside in the garden over the dinner tables the three objects scrimgeour had given them were passed from hand to hand everyone exclaimed over the deluminator and the tales of beedle the bard and lamented the fact that scrimgeour had refused to pass on the sword but none of them could offer any suggestion as to why dumbledore would have left harry an old snitch as mr weasley examined the deluminator for the third of fourth time mrs weasley said tentatively harry dear everyones awfully hungry we didnt like to start without you shall i serve dinner now 
 
 they all ate rather hurriedly and then after a hasty chorus of happy birthday and much gulping of cake the party broke up hagrid who was invited to the wedding the following day but was far too bulky to sleep in the overstretched burrow left to set up a tent for himself in a neighboring field 
 
 meet us upstairs harry whispered to hermione while they helped mrs weasley restore the garden to its normal state after everyones gone to bed 
 
 up in the attic room ron examined his deluminator and harry filled hagrids moleskin purse not with gold but with those items he most prized apparently worthless though some of them were the marauders map the shard of siriuss enchanted mirror and locket he pulled the string tight and slipped the purse around his neck then sat holding the old snitch and watching its wings flutter feebly at last hermione tapped on the door and tiptoed inside 
 
 muffiato she whispered waving her wand in the direction of the stairs 
 
 thought you didnt approve of that spell said ron 
 
 times change said hermione now show us that deluminator 
 
 ron obliged at once holding i up in front of him he clicked it the solitary lamp they had lit went out at once 
 
 the thing is whispered hermione through the dark we could have achieved that with peruvian instant darkness powder 
 
 there was a small click and the ball of light from the lamp flew back to the ceiling and illuminated them all once more 
 
 still its cool said ron a little defensively and from what they said dumbledore invented it himself 
 
 i know but surely he wouldnt have singled you out in his will just to help us turn out the lights 
 
 dyou think he knew the ministry would confiscate his will and examine everything hed left us asked harry 
 
 definitely said hermione he couldnt tell us in the will why he was leaving us these things but that will doesnt explain 
 
 why he couldnt have given us a hint when he was alive asked ron 
 
 well exactly said hermione now flicking through the tales of beedle the bard if these things are important enough to pass on right under the nose of the ministry youd think hed have left us know why unless he thought it was obvious 
 
 thought wrong then didnt he said ron i always said he was mental brilliant and everything but cracked leaving harry an old snitch c what the hell was that about 
 
 ive no idea said hermione when scrimgeour made you take it harry i was so sure that something was going to happen 
 
 yeah well said harry his pulse quickened as he raised the snitch in his fingers i wasnt going to try too hard in front of scrimgeour was i 
 
 what do you mean asked hermione 
 
 the snitch i caught in my first ever quidditch match said harry dont you remember 
 
 hermione looked simply bemused ron however gasped pointing frantically from harry to the snitch and back again until he found his voice 
 
 that was the one you nearly swallowed 
 
 exactly said harry and with his heart beating fast he pressed his mouth to the snitch 
 
 it did not open frustration and bitter disappointment welled up inside him he lowered the golden sphere but then hermione cried out 
 
 writing theres writing on it quick look he nearly dropped the snitch in surprise and excitement hermione was quite right engraved upon the smooth golden surface where seconds before there had been nothing were five words written in the thin slanted handwriting that harry recognized as dumbledores 
 
 i open at the close 
 
 he had barely read them when the words vanished again 
 
 i open at the close whats that supposed to mean 
 
 hermione and ron shook their heads looking blank 
 
 i open at the close at the close i open at the close 
 
 but no matter how often they repeated the words with many different inflections they were unable to wring any more meaning from them 
 
 and the sword said ron finally when they had at last abandoned their attempts to divine meaning in the snitchs inscription 
 
 why did he want harry to have the sword 
 
 and why couldnt he just have told me harry said quietly i was there it was right there on the wall of his office during all our talks last year if he wanted me to have it why didnt he just give it to me then 
 
 he felt as thought he were sitting in an examination with a question he ought to have been able to answer in front of him his brain slow and unresponsive was there something he had missed in the long talks with dumbledore last year ought he to know what it all meant had dumbledore expected him to understand 
 
 and as for this book said hermione the tales of beedle the bard ive never even heard of them 
 
 youve never heard of the tales of beedle the bard said ron incredulously youre kidding right 
 
 no im not said hermione in surprise do you know them then 
 
 well of course i do 
 
 harry looked up diverted the circumstance of ron having read a book that hermione had not was unprecedented ron however looked bemused by their surprise 
 
 oh come on all the old kids stories are supposed to be beedles arent they the fountain of fair fortune the wizard and the hopping pot babbitty rabbitty and her cackling stump 
 
 excuse me said hermione giggling what was the last one 
 
 come off it said ron looking in disbelief from harry to hermione you mustve heard of babbitty rabbitty c 
 
 ron you know full well harry and i were brought up by muggles said hermione we didnt hear stories like that when we were little we heard snow white and the seven dwarves and cinderella c 
 
 whats that an illness asked ron 
 
 so these are childrens stories asked hermione bending against over the runes 
 
 yeah said ron uncertainly i mean just what you hear you know that all these old stories came from beedle i dunno what theyre like in the original versions 
 
 but i wonder why dumbledore thought i should read them 
 
 something cracked downstairs 
 
 probably just charlie now mums asleep sneaking off to regrow his hair said ron nervously 
 
 all the same we should get to bed whispered hermione it wouldnt do to oversleep tomorrow 
 
 no agreed ron a brutal triple murder by the bridegrooms mother might put a bit of damper on the wedding ill get the light 
 
 and he clicked the deluminator once more as hermione left the room 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the deathly hallows 
 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 anne lisbeth 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 anne lisbeth was a beautiful young woman with a red and white 
 complexion glittering white teeth and clear soft eyes and her 
 footstep was light in the dance but her mind was lighter still she 
 had a little child not at all pretty so he was put out to be 
 nursed by a wife and his mother went to the castle 
 she sat in splendid rooms richly decorated with silk and velvet 
 not a breath of air was allowed to blow upon her and no one was 
 allowed to speak to her harshly for she was nurse to the 
 child he was fair and delicate as a prince and beautiful as an 
 angel and how she loved this child her own boy was provided for by being at the where the mouth watered more frequently than the pot boiled and where in general no one was at home to take care of the child then he would cry but what nobody knows nobody cares for so he would cry till he was tired and then fall asleep and while we are asleep we can feel neither hunger nor thirst ah yes sleep is a capital invention 
 
 as years went on anne child grew apace like weeds 
 although they said his growth had been stunted he had become quite 
 a member of the family in which he dwelt they received money to 
 keep him so that his mother got rid of him altogether she had become quite a lady she had a comfortable home of her own in the town and out of doors when she went for a walk she wore a bonnet but she never walked out to see the laborer that was too far from the town and indeed she had nothing to go for the boy now belonged to these laboring people he had food and he could also do something towards earning his living he took care of red cow for he knew how to tend cattle and make himself useful 
 
 the great dog by the yard gate of a mansion sits 
 proudly on the top of his kennel when the sun shines and barks at 
 every one that passes but if it rains he creeps into his house 
 and there he is warm and dry anne boy also sat in the 
 sunshine on the top of the fence cutting out a little toy if it 
 was he knew of three in blossom 
 which would certainly bear fruit this was his most hopeful thought 
 though it often came to nothing and he had to sit out in the rain 
 in the worst weather and get wet to the skin and let the cold wind 
 dry the clothes on his back afterwards if he went near the farmyard 
 belonging to the count he was pushed and knocked about for the men and the maids said he was so horrible ugly but he was used to all this for nobody loved him this was how the world treated anne 
 boy and how could it be otherwise it was his fate to be 
 beloved by no one hitherto he had been a land crab the land at 
 last cast him adrift he went to sea in a wretched vessel and sat 
 at the helm while the skipper sat over the he was dirty and 
 ugly and he always looked as if he never 
 had enough to eat which was really the case 
 
 late in the autumn when the weather was rough windy and wet 
 and the cold penetrated through the thickest clothing especially at 
 sea a wretched boat went out to sea with only two men on board or 
 more correctly a man and a half for it was the skipper and his 
 boy there had only been a kind of twilight all day and it soon 
 grew quite dark and so bitterly cold that the skipper took a dram to 
 warm him the bottle was old and the glass too it was perfect in the 
 upper part but the foot was broken off and it had therefore been 
 fixed upon a little carved block of wood painted blue a dram is a 
 great comfort and two are better still thought the skipper while 
 the boy sat at the helm which he held fast in his hard seamed 
 hands he was ugly and his hair was matted and he looked crippled 
 and stunted they called him the boy though in the 
 church register he was entered as anne son the wind cut 
 through the rigging and the boat cut through the sea the sails 
 filled by the wind swelled out and carried them along in wild career 
 it was wet and rough above and below and might still be worse 
 hold what is that what has struck the boat was it a waterspout 
 or a heavy sea rolling suddenly upon them 
 
 heaven help us cried the boy at the helm as the boat heeled 
 over and lay on its beam ends it had struck on a rock which rose 
 from the depths of the sea and sank at once like an old shoe in a 
 puddle it sank at once with mouse and man as the saying is 
 there might have been mice on board but only one man and a half 
 the skipper and the boy no one saw it but the skimming 
 and the fishes beneath the water and even they did not 
 see it properly for they darted back with terror as the boat filled 
 with water and sank there it lay scarcely a fathom below the 
 surface and those two were provided for buried and forgotten the 
 glass with the foot of blue wood was the only thing that did not sink 
 for the wood floated and the glass drifted away to be cast upon the 
 shore and broken where and when is indeed of no consequence it 
 had served its purpose and it had been loved which anne 
 boy had not been but in heaven no soul will be able to say never 
 loved 
 
 anne lisbeth had now lived in the town many years she was 
 called madame and felt dignified in consequence she remembered the old noble days in which she had driven in the carriage and had 
 associated with countess and baroness her beautiful noble child 
 had been a dear angel and possessed the kindest heart he had loved 
 her so much and she had loved him in return they had kissed and 
 loved each other and the boy had been her joy her second life now 
 he was fourteen years of age tall handsome and clever she had 
 not seen him since she carried him in her arms neither had she been 
 for years to the palace it was quite a journey thither from 
 the town 
 
 i must make one effort to go said anne lisbeth to see my 
 darling the sweet child and press him to my heart certainly 
 he must long to see me too the young count no doubt he thinks of me and loves me as in those days when he would fling his 
 round my neck and lisp anne liz it was music to my ears yes i 
 must make an effort to see him again she drove across the country in a cart and then got out and continued her journey on foot and thus reached the castle it was as great and magnificent as it had always been and the garden looked the same as ever all the servants were strangers to her not one of them knew anne lisbeth nor of what consequence she had once been there but she felt sure the countess would soon let them know it and her darling boy too how she longed to see him 
 
 now that anne lisbeth was at her end she was kept 
 waiting a long time and for those who wait time passes slowly but 
 before the great people went in to dinner she was called in and 
 spoken to very graciously she was to go in again after dinner and 
 then she would see her sweet boy once more how tall and slender and thin he had grown but the eyes and the sweet angel mouth were still beautiful he looked at her but he did not speak he certainly did 
 not know who she was he turned round and was going away but she seized his hand and pressed it to her lips 
 
 well well he said and with that he walked out of the room he 
 who filled her every thought he whom she loved best and who was 
 her whole earthly pride 
 
 anne lisbeth went forth from the castle into the public road 
 feeling mournful and sad he whom she had nursed day and night and 
 even now carried about in her dreams had been cold and strange and had not a word or thought respecting her a great black raven darted down in front of her on the high road and croaked dismally 
 ah said she what bird of ill omen art thou presently she 
 passed the hut his wife stood at the door and the two 
 women spoke to each other 
 
 you look well said the woman fat and plump you are 
 well off 
 
 oh yes answered anne lisbeth 
 
 the boat went down with them continued the woman hans the 
 skipper and the boy were both drowned so an end of them i 
 always thought the boy would be able to help me with a few dollars 
 never cost you anything more anne lisbeth 
 
 so they were drowned repeated anne lisbeth but she said no 
 more and the subject was dropped she felt very because her had shown no inclination to speak to her who loved him so well and who had travelled so far to see him the journey had cost money too and she had derived no great pleasure from it still she said not a word of all this she could not relieve her heart by telling the wife lest the latter should think she did not enjoy her former position at the castle then the raven flew over her screaming again as he flew 
 
 the black wretch said anne lisbeth he will end by frightening 
 me today she had brought coffee and chicory with her for she 
 thought it would be a charity to the poor woman to give them to her to boil a cup of coffee and then she would take a cup herself 
 
 the woman prepared the coffee and in the meantime anne lisbeth 
 seated her in a chair and fell asleep then she dreamed of something 
 which she had never dreamed before singularly enough she dreamed of her own child who had wept and hungered in the hut and had been knocked about in heat and in cold and who was now lying in the depths of the sea in a spot only known by god she fancied she was still sitting in the hut where the woman was busy preparing the coffee for she could smell the roasting but suddenly it seemed to her that there stood on the threshold a 
 beautiful young form as beautiful as the child and this 
 apparition said to her the world is passing away hold fast to me 
 for you are my mother after all you have an angel in heaven hold 
 me fast and the stretched out his hand and seized her 
 then there was a terrible crash as of a world crumbling to pieces 
 and the was rising from the earth and holding her by 
 the sleeve so tightly that she felt herself lifted from the ground 
 but on the other hand something heavy hung to her feet and dragged 
 her down and it seemed as if hundreds of women were clinging to 
 her and crying if thou art to be saved we must be saved too 
 hold fast hold fast and then they all hung on her but there were 
 too many and as they clung the sleeve was torn and anne lisbeth fell down in horror and awoke indeed she was on the point of falling over in reality with the chair on which she sat but she was so startled 
 and alarmed that she could not remember what she had dreamed only 
 that it was something very dreadful 
 
 they drank their coffee and had a chat together and then anne 
 lisbeth went away towards the little town where she was to meet the 
 carrier who was to drive her back to her own home but when she 
 came to him she found that he would not be ready to start till the 
 evening of the next day then she began to think of the expense and 
 what the distance would be to walk she remembered that the route by the was two miles shorter than by the high road and as 
 the weather was clear and there would be moonlight she determined to make her way on foot and to start at once that she might reach 
 home the next day 
 
 the sun had set and the evening bells sounded through the air 
 from the tower of the village church but to her it was not the bells 
 but the cry of the frogs in the marshes then they ceased and all 
 around became still not a bird could be heard they were all at rest 
 even the owl had not left her hiding place deep silence reigned on 
 the margin of the wood by the as anne lisbeth walked on she could hear her own footsteps in the sands even the waves of the sea were at rest and all in the deep waters had sunk into silence 
 
 there was quiet among the dead and the living in the deep sea anne 
 lisbeth walked on thinking of nothing at all as people say or 
 rather her thoughts wandered but not away from her for thought is 
 never absent from us it only slumbers many thoughts that have lain 
 dormant are roused at the proper time and begin to stir in the mind 
 and the heart and seem even to come upon us from above it is 
 written that a good deed bears a blessing for its fruit and it is 
 also written that the wages of sin is death much has been said and 
 much written which we pass over or know nothing of a light arises 
 within us and then forgotten things make themselves remembered and thus it was with anne lisbeth the germ of every vice and every virtue lies in our heart in yours and in mine they lie like little grains 
 of seed till a ray of sunshine or the touch of an evil hand or 
 you turn the corner to the right or to the left and the decision is 
 made the little seed is stirred it swells and shoots up and pours 
 its sap into your blood directing your course either for good or 
 evil troublesome thoughts often exist in the mind fermenting 
 there which are not realized by us while the senses are as it were 
 slumbering but still they are there anne lisbeth walked on thus with 
 her senses half asleep but the thoughts were fermenting within her 
 from one shrove tuesday to another much may occur to weigh down the heart it is the reckoning of a whole year much may be forgotten sins against heaven in word and thought sins against our neighbor and against our own conscience we are scarcely aware of their existence and anne lisbeth did not think of any of her errors 
 she had committed no crime against the law of the land she was an 
 honorable person in a good position that she knew 
 
 she continued her walk along by the margin of the sea what was it 
 she saw lying there an old hat a hat now when might that have been washed overboard she drew nearer she stopped to look at the hat ha what was lying yonder she shuddered yet it was nothing save a heap of grass and tangled seaweed flung across a long stone but it looked like a corpse only tangled grass and yet she was 
 frightened at it as she turned to walk away much came into her 
 mind that she had heard in her childhood old superstitions of 
 spectres by the of the ghosts of drowned but unburied 
 people whose corpses had been washed up on the desolate beach 
 the body she knew could do no harm to any one but the spirit could pursue the lonely wanderer attach itself to him and demand to be carried to the churchyard that it might rest in consecrated ground 
 hold fast hold fast the spectre would cry and as anne lisbeth 
 murmured these words to herself the whole of her dream was suddenly recalled to her memory when the mother had clung to her and uttered these words when amid the crashing of worlds her sleeve had been torn and she had slipped from the grasp of her child who wanted to hold her up in that terrible hour her child her own child which she had never loved lay now buried in the sea and might rise up like a spectre from the waters and cry hold fast carry me 
 to consecrated ground 
 
 as these thoughts passed through her mind fear gave speed to 
 her feet so that she walked faster and faster fear came upon her 
 as if a cold clammy hand had been laid upon her heart so that she 
 almost fainted as she looked across the sea all there grew darker a 
 heavy mist came rolling onwards and clung to bush and tree 
 distorting them into fantastic shapes she turned and glanced at the 
 moon which had risen behind her it looked like a pale rayless 
 surface and a deadly weight seemed to hang upon her limbs hold 
 thought she and then she turned round a second time to look at the 
 moon a white face appeared quite close to her with a mist hanging 
 like a garment from its shoulders stop carry me to consecrated 
 earth sounded in her ears in strange hollow tones the sound did 
 not come from frogs or ravens she saw no sign of such creatures 
 a grave dig me a grave was repeated quite loud yes it was indeed the spectre of her child the child that lay beneath the ocean and whose spirit could have no rest until it was carried to the 
 churchyard and until a grave had been dug for it in consecrated 
 ground she would go there at once and there she would dig she 
 turned in the direction of the church and the weight on her heart 
 seemed to grow lighter and even to vanish altogether but when she 
 turned to go home by the shortest way it returned stop stop 
 and the words came quite clear though they were like the croak of a 
 frog or the wail of a bird a grave dig me a grave 
 
 the mist was cold and damp her hands and face were moist and 
 clammy with horror a heavy weight again seized her and clung to 
 her her mind became clear for thoughts that had never before been 
 there 
 
 in these northern regions a often buds in a single 
 night and appears in the morning sunlight in its full glory of 
 youthful green so in a single instant can the consciousness of 
 the sin that has been committed in thoughts words and actions of our past life be unfolded to us when once the conscience is awakened it springs up in the heart spontaneously and god awakens the conscience when we least expect it then we can find no excuse for ourselves the deed is there and bears witness against us the 
 thoughts seem to become words and to sound far out into the world 
 we are horrified at the thought of what we have carried within us and at the consciousness that we have not overcome the evil which has its 
 origin in thoughtlessness and pride the heart conceals within 
 itself the vices as well as the virtues and they grow in the shallowest ground anne lisbeth now experienced in thought what we have clothed in words she was overpowered by them and sank down 
 and crept along for some distance on the ground a grave dig me a 
 grave sounded again in her ears and she would have gladly buried 
 herself if in the grave she could have found forgetfulness of her 
 actions 
 
 it was the first hour of her awakening full of anguish and 
 horror superstition made her alternately shudder with cold or burn 
 with the heat of fever many things of which she had feared even to 
 speak came into her mind silently as the in the 
 moonshine a spectral apparition flitted by her she had heard of it 
 before close by her galloped four snorting steeds with fire flashing 
 from their eyes and nostrils they dragged a burning coach and within it sat the wicked lord of the manor who had ruled there a hundred years before the legend says that every night at twelve he drove into his castleyard and out again he was not as pale as dead men are but black as a coal he nodded and pointed to 
 anne lisbeth crying out hold fast hold fast and then you may ride again in a carriage and forget your child 
 
 she gathered herself up and hastened to the churchyard but black 
 crosses and black ravens danced before her eyes and she could not 
 distinguish one from the other the ravens croaked as the raven had 
 done which she saw in the daytime but now she understood what they said i am the i am the each raven 
 croaked and anne lisbeth felt that the name also applied to her 
 and she fancied she should be transformed into a black bird and 
 have to cry as they cried if she did not dig the grave and she threw 
 herself upon the earth and with her hands dug a grave in the hard 
 ground so that the blood ran from her fingers a grave dig me a 
 grave still sounded in her ears she was fearful that the cock might 
 crow and the first red streak appear in the east before she had 
 finished her work and then she would be lost and the cock crowed 
 and the day dawned in the east and the grave was only half dug an 
 icy hand passed over her head and face and down towards her heart 
 only half a grave a voice wailed and fled away yes it fled 
 away over the sea it was the ocean spectre and exhausted and 
 overpowered anne lisbeth sunk to the ground and her senses left her 
 
 it was a bright day when she came to herself and two men were 
 raising her up but she was not lying in the churchyard but on the 
 where she had dug a deep hole in the sand and cut her hand with a piece of broken glass whose sharp stern was stuck in a 
 little block of painted wood anne lisbeth was in a fever 
 
 conscience had roused the memories of superstitions and had so 
 acted upon her mind that she fancied she had only half a soul and 
 that her child had taken the other half down into the sea never would 
 she be able to cling to the mercy of heaven till she had recovered 
 this other half which was now held fast in the deep water 
 
 anne lisbeth returned to her home but she was no longer the woman 
 she had been her thoughts were like a confused tangled skein only 
 one thread only one thought was clear to her namely that she must 
 carry the spectre of the to the churchyard and dig a 
 grave for him there that by so doing she might win back her soul 
 
 many a night she was missed from her home and was always found on the waiting for the spectre 
 
 in this way a whole year passed and then one night she vanished 
 again and was not to be found the whole of the next day was spent in a useless search after her 
 
 towards evening when the clerk entered the church to toll the 
 vesper bell he saw by the altar anne lisbeth who had spent the whole day there her powers of body were almost exhausted but her eyes flashed brightly and on her cheeks was a rosy flush the last rays of the setting sun shone upon her and gleamed over the altar upon the shining clasps of the bible which lay open at the words of the prophet joel rend your hearts and not your garments and turn unto the lord 
 
 that was just a chance people said but do things happen by 
 chance in the face of anne lisbeth lighted up by the evening sun 
 could be seen peace and rest she said she was happy now for she 
 had conquered the spectre of the shore her own child had come to 
 her the night before and had said to her thou hast dug me only half 
 a grave but thou hast now for a year and a day buried me altogether 
 in thy heart and it is there a mother can best hide her child and 
 then he gave her back her lost soul and brought her into the church now i am in the house of god she said and in that house 
 we are happy 
 
 when the sun set anne soul had risen to that region 
 where there is no more pain and anne troubles were at an 
 end 
 
 the end

 of marriage single life 
 he that hath wife and children hath given hostages to fortune for they are impediment to great enterprises either of virtue or mischief certainly the best works and of greatest merit for the public have proceeded from the unmarried or childless men which both in affection and means have married and endowed the public yet it were great reason that those that have children should have greatest care of future times unto which they know they must transmit their dearest pledges some there are who though they lead a single life yet their thoughts do end with themselves and account future times impertinences nay there are some other that account wife and children 
 but as bills of charges nay more there are some foolish rich covetous men that 
 take a pride in having no children because they may be thought so much the richer 
 for perhaps they have heard some talk such an one is a great rich man and another except to it yea but he hath a great charge of children as if it were an abatement to his riches but the most ordinary cause of a single life is liberty especially in certain and humorous minds which are so sensible of every restraint as they will go near to think their girdles and garters to be bonds and shackles 
 unmarried men are best friends best masters best servants but not always best subjects for they are light to run away and almost all fugitives are of that 
 condition a single life doth well with church men for charity will hardly water 
 the ground where it must first fill a pool it is indifferent for judges and magistrates for if they be facile and corrupt you shall have a servant five times 
 worse than a wife for soldiers i find the generals commonly in their hortatives 
 put men in mind of their wives and children and i think the despising of marriage 
 amongst the turks maketh the vulgar soldier more base certainly wife and children are a kind of discipline of humanity and single men though they be many times more charitable because their means are less exhaust yet on the other side they are more cruel and hard hearted good to make severe inquisitors because their tenderness is not so oft called upon grave natures led by custom and therefore constant are commonly loving husbands as was said of ulysses vetulam suam praetulit immortalitati 
 chaste women are often proud and forward as presuming upon the merit of their chastity it is one of the best bonds both of chastity and obedience in the wife if she think her husband wise which she will never do if she find him jealous wives are young mistresses companions for middle age and old nurses so as a man may have a quarrel to many when he will but yet he was reputed one of the wise men mat made answer to the question when a man should marry a young man not yet an elder man not at all it is often seen that bad husbands have very good wives whether it be that it raiseth the price of their kindness when it comes or that the wives take a pride in their patience but this never fails if the bad husbands were of their own choosing against their friends consent for then they will be sure to make good their own folly

 chapter vii 
 
 cravatte 
 it is here that a fact falls naturally into place which we must not omit because it is one of the sort which show us best what sort of a man the bishop of d was 
 after the destruction of the band of gaspard bes who had infested the gorges of ollioules one of his lieutenants cravatte took refuge in the mountains 
 he concealed himself for some time with his bandits the remnant of gaspard troop in the county of nice then he made his way to piedmont and suddenly reappeared in france in the vicinity of barcelonette 
 he was first seen at jauziers then at tuiles 
 he hid himself in the caverns of the and thence he descended towards the hamlets and villages through the ravines of ubaye and ubayette 
 he even pushed as far as embrun entered the cathedral one night and despoiled the sacristy 
 his highway robberies laid waste the the gendarmes were set on his track but in vain he always escaped sometimes he resisted by main force 
 he was a bold wretch 
 in the midst of all this terror the bishop arrived he was making his circuit to chastelar 
 the mayor came to meet him and urged him to retrace his steps 
 cravatte was in possession of the mountains as far as arche and beyond there was danger even with an escort it merely exposed three or four unfortunate gendarmes to no purpose 
 therefore said the bishop i intend to go without escort 
 you do not really mean that monseigneur exclaimed the mayor 
 i do mean it so thoroughly that i absolutely refuse any gendarmes and shall set out in an hour 
 set out 
 set out 
 alone 
 alone 
 monseigneur you will not do that 
 there exists yonder in the mountains said the bishop a tiny community no bigger than that which i have not seen for three years they are my good friends those gentle and honest shepherds 
 they own one goat out of every thirty that they tend 
 they make very pretty woollen cords of various colors and they play the mountain airs on little flutes with six holes 
 they need to be told of the good god now and then 
 what would they say to a bishop who was afraid what would they say if i did not go 
 but the brigands monseigneur 
 hold said the bishop i must think of that 
 you are right i may meet them 
 they too need to be told of the good god 
 but monseigneur there is a band of them 
 a flock of wolves 
 monsieur le maire it may be that it is of this very flock of wolves that jesus has constituted me the shepherd 
 who knows the ways of providence 
 they will rob you monseigneur 
 i have nothing 
 they will kill you 
 an old goodman of a priest who passes along mumbling his prayers bah 
 to what purpose 
 oh mon dieu what if you should meet them 
 i should beg alms of them for my poor 
 do not go monseigneur 
 in the name of heaven 
 you are risking your life 
 monsieur le maire said the bishop is that really all i am not in the world to guard my own life but to guard souls 
 they had to allow him to do as he pleased 
 he set out accompanied only by a child who offered to serve as a guide 
 his obstinacy was bruited about the and caused great consternation 
 he would take neither his sister nor madame magloire 
 he traversed the mountain on encountered no one and arrived safe and sound at the residence of his good friends the shepherds he remained there for a fortnight preaching administering the sacrament teaching exhorting 
 when the time of his departure approached he resolved to chant a te deum pontifically 
 he mentioned it to the cure 
 but what was to be done 
 there were no episcopal ornaments they could only place at his disposal a wretched village sacristy with a few ancient chasubles of threadbare damask adorned with imitation lace 
 bah said the bishop 
 let us announce our te deum from the pulpit nevertheless monsieur le cure 
 things will arrange themselves 
 they instituted a search in the churches of the neighborhood all the magnificence of these humble parishes combined would not have sufficed to clothe the chorister of a cathedral properly 
 while they were thus embarrassed a large chest was brought and deposited in the presbytery for the bishop by two unknown horsemen who departed on the instant 
 the chest was opened it contained a cope of cloth of gold a mitre ornamented with diamonds an cross a magnificent the pontifical vestments which had been stolen a month previously from the treasury of notre dame in the chest was a paper on which these words were written from cravatte to monseigneur bienvenu 
 did not i say that things would come right of themselves said the bishop 
 then he added with a smile to him who contents himself with the surplice of a curate god sends the cope of an archbishop 
 monseigneur murmured the cure throwing back his head with a smile the devil 
 the bishop looked steadily at the cure and repeated with authority god 
 when he returned to chastelar the people came out to stare at him as at a curiosity all along the road 
 at the house in chastelar he rejoined mademoiselle baptistine and madame magloire who were waiting for him and he said to his sister 
 well was i in the right 
 the poor priest went to his poor mountaineers with empty hands and he returns from them with his hands full i set out bearing only my faith in god i have brought back the treasure of a cathedral 
 that evening before he went to bed he said again 
 let us never fear robbers nor murderers 
 those are dangers from without petty dangers 
 let us fear ourselves 
 prejudices are the real robbers vices are the real murderers 
 the great dangers lie within ourselves what matters it what threatens our head or our purse 
 let us think only of that which threatens our soul 
 then turning to his sister 
 sister never a precaution on the part of the priest against his that which his fellow does god permits 
 let us confine ourselves to prayer when we think that a danger is approaching us 
 let us pray not for ourselves but that our brother may not fall into sin on our account 
 however such incidents were rare in his life 
 we relate those of which we know but generally he passed his life in doing the same things at the same moment 
 one month of his year resembled one hour of his day 
 as to what became of the treasure of the cathedral of embrun we should be embarrassed by any inquiry in that direction it consisted of very handsome things very tempting things and things which were very well adapted to be stolen for the benefit of the unfortunate 
 stolen they had already been elsewhere half of the adventure was completed it only remained to impart a new direction to the theft and to cause it to take a short trip in the direction of the poor 
 however we make no assertions on this point 
 only a rather obscure note was found among the papers which may bear some relation to this matter and which is couched in these terms the question is to decide whether this should be turned over to the cathedral or to the hospital

 a new hope 
 vii 
 
 luke and ben were securing artoo detoo in the back of the speeder while threepiokept a lookout for any additional troops 
 if ship is as fast as his boasting we should be all right the old manobserved with satisfaction 
 but two fifteen more when we reach alderaan 
 not the fifteen that worries me the first two kenobi explained have to sell your speeder 
 luke let his gaze rove over the landspeeder but the thrill it had once given himwas along with other things best not dwelt on 
 all right he assured kenobi listlessly i think need it again 
 from their vantage point in another booth solo and chewbacca watched as theimperials strode through the bar two of them gave the corellian a lingering growled once and the two soldiers hurried their pace somewhat 
 solo grinned sardonically turning to his partner chewie this charter couldsave our necks seventeen thousand he shook his head in amazement thosetwo must really be desperate i wonder what wanted for but i agreed noquestions paying enough for it get falcon checkitself out 
 going somewhere solo 
 the corellian identify the voice coming as it did through an electronictranslator but there was no problem recognizing the speaker or the gun it held stuckin side 
 the creature was roughly and bipedal but its head was something outof delirium by way of an upset stomach it had huge eyes bulbous on face a ridge of short spines crested the high skull while nostrils andmouth were contained in a snout 
 as a matter of fact solo replied slowly i was just on my way to see yourboss you can tell jabba got the money i owe him 
 what you said last the week prior to too late solo not going back to jabba with another one of your stories 
 but really got the money this time solo protested 
 fine take it now please 
 solo sat down slowly minions were apt to be cursed with nervoustrigger fingers the alien took the seat across from him the muzzle of the ugly littlepistol never straying from chest 
 i got it here with me tell jabba 
 too late i think jabba would rather have your my dead body solo said unamiably 
 the alien was not impressed if you insist will you come outside with must i finish it here 
 i think like another killing in here solo pointed out 
 something which might have been a laugh came from the hardly notice get up solo been looking forward to this for a longtime embarrassed me in front of jabba with your pious excuses for the lasttime 
 i think right 
 light and noise filled the little corner of the cantina and when it had faded allthat remained of the unctuous alien was a smoking slimy spot on the stone floor 
 solo brought his hand and the smoking weapon it held out from beneath the bemused stares from several of the patrons and clucking soundsfrom its more knowledgeable ones they had known the creature had committed itsfatal mistake in allowing solo the chance to get his hands under cover 
 take a lot more than the likes of you to finish me off jabba the hutalways did skimp when it came to hiring his hands 
 leaving the booth solo flipped the bartender a handful of coins as he andchewbacca moved off sorry for the mess i always was a rotten host 
 heavily armed troopers hurried down the narrow alleyway glowering from timeto time at the darkly clad beings who hawked exotic goods from dingy little in mos inner regions the walls were high and narrow turning thepassageway into tunnel 
 no one stared angrily back at them no one shouted imprecations or mouthedobscenities these armored figures moved with the authority of the empire theirsidearms boldly displayed and activated all around men andmechanicals were crouched in doorways among accumulations ofgarbage and filth they exchanged information and concluded transactions of dubiouslegality 
 a hot wind moaned down the alleyway and the troopers closed their precision and order masked a fear of such claustrophobic quarters 
 one paused to check a door only to discover it tightly locked and bolted human shambling nearby visited a harangue on the inwardly the soldier gave the crazy human a sour eye before moving ondown the alley to join up again with his fellow 
 as soon as they were well past the door slid open a crack and a metallic facepeered out below leg a squat barrel shape struggled for a view 
 i would rather have gone with master luke than stay here with you are orders i quite know what all the trouble is about but sure itmust be your fault 
 artoo responded with a near impossibility a sniggering beep 
 you watch your language the taller machine warned 
 the number of old landspeeders and other powered transports in the dusty lotwhich were still capable of motion could be counted on the fingers of one hand butthat was not the concern of luke and ben as they stood bargaining with the insectoid owner they were here not to buy but to sell 
 none of the passersby favored the hagglers with so much as a curious transactions which were no more pleas or threats to be exchanged asthough doling out vials of his own blood the owner finalized the sale by passing anumber of small metal shapes to luke luke and the insectoid traded formal and then they parted each convinced he had gotten the better of the deal 
 he says the best he can do since the xp came out they just indemand anymore luke sighed 
 look so discouraged kenobi chided him what obtained willbe sufficient enough to cover the rest 
 leaving the main street they turned down an alleyway and walked past a smallrobot herding along a clutch of creatures resembling attenuated anteaters as theyrounded the corner luke strained for a forlorn glimpse of the old link with his former life then there was no more time for looking back 
 something short and dark that might have been human underneath all itswrappings stepped out of the shadows as they moved away from the corner itcontinued staring after them as they disappeared down a bend in the walkway 
 the entrance to the small spacecraft was completelyringed by half a dozen men and aliens of which the former were by half the mostgrotesque a great mobile tub of muscle and suet topped by a shaggy scarred skullsurveyed the semicircle of armed assassins with satisfaction moving forward fromthe center of the crescent he shouted toward the ship 
 come on out solo got you surrounded 
 if so facing the wrong way came a calm voice 
 jabba the hut itself a remarkable sight his lackeys see han solo and chewbacca standing behind them 
 you see been waiting for you jabba 
 i expected you would be the hut admitted at once pleased and alarmed by thefact that neither solo nor the big wookie appeared to be armed 
 not the type to run solo said 
 run run from what jabba countered the absence of visible weaponsbothered jabba more than he cared to admit to himself there was somethingpeculiar here and it would be better to make no hasty moves until he discovered whatwas amiss 
 han my boy there are times when you disappoint me i merely wish to knowwhy you paid me as you should have long ago and why did you have tofry poor greedo like that after all you and i have been through together 
 solo grinned tightly shove it jabba there enough sentiment in yourbody to warm an orphaned bacterium as for greedo you sent him to kill me 
 why han jabba protested in surprise why would i do that the bestsmuggler in the business too valuable to fry greedo was only relaying mynatural concern at your delays he going to kill you 
 i think he thought he was next time send one of those hired twerps got something to say come see me yourself 
 jabba shook his head and his jowls fleshy echoes of his mocksorrow han only you understandi just make an would i be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped his shipment at thefirst sign of an imperial warship and then simply showed empty pockets when idemanded recompense not good business i can be generous and not to the point of bankruptcy 
 you know even i get boarded sometimes jabba did you think i dumped thatspice because i got tired of its smell i wanted to deliver it as much as you wantedto receive it i had no choice again the sardonic smile as you say toovaluable to fry but got a charter now and i can pay you back plus a little just need some more time i can give you a thousand on account the rest in threeweeks 
 the gross form seemed to consider then directed his next words not to solo butto his hirelings put your blasters away his gaze and a predatory smile turned tothe wary corellian 
 han my boy only doing this because the best and need youagain sometime so out of the greatness of my soul and a forgiving foran extra say twenty give you a little more time the voice nearlycracked with restraint but this is the last time if you disappoint me again if youtrample my generosity in your mocking laughter put a price on your head so largeyou be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your life because onevery one your name and face will be known to men gladly cut your guts outfor of what promise them 
 glad we both have my best interests at heart replied solo pleasantly as heand chewbacca started past the staring eyes of the hired guns pay you but not because you threaten me pay you pleasure 
 starting to search the spaceport central the commander to alternately run a couple of steps and then walk to keep pace with the longstrides of darth vader the dark lord was deep in thought as he strode down one ofthe battle main corridors trailed by several aides 
 the reports are just starting to come in the commander went on only amatter of time before we have those droids 
 send in more men if you have to never mind the protests of the must have those droids her hope of that data being used againstus that is the pillar of her resistance to the mind probes 
 i understand lord vader until then we must waste our time with foolish plan to break her 
 docking bay luke told kenobi and the robots who hadrejoined them and chewbacca he seems excited about something 
 indeed the big wookie was waving over the heads of the crowd and jabberingloudly in their direction speeding their pace none of the foursome noticed thesmall thing that had followed them from the transporter lot 
 the creature moved into the doorway and pulled a tiny transmitter from a pouchconcealed by its multifold robes the transmitter looked far too new and modern tobe in the grasp of so decrepit a specimen yet its manipulator was speaking into it withsteady assurance 
 docking bay luke noted was no different in appearance from a hostof other grandiosely named docking bays scattered throughout mos eisley itconsisted mostly of an entrance rampway and an enormous pit gouged from the rockysoil this served as clearance radii for the effects of the simple antigrav drive whichboosted all spacecraft clear of the gravitational field of the planet 
 the mathematics of spacedrive were simple enough even to luke antigravcould operate only when there was a sufficient gravity well to push thatof a supralight travel could only take place when a ship was clear ofthat same gravity hence the necessity for the system on any extrasystemcraft 
 the pit which formed docking bay was as shabbily cut and as the majority of mos eisley its sloping sides were crumbling in placesinstead of being smoothly fashioned as they were on more populous worlds lukefelt it formed the perfect setting for the spacecraft chewbacca was leading themtoward 
 that battered ellipsoid which could only loosely be labeled a ship appeared tohave been pieced together out of old hull fragments and components discarded asunusable by other craft the wonder of it luke mused was that the thing actuallyheld its shape trying to picture this vehicle as spaceworthy would have caused himto collapse in the situation not so serious but to think of traveling toalderaan in this pathetic 
 what a piece of junk he finally murmured unable to hide his feelings anylonger they were walking up the rampway toward the open port this possibly make it into hyperspace 
 kenobi comment but merely gestured toward the port where a figure wascoming to meet them 
 either solo had supernaturally acute hearing or else he was used to the reactionthe sight of the millennium falcon produced in prospective passengers she maynot look like much he confessed as he approached them but all go a few unique modifications to her myself in addition to piloting i like totinker make point five factors beyond lightspeed 
 luke scratched his head as he tried to reassess the craft in view of its either the corellian was the biggest liar this side of the galactic center orthere was more to this vessel than met the eye luke thought back once more to admonition never to trust surface impressions and decided to reserve judgmenton the ship and its pilot until after he had watched them in operation 
 chewbacca had lingered behind at the entrance now he rushedup the ramp a hairy whirlwind and blabbered excitedly at solo the pilot regardedhim coolly nodding from time to time then barked a brief reply the wookiecharged into the ship pausing only to urge everyone to follow 
 we seem to be a bit rushed solo explained cryptically so if hurryaboard be off 
 luke was about to venture some questions but kenobi was already proddinghim up the ramp the droids followed 
 inside luke was slightly startled to see the bulky chewbacca squirm and fighthis way into a chair which despite modifications was still byhis massive form the wookie flipped several tiny switches with digits seeminglytoo big for the task those great paws drifted with surprising grace over the controls 
 a deep throbbing started somewhere within the ship as the engines wereactivated luke and ben began strapping themselves into the vacant seats in themain passageway 
 outside the entrance a long leathery snout protruded from darkfolds of cloth and somewhere in the depths to either side of that imposing stared intently they turned along with the rest of the head as a squad of eightimperial troops rushed up perhaps not surprisingly they headed straight for theenigmatic figure who whispered something to the lead trooper and gestured to thedocking bay 
 the information must have been provocative activating their weapons andraising them to firing position the troops charged en masse down the 
 a glint of light on moving metal caught eyes as the unwelcome outlinesof the first troops showed themselves solo thought it unlikely they would pause toengage in casual conversation his suspicion was confirmed before he could openhis mouth to protest their intrusion as several dropped to their knees and opened fireon him solo ducked back inside turning to yell forward 
 shields quick get us out of here 
 a throaty roar of acknowledgment came back to him 
 drawing his own pistol solo managed to snap off a couple of bursts from thecomparative safety of the hatchway seeing that their quarry was neither helplessnor comatose the exposed troops dove for cover 
 the low throbbing rose to a whine then to a deafening howl as hand camedown on the button immediately the overhead slammedshut 
 as the retreating troops raced out of the entrance the ground wastrembling steadily they ran smack into a second squad which had just arrived inresponse to the rapidly spreading emergency call one of the soldiers gesticulatingwildly tried to explain to the newly arrived ranking officer what had happened backin the bay 
 as soon as the panting trooper had finished the officer whipped out a compactcommunicator and shouted into it flight trying to escape sendeverything got after this ship 
 all across mos eisley alarms began to sound spreading out from docking in concentric circles of concern 
 several soldiers scouring one alleyway reacted to the citywide alarm at the sametime as they saw the small freighter lift gracefully into the clear blue sky above moseisley it shrank to a pinpoint before any of them thought to bring a weapon to bear 
 luke and ben were already undoing their acceleration straps as solo walked pastthem moving toward the cockpit with the easy stride of the experiencedspacer once forward he fell rather than sat in the seat and immediatelybegan checking readouts and gauges in the seat next to him chewbacca wasgrowling and grunting like a poorly tuned speeder engine he turned from studyinghis own instruments long enough to jab a massive finger at the tracking screen 
 solo gave it a quick glance then turned irritably to his own panel i know iknowlooks like two maybe three destroyers somebody certainly dislikes ourpassengers sure picked ourselves a hot one this time try to hold them offsomehow until i can finish the programming for the supralight jump angle thedeflectors for maximum shielding 
 with those instructions he ceased conversing with the huge wookie as his handsflew over the terminals solo did not even turned around when asmall cylindrical shape appeared in the doorway behind him artoo detoo beeped afew remarks then scurried away 
 rear scanners showed the baleful lemon eye of tatooine shrinking rapidlybehind them it rapid enough to eliminate the three points of light thatindicated the presence of the pursuing imperial warships 
 although solo had ignored artoo he turned to acknowledge the entrance of hishuman passengers got two more coming in from different angles he toldthem scrutinizing the remorseless instrumentation going to try box upbefore we can jump five shipswhat did you two do to attract that kind ofcompany 
 you outrun them luke asked sarcastically ignoring the questionthe question i thought you said this thing was fast 
 watch your mouth kid or find yourself floating home toomany of em for one thing but be safe enough once made the jumpinto hyperspace he grinned knowingly nobody track another shipaccurately at supralight speeds plus i know a few tricks that ought to lose anypersistent i wish known you boys were so popular 
 why luke said challengingly would you have refused to take us 
 not necessarily the corellian replied refusing to be baited but i boosted your fare 
 luke had a retort poised on his lips it was wiped out as he threw up his armsto ward off a brilliant red flash which gave black space outside the viewport thetemporary aspect of the surface of a sun kenobi solo and even chewbacca didlikewise since the proximity of the explosion nearly overrode the phototropicshielding 
 where the situation gets interesting solo muttered 
 how long before you can make the jump kenobi inquired easily apparentlyunconcerned that at any second they all might cease to exist 
 still within the gravitational influence of tatooine came the coolresponse it will be a few minutes yet before the navigation computer cancompensate and effect an accurate jump i could override its decision but thehyperdrive would likely shred itself that would give me a nice hold full of scrapmetal in addition to you four 
 a few minutes luke blurted staring at the screens at the rate 
 traveling through hyperspace like dusting crops boy ever triedcalculating a hyperspace jump luke had to shake his head no mean nice if we rushed it and passed right through a star or some other friendly spatialphenom like a black hole that would end our trip real quick 
 fresh explosions continued to flare close by despite best efforts atevasion on console a red warning light began to flash for attention 
 that luke wondered nervously 
 losing a deflector shield solo informed him with the air of a man aboutto have a tooth pulled better strap yourselves back in almost ready tomake the jump it could get bad if we take a at the wrong moment 
 back in the main hold area threepio was already locked tightly into his seat bymetal arms stronger than any acceleration straps artoo swayed back and forthunder the concussion produced by increasingly powerful energy bursts against deflectors 
 was this trip really necessary the tall robot muttered in desperation how much i hate space travel he broke off as luke and ben appearedand began strapping themselves back into their chairs 
 oddly luke was thinking of a dog he had once owned when an immenselypowerful something wrenched at the hull with the strength of a fallen angel 
 admiral motti entered the quiet conference room his face streaked by the linearlights lining the walls his gaze went to the spot where governor tarkin stoodbefore the curved viewscreen and he bowed slightly despite the evidence of thesmall green gem of a world entered in the screen he formally announced we haveentered the alderaan system we await your order 
 the door signaled and tarkin made a falsely gentle gesture to the a moment yet motti 
 the door slid aside and leia organa entered flanked by two armed by darth vader 
 i am tarkin began 
 i know who you are she spat governor tarkin i should have expected tofind you holding leash i thought i recognized your unique stench when iwas first brought on board 
 charming to the last tarkin declared in a fashion which suggested he wasanything but charmed you know how hard i found it to sign the order foryour termination his expression changed to one of mock sorrow of you cooperated in our investigation things might be otherwise lord vader hasinformed me that your resistance to our traditional methods of inquiry 
 torture you mean she countered a trifle shakily 
 let us not bandy semantics tarkin smiled 
 surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility for issuing the orderon yourself 
 tarkin sighed reluctantly i am a dedicated man and the pleasures i reservedfor myself are few one of them is that before your execution i should like you to bemy guest at a small ceremony it will certify this battle operational statuswhile at the same time ushering in a new era of imperial technical supremacy thisstation is the final link in the imperial chain which will bind the millionsystems of the galactic empire together once and for all your petty alliance will nolonger be of any concern to us after demonstration no one will dare toopposite imperial decree not even the senate 
 organa looked at him with contempt force will not keep the empire has never kept anything together for very long the more you tighten yourgrip the more systems will slip through your fingers a foolish foolish men often choke to death on their own delusions 
 tarkin smiled a smile his face a parchment it will beinteresting to see what manner of passing lord vader has in mind for you i amcertain it will be worthy of of him 
 but before you leave us we must demonstrate the power of this station onceand for all in a conclusive fashion in a way you have determined the choice ofsubject for this demonstration since you have proven reluctant to supply us withthe location of the rebel stronghold i have deemed it appropriate to select as analternate subject your home planet of alderaan 
 no you alderaan is a peaceful world with no standing 
 eyes gleamed you would prefer another target a military agreeable grow tired of such games for the last time where is themain rebel base 
 a voice announced over a hidden speaker that they had approached withinantigrav range of six planetary diameters that wasenough to accomplish what all of infernal devices had failed to 
 dantooine she whispered staring at the deck all pretense at defiance gonenow on dantooine 
 tarkin let out a slow sigh of satisfaction then turned to the black figure you see lord vader she can be reasonable one needs only frame thequestion properly to elicit the desired response he directed his attention to theother officers after concluding our little test here we shall make haste to move onto dantooine you may proceed with the operation gentlemen 
 it took several seconds for words so casually uttered to organa finally gasped 
 dantooine tarkin explained examining his fingers is too far from thecenters of imperial population to serve as the subject of an effective will understand that for reports of our power to spread rapidly through theempire we require an obstreperous world more centrally located have no we will deal with your rebel friends on dantooine as soon as possible 
 but you said organa started to protest 
 the only words which have meaning are the last ones spoken tarkin declaredcuttingly we will proceed with destruction of alderaan as planned then youwill enjoy watching with us as we obliterate the dantooine center of this stupid andfutile rebellion 
 he gestured to the two soldiers flanking her escort her to the principalobservation level and he smiled make certain she is provided with an unobstructedview

 chapter viii 
 
 the friends were silent neither cared to begin talking pierre continually glanced at prince andrew prince andrew rubbed his forehead with his small hand 
 let us go and have supper he said with a sigh going to the door 
 they entered the elegant newly decorated and luxurious dining room everything from the table napkins to the silver china and glass bore that imprint of newness found in the households of the newly married halfway through supper prince andrew leaned his elbows on the table and with a look of nervous agitation such as pierre had never before seen on his face began to talk as one who has long had something on his mind and suddenly determines to speak out 
 never never marry my dear fellow my advice never marry till you can say to yourself that you have done all you are capable of and until you have ceased to love the woman of your choice and have seen her plainly as she is or else you will make a cruel and irrevocable mistake marry when you are old and good for nothing or all that is good and noble in you will be lost it will all be wasted on trifles yes yes yes look at me with such surprise if you marry expecting anything from yourself in the future you will feel at every step that for you all is ended all is closed except the drawing room where you will be ranged side by side with a court lackey and an idiot but the good and he waved his arm 
 pierre took off his spectacles which made his face seem different and the expression still more apparent and gazed at his friend in amazement 
 my wife continued prince andrew is an excellent woman one of those rare women with whom a honor is safe but o god what would i not give now to be unmarried you are the first and only one to whom i mention this because i like you 
 as he said this prince andrew was less than ever like that bolkonski who had lolled in anna easy chairs and with eyes had uttered french phrases between his teeth every muscle of his thin face was now quivering with nervous excitement his eyes in which the fire of life had seemed extinguished now flashed with brilliant light it was evident that the more lifeless he seemed at ordinary times the more impassioned he became in these moments of almost morbid irritation 
 you understand why i say this he continued but it is the whole story of life you talk of bonaparte and his career said he though pierre had not mentioned bonaparte but bonaparte when he worked went step by step toward his goal he was free he had nothing but his aim to consider and he reached it but tie yourself up with a woman and like a chained convict you lose all freedom and all you have of hope and strength merely weighs you down and torments you with regret drawing rooms gossip balls vanity and triviality these are the enchanted circle i cannot escape from i am now going to the war the greatest war there ever was and i know nothing and am fit for nothing i am very amiable and have a caustic wit continued prince andrew and at anna they listen to me and that stupid set without whom my wife cannot exist and those women if you only knew what those society women are and women in general my father is right selfish vain stupid trivial in everything what women are when you see them in their true colors when you meet them in society it seems as if there were something in them but nothing nothing nothing no marry my dear fellow marry concluded prince andrew 
 it seems funny to me said pierre that you you should consider yourself incapable and your life a spoiled life you have everything before you everything and you 
 he did not finish his sentence but his tone showed how highly he thought of his friend and how much he expected of him in the future 
 how can he talk like that thought pierre he considered his friend a model of perfection because prince andrew possessed in the highest degree just the very qualities pierre lacked and which might be best described as strength of will pierre was always astonished at prince calm manner of treating everybody his extraordinary memory his extensive reading he had read everything knew everything and had an opinion about everything but above all at his capacity for work and study and if pierre was often struck by lack of capacity for philosophical meditation to which he himself was particularly addicted he regarded even this not as a defect but as a sign of strength 
 even in the best most friendly and simplest relations of life praise and commendation are essential just as grease is necessary to wheels that they may run smoothly 
 my part is played out said prince andrew the use of talking about me let us talk about you he added after a silence smiling at his reassuring thoughts 
 that smile was immediately reflected on face 
 but what is there to say about me said pierre his face relaxing into a careless merry smile what am i an illegitimate son he suddenly blushed crimson and it was plain that he had made a great effort to say this without a name and without means and it really but he did not say what it really was for the present i am free and am all right only i the least idea what i am to do i wanted to consult you seriously 
 prince andrew looked kindly at him yet his glance friendly and affectionate as it was expressed a sense of his own superiority 
 i am fond of you especially as you are the one live man among our whole set yes all right choose what you will all the same be all right anywhere but look here give up visiting those kuragins and leading that sort of life it suits you so badly all this debauchery dissipation and the rest of it 
 what would you have my dear fellow answered pierre shrugging his shoulders women my dear fellow women 
 i understand it replied prince andrew women who are comme il faut a different matter but the kuragins set of women women and wine i understand 
 pierre was staying at prince vasili and sharing the dissipated life of his son anatole the son whom they were planning to reform by marrying him to prince sister 
 do you know said pierre as if suddenly struck by a happy thought seriously i have long been thinking of it leading such a life i decide or think properly about anything head aches and one spends all money he asked me for tonight but i go 
 you give me your word of honor not to go 
 on my honor

 chapter 
 
 on the morning of a fine june day my first bonny little nursling and the last of the ancient earnshaw stock was born we were busy with the hay in a far away field when the girl that usually brought our breakfasts came running an hour too soon across the meadow and up the lane calling me as she ran 
 oh such a grand bairn she panted out the finest lad that ever breathed but the doctor says missis must go he says been in a consumption these many months i heard him tell mr hindley and now she has nothing to keep her and be dead before winter you must come home directly to nurse it nelly to feed it with sugar and milk and take care of it day and night i wish i were you because it will be all yours when there is no missis 
 but is she very ill i asked flinging down my rake and tying my bonnet 
 i guess she is yet she looks bravely replied the girl and she talks as if she thought of living to see it grow a man out of her head for joy such a beauty if i were her certain i should not die i should get better at the bare sight of it in spite of kenneth i was fairly mad at him dame archer brought the cherub down to master in the house and his face just began to light up then the old croaker steps forward and says he earnshaw a blessing your wife has been spared to leave you this son when she came i felt convinced we keep her long and now i must tell you the winter will probably finish her take on and fret about it too much it be helped and besides you should have known better than to choose such a rush of a lass 
 and what did the master answer i inquired 
 i think he swore but i mind him i was straining to see the bairn and she began again to describe it rapturously i as zealous as herself hurried eagerly home to admire on my part though i was very sad for sake he had room in his heart only for two wife and himself he doted on both and adored one and i conceive how he would bear the loss 
 when we got to wuthering heights there he stood at the front door and as i passed in i asked how was the baby 
 nearly ready to run about nell he replied putting on a cheerful smile 
 and the mistress i ventured to inquire the doctor says 
 damn the doctor he interrupted reddening frances is quite right be perfectly well by this time next week are you going upstairs will you tell her that come if promise not to talk i left her because she would not hold her tongue and she her mr kenneth says she must be quiet 
 i delivered this message to mrs earnshaw she seemed in flighty spirits and replied merrily 
 i hardly spoke a word there he has gone out twice crying well say i promise i speak but that does not bind me not to laugh at him 
 poor soul till within a week of her death that gay heart never failed her and her husband persisted doggedly nay furiously in affirming her health improved every day when kenneth warned him that his medicines were useless at that stage of the malady and he put him to further expense by attending her he retorted 
 i know you need does not want any more attendance from you she never was in a consumption it was a fever and it is gone her pulse is as slow as mine now and her cheek as cool 
 he told his wife the same story and she seemed to believe him but one night while leaning on his shoulder in the act of saying she thought she should be able to get up tomorrow a fit of coughing took very slight raised her in his arms she put her two hands about his neck her face changed and she was dead 
 as the girl had anticipated the child hareton fell wholly into my hands mr earnshaw provided he saw him healthy and never heard him cry was contented as far as regarded him for himself he grew desperate his sorrow was of that kind that will not lament he neither wept nor prayed he cursed and defied execrated god and man and gave himself up to reckless dissipation the servants could not bear his tyrannical and evil conduct long joseph and i were the only two that would stay i had not the heart to leave my charge and besides you know i had been his and excused his behaviour more readily than a stranger would joseph remained to hector over tenants and labourers and because it was his vocation to be where he had plenty of wickedness to reprove 
 the bad ways and bad companions formed a pretty example for catherine and heathcliff his treatment of the latter was enough to make a fiend of a saint and truly it appeared as if the lad were possessed of something diabolical at that period he delighted to witness hindley degrading himself past redemption and became daily more notable for savage sullenness and ferocity i could not half tell what an infernal house we had the curate dropped calling and nobody decent came near us at last unless edgar visits to miss cathy might be an exception at fifteen she was the queen of the countryside she had no peer and she did turn out a haughty headstrong creature i own i did not like her after her infancy was past and i vexed her frequently by trying to bring down her arrogance she never took an aversion to me though she had a wondrous constancy to old attachments even heathcliff kept his hold on her affections unalterably and young linton with all his superiority found it difficult to make an equally deep impression he was my late master that is his portrait over the fireplace it used to hang on one side and his on the other but hers has been removed or else you might see something of what she was can you make that out 
 mrs dean raised the candle and i discerned a face exceedingly resembling the young lady at the heights but more pensive and amiable in expression it formed a sweet picture the long light hair curled slightly on the temples the eyes were large and serious the figure almost too graceful i did not marvel how catherine earnshaw could forget her first friend for such an individual i marvelled much how he with a mind to correspond with his person could fancy my idea of catherine earnshaw 
 a very agreeable portrait i observed to the housekeeper is it like 
 yes she answered but he looked better when he was animated that is his everyday countenance he wanted spirit in general 
 catherine had kept up her acquaintance with the lintons since her five weeks residence among them and as she had no temptation to show her rough side in their company and had the sense to be ashamed of being rude where she experienced such invariable courtesy she imposed unwittingly on the old lady and gentleman by her ingenious cordiality gained the admiration of isabella and the heart and soul of her brother acquisitions that flattered her from the first for she was full of ambition and led her to adopt a double character without exactly intending to deceive anyone in the place where she heard heathcliff termed a vulgar young ruffian and worse than a brute she took care not to act like him but at home she had small inclination to practise politeness that would only be laughed at and restrain an unruly nature when it would bring her neither credit nor praise mr edgar seldom mustered courage to visit wuthering heights openly he had a terror of reputation and shrunk from encountering him and yet he was always received with our best attempts at civility the master himself avoided offending him knowing why he came and if he could not be gracious kept out of the way i rather think his appearance there was distasteful to catherine she was not artful never played the coquette and had evidently an objection to her two friends meeting at all for when heathcliff expressed contempt of linton in his presence she could not half coincide as she did in his absence and when linton evinced disgust and antipathy to heathcliff she dared not treat his sentiments with indifference as if depreciation of her playmate were of scarcely any consequence to her had many a laugh at her perplexities and untold troubles which she vainly strove to hide from my mockery that sounds but she was so proud it became really impossible to pity her distresses till she should be chastened into more humility she did bring herself finally to confess and confide in me there was not a soul else that she might fashion into an adviser 
 mr hindley had gone from home one afternoon and heathcliff presumed to give himself a holiday on the strength of it he had reached the age of sixteen then i think and without having bad features or being deficient in intellect he contrived to convey an impression of inward and outward repulsiveness that his present aspect retains no traces of in the first place he had by that time lost the benefit of his early education continual hard work begun soon and concluded late had extinguished any curiosity he once possessed in pursuit of knowledge and any love for books or learning his sense of superiority instilled into him by the favours of old mr earnshaw was faded away he struggled long to keep up an equality with catherine in her studies and yielded with poignant though silent regret but he yielded completely and there was no prevailing on him to take a step in the way of moving upward when he found he must necessarily sink beneath his former level then personal appearance sympathized with mental deterioration he acquired a slouching gait and ignoble look his naturally reserved disposition was exaggerated into an almost idiotic excess of unsociable moroseness and he took a grim pleasure apparently in exciting the aversion rather than the esteem of his few acquaintance 
 catherine and he were constant companions still at his seasons of respite from labour but he had ceased to express his fondness for her in words and recoiled with angry suspicion from her girlish caresses as if conscious there could be no gratification in lavishing such marks of affection on him on the occasion he came into the house to announce his intention of doing nothing while i was assisting miss cathy to arrange her dress she had not reckoned on his taking it into his head to be idle and imagining she would have the whole place to herself she managed by some means to inform mr edgar of her absence and was then preparing to receive him 
 cathy are you busy this afternoon asked heathcliff are you going anywhere 
 no it is raining she answered 
 why have you that silk frock on then he said nobody coming here i hope 
 not that i know of stammered miss but you should be in the field now heathcliff it is an hour past dinner time i thought you were gone 
 hindley does not often free us from his accursed presence observed the boy not work any more today stay with you 
 oh but joseph will tell she suggested better go 
 joseph is loading lime on the farther side of pennistow crag it will take him till dark and never know 
 so saying he lounged to the fire and sat down catherine reflected an instant with knitted found it needful to smooth the way for an intrusion isabella and edgar linton talked of calling this afternoon she said at the conclusion of a silence as it rains i hardly expect them but they may come and if they do you run the risk of being scolded for no good 
 order ellen to say you are engaged cathy he persisted turn me out for those pitiful silly friends of yours on the point sometimes of complaining that not 
 that they what cried catherine gazing at him with a troubled countenance oh nelly she added petulantly jerking her head away from my hands combed my hair quite out of curl enough let me alone what are you on the point of complaining about heathcliff 
 look at the almanac on that wall he pointed to a framed sheet hanging near the window and crosses are for the evenings you have spent with the lintons the dots for those spent with me do you see marked every day 
 foolish as if i took notice replied catherine in a peevish tone and where is the sense of that 
 to show that i do take notice said heathcliff 
 and should i always be sitting with you she demanded growing more irritated what good do i get what do you talk about you might be dumb or a baby for anything you say to amuse me or for anything you do either 
 you never told me before that i talked too little or that you disliked my company cathy exclaimed heathcliff in much agitation 
 no company at all when people know nothing and say nothing she muttered 
 her companion rose up but he time to express his feelings further for a feet were heard on the flags and having knocked gently young linton entered his face brilliant with delight at the unexpected summons he had received doubtless catherine marked the difference between her friends as one came in and the other went out the contrast resembled what you see in exchanging a bleak hilly coal country for a beautiful fertile valley and his voice and greeting were as opposite as his aspect 
 he had a sweet low manner of speaking and pronounced his words as you do less gruff than we talk here and softer 
 not come too soon am i he said casting a look at me i had begun to wipe the plate and tidy some drawers at the far end in the dresser 
 no answered catherine what are you doing there nelly 
 my work miss i replied mr hindley had given me directions to make a third parry in any private visits linton chose to pay 
 she stepped behind me and whispered crossly take yourself and your dusters off when company are in the house servants commence scouring and cleaning in the room where they are 
 a good opportunity now that the master is away i answered aloud he hates me to be fidgeting over these things in his presence sure mr edgar will excuse me 
 i hate you to be fidgeting in my presence exclaimed the young lady imperiously not allowing her guest time to speak she had failed to recover her equanimity since the little dispute with heathcliff 
 sorry for it miss catherine was my response and i proceeded assiduously with my occupation 
 she supposing edgar could not see her snatched the cloth from my hand and pinched me with a prolonged wrench very spitefully on the arm said i did not love her and rather relished mortifying her vanity now and then besides she hurt me extremely so i started up from my knees and screamed out oh miss a nasty trick you have no right to nip me and not going to bear it 
 i touch you you lying creature cried she her fingers tingling to repeat the act and her ears red with rage she never had power to conceal her passion it always set her whole complexion in a blaze 
 that then i retorted showing a decided purple witness to refute her 
 she stamped her foot wavered a moment and then irresistibly impelled by the naughty spirit within her slapped me on the cheek a stinging blow that filled both eyes with water 
 catherine love catherine interposed linton greatly shocked at the double fault of falsehood and violence which his idol had committed 
 leave the room ellen she repeated trembling all over 
 little hareton who followed me everywhere and was sitting near me on the floor at seeing my tears commenced crying himself and sobbed out complaints against wicked aunt cathy which drew her fury on to his unlucky head she seized his shoulders and shook him till the poor child waxed livid and edgar thoughtlessly laid hold of her hands to deliver him in an instant one was wrung free and the astonished young man felt it applied over his own ear in a way that could not be mistaken for jest he drew back in consternation i lifted hareton in my arms and walked off to the kitchen with him leaving the door of communication open for i was curious to watch how they would settle their disagreement the insulted visitor moved to the spot where he had laid his hat pale and with a quivering lip 
 right i said to myself take warning and begone a kindness to let you have a glimpse of her genuine disposition 
 where are you going demanded catherine advancing to the door 
 he swerved aside and attempted to pass 
 you must not go she exclaimed energetically 
 i must and shall he replied in a subdued voice 
 no she persisted grasping the handle not yet edgar linton sit down you shall not leave me in that temper i should be miserable all night and i be miserable for you 
 can i stay after you have struck me asked linton catherine was mute 
 made me afraid and ashamed of you he continued not come here again 
 her eyes began to glisten and her lids to twinkle and you told a deliberate untruth he said 
 i she cried recovering her speech i did nothing deliberately well go if you away and now cry myself sick 
 she dropped down on her knees by a chair and set to weeping in serious earnest edgar persevered in his resolution as far as the court there he lingered i resolved to encourage him 
 miss is dreadfully wayward sir i called out as bad as any marred child better be riding home or else she will be sick only to grieve us 
 the soft thing looked askance through the window he possessed the power to depart as much as a cat possesses the power to leave a mouse half killed or a bird half eaten ah i thought there will be no saving him doomed and flies to his fate and so it was he turned abruptly hastened into the house again shut the door behind him and when i went in a while after to inform them that earnshaw had come home rabid drunk ready to pull the whole place about our ears his ordinary frame of mind in that condition i saw the quarrel had merely effected a closer intimacy had broken the outworks of youthful timidity and enabled them to forsake the disguise of friendship and confess themselves lovers 
 intelligence of mr arrival drove linton speedily to his horse and catherine to her chamber i went to hide little hareton and to take the shot out of the which he was fond of playing with in his insane excitement to the hazard of the lives of any who provoked or even attracted his notice too much and i had hit upon the plan of removing it that he might do less mischief if he did go the length of firing the gun

 chapter eight 
 
 girls where are you going asked amy coming into their room one saturday afternoon and finding them getting ready to go out with an air of secrecy which excited her curiosity 
 never mind little girls ask questions returned jo sharply 
 now if there is anything mortifying to out feelings when we are young it is to be told that and to be bidden to run away dear is still more trying to us amy bridled up at this insult and determined to find out the secret if she teased for an hour turning to meg who never refused her anything very long she said coaxingly do tell me i should think you might let me go too for beth is fussing over her piano and i got anything to do and am so lonely 
 i dear because you invited began meg but jo broke in impatiently now meg be quiet or you will spoil it all you go amy so be a baby and whine about it 
 you are going somewhere with laurie i know you are you were whispering and laughing together on the sofa last night and you stopped when i came in you going with him 
 yes we are now do be still and stop bothering 
 amy held her tongue but used her eyes and saw meg slip a fan into her pocket 
 i know i know going to the theater to see the seven castles she cried adding resolutely and i shall go for mother said i might see it and got my rag money and it was mean not to tell me in time 
 just listen to me a minute and be a good child said meg soothingly mother wish you to go this week because your eyes are not well enough yet to bear the light of this fairy piece next week you can go with beth and hannah and have a nice time 
 i like that half as well as going with you and laurie please let me been sick with this cold so long and shut up dying for some fun do meg be ever so good pleaded amy looking as pathetic as she could 
 suppose we take her i believe mother would mind if we bundle her up well began meg 
 if she goes i and if i laurie like it and it will be very rude after he invited only us to go and drag in amy i should think hate to poke herself where she wanted said jo crossly for she disliked the trouble of overseeing a fidgety child when she wanted to enjoy herself 
 her tone and manner angered amy who began to put her boots on saying in her most aggravating way i shall go meg says i may and if i pay for myself laurie anything to do with it 
 you sit with us for our seats are reserved and you sit alone so laurie will give you his place and that will spoil our pleasure or get another seat for you and that proper when you asked you stir a step so you may just stay where you are scolded jo crosser than ever having just pricked her finger in her hurry 
 sitting on the floor with one boot on amy began to cry and meg to reason with her when laurie called from below and the two girls hurried down leaving their sister wailing for now and then she forgot her ways and acted like a spoiled child just as the party was setting out amy called over the banisters in a threatening tone be sorry for this jo march see if you 
 fiddlesticks returned jo slamming the door 
 they had a charming time for the seven castles of the diamond lake was as brilliant and wonderful as heart could wish but in spite of the comical red imps sparkling elves and the gorgeous princes and princesses pleasure had a drop of bitterness in it the fairy yellow curls reminded her of amy and between the acts she amused herself with wondering what her sister would do to make her sorry for it she and amy had had many lively skirmishes in the course of their lives for both had quick tempers and were apt to be violent when fairly roused amy teased jo and jo irritated amy and semioccasional explosions occurred of which both were much ashamed afterward although the oldest jo had the least and had hard times trying to curb the fiery spirit which was continually getting her into trouble her anger never lasted long and having humbly confessed her fault she sincerely repented and tried to do better her sisters used to say that they rather liked to get jo into a fury because she was such an angel afterward poor jo tried desperately to be good but her bosom enemy was always ready to flame up and defeat her and it took years of patient effort to subdue it 
 when they got home they found amy reading in the parlor she assumed an injured air as they came in never lifted her eyes from her book or asked a single question perhaps curiosity might have conquered resentment if beth had not been there to inquire and receive a glowing description of the play on going up to put away her best hat first look was toward the bureau for in their last quarrel amy had soothed her feelings by turning top drawer upside down on the floor everything was in its place however and after a hasty glance into her various closets bags and boxes jo decided that amy had forgiven and forgotten her wrongs 
 there jo was mistaken for next day she made a discovery which produced a tempest meg beth and amy were sitting together late in the afternoon when jo burst into the room looking excited and demanding breathlessly has anyone taken my book 
 meg and beth said no at once and looked surprised amy poked the fire and said nothing jo saw her color rise and was down upon her in a minute 
 amy got it 
 no i 
 you know where it is then 
 no i 
 a fib cried jo taking her by the shoulders and looking fierce enough to frighten a much braver child than amy 
 it i got it know where it is now and care 
 you know something about it and better tell at once or make you and jo gave her a slight shake 
 scold as much as you like never see your silly old book again cried amy getting excited in her turn 
 why not 
 i burned it up 
 what my little book i was so fond of and worked over and meant to finish before father got home have you really burned it said jo turning very pale while her eyes kindled and her hands clutched amy nervously 
 yes i did i told you make you pay for being so cross yesterday and i have so 
 amy got no farther for hot temper mastered her and she shook amy till her teeth chattered in her head crying in a passion of grief and anger 
 you wicked wicked girl i never can write it again and never forgive you as long as i live 
 meg flew to rescue amy and beth to pacify jo but jo was quite beside herself and with a parting box on her ear she rushed out of the room up to the old sofa in the garret and finished her fight alone 
 the storm cleared up below for mrs march came home and having heard the story soon brought amy to a sense of the wrong she had done her sister book was the pride of her heart and was regarded by her family as a literary sprout of great promise it was only half a dozen little fairy tales but jo had worked over them patiently putting her whole heart into her work hoping to make something good enough to print she had just copied them with great care and had destroyed the old manuscript so that bonfire had consumed the loving work of several years it seemed a small loss to others but to jo it was a dreadful calamity and she felt that it never could be made up to her beth mourned as for a departed kitten and meg refused to defend her pet mrs march looked grave and grieved and amy felt that no one would love her till she had asked pardon for the act which she now regretted more than any of them 
 when the tea bell rang jo appeared looking so grim and unapproachable that it took all courage to say meekly 
 please forgive me jo very very sorry 
 i never shall forgive you was stern answer and from that moment she ignored amy entirely 
 no one spoke of the great trouble not even mrs march for all had learned by experience that when jo was in that mood words were wasted and the wisest course was to wait till some little accident or her own generous nature softened resentment and healed the breach it was not a happy evening for though they sewed as usual while their mother read aloud from bremer scott or edgeworth something was wanting and the sweet home peace was disturbed they felt this most when singing time came for beth could only play jo stood dumb as a stone and amy broke down so meg and mother sang alone but in spite of their efforts to be as cheery as larks the flutelike voices did not seem to chord as well as usual and all felt out of tune 
 as jo received her kiss mrs march whispered gently my dear let the sun go down upon your anger forgive each other help each other and begin again tomorrow 
 jo wanted to lay her head down on that motherly bosom and cry her grief and anger all away but tears were an unmanly weakness and she felt so deeply injured that she really quite forgive yet so she winked hard shook her head and said gruffly because amy was listening it was an abominable thing and she deserve to be forgiven 
 with that she marched off to bed and there was no merry or confidential gossip that night 
 amy was much offended that her overtures of peace had been repulsed and began to wish she had not humbled herself to feel more injured than ever and to plume herself on her superior virtue in a way which was particularly exasperating jo still looked like a thunder cloud and nothing went well all day it was bitter cold in the morning she dropped her precious turnover in the gutter aunt march had an attack of the fidgets meg was sensitive beth would look grieved and wistful when she got home and amy kept making remarks about people who were always talking about being good and yet even try when other people set them a virtuous example everybody is so hateful ask laurie to go skating he is always kind and jolly and will put me to rights i know said jo to herself and off she went 
 amy heard the clash of skates and looked out with an impatient exclamation 
 there she promised i should go next time for this is the last ice we shall have but no use to ask such a crosspatch to take me 
 say that you were very naughty and it is hard to forgive the loss of her precious little book but i think she might do it now and i guess she will if you try her at the right minute said meg go after them say anything till jo has got with laurie than take a quiet minute and just kiss her or do some kind thing and sure be friends again with all her heart 
 try said amy for the advice suited her and after a flurry to get ready she ran after the friends who were just disappearing over the hill 
 it was not far to the river but both were ready before amy reached them jo saw her coming and turned her back laurie did not see for he was carefully skating along the shore sounding the ice for a warm spell had preceded the cold snap 
 go on to the first bend and see if all right before we begin to race amy heard him say as he shot away looking like a young russian in his coat and cap 
 jo heard amy panting after her run stamping her feet and blowing on her fingers as she tried to put her skates on but jo never turned and went slowly zigzagging down the river taking a bitter unhappy sort of satisfaction in her troubles she had cherished her anger till it grew strong and took possession of her as evil thoughts and feelings always do unless cast out at once as laurie turned the bend he shouted back 
 keep near the shore it safe in the middle jo heard but amy was struggling to her feet and did not catch a word jo glanced over her shoulder and the little demon she was harboring said in her ear 
 no matter whether she heard or not let her take care of herself 
 laurie had vanished round the bend jo was just at the turn and amy far behind striking out toward the the smoother ice in the middle of the river for a minute jo stood still with a strange feeling in her heart then she resolved to go on but something held and turned her round just in time to see amy throw up her hands and go down with a sudden crash of rotten ice the splash of water and a cry that made heart stand still with fear she tried to call laurie but her voice was gone she tried to rush forward but her feet seemed to have no strength in them and for a second she could only stand motionless staring with a face at the little blue hood above the black water something rushed swiftly by her and voice cried out 
 bring a rail quick quick 
 how she did it she never knew but for the next few minutes she worked as if possessed blindly obeying laurie who was quite and lying flat held amy up by his arm and hockey stick till jo dragged a rail from the fence and together they got the child out more frightened than hurt 
 now then we must walk her home as fast as we can pile our things on her while i get off these confounded skates cried laurie wrapping his coat round amy and tugging away at the straps which never seemed so intricate before 
 shivering dripping and crying they got amy home and after an exciting time of it she fell asleep rolled in blankets before a hot fire during the bustle jo had scarcely spoken but flown about looking pale and wild with her things half off her dress torn and her hands cut and bruised by ice and rails and refractory buckles when amy was comfortably asleep the house quiet and mrs march sitting by the bed she called jo to her and began to bind up the hurt hands 
 are you sure she is safe whispered jo looking remorsefully at the golden head which might have been swept away from her sight forever under the treacherous ice 
 quite safe dear she is not hurt and even take cold i think you were so sensible in covering and getting her home quickly replied her mother cheerfully 
 laurie did it all i only let her go mother if she should die it would be my fault and jo dropped down beside the bed in a passion of penitent tears telling all that had happened bitterly condemning her hardness of heart and sobbing out her gratitude for being spared the heavy punishment which might have come upon her my dreadful temper i try to cure it i think i have and then it breaks out worse than ever oh mother what shall i do what shall i do cried poor jo in despair 
 watch and pray dear never get tired of trying and never think it is impossible to conquer your fault said mrs march drawing the blowzy head to her shoulder and kissing the wet cheek so tenderly that jo cried even harder 
 you know you guess how bad it is it seems as if i could do anything when in a passion i get so savage i could hurt anyone and enjoy it afraid i shall do something dreadful some day and spoil my life and make everybody hate me oh mother help me do help me 
 i will my child i will cry so bitterly but remember this day and resolve with all your soul that you will never know another like it jo dear we all have our temptations some far greater than yours and it often takes us all our lives to conquer them you think your temper is the worst in the world but mine used to be just like it 
 yours mother why you are never angry and for the moment jo forgot remorse in surprise 
 been trying to cure it for forty years and have only succeeded in controlling it i am angry nearly every day of my life jo but i have learned not to show it and i still hope to learn not to feel it though it may take me another forty years to do so 
 the patience and the humility of the face she loved so well was a better lesson to jo than the wisest lecture the sharpest reproof she felt comforted at once by the sympathy and confidence given her the knowledge that her mother had a fault like hers and tried to mend it made her own easier to bear and strengthened her resolution to cure it though forty years seemed rather a long time to watch and pray to a girl of fifteen 
 mother are you angry when you fold your lips tight together and go out of the room sometimes when aunt march scolds or people worry you asked jo feeling nearer and dearer to her mother than ever before 
 yes learned to check the hasty words that rise to my lips and when i feel that they mean to break out against my will i just go away for a minute and give myself a little shake for being so weak and wicked answered mrs march with a sigh and a smile as she smoothed and fastened up disheveled hair 
 how did you learn to keep still that is what troubles me for the sharp words fly out before i know what about and the more i say the worse i get till a pleasure to hurt feelings and say dreadful things tell me how you do it marmee dear 
 my good mother used to help me 
 as you do us interrupted jo with a grateful kiss 
 but i lost her when i was a little older than you are and for years had to struggle on alone for i was too proud to confess my weakness to anyone else i had a hard time jo and shed a good many bitter tears over my failures for in spite of my efforts i never seemed to get on then your father came and i was so happy that i found it easy to be good but when i had four little daughters round me and we were poor then the old trouble began again for i am not patient by nature and it tried me very much to see my children wanting anything 
 poor mother what helped you then 
 your father jo he never loses patience never doubts or complains but always hopes and works and waits so cheerfully that one is ashamed to do otherwise before him he helped and comforted me and showed me that i must try to practice all the virtues i would have my little girls possess for i was their example it was easier to try for your sakes than for my own a startled or surprised look from one of you when i spoke sharply rebuked me more than any words could have done and the love respect and confidence of my children was the sweetest reward i could receive for my efforts to be the woman i would have them copy 
 oh mother if ever half as good as you i shall be satisfied cried jo much touched 
 i hope you will be a great deal better dear but you must keep watch over your bosom enemy as father calls it or it may sadden if not spoil your life you have had a it and try with heart and soul to master this quick temper before it brings you greater sorrow and regret than you have known today 
 i will try mother i truly will but you must help me remind me and keep me from flying out i used to see father sometimes put his finger on his lips and look at you with a very kind but sober face and you always folded your lips tight and went away was he reminding you then asked jo softly 
 yes i asked him to help me so and he never forgot it but saved me from many a sharp word by that little gesture and kind look 
 jo saw that her eyes filled and her lips trembled as she spoke and fearing that she had said too much she whispered anxiously was it wrong to watch you and to speak of it i mean to be rude but so comfortable to say all i think to you and feel so safe and happy here 
 mu jo you may say anything to your mother for it is my greatest happiness and pride to feel that my girls confide in me and know how much i love them 
 i thought grieved you 
 no dear but speaking of father reminded me how much i miss him how much i owe him and how faithfully i should watch and work to keep his little daughters safe and good for him 
 yet you told him to go mother and cry when he went and never complain now or seem as if you needed any help said jo wondering 
 i gave my best to the country i love and kept my tears till he was gone why should i complain when we both have merely done our duty and will surely be the happier for it in the end if i seem to need help it is because i have a better friend even than father to comfort and sustain me my child the troubles and temptations of your life are beginning and may be many but you can overcome and outlive them all if you learn to feel the strength and tenderness of your heavenly father as you do that of your earthly one the more you love and trust him and the less you will depend on human power and wisdom his love and care never tire or change can never be taken from you but my become the source of lifelong peace happiness and strength believe this heartily and go to god with all your little cares and hopes and sins and sorrows as freely and confidingly as you come to your mother 
 only answer was to hold her mother close and in the silence which followed the sincerest prayer she had ever prayed left her heart without words for in that sad yet happy hour she had learned not only the bitterness of remorse and despair but the sweetness of and and led by her hand she had drawn nearer to the friend who always welcomes every child with a love stronger than that of any father tenderer than that of any mother 
 amy stirred and sighed in her sleep and as if eager to begin at once to mend her fault l jo looked up with an expression on her face which it had never worn before 
 i let the sun go down on my anger i forgive her and today if it been for laurie it might have been too late how could i be so wicked said jo half aloud as she leaned over her sister softly stroking the wet hair scattered on the pillow 
 as if she heard amy opened her eyes and held out her arms with a smile that went straight to heart neither said a word but they hugged one another close in spite of the blankets and everything was forgiven and forgotten in one hearty kiss

 int room 
 across the room a dark figure stares out the tall 
 windows veiled with decaying lace he turns and his 
 smile lights up the room 
 morpheus 
 at last 
 he wears a long black coat and his eyes are invisible 
 behind circular mirrored glasses 
 he strides to neo and they shake hands 
 morpheus 
 welcome neo as you no doubt have guessed i am morpheus 
 neo 
 an honor 
 morpheus 
 please come sit 
 he nods to trinity 
 morpheus 
 thank you trinity 
 she bows her head sharply and exits through a door to an 
 adjacent room 
 they sit across from one another in cracked burgundy 
 leather chairs 
 morpheus 
 i imagine right now you must be feeling a bit like alice tumbling 
 down the rabbit hole 
 neo 
 you could say that 
 morpheus 
 i can see it in your eyes you have the look of a man who accepts 
 what he sees because he is expecting to wake up 
 a smile curls the corner of his lips 
 morpheus 
 ironically this is not far from the truth but getting ahead 
 of myself can you tell me neo why are you here 
 neo 
 morpheus a legend most hackers would die to meet 
 you 
 morpheus 
 yes thank you but i think we both know more to it than 
 that do you believe in fate neo 
 neo 
 no 
 morpheus 
 why not 
 neo 
 because i like the idea that not in control of my life 
 morpheus 
 i know exactly what you mean 
 again that smile that could cut glass 
 morpheus 
 let me tell you why you are here you are here because you have the gift 
 neo 
 what gift 
 morpheus 
 watched you neo you do not use a computer like a tool you 
 use it like it was part of yourself what you can do inside 
 a computer is not normal i know seen it what you do is 
 magic 
 neo shrugs 
 neo 
 not magic 
 morpheus 
 but it is neo it is how else would you describe what has been 
 happening to you 
 he leans forward 
 morpheus 
 we are trained in this world to accept only what is rational and 
 logical have you ever wondered why 
 neo shakes his head 
 morpheus 
 as children we do not separate the possible from the impossible 
 which is why the younger a mind is the easier it is to free while a 
 mind like yours can be very difficult 
 neo 
 free from what 
 morpheus 
 from the matrix 
 neo locks at his eyes but only sees a reflection of himself 
 morpheus 
 do you want to know what it is neo 
 neo swallows and nods his head 
 morpheus 
 that feeling you have had all your life that feeling that 
 something was wrong with the world you know what it is 
 but there like a splinter in your mind driving you mad 
 driving you to me but what is it 
 the leather creaks as he leans back 
 morpheus 
 the matrix is everywhere all around us here even in this room 
 you can see it out your window or on your television you feel it 
 when you go to work or go to church or pay your taxes it is 
 the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from 
 the truth 
 neo 
 what truth 
 morpheus 
 that you are a slave neo that you like everyone else was born 
 into bondage 
 kept inside a prison that you cannot smell taste or touch a 
 prison for your mind 
 outside the wind batters a loose pane of glass 
 morpheus 
 unfortunately no one can be told what the matrix is you have to 
 see it for yourself 
 neo 
 how 
 morpheus 
 hold out your hands 
 in right hand morpheus drops a red pill 
 morpheus 
 this is your last chance after this there is no going back 
 in his left a blue pill 
 morpheus 
 you take the blue pill and the story ends you wake in your bed 
 and you believe whatever you want to believe 
 the pills in his open hands are reflected in the glasses 
 morpheus 
 you take the red pill and you stay in wonderland and i show you how deep the goes 
 neo feels the smooth skin of the capsules with the 
 moisture growing in his palms 
 morpheus 
 remember that all i am offering is the truth nothing more 
 neo opens his mouth and swallows the red pill the 
 cheshire smile returns 
 morpheus 
 follow me 
 he leads neo into the other room which is cramped with 
 equipment glowing and electric green 
 from the racks of monitors 
 trinity apoc and cypher look up as they enter 
 cypher 
 shit 
 trinity 
 i knew he would 
 cypher saddles up to morpheus talking in a hushed tone 
 away from neo 
 cypher 
 morpheus i know what you believe but i think this is a mistake 
 rushing him old afraid he might pop 
 morpheus 
 i always told you cypher not to let fear control your life 
 apoc are we 
 neo recognizes the large man from the el train 
 apoc 
 almost 
 he and trinity are working quickly hardwiring a complex 
 system of monitors modules and drives 
 neo 
 apoc you wrote the four horsemen virus 
 apoc 
 right 
 morpheus 
 neo time is always against us will you take a seat there 
 in the center of the room sits a chair near the chair 
 is an old oval dressing mirror that is cracked 
 morpheus 
 i imagine you know sonething about virtual reality 
 neo sits and trinity begins gently fixing white electrode 
 disks to his head arns and the back of his neck 
 neo 
 a little 
 morpheus 
 tell me about it 
 neo 
 essentially a hardware system that uses an apparatus 
 headgear gloves and whatever to make you feel that you are in a 
 computer program 
 morpheus 
 if the virtual reality apparatus as you called it was wired to all 
 of your senses and controlled them completely would you be able to tell the difference between the virtual world and the real world 
 neo 
 you might not no 
 morpheus 
 no you 
 neo whispers to trinity 
 neo 
 you did all this 
 she nods placing a set of headphones over his ears 
 they are wired to an old hotel phone 
 morpheus 
 the pill you took is part of a trace program going to make 
 things feel a bit strange 
 distantly through the ear phones he hears apoc pounding 
 on a keyboard sweat beads his face his eyes blink and 
 twitch when he notices the mirror 
 he stares as it begins to heal itself a 
 webwork of cracks that slowly run together as though the 
 mirror were becoming liquid 
 neo 
 shit 
 cypher works with apoc checking reams of phosphorescent 
 data trinity monitors electric vital signs 
 neo reaches out to touch the mirror and his fingers 
 disappear beneath the rippling surface 
 quickly he tries to pull his fingers out but the mirror 
 stretches in long rubbery strands like 
 stuck to his fingertips 
 neo 
 what is this mescaline 
 morpheus 
 just relax neo 
 the strands thin like rubber cement as he pulls away 
 until the fragile wisps of mirror thread break 
 with the tinkling of glass shimmering snowflakes 
 of mercury fall hit the ground and 
 fade 
 he looks at his hand fingers distended into mirrored 
 icicles that begin to melt rapidly dripping running 
 like wax down his fingers spreading across his palms 
 where he sees his face reflected 
 neo 
 
 trinity 
 going into replication 
 morpheus 
 apoc 
 apoc 
 still nothing 
 morpheus takes out a cellular phone and dials a number 
 morpheus 
 tank going to need the signal soon stay calm neo 
 the mirror gel seems to come to life racing crawling up 
 his arns like hundreds of insects 
 neo 
 cold 
 the mirror creeps up his neck as neo begins to panic 
 tipping his head as though he were sinking into the 
 mirror trying to keep his mouth up 
 neo 
 all over me 
 morpheus is right next to him with the phone 
 trinity 
 i got a fibrillation 
 cypher 
 i knew it i knew it 
 morpheus 
 shit apoc 
 streams of mercury run from nose 
 apoc 
 targeting almost there 
 an alarm on monitor erupts 
 trinity 
 going into arrest 
 cypher 
 gonna pop 
 apoc 
 lock i got him 
 morpheus 
 now tank now 
 his eyes tear with mirror rolling up and closing as a 
 electric scream erupts in the headphones 
 it is a piercing shriek like a computer calling to 
 another computer 
 body arches in agony and we are pulled like we were 
 pulled into the holes of the phone 
 sucked into his scream and swallowed by darkness

lionfish nov chapter eight the deathday partycontents prev chapter next chapter 
 october arrived spreading a damp chill over the grounds and into the castle madam pomfrey the nurse was kept busy by a sudden spate of colds among the staff and students her pepperup potion worked instantly though it left the drinker smoking at the ears for several hours afterward ginny weasley who had been looking pale was bullied into taking some by percy the steam pouring from under her vivid hair gave the impression that her whole head was on fire raindrops the size of bullets thundered on the castle windows for days on end the lake rose the flower beds turned into muddy streams and pumpkins swelled to the size of garden sheds oliver enthusiasm for regular training sessions however was not dampened which was why harry was to be found late one stormy saturday afternoon a few days before halloween returning to gryffindor tower drenched to the skin and splattered with mud 
 
 even aside from the rain and wind it been a happy practice session fred and george who had been spying on the slytherin team had seen for themselves the speed of those new nimbus two thousand and ones they reported that the slytherin team was no more than seven greenish blurs shooting through the air like missiles as harry squelched along the deserted corridor he came across somebody who looked just as preoccupied as he was nearly headless nick the ghost of gryffindor tower was staring morosely out of a window muttering under his breath fulfill their requirements half an inch if that 
 
 hello nick said harry 
 
 hello hello said nearly headless nick starting and looking round he wore a dashing plumed hat on his long curly hair and a tunic with a ruff which concealed the fact that his neck was almost completely severed he was pale as smoke and harry could see right through him to the dark sky and torrential rain outside 
 
 you look troubled young potter said nick folding a transparent letter as he spoke and tucking it inside his doublet 
 
 so do you said harry 
 
 ah nearly headless nick waved an elegant hand a matter of no importance not as though i really wanted to join thought apply but apparently i fulfill requirements 
 
 in spite of his airy tone there was a look of great bitterness on his face 
 
 but you would think you he erupted suddenly pulling the letter back out of his pocket that getting hit times in the neck with a blunt axe would qualify you to join the headless hunt 
 
 oh yes said harry who was obviously supposed to agree 
 
 i mean nobody wishes more than i do that it had all been quick and clean and my head had come off properly i mean it would have saved me a great deal of pain and ridicule however nearly headless nick shook his letter open and read furiously 
 
 we can only accept huntsmen whose heads have parted company with their bodies you will appreciate that it would be impossible otherwise for members to participate in hunt activities such as horseback and head polo it is with the greatest regret therefore that i must inform you that you do not fulfill our requirements with very best wishes sir patrick 
 
 fuming nearly headless nick stuffed the letter away 
 
 half an inch of skin and sinew holding my neck on harry most people would think good and beheaded but oh no not enough for sir properly 
 
 nearly headless nick took several deep breaths and then said in a far calmer tone so bothering you anything i can do 
 
 no said harry not unless you know where we can get seven free nimbus two thousand and ones for our match against sly 
 
 the rest of sentence was drowned out by a mewling from somewhere near his ankles he looked down and found himself gazing into a pair of yellow eyes it was mrs norris the skeletal gray cat who was used by the caretaker argus filch as a sort of deputy in his endless battle against students 
 
 better get out of here harry said nick quickly filch in a good mood got the flu and some third years accidentally plastered frog brains all over the ceiling in dungeon five been cleaning all morning and if he sees you dripping mud all over the place 
 
 right said harry backing away from the accusing stare of mrs norris but not quickly enough drawn to the spot by the mysterious power that seemed to connect him with his foul cat argus filch burst suddenly through a tapestry to right wheezing and looking wildly about for the there was a thick tartan scarf bound around his head and his nose was unusually purple 
 
 filth he shouted his jowls aquiver his eyes popping alarmingly as he pointed at the muddy puddle that had dripped from quidditch robes mess and muck everywhere had enough of it i tell you follow me potter 
 
 so harry waved a gloomy to nearly headless nick and followed filch back downstairs doubling the number of muddy footprints on the floor harry had never been inside office before it was a place most students avoided the room was dingy and windowless lit by a single oil lamp dangling from the low ceiling a faint smell of fried fish lingered about the place wooden filing cabinets stood around the walls from their labels harry could see that they contained details of every pupil filch had ever punished fred and george weasley had an entire drawer to themselves a highly polished collection of chains and manacles hung on the wall behind desk it was common knowledge that he was always begging dumbledore to let him suspend students by their ankles from the ceiling 
 
 filch grabbed a quill from a pot on his desk and began shuffling around looking for parchment 
 
 dung he muttered furiously great sizzling dragon bogies frog brains rat intestines had enough of it make an example the form yes 
 
 he retrieved a large roll of parchment from his desk drawer and stretched it out in front of him dipping his long black quill into the ink pot 
 
 name harry potter crime 
 
 it was only a bit of mud said harry 
 
 only a bit of mud to you boy but to me an extra hour scrubbing shouted filch a drip shivering unpleasantly at the end of his bulbous nose crime befouling the castle suggested sentence 
 
 dabbing at his streaming nose filch squinted unpleasantly at harry who waited with bated breath for his sentence to fall 
 
 but as filch lowered his quill there was a great bang on the ceiling of the office which made the oil lamp rattle 
 
 peeves filch roared flinging down his quill in a transport of rage have you this time have you 
 
 and without a backward glance at harry filch ran from the office mrs norris streaking alongside him 
 
 peeves was the school poltergeist a grinning airborne menace who lived to cause havoc and distress harry much like peeves but help feeling grateful for his timing hopefully whatever peeves had done and it sounded as though wrecked something very big this time would distract filch from harry 
 
 thinking that he should probably wait for filch to come back harry sank into a chair next to the desk there was only one thing on it apart from his form a large glossy purple envelope with silver lettering on the front with a quick glance at the door to check that filch on his way back harry picked up the envelope and read 
 
 kwikspell 
 
 a correspondence course in 
 
 intrigued harry flicked the envelope open and pulled out the sheaf of parchment inside more curly silver writing on the front page said 
 
 
 feel out of step in the world of modern magic find yourself making excuses not to perform simple spells ever been taunted for your woeful wandwork 
 
 there is an answer 
 
 kwikspell is an course hundreds of witches and wizards have benefited from the kwikspell method 
 
 madam z nettles of topsham writes 
 
 i had no memory for incantations and my potions were a family joke now after a kwikspell course i am the center of attention at parties and friends beg for the recipe of my scintillation solution 
 
 warlock d j prod of didsbury says 
 
 my wife used to sneer at my feeble charms but one month into your fabulous kwikspell course and i succeeded in turning her into a yak thank you kwikspell 
 
 fascinated harry thumbed through the rest of the contents why on earth did filch want a kwikspell course did this mean he a proper wizard harry was just reading lesson one holding your wand some useful tips when shuffling footsteps outside told him filch was coming back stuffing the parchment back into the envelope harry threw it back onto the desk just as the door opened 
 
 filch was looking triumphant 
 
 that vanishing cabinet was extremely valuable he was saying gleefully to mrs norris have peeves out this time my sweet 
 
 his eyes fell on harry and then darted to the kwikspell envelope which harry realized too late was lying two feet away from where it had started 
 
 pasty face went brick red harry braced himself for a tidal wave of fury filch hobbled across to his desk snatched up the envelope and threw it into a drawer 
 
 have you did you read he sputtered 
 
 no harry lied quickly 
 
 knobbly hands were twisting together 
 
 if i thought read my private not that mine for a friend be that as it may however 
 
 harry was staring at him alarmed filch had never looked madder his eyes were popping a tic was going in one of his pouchy cheeks and the tartan scarf help 
 
 very well go and breathe a word not that however if you read go now i have to write up go 
 
 amazed at his luck harry sped out of the office up the corridor and back upstairs to escape from office without punishment was probably some kind of school record 
 
 harry harry did it work 
 
 nearly headless nick came gliding out of a classroom behind him harry could see the wreckage of a large cabinet that appeared to have been dropped from a great height 
 
 i persuaded peeves to crash it right over office said nick eagerly thought it might distract him 
 
 was that you said harry gratefully yeah it worked i even get detention thanks nick 
 
 they set off up the corridor together nearly headless nick harry noticed was still holding sir rejection letter 
 
 i wish there was something i could do for you about the headless hunt harry said nearly headless nick stopped in his tracks and harry walked right through him he wished he it was like stepping through an icy shower 
 
 but there is something you could do for me said nick excitedly harry would i be asking too much but no you want 
 
 what is it said harry well this halloween will be my five hundredth deathday said nearly headless nick drawing himself up and looking dignified 
 
 oh said harry not sure whether he should look sorry or happy about this right 
 
 holding a party down in one of the roomier dungeons friends will be coming from all over the country it would be such an honor if you would attend mr weasley and miss granger would be most welcome too of course but i daresay rather go to the school feast he watched harry on tenterhooks 
 
 no said harry quickly come 
 
 my dear boy harry potter at my deathday party and he hesitated looking excited do you think you could possibly mention to sir patrick how very frightening and impressive you find me 
 
 of of course said harry 
 
 nearly headless nick beamed at him 
 
 a deathday party said hermione keenly when harry had changed at last and joined her and ron in the common room i bet there many living people who can say been to one of those be fascinating 
 
 why would anyone want to celebrate the day they died said ron who was halfway through his potions homework and grumpy sounds dead depressing to me 
 
 rain was still lashing the windows which were now inky black but inside all looked bright and cheerful the firelight glowed over the countless squashy armchairs where people sat reading talking doing homework or in the case of fred and george weasley trying to find out what would happen if you fed a filibuster firework to a salamander fred had rescued the brilliant orange lizard from a care of magical creatures class and it was now smouldering gently on a table surrounded by a knot of curious people 
 
 harry was at the point of telling ron and hermione about filch and the kwikspell course when the salamander suddenly whizzed into the air emitting loud sparks and bangs as it whirled wildly round the room the sight of percy bellowing himself hoarse at fred and george the spectacular display of tangerine stars showering from the mouth and its escape into the fire with accompanying explosions drove both filch and the kwikspell envelope from mind 
 
 by the time halloween arrived harry was regretting his rash promise to go to the deathday party the rest of the school was happily anticipating their halloween feast the great hall had been decorated with the usual live bats vast pumpkins had been carved into lanterns large enough for three men to sit in and there were rumors that dumbledore had booked a troupe of dancing skeletons for the entertainment 
 
 a promise is a promise hermione reminded harry bossily you said go to the deathday party 
 
 so at seven harry ron and hermione walked straight past the doorway to the packed great hall which was glittering invitingly with gold plates and candles and directed their steps instead toward the dungeons 
 
 the passageway leading to nearly headless party had been lined with candles too though the effect was far from cheerful these were long thin tapers all burning bright blue casting a dim ghostly light even over their own living faces the temperature dropped with every step they took as harry shivered and drew his robes tightly around him he heard what sounded like a thousand fingernails scraping an enormous blackboard 
 
 is that supposed to be music ron whispered they turned a corner and saw nearly headless nick standing at a doorway hung with black velvet drapes 
 
 my dear friends he said mournfully welcome welcome so pleased you could come 
 
 he swept off his plumed hat and bowed them inside 
 
 it was an incredible sight the dungeon was full of hundreds of translucent people mostly drifting around a crowded dance floor waltzing to the dreadful quavering sound of thirty musical saws played by an orchestra on a raised platform a chandelier overhead blazed with a thousand more black candles their breath rose in a mist before them it was like stepping into a freezer 
 
 shall we have a look around harry suggested wanting to warm up his feet 
 
 careful not to walk through anyone said ron nervously and they set off around the edge of the dance floor they passed a group of gloomy nuns a ragged man wearing chains and the fat friar a cheerful hufflepuff ghost who was talking to a knight with an arrow sticking out of his forehead harry surprised to see that the bloody baron a gaunt staring slytherin ghost covered in silver bloodstains was being given a wide berth by the other ghosts 
 
 oh no said hermione stopping abruptly turn back turn back i want to talk to moaning myrtle 
 
 who said harry as they backtracked quickly 
 
 she haunts one of the toilets in the on the first floor said hermione 
 
 she haunts a toilet 
 
 yes been all year because she keeps having tantrums and flooding the place i never went in there anyway if i could avoid it awful trying to have a pee with her wailing at you 
 
 look food said ron 
 
 on the other side of the dungeon was a long table also covered in black velvet they approached it eagerly but next moment had stopped in their tracks horrified the smell was quite disgusting large rotten fish were laid on handsome silver platters cakes burned were heaped on salvers there was a great maggoty haggis a slab of cheese covered in furry green mold and in pride of place an enormous gray cake in the shape of a tombstone with icing forming the words 
 
 sir nicholas de 
 
 died st october 
 
 harry watched amazed as a portly ghost approached the table crouched low and walked through it his mouth held wide so that it passed through one of the stinking salmon 
 
 can you taste it if you walk though it harry asked him 
 
 almost said the ghost sadly and he drifted away 
 
 i expect let it rot to give it a stronger flavor said hermione knowledgeably pinching her nose and leaning closer to look at the putrid haggis 
 
 can we move i feel sick said ron 
 
 they had barely turned around however when a little man swooped suddenly from under the table and came to a halt in midair before them 
 
 hello peeves said harry cautiously 
 
 unlike the ghosts around them peeves the poltergeist was the very reverse of pale and transparent he was wearing a bright orange party hat a revolving bow tie and a broad grin on his wide wicked face 
 
 nibbles he said sweetly offering them a bowl of peanuts covered in fungus 
 
 no thanks said hermione 
 
 heard you talking about poor myrtle said peeves his eyes dancing rude you was about poor myrtle he took a deep breath and bellowed oy myrtle 
 
 oh no peeves tell her what i said be really upset hermione whispered frantically i mean it i mind her er hello myrtle 
 
 the squat ghost of a girl had glided over she had the glummest face harry had ever seen behind lank hair and thick pearly spectacles 
 
 what she said sulkily 
 
 how are you myrtle said hermione in a falsely bright voice nice to see you out of the toilet 
 
 myrtle sniffed 
 
 miss granger was just talking about you said peeves slyly in ear just saying 
 
 just saying saying how nice you look tonight said hermione glaring at peeves 
 
 myrtle eyed hermione suspiciously 
 
 making fun of me she said silver tears welling rapidly in her small eyes 
 
 no honestly i just say how nice looking said hermione nudging harry and ron painfully in the ribs 
 
 oh yeah 
 
 she did 
 
 lie to me myrtle gasped tears now flooding down her face while peeves chuckled happily over her shoulder think i know what people call me behind my back fat myrtle ugly myrtle miserable moaning moping myrtle 
 
 forgotten pimply peeves hissed in her ear 
 
 moaning myrtle burst into anguished sobs and fled from the dungeon peeves shot after her pelting her with moldy peanuts yelling pimply pimply 
 
 oh dear said hermione sadly 
 
 nearly headless nick now drifted toward them through the crowd 
 
 enjoying yourselves 
 
 oh yes they lied 
 
 not a bad turnout said nearly headless nick proudly the wailing widow came all the way up from kent nearly time for my speech better go and warn the orchestra 
 
 the orchestra however stopped playing at that very moment they and everyone else in the dungeon fell silent looking around in excitement as a hunting horn sounded 
 
 oh here we go said nearly headless nick bitterly 
 
 through the dungeon wall burst a dozen ghost horses each ridden by a headless horseman the assembly clapped wildly harry started to clap too but stopped quickly at the sight of face 
 
 the horses galloped into the middle of the dance floor and halted rearing and plunging at the front of the pack was a large ghost who held his bearded head under his arm from which position he was blowing the horn the ghost leapt down lifted his head high in the air so he could see over the crowd everyone laughed and strode over to nearly headless nick squashing his head back onto his neck 
 
 nick he roared how are you head still hanging in there 
 
 he gave a hearty guffaw and clapped nearly headless nick on the shoulder 
 
 welcome patrick said nick stiffly 
 
 live uns said sir patrick spotting harry ron and hermione and giving a huge fake jump of astonishment so that his head fell off again the crowd howled with laughter 
 
 very amusing said nearly headless nick darkly 
 
 mind nick shouted sir head from the floor still upset we let him join the hunt but i mean to say look at the fellow 
 
 i think said harry hurriedly at a meaningful look from nick very frightening and er 
 
 ha yelled sir head 
 
 bet he asked you to say that 
 
 if i could have attention time for my speech said nearly headless nick loudly striding toward the podium and climbing into an icy blue spotlight 
 
 my late lamented lords ladies and gentlemen it is my great sorrow 
 
 but nobody heard much more sir patrick and the rest of the headless hunt had just started a game of head hockey and the crowd were turning to watch nearly headless nick tried vainly to recapture his audience but gave up as sir head went sailing past him to loud cheers 
 
 harry was very cold by now not to mention hungry 
 
 i stand much more of this ron muttered his teeth chattering as the orchestra ground back into action and the ghosts swept back onto the dance floor 
 
 go harry agreed 
 
 they backed toward the door nodding and beaming at anyone who looked at them and a minute later were hurrying back up the passageway full of black candles 
 
 pudding might not be finished yet said ron hopefully leading the way toward the steps to the entrance hall 
 
 and then harry heard it 
 
 rip tear kill 
 
 it was the same voice the same cold murderous voice he had heard in office 
 
 he stumbled to a halt clutching at the stone wall listening with all his might looking around squinting up and down the dimly lit passageway 
 
 harry you 
 
 that voice again shut up a minute 
 
 soo hungry for so long 
 
 listen said harry urgently and ron and hermione froze watching him 
 
 kill time to kill 
 
 the voice was growing fainter harry was sure it was moving away moving upward a mixture of fear and excitement gripped him as he stared at the dark ceiling how could it be moving upward was it a phantom to whom stone ceilings matter 
 
 this way he shouted and he began to run up the stairs into the entrance hall it was no good hoping to hear anything here the babble of talk from the halloween feast was echoing out of the great hall harry sprinted up the marble staircase to the first floor ron and hermione clattering behind him 
 
 harry we 
 
 shh 
 
 harry strained his ears distantly from the floor above and growing fainter still he heard the voice i smell blood i smell blood 
 
 his stomach lurched 
 
 going to kill someone he shouted and ignoring and bewildered faces he ran up the next flight of steps three at a time trying to listen over his own pounding footsteps harry hurtled around the whole of the second floor ron and hermione panting behind him not stopping until they turned a corner into the last deserted passage 
 
 harry what was that all about said ron wiping sweat off his face i hear anything 
 
 but hermione gave a sudden gasp pointing down the corridor 
 
 look 
 
 something was shining on the wall ahead they approached slowly squinting through the darkness words had been daubed on the wall between two windows shimmering in the light cast by the flaming torches 
 
 the chamber of secrets has been 
 
 opened enemies of the heir beware 
 
 that thing hanging underneath said ron a slight quiver in his voice 
 
 as they edged nearer harry almost slipped there was a large puddle of water on the floor ron and hermione grabbed him and they inched toward the message eyes fixed on a dark shadow beneath it all three of them realized what it was at once and leapt backward with a splash 
 
 mrs norris the cat was hanging by her tail from the torch bracket she was stiff as a board her eyes wide and staring 
 
 for a few seconds they move then ron said get out of here 
 
 we try and help harry began awkwardly 
 
 trust me said ron we want to be found here 
 
 but it was too late a rumble as though of distant thunder told them that the feast had just ended from either end of the corridor where they stood came the sound of hundreds of feet climbing the stairs and the loud happy talk of people next moment students were crashing into the passage from both ends 
 
 the chatter the bustle the noise died suddenly as the people in front spotted the hanging cat harry ron and hermione stood alone in the middle of the corridor as silence fell among the mass of students pressing forward to see the grisly sight 
 
 then someone shouted through the quiet 
 
 enemies of the heir beware be next mudbloods 
 
 it was draco malfoy he had pushed to the front of the crowd his cold eyes alive his usually bloodless face flushed as he grinned at the sight of the hanging immobile cat 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the chamber of secrets 
 

lionfish nov chapter eight flight of the fat ladycontents prev chapter next chapter 
 in no time at all defense against the dark arts had become most favorite class only draco malfoy and his gang of slytherins had anything bad to say about professor lupin 
 
 look at the state of his robes malfoy would say in a loud whisper as professor lupin passed he dresses like our old house elf 
 
 but no one else cared that professor robes were patched and frayed his next few lessons were just as interesting as the first after boggarts they studied red caps nasty little creatures that lurked wherever there had been bloodshed in the dungeons of castles and the potholes of deserted battlefields waiting to bludgeon those who had gotten lost from red caps they moved on to kappas creepy that looked like scaly monkeys with webbed hands itching to strangle unwitting waders in their ponds 
 
 harry only wished he was as happy with some of his other classes worst of all was potions snape was in a particularly vindictive mood these days and no one was in any doubt why the story of the boggart assuming shape and the way that neville had dressed it in his clothes had traveled through the school like wildfire snape seem to find it funny his eyes flashed menacingly at the very mention of professor name and he was bullying neville worse than ever 
 
 harry was also growing to dread the hours he spent in professor stifling tower room deciphering lopsided shapes and symbols trying to ignore the way professor enormous eyes filled with tears every time she looked at him he like professor trelawney even though she was treated with respect bordering on reverence by many of the class parvati patil and lavender brown had taken to haunting professor tower room at lunch times and always returned with annoyingly superior looks on their faces as though they knew things the others they had also started using hushed voices whenever they spoke to harry as though he were on his deathbed 
 
 nobody really liked care of magical creatures which after the first class had become extremely dull hagrid seemed to have lost his confidence they were now spending lesson after lesson learning how to look after flobberworms which had to be some of the most boring creatures in existence 
 
 why would anyone bother looking after them said ron after yet another hour of poking shredded lettuce down the flobberworms throats 
 
 at the start of october however harry had something else to occupy him something so enjoyable it more than made up for his unsatisfactory classes the quidditch season was approaching and wood captain of the gryffindor team called a meeting on thursday evening to discuss tactics for the new season 
 
 there were seven people on a quidditch team three chasers whose job it was to score goals by putting the quaffle a red ball through one of the hoops at each end of the field two beaters who were equipped with heavy bats to repel the bludgers two heavy black balls that zoomed around trying to attack the players a keeper who defended the goal posts and the seeker who had the hardest job of all that of catching the golden snitch a tiny winged ball whose capture ended the game and earned the team an extra one hundred and fifty points 
 
 oliver wood was a burly now in his seventh and final year at hogwarts there was a quiet sort of desperation in his voice as he addressed his six fellow team members in the chilly locker rooms on the edge of the darkening quidditch field 
 
 this is our last chance my last chance to win the quidditch cup he told them striding up and down in front of them be leaving at the end of this year never get another shot at it 
 
 gryffindor won for seven years now okay so had the worst luck in the world injuries then the tournament getting called off last year wood swallowed as though the memory still brought a lump to his throat but we also know got the best ruddy team in the school he said punching a fist into his other hand the old manic glint back in his eye got three superb chasers 
 
 wood pointed at alicia spinner angelina johnson and katie bell 
 
 got two unbeatable beaters 
 
 stop it oliver embarrassing us said fred and george weasley together pretending to blush 
 
 and got a seeker who has never failed to win us a match wood rumbled glaring at harry with a kind of furious pride and me he added as an afterthought 
 
 we think very good too oliver said george 
 
 spanking good keeper said fred 
 
 the point is wood went on resuming his pacing the quidditch cup should have had our name on it these last two years ever since harry joined the team thought the thing was in the bag but we got it and this the last chance get to finally see our name on the thing 
 
 wood spoke so dejectedly that even fred and george looked sympathetic 
 
 oliver this our year said fred 
 
 do it oliver said angelina 
 
 definitely said harry 
 
 full of determination the team started training sessions three evenings a week the weather was getting colder and wetter the nights darker but no amount of mud wind or rain could tarnish wonderful vision of finally winning the huge silver quidditch cup 
 
 harry returned to the gryffindor common room one evening after training cold and stiff but pleased with the way practice had gone to find the room buzzing excitedly 
 
 happened he asked ron and hermione who were sitting in two of the best chairs by the fireside and completing some star charts for astronomy 
 
 first hogsmeade weekend said ron pointing at a notice that had appeared on the battered old bulletin board end of october halloween 
 
 excellent said fred who had followed harry through the portrait hole i need to visit nearly out of stink pellets 
 
 harry threw himself into a chair beside ron his high spirits ebbing away hermione seemed to read his mind 
 
 harry sure be able to go next time she said bound to catch black soon been sighted once already 
 
 not fool enough to try anything in hogsmeade said ron ask mcgonagall if you can go this time harry the next one might not be for ages 
 
 ron said hermione supposed to stay in school 
 
 he be the only third year left behind said ron ask mcgonagall go on harry 
 
 yeah i think i will said harry making up his mind 
 
 hermione opened her mouth to argue but at that moment crookshanks leapt lightly onto her lap a large dead spider was dangling from his mouth 
 
 does he have to eat that in front of us said ron scowling 
 
 clever crookshanks did you catch that all by yourself said hermione 
 
 crookshanks slowly chewed up the spider his yellow eyes fixed insolently on ron 
 
 just keep him over there all said ron irritably turning back to his star chart got scabbers asleep in my bag 
 
 harry yawned he really wanted to go to bed but he still had his own star chart to complete he pulled his bag toward him took out parchment ink and quill and started work 
 
 you can copy mine if you like said ron labeling his last star with a flourish and shoving the chart toward harry 
 
 hermione who disapproved of copying pursed her lips but say anything crookshanks was still staring unblinkingly at ron flicking the end of his bushy tail then without warning he pounced 
 
 oy ron roared seizing his bag as crookshanks sank four sets of claws deep inside it and began tearing ferociously get off you stupid animal 
 
 ron tried to pull the bag away from crookshanks but crookshanks clung on spitting and slashing 
 
 ron hurt him squealed hermione the whole common room was watching ron whirled the bag around crookshanks still clinging to it and scabbers came flying out of the top 
 
 catch that cat ron yelled as crookshanks freed himself from the remnants of the bag sprang over the table and chased after the terrified scabbers 
 
 george weasley made a lunge for crookshanks but missed scabbers streaked through twenty pairs of legs and shot beneath an old chest of drawers crookshanks skidded to a halt crouched low on his bandy legs and started making furious swipes beneath it with his front paw 
 
 ron and hermione hurried over hermione grabbed crookshanks around the middle and heaved him away ron threw himself onto his stomach and with great difficulty pulled scabbers out by the tail 
 
 look at him he said furiously to hermione dangling scabbers in front of her skin and bone you keep that cat away from him 
 
 crookshanks understand wrong said hermione her voice shaking all cats chase rats ron 
 
 something funny about that animal said ron who was trying to persuade a frantically wiggling scabbers back into his pocket it heard me say that scabbers was in my bag 
 
 oh what rubbish said hermione impatiently crookshanks could smell him ron how else think 
 
 that got it in for scabbers said ron ignoring the people around him who were starting to giggle and scabbers was here first and ill 
 
 ron marched through the common room and out of sight up the stairs to the boys dormitories 
 
 
 
 ron was still in a bad mood with hermione next day he barely talked to her all through herbology even though he harry and hermione were working together on the same puffapod 
 
 scabbers hermione asked timidly as they stripped fat pink pods from the plants and emptied the shining beans into a wooden pail 
 
 hiding at the bottom of my bed shaking said ron angrily missing the pail and scattering beans over the greenhouse floor 
 
 careful weasley careful cried professor sprout as the beans burst into bloom before their very eyes 
 
 they had transfiguration next harry who had resolved to ask professor mcgonagall after the lesson whether he could go into hogsmeade with the rest joined the line outside the class trying to decide how he was going to argue his case he was distracted however by a disturbance at the front of the line 
 
 lavender brown seemed to be crying parvati had her arm around her and was explaining something to seamus finnigan and dean thomas who were looking very serious 
 
 the matter lavender said hermione anxiously as she harry and ron went to join the group 
 
 she got a letter from home this morning parvati whispered her rabbit binky been killed by a fox 
 
 oh said hermione sorry lavender 
 
 i should have known said lavender tragically you know what day it is 
 
 er 
 
 the sixteenth of october that thing dreading it will happen on the sixteenth of october remember she was right she was right 
 
 the whole class was gathered around lavender now seamus shook his head seriously hermione hesitated then she said you you were dreading binky being killed by a fox 
 
 well not necessarily by a fox said lavender looking up at hermione with streaming eyes but i was obviously dreading him dying i 
 
 oh said hermione she paused again then 
 
 was binky an old rabbit 
 
 n no sobbed lavender h he was only a baby 
 
 parvati tightened her arm around shoulders 
 
 but then why would you dread him dying said hermione 
 
 parvati glared at her 
 
 well look at it logically said hermione turning to the rest of the group i mean binky even die today did he lavender just got the news today lavender wailed loudly c and she have been dreading it because come as a real shock 
 
 mind hermione lavender said ron loudly she think other pets matter very much 
 
 professor mcgonagall opened the classroom door at that moment which was perhaps lucky hermione and ron were looking daggers at each other and when they got into class they seated themselves on either side of harry and talk to each other for the whole class 
 
 harry still decided what he was going to say to professor mcgonagall when the bell rang at the end of the lesson but it was she who brought up the subject of hogsmeade first 
 
 one moment please she called as the class made to leave as all in my house you should hand hogsmeade permission forms to me before halloween no form no visiting the village so forget 
 
 neville put up his hand 
 
 please professor i i think lost 
 
 your grandmother sent yours to me directly longbottom said professor mcgonagall she seemed to think it was safer well all you may leave 
 
 ask her now ron hissed at harry 
 
 oh but hermione began 
 
 go for it harry said ron stubbornly 
 
 harry waited for the rest of the class to disappear then headed nervously for professor desk 
 
 yes potter harry took a deep breath 
 
 professor my aunt and uncle er forgot to sign my form he said 
 
 professor mcgonagall looked over her square spectacles at him but say anything 
 
 so er think it would be all right mean will it be okay if i if i go to hogsmeade 
 
 professor mcgonagall looked down and began shuffling papers on her desk 
 
 afraid not potter she said you heard what i said no form no visiting the village the rule 
 
 but professor my aunt and uncle you know muggles they really understand about about hogwarts forms and stuff harry said while ron egged him on with vigorous nods if you said i could go 
 
 but i say so said professor mcgonagall standing up and piling her papers neatly into a drawer the form clearly states that the parent or guardian must give permission she turned to look at him with an odd expression on her face was it pity sorry potter but my final word you had better hurry or be late for your next lesson 
 
 
 
 there was nothing to be done ron called professor mcgonagall a lot of names that greatly annoyed hermione hermione assumed an expression that made ron even angrier and harry had to endure everyone in the class talking loudly and happily about what they were going to do first once they got into hogsmeade 
 
 always the feast said ron in an effort to cheer harry up you know the halloween feast in the evening 
 
 yeah said harry gloomily great 
 
 the halloween feast was always good but it would taste a lot better if he was coming to it after a day in hogsmeade with everyone else nothing anyone said made him feel any better about being left behind dean thomas who was good with a quill had offered to forge uncle signature on the form but as harry had already told professor mcgonagall he had it signed that was no good ron halfheartedly suggested the invisibility cloak but hermione stamped on that one reminding ron what dumbledore had told them about the dementors being able to see through them percy had what were possibly the least helpful words of comfort 
 
 they make a fuss about hogsmeade but i assure you harry not all cracked up to be he said seriously all right the rather good and joke frankly dangerous and yes the shrieking always worth a visit but really harry apart from that not missing anything 
 
 
 
 on halloween morning harry awoke with the rest and went down to breakfast feeling thoroughly depressed though doing his best to act normally 
 
 bring you lots of sweets back from honeydukes said hermione looking desperately sorry for him 
 
 yeah loads said ron he and hermione had finally forgotten their squabble about crookshanks in the face of difficulties 
 
 worry about me said harry in what he hoped was at offhand voice see you at the feast have a good time 
 
 he accompanied them to the entrance hall where filch the caretaker was standing inside the front doors checking off names against a long list peering suspiciously into every face and making sure that no one was sneaking out who be going 
 
 staying here potter shouted malfoy who was standing in line with crabbe and goyle scared of passing the dementors 
 
 harry ignored him and made his solitary way up the marble staircase through the deserted corridors and back to gryffindor tower 
 
 password said the fat lady jerking out of a doze 
 
 fortuna major said harry listlessly 
 
 the portrait swung open and he climbed through the hole into the common room it was full of chattering and a few older students who had obviously visited hogsmeade so often the novelty had worn off 
 
 harry harry hi harry 
 
 it was colin creevey a second year who was deeply in awe of harry and never missed an opportunity to speak to him 
 
 you going to hogsmeade harry why not hey colin looked eagerly around at his friends you can come and sit with us if you like harry 
 
 er no thanks colin said harry who in the mood to have a lot of people staring avidly at the scar on his forehead i got to go to the library got to get some work done 
 
 after that he had no choice but to turn right around and head back out of the portrait hole again 
 
 what was the point of waking me up the fat lady called grumpily after him as he walked away 
 
 harry wandered dispiritedly toward the library but halfway there he changed his mind he feel like working he turned around and came with filch who had obviously just seen off the last of the hogsmeade visitors 
 
 what are you doing filch snarled suspiciously 
 
 nothing said harry truthfully 
 
 nothing spat filch his jowls quivering unpleasantly a likely story sneaking around on your own why you in hogsmeade buying stink pellets and belch powder and whizzing worms like the rest of your nasty little friends 
 
 harry shrugged 
 
 well get back to your common room where you belong snapped filch and he stood glaring until harry had passed out of sight 
 
 but harry go back to the common room he climbed a staircase thinking vaguely of visiting the owlery to see hedwig and was walking along another corridor when a voice from inside one of the rooms said harry 
 
 harry doubled back to see who had spoken and met professor lupin looking around his office door 
 
 what are you doing said lupin though in a very different voice from filch where are ron and hermione 
 
 hogsmeade said harry in a casual voice 
 
 ah said lupin he considered harry for a moment why you come in just taken delivery of a grindylow for our next lesson 
 
 a what said harry 
 
 he followed lupin into his office in the corner stood a very large tank of water a sickly green creature with sharp little horns had its face pressed against the glass pulling faces and flexing its long spindly fingers 
 
 water demon said lupin surveying the grindylow thoughtfully we have much difficulty with him not after the kappas the trick is to break his grip you notice the abnormally long fingers strong but very brittle 
 
 the grindylow bared its green teeth and then buried itself in a tangle of weeds in a corner 
 
 cup of tea lupin said looking around for his kettle i was just thinking of making one 
 
 all right said harry awkwardly 
 
 lupin tapped the kettle with his wand and a blast of steam issued suddenly from the spout 
 
 sit down said lupin taking the lid off a dusty tin only got teabags afraid but i daresay had enough of tea leaves 
 
 harry looked at him eyes were twinkling 
 
 how did you know about that harry asked 
 
 professor mcgonagall told me said lupin passing harry a chipped mug of tea not worried are you 
 
 no said harry 
 
 he thought for a moment of telling lupin about the dog seen in magnolia crescent but decided not to he want lupin to think he was a coward especially since lupin already seemed to think he cope with a boggart 
 
 something of thoughts seemed to have shown on his face because lupin said anything worrying you harry 
 
 no harry lied he drank a bit of tea and watched the grindylow brandishing a fist at him yes he said suddenly putting his tea down on desk you know that day we fought the boggart 
 
 yes said lupin slowly 
 
 why you let me fight it said harry abruptly 
 
 lupin raised his eyebrows 
 
 i would have thought that was obvious harry he said sounding surprised 
 
 harry who had expected lupin to deny that done any such thing was taken aback 
 
 why he said again 
 
 well said lupin frowning slightly i assumed that if the boggart faced you it would assume the shape of lord voldemort 
 
 harry stared not only was this the last answer expected but lupin had said name the only person harry had ever heard say the name aloud apart from himself was professor dumbledore 
 
 clearly i was wrong said lupin still frowning at harry but i think it a good idea for lord voldemort to materialize in the staffroom i imagined that people would panic 
 
 i think of voldemort said harry honestly i i remembered those dementors 
 
 i see said lupin thoughtfully well impressed he smiled slightly at the look of surprise on face that suggests that what you fear most of all is fear very wise harry 
 
 harry know what to say to that so he drank some more tea 
 
 so been thinking that i believe you capable of fighting the boggart said lupin shrewdly 
 
 wellyeah said harry he was suddenly feeling a lot happier professor lupin you know the dementors 
 
 he was interrupted by a knock on the door 
 
 come in called lupin 
 
 the door opened and in came snape he was carrying a goblet which was smoking faintly and stopped at the sight of harry his black eyes narrowing 
 
 ah severus said lupin smiling thanks very much could you leave it here on the desk for me 
 
 snape set down the smoking goblet his eyes wandering between harry and lupin 
 
 i was just showing harry my grindylow said lupin pleasantly pointing at the tank 
 
 fascinating said snape without looking at it you should drink that directly lupin 
 
 yes yes i will said lupin 
 
 i made an entire cauldronful snape continued if you need more 
 
 i should probably have some again tomorrow thanks very much severus 
 
 not at all said snape but there was a look in his eye harry like he backed out of the room unsmiling and watchful 
 
 harry looked curiously at the goblet lupin smiled 
 
 professor snape has very kindly concocted a potion for me he said i have never been much of a and this one is particularly complex he picked up the goblet and sniffed it pity sugar makes it useless he added taking a sip and shuddering 
 
 why harry began lupin looked at him and answered the unfinished question 
 
 been feeling a bit he said this potion is the only thing that helps i am very lucky to be working alongside professor snape there many wizards who are up to making it 
 
 professor lupin took another sip and harry had a crazy urge to knock the goblet out of his hands 
 
 professor very interested in the dark arts he blurted out 
 
 really said lupin looking only mildly interested as he took another gulp of potion 
 
 some people reckon harry hesitated then plunged recklessly on some people reckon do anything to get the defense against the dark arts job 
 
 lupin drained the goblet and pulled a face 
 
 disgusting he said well harry better get back to work see you at the feast later 
 
 right said harry putting down his empty teacup 
 
 the empty goblet was still smoking 
 
 
 
 there you go said ron we got as much as we could carry 
 
 a shower of brilliantly colored sweets fell into lap it was dusk and ron and hermione had just turned up in the common room from the cold wind and looking as though had the time of their lives 
 
 thanks said harry picking up a packet of tiny black pepper imps hogsmeade like where did you go 
 
 by the sound of it everywhere dervish and banges the wizarding equipment shop joke shop into the three broomsticks for foaming mugs of hot butterbeer and many places besides 
 
 the post office harry about two hundred owls all sitting on shelves all depending on how fast you want your letter to get there 
 
 honeydukes has got a new kind of fudge they were giving out free samples a bit look 
 
 we think we saw an ogre honestly they get all sorts at the three broomsticks 
 
 wish we could have brought you some butterbeer really warms you up 
 
 what did you do said hermione looking anxious did you get any work done 
 
 no said harry lupin made me a cup of tea in his office and then snape came in 
 
 he told them all about the goblet mouth fell open 
 
 lupin drank it he gasped is he mad 
 
 hermione checked her watch 
 
 better go down you know the be starting in five minutes they hurried through the portrait hole and into the crowd still discussing snape 
 
 but if he you know hermione dropped her voice glancing nervously around if he was trying to to poison lupin he have done it in front of harry 
 
 yeah maybe said harry as they reached the entrance hall and crossed into the great hall it had been decorated with hundreds and hundreds of pumpkins a cloud of fluttering live bats and many flaming orange streamers which were swimming lazily across the stormy ceiling like brilliant watersnakes 
 
 the food was delicious even hermione and ron who were full to bursting with honeydukes sweets managed second helpings of everything harry kept glancing at the staff table professor lupin looked cheerful and as well as he ever did he was talking animatedly to tiny little professor flitwick the charms teacher harry moved his eyes along the table to the place where snape sat was he imagining it or were eyes flickering toward lupin more often than was natural 
 
 the feast finished with an entertainment provided by the hogwarts ghosts they popped out of the walls and tables to do a bit of formation gliding nearly headless nick the gryffindor ghost had a great success with a reenactment of his own botched beheading 
 
 it had been such a pleasant evening that good mood even be spoiled by malfoy who shouted through the crowd as they all left the hall the dementors send their love potter 
 
 harry ron and hermione followed the rest of the gryffindors along the usual path to gryffindor tower but when they reached the corridor that ended with the portrait of the fat lady they found it jammed with students 
 
 why anyone going in said ron curiously 
 
 harry peered over the heads in front of him the portrait seemed to be closed 
 
 let me through please came voice and he came bustling importantly through the crowd the holdup here you all have forgotten the password excuse me head boy 
 
 and then a silence fell over the crowd from the front first so that a chill seemed to spread down the corridor they heard percy say in a suddenly sharp voice somebody get professor dumbledore quick 
 
 heads turned those at the back were standing on tiptoe 
 
 going on said ginny who had just arrived 
 
 a moment later professor dumbledore was there sweeping toward the portrait the gryffindors squeezed together to let him through and harry ron and hermione moved closer to see what the trouble was 
 
 oh my hermione grabbed arm 
 
 the fat lady had vanished from her portrait which had been slashed so viciously that strips of canvas littered the floor great chunks of it had been torn away completely dumbledore took one quick look at the ruined painting and turned his eyes somber to see professors mcgonagall lupin and snape hurrying toward him 
 
 we need to find her said dumbledore professor mcgonagall please go to mr filch at once and tell him to search every painting in the castle for the fat lady 
 
 be lucky said a cackling voice 
 
 it was peeves the poltergeist bobbing over the crowd and looking delighted as he always did at the sight of wreckage or worry 
 
 what do you mean peeves said dumbledore calmly and grin faded a little he dare taunt dumbledore instead he adopted an oily voice that was no better than his cackle ashamed your headship sir want to be seen a horrible mess saw her running through the landscape up on the fourth floor sir dodging between the trees crying something dreadful he said happily poor thing he added unconvincingly 
 
 did she say who did it said dumbledore quietly 
 
 oh yes professorhead said peeves with the air of one cradling a large bombshell in his arms he got very angry when she let him in you see peeves flipped over and grinned at dumbledore from between his own legs nasty temper got that sirius black

lionfish nov chapter eight the quidditch world cupcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 clutching their purchases mr weasley in the lead they all hurried into the wood following the trail they could hear the sounds of thousands of people moving around them shouts and laughter snatches of singing the atmosphere of feverish excitement was highly infectious harry stop grinning they walked through the wood for twenty minutes talking and joking loudly until at last they emerged on the other side and found themselves in the shadow of a gigantic stadium though harry could see only a fraction of the immense gold walls surrounding the field he could tell that ten cathedrals would fit comfortably inside it 
 
 seats a hundred thousand said mr weasley spotting the awestruck look on face ministry task force of five hundred have been working on it all year muggle repelling charms on every inch of it every time muggles have got anywhere near here all year suddenly remembered urgent appointments and had to dash away againbless them he added fondly leading the way toward the nearest entrance which was already surrounded by a swarm of shouting witches and wizards 
 
 prime seats said the ministry witch at the entrance when she checked their tickets top box straight upstairs arthur and as high as you can go 
 
 the stairs into the stadium were carpeted in rich purple they clambered upward with the rest of the crowd which slowly filtered away through doors into the stands to their left and right mr party kept climbing and at last they reached the top of the staircase and found themselves in a small box set at the highest point of the stadium and situated exactly halfway between the golden goal posts about twenty chairs stood in two rows here and harry filing into the front seats with the weasleys looked down upon a scene the likes of which he could never have imagined 
 
 a hundred thousand witches and wizards were taking their places in the seats which rose in levels around the long oval field everything was suffused with a mysterious golden light which seemed to come from the stadium itself the field looked smooth as velvet from their lofty position at either end of the field stood three goal hoops fifty feet high right opposite them almost at eye level was a gigantic blackboard gold writing kept dashing across it as though an invisible hand were scrawling upon the blackboard and then wiping it off again watching it harry saw that it was flashing advertisements across the field 
 
 the bluebottle a broom for all the family safe reliable and with buzzermrs all purpose magical mess remover no pain no wizardwear london paris hogsmeade 
 harry tore his eyes away from the sign and looked over his shoulder to see who else was sharing the box with them so far it was empty except for a tiny creature sitting in the second from last seat at the end of the row behind them the creature whose legs were so short they stuck out in front of it on the chair was wearing a tea towel draped like a toga and it had its face hidden in its hands yet those long batlike ears were oddly familiar 
 
 dobby said harry incredulously 
 
 the tiny creature looked up and stretched its fingers revealing enormous brown eyes and a nose the exact size and shape of a large tomato it dobby it was however unmistakably a as friend dobby had been harry had set dobby free from his old owners the malfoy family 
 
 did sir just call me dobby squeaked the elf curiously from between its fingers its voice was higher even than had been a teeny quivering squeak of a voice and harry suspected though it was very hard to tell with a that this one might just be female ron and hermione spun around in their seats to look though they had heard a lot about dobby from harry they had never actually met him even mr weasley looked around in interest 
 
 sorry harry told the elf i just thought you were someone i knew 
 
 but i knows dobby too sir squeaked the elf she was shielding her face as though blinded by light though the top box was not brightly lit my name is winky sir and you sir her dark brown eyes widened to the size of side plates as they rested upon scar you is surely harry potter 
 
 yeah i am said harry 
 
 but dobby talks of you all the time sir she said lowering her hands very slightly and looking awestruck 
 
 how is he said harry freedom suiting him 
 
 ah sir said winky shaking her head ah sir meaning no disrespect sir but i is not sure you did dobby a favor sir when you is setting him free 
 
 why said harry taken aback wrong with him 
 
 freedom is going to head sir said winky sadly ideas above his station sir get another position sir 
 
 why not said harry 
 
 winky lowered her voice by a and whispered he is wanting paying for his work sir 
 
 paying said harry blankly well why he be paid 
 
 winky looked quite horrified at the idea and closed her fingers slightly so that her face was again 
 
 is not paid sir she said in a muffled squeak no no no i says to dobby i says go find yourself a nice family and settle down dobby he is getting up to all sorts of high jinks sir what is unbecoming to a you goes racketing around like this dobby i says and next thing i hear up in front of the department for the regulation and control of magical creatures like some common goblin 
 
 well about time he had a bit of fun said harry 
 
 is not supposed to have fun harry potter said winky firmly from behind her hands does what they is told i is not liking heights at all harry potter she glanced toward the edge of the box and gulped but my master sends me to the top box and i comes sir 
 
 he sent you up here if he knows you like heights said harry frowning 
 
 master master wants me to save him a seat harry potter he is very busy said winky tilting her head toward the empty space beside her winky is wishing she is back in tent harry potter but winky does what she is told winky is a good 
 
 she gave the edge of the box another frightened look and hid her eyes completely again harry turned back to the others 
 
 so a ron muttered weird things they 
 
 dobby was weirder said harry fervently 
 
 ron pulled out his omnioculars and started testing them staring down into the crowd on the other side of the stadium 
 
 wild he said twiddling the replay knob on the side i can make that old bloke down there pick his nose againand againand again 
 
 hermione meanwhile was skimming eagerly through her velvetcovered tasseled program 
 
 a display from the team mascots will precede the match she read aloud 
 
 oh always worth watching said mr weasley national teams bring creatures from their native land you know to put on a bit of a show 
 
 the box filled gradually around them over the next half hour mr weasley kept shaking hands with people who were obviously very important wizards percy jumped to his feet so often that he looked as though he were trying to sit on a hedgehog when cornelius fudge the minister of magic himself arrived percy bowed so low that his glasses fell off and shattered highly embarrassed he repaired them with his wand and thereafter remained in his seat throwing jealous looks at harry whom cornelius fudge had greeted like an old friend they had met before and fudge shook hand in a fatherly fashion asked how he was and introduced him to the wizards on either side of him 
 
 harry potter you know he told the bulgarian minister loudly who was wearing splendid robes of black velvet trimmed with gold and seem to understand a word of english harry potteroh come on now you know who he isthe boy who survived do know who he is 
 
 the bulgarian wizard suddenly spotted scar and started gabbling loudly and excitedly pointing at it 
 
 knew get there in the end said fudge wearily to harry no great shakes at languages i need barty crouch for this sort of thing ah i see his saving him a job too these bulgarian blighters have been trying to cadge all the best placesah and lucius 
 
 harry ron and hermione turned quickly edging along the second row to three seats right behind mr weasley were none other than dobby the former owners lucius malfoy his son draco and a woman harry supposed must be mother 
 
 harry and draco malfoy had been enemies ever since their very first journey to hogwarts a pale boy with a pointed face and hair draco greatly resembled his father his mother was blonde too tall and slim she would have been if she been wearing a look that suggested there was a nasty smell under her nose 
 
 ah fudge said mr malfoy holding out his hand as he reached the minister of magic how are you i think met my wife narcissa or our son draco 
 
 how do you do how do you do said fudge smiling and bowing to mrs malfoy and allow me to introduce you to mr oblansk obalonsk mr well the bulgarian minister of magic and he understand a word saying anyway so never mind and see who else you know arthur weasley i daresay 
 
 it was a tense moment mr weasley and mr malfoy looked at each other and harry vividly recalled the last time they had come it had been in flourish and blotts bookshop and they had had a fight mr cold gray eyes swept over mr weasley and then up and down the row 
 
 good lord arthur he said softly what did you have to sell to get seats in the top box surely your house have fetched this much 
 
 fudge who listening said lucius has just given a very generous contribution to st hospital for magical maladies and injuries arthur here as my guest 
 
 how how nice said mr weasley with a very strained smile 
 
 mr eyes had returned to hermione who went slightly pink but stared determinedly back at him harry knew exactly what was making mr lip curl like that the malfoys prided themselves on being purebloods in other words they considered anyone of muggle descent like hermione however under the gaze of the minister of magic mr malfoy dare say anything he nodded sneeringly to mr weasley and continued down the line to his seats draco shot harry ron and hermione one contemptuous look then settled himself between his mother and father 
 
 slimy gits ron muttered as he harry and hermione turned to face the field again next moment ludo bagman charged into the box 
 
 everyone ready he said his round face gleaming like a great excited edam minister ready to go 
 
 ready when you are ludo said fudge comfortably 
 
 ludo whipped out his wand directed it at his own throat and said sonorus and then spoke over the roar of sound that was now filling the packed stadium his voice echoed over them booming into every corner of the stands 
 
 ladies and gentlemenwelcome welcome to the final of the four hundred and quidditch world cup 
 
 the spectators screamed and clapped thousands of flags waved adding their discordant national anthems to the racket the huge blackboard opposite them was wiped clear of its last message bertie every flavor beans a risk with every mouthful and now showed bulgaria ireland 
 
 and now without further ado allow me to introducethe bulgarian national team mascots 
 
 the side of the stands which was a solid block of scarlet roared its approval 
 
 i wonder what brought said mr weasley leaning forward in his seat aaah he suddenly whipped off his glasses and polished them hurriedly on his robes veela 
 
 what are veel 
 
 but a hundred veela were now gliding out onto the field and question was answered for him veela were womenthe most beautiful women harry had ever seenexcept that they they be human this puzzled harry for a moment while he tried to guess what exactly they could be what could make their skin shine like that or their hair fan out behind them without windbut then the music started and harry stopped worrying about them not being human in fact he stopped worrying about anything at all 
 
 the veela had started to dance and mind had gone completely and blissfully blank all that mattered in the world was that he kept watching the veela because if they stopped dancing terrible things would happen 
 
 and as the veela danced faster and faster wild thoughts started chasing through dazed mind he wanted to do something very impressive right now jumping from the box into the stadium seemed a good ideabut would it be good enough 
 
 harry what are you doing said voice from a long way off 
 
 the music stopped harry blinked he was standing up and one of his legs was resting on the wall of the box next to him ron was frozen in an attitude that looked as though he were about to dive from a springboard 
 
 angry yells were filling the stadium the crowd want the veela to go harry was with them he would of course be supporting bulgaria and he wondered vaguely why he had a large green shamrock pinned to his chest ron meanwhile was absentmindedly shredding the shamrocks on his hat mr weasley smiling slightly leaned over to ron and tugged the hat out of his hands 
 
 be wanting that he said once ireland have had their say 
 
 huh said ron staring openmouthed at the veela who had now lined up along one side of the field 
 
 hermione made a loud tutting noise she reached up and pulled harry back into his seat honestly she said 
 
 and now roared ludo voice kindly put your wands in the airfor the irish national team mascots 
 
 next moment what seemed to be a great comet came zooming into the stadium it did one circuit of the stadium then split into two smaller comets each hurtling toward the goal posts a rainbow arced suddenly across the field connecting the two balls of light the crowd oooohed and aaaaahed as though at a fireworks display now the rainbow faded and the balls of light reunited and merged they had formed a great shimmering shamrock which rose up into the sky and began to soar over the stands something like golden rain seemed to be falling from it 
 
 excellent yelled ron as the shamrock soared over them and heavy gold coins rained from it bouncing off their heads and seats squinting up at the shamrock harry realized that it was actually comprised of thousands of tiny little bearded men with red vests each carrying a minute lamp of gold or green 
 
 leprechauns said mr weasley over the tumultuous applause of the crowd many of whom were still fighting and rummaging around under their chairs to retrieve the gold 
 
 there you go ron yelled happily stuffing a fistful of gold coins into hand for the omnioculars now got to buy me a christmas present ha 
 
 the great shamrock dissolved the leprechauns drifted down onto the field on the opposite side from the veela and settled themselves to watch the match 
 
 and now ladies and gentlemen kindly welcome the bulgarian national quidditch team i give you dimitrov 
 
 a figure on a broomstick moving so fast it was blurred shot out onto the field from an entrance far below to wild applause from the bulgarian supporters 
 
 ivanova 
 
 a second player zoomed out 
 
 zograf levski vulchanov volkov aaaaaaand krum 
 
 him him yelled ron following krum with his omnioculars harry quickly focused his own 
 
 viktor krum was thin dark and with a large curved nose and thick black eyebrows he looked like an overgrown bird of prey it was hard to believe he was only eighteen 
 
 and now please greet the irish national quidditch team yelled bagman presenting connolly ryan troy mullet moran quigley aaaaaand lynch 
 
 seven green blurs swept onto the field harry spun a small dial on the side of his omnioculars and slowed the players down enough to read the word firebolt on each of their brooms and see their names embroidered in silver upon their backs 
 
 and here all the way from egypt our referee acclaimed chairwizard of the international association of quidditch hassan mostafa 
 
 a small and skinny wizard completely bald but with a mustache to rival uncle wearing robes of pure gold to match the stadium strode out onto the field a silver whistle was protruding from under the mustache and he was carrying a large wooden crate under one arm his broomstick under the other harry spun the speed dial on his omnioculars back to normal watching closely as mostafa mounted his broomstick and kicked the crate open four balls burst into the air the scarlet quaffle the two black bludgers and harry saw it for the briefest moment before it sped out of sight the minuscule winged golden snitch with a sharp blast on his whistle mostafa shot into the air after the balls 
 
 off screamed bagman and mullet troy moran dimitrov back to mullet troy levski moran 
 
 it was quidditch as harry had never seen it played before he was pressing his omnioculars so hard to his glasses that they were cutting into the bridge of his nose the speed of the players was incredible the chasers were throwing the quaffle to one another so fast that bagman only had time to say their names harry spun the slow dial on the right of his omnioculars again pressed the button on the top and he was immediately watching in slow motion while glittering purple lettering flashed across the lenses and the noise of the crowd pounded against his eardrums 
 
 hawkshead attacking formation he read as he watched the three irish chasers zoom closely together troy in the center slightly ahead of mullet and moran bearing down upon the bulgarians porskoff ploy flashed up next as troy made as though to dart upward with the quaffle drawing away the bulgarian chaser ivanova and dropping the quaffle to moran one of the bulgarian beaters volkov swung hard at a passing bludger with his small club knocking it into path moran ducked to avoid the bludger and dropped the quaffle and levski soaring beneath caught it troy scores roared bagman and the stadium shuddered with a roar of applause and cheers ten zero to ireland 
 
 what harry yelled looking wildly around through his omnioculars but got the quaffle 
 
 harry if not going to watch at normal speed going to miss things shouted hermione who was dancing up and down waving her arms in the air while troy did a lap of honor around the field harry looked quickly over the top of his omnioculars and saw that the leprechauns watching from the sidelines had all risen into the air again and formed the great glittering shamrock across the field the veela were watching them sulkily 
 
 furious with himself harry spun his speed dial back to normal as play resumed 
 
 harry knew enough about quidditch to see that the irish chasers were superb they worked as a seamless team their movements so well coordinated that they appeared to be reading one minds as they positioned themselves and the rosette on chest kept squeaking their names troy mullet moran and within ten minutes ireland had scored twice more bringing their lead to and causing a thunderous tide of roars and applause from the supporters 
 
 the match became still faster but more brutal volkov and vulchanov the bulgarian beaters were whacking the bludgers as fiercely as possible at the irish chasers and were starting to prevent them from using some of their best moves twice they were forced to scatter and then finally ivanova managed to break through their ranks dodge the keeper ryan and score first goal 
 
 fingers in your ears bellowed mr weasley as the veela started to dance in celebration harry screwed up his eyes too he wanted to keep his mind on the game after a few seconds he chanced a glance at the field the veela had stopped dancing and bulgaria was again in possession of the quaffle 
 
 dimitrov levski dimitrov ivanova oh i say roared bagman 
 
 one hundred thousand wizards gasped as the two seekers krum and lynch plummeted through the center of the chasers so fast that it looked as though they had just jumped from airplanes without parachutes harry followed their descent through his omnioculars squinting to see where the snitch was 
 
 going to crash screamed hermione next to harry 
 
 she was half right at the very last second viktor krum pulled out of the dive and spiraled off lynch however hit the ground with a dull thud that could be heard throughout the stadium a huge groan rose from the irish seats 
 
 fool moaned mr weasley krum was feinting 
 
 yelled voice as trained mediwizards hurry onto the field to examine aidan lynch 
 
 be okay he only got ploughed charlie said reassuringly to ginny who was hanging over the side of the box looking which is what krum was after of course 
 
 harry hastily pressed the replay and buttons on his omnioculars twiddled the speed dial and put them back up to his eyes 
 
 he watched as krum and lynch dived again in slow motion wronski defensive feint dangerous seeker diversion read the shining purple lettering across his lenses he saw face contorted with concentration as he pulled out of the dive just in time while lynch was flattened and he understood krum seen the snitch at all he was just making lynch copy him harry had never seen anyone fly like that krum hardly looked as though he was using a broomstick at all he moved so easily through the air that he looked unsupported and weightless harry turned his omnioculars back to normal and focused them on krum he was now circling high above lynch who was being revived by mediwizards with cups of potion harry focusing still more closely upon face saw his dark eyes darting all over the ground a hundred feet below he was using the time while lynch was revived to look for the snitch without interference 
 
 lynch got to his feet at last to loud cheers from the supporters mounted his firebolt and kicked back off into the air his revival seemed to give ireland new heart when mostafa blew his whistle again the chasers moved into action with a skill unrivaled by anything harry had seen so far 
 
 after fifteen more fast and furious minutes ireland had pulled ahead by ten more goals they were now leading by one hundred and thirty points to ten and the game was starting to get dirtier 
 
 as mullet shot toward the goal posts yet again clutching the quaffle tightly under her arm the bulgarian keeper zograf flew out to meet her whatever happened was over so quickly harry catch it but a scream of rage from the irish crowd and long shrill whistle blast told him it had been a foul 
 
 and mostafa takes the bulgarian keeper to task for cobbing excessive use of elbows bagman informed the roaring spectators and yes a penalty to ireland 
 
 the leprechauns who had risen angrily into the air like a swarm of glittering hornets when mullet had been fouled now darted together to form the words ha ha ha 
 
 the veela on the other side of the field leapt to their feet tossed their hair angrily and started to dance again 
 
 as one the weasley boys and harry stuffed their fingers into their ears but hermione who bothered was soon tugging on arm he turned to look at her and she pulled his fingers impatiently out of his ears 
 
 look at the referee she said giggling 
 
 harry looked down at the field hassan mostafa had landed right in front of the dancing veela and was acting very oddly indeed he was flexing his muscles and smoothing his mustache excitedly 
 
 now we have that said ludo bagman though he sounded highly amused somebody slap the referee 
 
 a mediwizard came tearing across the field his fingers stuffed into his own ears and kicked mostafa hard in the shins mostafa seemed to come to himself harry watching through the omnioculars again saw that he looked exceptionally embarrassed and had started shouting at the veela who had stopped dancing and were looking mutinous 
 
 and unless much mistaken mostafa is actually attempting to send off the bulgarian team mascots said voice now something we seen beforeoh this could turn nasty 
 
 it did the bulgarian beaters volkov and vulchanov landed on either side of mostafa and began arguing furiously with him gesticulating toward the leprechauns who had now gleefully formed the words hee hee hee mostafa was not impressed by the bulgarians arguments however he was jabbing his finger into the air clearly telling them to get flying again and when they refused he gave two short blasts on his whistle 
 
 two penalties for ireland shouted bagman and the bulgarian crowd howled with anger and volkov and vulchanov had better get back on those broomsyesthere they goand troy takes the quaffle 
 
 play now reached a level of ferocity beyond anything they had yet seen the beaters on both sides were acting without mercy volkov and vulchanov in particular seemed not to care whether their clubs made contact with bludger or human as they swung them violently through the air dimitrov shot straight at moran who had the quaffle nearly knocking her off her broom 
 
 foul roared the irish supporters as one all standing up in a great wave of green 
 
 foul echoed ludo magically magnified voice dimitrov skins moran deliberately flying to collide there and got to be another penalty yes the whistle 
 
 the leprechauns had risen into the air again and this time they formed a giant hand which was making a very rude sign indeed at the veela across the field at this the veela lost control instead of dancing they launched themselves across the field and began throwing what seemed to be handfuls of fire at the leprechauns watching through his omnioculars harry saw that they look remotely beautiful now on the contrary their faces were elongating into sharp bird heads and long scaly wings were bursting from their shoulders 
 
 and that boys yelled mr weasley over the tumult of the crowd below is why you should never go for looks alone 
 
 ministry wizards were flooding onto the field to separate the veela and the leprechauns but with little success meanwhile the pitched battle below was nothing to the one taking place above harry turned this way and that staring through his omnioculars as the quaffie changed hands with the speed of a bullet 
 
 levski dimitrov moran troy mullet ivanova moran again moran moran scores 
 
 but the cheers of the irish supporters were barely heard over the shrieks of the veela the blasts now issuing from the ministry members wands and the furious roars of the bulgarians the game recommenced immediately now levski had the quaffle now dimitrov 
 
 the irish beater quigley swung heavily at a passing bludger and hit it as hard as possible toward krum who did not duck quickly enough it hit him full in the face 
 
 there was a deafening groan from the crowd nose looked broken there was blood everywhere but hassan mostafa blow his whistle he had become distracted and harry blame him one of the veela had thrown a handful of fire and set his broom tail alight 
 
 harry wanted someone to realize that krum was injured even though he was supporting ireland krum was the most exciting player on the field ron obviously felt the same 
 
 ah come on he play like that look at him 
 
 look at lynch harry yelled 
 
 for the irish seeker had suddenly gone into a dive and harry was quite sure that this was no wronski feint this was the real thing 
 
 seen the snitch harry shouted seen it look at him go 
 
 half the crowd seemed to have realized what was happening the irish supporters rose in another great wave of green screaming their seeker onbut krum was on his tail how he could see where he was going harry had no idea there were flecks of blood flying through the air behind him but he was drawing level with lynch now as the pair of them hurtled toward the ground again 
 
 going to crash shrieked hermione 
 
 not roared ron 
 
 lynch is yelled harry 
 
 and he was right for the second time lynch hit the ground with tremendous force and was immediately stampeded by a horde of angry veela 
 
 the snitch the snitch bellowed charlie along the row 
 
 got it got it all over shouted harry 
 
 krum his red robes shining with blood from his nose was rising gently into the air his fist held high a glint of gold in his hand 
 
 the scoreboard was flashing bulgaria ireland across the crowd who seem to have realized what had happened then slowly as though a great jumbo jet were revving up the rumbling from the ireland supporters grew louder and louder and erupted into screams of delight 
 
 ireland wins bagman shouted who like the irish seemed to be taken aback by the sudden end of the match 
 
 krum gets the snitch but ireland wins good lord i think any of us were expecting that 
 
 what did he catch the snitch for ron bellowed even as he jumped up and down applauding with his hands over his head he ended it when ireland were a hundred and sixty points ahead the idiot 
 
 he knew they were never going to catch up harry shouted back over all the noise also applauding loudly the irish chasers were too goodhe wanted to end it on his terms all 
 
 he was very brave he hermione said leaning forward to watch krum land as a swarm of mediwizards blasted a path through the battling leprechauns and veela to get to him he looks a terrible mess 
 
 harry put his omnioculars to his eyes again it was hard to see what was happening below because leprechauns were zooming delightedly all over the field but he could just make out krum surrounded by mediwizards he looked surlier than ever and refused to let them mop him up his team members were around him shaking their heads and looking dejected a short way away the irish players were dancing gleefully in a shower of gold descending from their mascots flags were waving all over the stadium the irish national anthem blared from all sides the veela were shrinking back into their usual beautiful selves now though looking dispirited and forlorn 
 
 vell ve fought bravely said a gloomy voice behind harry he looked around it was the bulgarian minister of magic 
 
 you can speak english said fudge sounding outraged and been letting me mime everything all day 
 
 veil it vos very funny said the bulgarian minister shrugging 
 
 and as the irish team performs a lap of honor flanked by their mascots the quidditch world cup itself is brought into the top box roared bagman 
 
 eyes were suddenly dazzled by a blinding white light as the top box was magically illuminated so that everyone in the stands could see the inside squinting toward the entrance he saw two panting wizards carrying a vast golden cup into the box which they handed to cornelius fudge who was still looking very disgruntled that been using sign language all day for nothing 
 
 have a really loud hand for the gallant losers bulgaria bagman shouted 
 
 and up the stairs into the box came the seven defeated bulgarian players the crowd below was applauding appreciatively harry could see thousands and thousands of omniocular lenses flashing and winking in their direction 
 
 one by one the bulgarians filed between the rows of seats in the box and bagman called out the name of each as they shook hands with their own minister and then with fudge krum who was last in line looked a real mess two black eyes were blooming spectacularly on his bloody face he was still holding the snitch harry noticed that he seemed much less coordinated on the ground he was slightly and distinctly but when name was announced the whole stadium gave him a resounding earsplitting roar 
 
 and then came the irish team aidan lynch was being supported by moran and connolly the second crash seemed to have dazed him and his eyes looked strangely unfocused but he grinned happily as troy and quigley lifted the cup into the air and the crowd below thundered its approval hands were numb with clapping 
 
 at last when the irish team had left the box to perform another lap of honor on their brooms aidan lynch on the back of clutching hard around his waist and still grinning in a bemused sort of way bagman pointed his wand at his throat and muttered quietus 
 
 be talking about this one for years he said hoarsely a really unexpected twist it have lasted yesyes i owe much 
 
 for fred and george had just scrambled over the backs of their seats and were standing in front of ludo bagman with broad grins on their faces their hands outstretched

lionfish nov chapter eight the hearingcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry gasped he could not help himself the large dungeon he had entered was horribly familiar he had not only seen it before he had been here before this was the place he had visited inside pensieve the place where he had watched the lestranges sentenced to life imprisonment in azkaban 
 
 the walls were made of dark stone dimly lit by torches empty benches rose on either side of him but ahead in the highest benches of all were many shadowy figures they had been talking in low voices but as the heavy door swung closed behind harry an ominous silence fell 
 
 a cold male voice rang across the courtroom 
 
 late 
 
 sorry said harry nervously ii know the time had been changed 
 
 that is not the fault said the voice an owl was sent to you this morning take your seat 
 
 harry dropped his gaze to the chair in the centre of the room the arms of which were covered in chains he had seen those chains spring to life and bind whoever sat between them his footsteps echoed loudly as he walked across the stone floor when he sat gingerly on the edge of the chair the chains clinked threateningly but did not bind him feeling rather sick he looked up at the people seated at the bench above 
 
 there were about fifty of them all as far as he could see wearing robes with an elaborately worked silver w on the side of the chest and all staring down their noses at him some with very austere expressions others looks of frank curiosity 
 
 in the very middle of the front row sat cornelius fudge the minister for magic fudge was a portly man who often sported a bowler hat though today he had dispensed with it he had dispensed too with the indulgent smile he had once worn when he spoke to harry a broad witch with very short grey hair sat on fudges left she wore a monocle and looked forbidding on fudges right was another witch but she was sitting so far back on the bench that her face was in shadow 
 
 very well said fudge the accused being presentfinallylet us begin are you ready he called down the row 
 
 yes sir said an eager voice harry knew brother percy was sitting at the very end of the front bench harry looked at percy expecting some sign of recognition from him but none came eyes behind his glasses were fixed on his parchment a quill poised in his hand 
 
 disciplinary hearing of the twelfth of august said fudge in a ringing voice and percy began taking notes at once into offences committed under the decree for the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery and the international statute of secrecy by harry james potter resident at number four privet drive little whinging surrey 
 
 interrogators cornelius oswald fudge minister for magic amelia susan bones head of the department of magical law enforcement dolores jane umbridge senior undersecretary to the minister court scribe percy ignatius weasley 
 
 witness for the defence albus percival wulfric brian dumbledore said a quiet voice from behind harry who turned his head so fast he cricked his neck 
 
 dumbledore was striding serenely across the room wearing long robes and a perfectly calm expression his long silver beard and hair gleamed in the torchlight as he drew level with harry and looked up at fudge through the spectacles that rested halfway down his very crooked nose 
 
 the members of the wizengamot were muttering all eyes were now on dumbledore some looked annoyed others slightly frightened two elderly witches in the back row however raised their hands and waved in welcome 
 
 a powerful emotion had risen in chest at the sight of dumbledore a fortified hopeful feeling rather like that which phoenix song gave him he wanted to catch eye but dumbledore was not looking his way he was continuing to look up at the obviously flustered fudge 
 
 ah said fudge who looked thoroughly disconcerted dumbledore yes youergot ourer message that the time anderplace of the hearing had been changed then 
 
 i must have missed it said dumbledore cheerfully however due to a lucky mistake i arrived at the ministry three hours early so no harm done 
 
 yeswelli suppose need another chairiweasley could you 
 
 not to worry not to worry said dumbledore pleasantly he took out his wand gave it a little flick and a squashy chintz armchair appeared out of nowhere next to harry dumbledore sat down put the tips of his long fingers together and surveyed fudge over them with an expression of polite interest the wizengamot was still muttering and fidgeting restlessly only when fudge spoke again did they settle down 
 
 yes said fudge again shuffling his notes well then so the charges yes 
 
 he extricated a piece of parchment from the pile before him took a deep breath and read out the charges against the accused are as follows that he did knowingly deliberately and in full awareness of the illegality of his actions having received a previous written warning from the ministry of magic on a similar charge produce a patronus charm in a area in the presence of a muggle on the second of august at minutes past nine which constitutes an offence under paragraph c of the decree for the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery and also under section of the international confederation of warlocks statute of secrecy 
 
 you are harry james potter of number four privet drive little whinging surrey fudge said glaring at harry over the top of his parchment 
 
 yes harry said 
 
 you received an official warning from the ministry for using illegal magic three years ago did you not 
 
 yes but 
 
 and yet you conjured a patronus on the night of the second of august said fudge 
 
 yes said harry but 
 
 knowing that you are not permitted to use magic outside school while you are under the age of seventeen 
 
 yes but 
 
 knowing that you were in an area full of muggles 
 
 yes but 
 
 fully aware that you were in close proximity to a muggle at the time 
 
 yes said harry angrily but i only used it because we were 
 
 the witch with the monocle cut across him in a booming voice 
 
 you produced a patronus 
 
 yes said harry because 
 
 a corporeal patronus 
 
 awhat said harry 
 
 your patronus had a clearly defined form i mean to say it was more than vapour or smoke 
 
 yes said harry feeling both impatient and slightly desperate a stag always a stag 
 
 always boomed madam bones you have produced a patronus before now 
 
 yes said harry been doing it for over a year 
 
 and you are fifteen years old 
 
 yes and 
 
 you learned this at school 
 
 yes professor lupin taught me in my third year because of the 
 
 impressive said madam bones staring down at him a true patronus at his age very impressive indeed 
 
 some of the wizards and witches around her were muttering again a few nodded but others were frowning and shaking their heads 
 
 not a question of how impressive the magic was said fudge in a testy voice in fact the more impressive the worse it is i would have thought given that the boy did it in plain view of a muggle 
 
 those who had been frowning now murmured in agreement but it was the sight of sanctimonious little nod that goaded harry into speech 
 
 i did it because of the dementors he said loudly before anyone could interrupt him again 
 
 he had expected more muttering but the silence that fell seemed to be somehow denser than before 
 
 dementors said madam bones after a moment her thick eyebrows rising until her monocle looked in danger of falling out what do you mean boy 
 
 i mean there were two dementors down that alleyway and they went for me and my cousin 
 
 ah said fudge again smirking unpleasantly as he looked around at the wizengamot as though inviting them to share the joke yes yes i thought be hearing something like this 
 
 dementors in little whinging madam bones said in a tone of great surprise i understand 
 
 you amelia said fudge still smirking let me explain been thinking it through and decided dementors would make a very nice little cover story very nice indeed muggles see dementors can they boy highly convenient highly convenient so just your word and no witnesses 
 
 not lying said harry loudly over another outbreak of muttering from the court there were two of them coming from opposite ends of the alley everything went dark and cold and my cousin felt them and ran for it 
 
 enough enough said fudge with a very supercilious look on his face sorry to interrupt what sure would have been a very story 
 
 dumbledore cleared his throat the wizengamot fell silent again 
 
 we do in fact have a witness to the presence of dementors in that alleyway he said other than dudley dursley i mean 
 
 plump face seemed to slacken as though somebody had let air out of it he stared down at dumbledore for a moment or two then with the appearance of a man pulling himself back together said we got time to listen to more tarradiddles afraid dumbledore i want this dealt with quickly 
 
 i may be wrong said dumbledore pleasantly but i am sure that under the wizengamot charter of rights the accused has the right to present witnesses for his or her case that the policy of the department of magical law enforcement madam bones he continued addressing the witch in the monocle 
 
 true said madam bones perfectly true 
 
 oh very well very well snapped fudge where is this person 
 
 i brought her with me said dumbledore just outside the door should i 
 
 noweasley you go fudge barked at percy who got up at once ran down the stone steps from the balcony and hurried past dumbledore and harry without glancing at them 
 
 a moment later percy returned followed by mrs figg she looked scared and more batty than ever harry wished she had thought to change out of her carpet slippers 
 
 dumbledore stood up and gave mrs figg his chair conjuring a second one for himself 
 
 full name said fudge loudly when mrs figg had perched herself nervously on the very edge of her seat 
 
 arabella doreen figg said mrs figg in her quavery voice 
 
 and who exactly are you said fudge in a bored and lofty voice 
 
 a resident of little whinging close to where harry potter lives said mrs figg 
 
 we have no record of any witch or wizard living in little whinging other than harry potter said madam bones at once that situation has always been closely monitored given given past events 
 
 a squib said mrs figg so you have me registered would you 
 
 a squib eh said fudge eyeing her closely be checking that leave details of your parentage with my assistant weasley incidentally can squibs see dementors he added looking left and right along the bench 
 
 yes we can said mrs figg indignantly 
 
 fudge looked back down at her his eyebrows raised very well he said aloofly what is your story 
 
 i had gone out to buy cat food from the corner shop at the end of wisteria walk around about nine on the evening of the second of august gabbled mrs figg at once as though she had learned what she was saying by heart when i heard a disturbance down the alleyway between magnolia crescent and wisteria walk on approaching the mouth of the alleyway i saw dementors running 
 
 running said madam bones sharply dementors run they glide 
 
 what i meant to say said mrs figg quickly patches of pink appearing in her withered cheeks gliding along the alley towards what looked like two boys 
 
 what did they look like said madam bones narrowing her eyes so that the edge of the monocle disappeared into her flesh 
 
 well one was very large and the other one rather skinny 
 
 no no said madam bones impatiently the dementors describe them 
 
 oh said mrs figg the pink flush creeping up her neck now they were big big and wearing cloaks 
 
 harry felt a horrible sinking in the pit of his stomach whatever mrs figg might say it sounded to him as though the most she had ever seen was a picture of a dementor and a picture could never convey the truth of what these beings were like the eerie way they moved hovering inches over the ground or the rotting smell of them or that terrible rattling noise they made as they sucked on the surrounding air 
 
 in the second row a dumpy wizard with a large black moustache leaned close to whisper in the ear of his neighbour a witch she smirked and nodded 
 
 big and wearing cloaks repeated madam bones coolly while fudge snorted derisively i see anything else 
 
 yes said mrs figg i felt them everything went cold and this was a very warm night mark you and i felt as though all happiness had gone from the world and i remembered dreadful things 
 
 her voice shook and died 
 
 madam eyes widened slightly harry could see red marks under her eyebrow where the monocle had dug into it 
 
 what did the dementors do she asked and harry felt a rush of hope 
 
 they went for the boys said mrs figg her voice stronger and more confident now the pink flush ebbing away from her face one of them had fallen the other was backing away trying to repel the dementor that was harry he tried twice and produced only silver vapour on the third attempt he produced a patronus which charged down the first dementor and then with his encouragement chased the second one away from his cousin and that that is what happened mrs figg finished somewhat lamely 
 
 madam bones looked down at mrs figg in silence fudge was not looking at her at all but fidgeting with his papers finally he raised his eyes and said rather aggressively what you saw is it 
 
 that is what happened mrs figg repeated 
 
 very well said fudge you may go 
 
 mrs figg cast a frightened look from fudge to dumbledore then got up and shuffled off towards the door harry heard it thud shut behind her 
 
 not a very convincing witness said fudge loftily 
 
 oh i know said madam bones in her booming voice she certainly described the effects of a dementor attack very accurately and i imagine why she would say they were there if they 
 
 but dementors wandering into a muggle suburb and just happening to come across a wizard snorted fudge the odds on that must be very very long even bagman have bet 
 
 oh i think any of us believe the dementors were there by coincidence said dumbledore lightly 
 
 the witch sitting to the right of fudge with her face in shadow moved slightly but everyone else was quite still and silent 
 
 and what is that supposed to mean fudge asked icily 
 
 it means that i think they were ordered there said dumbledore 
 
 i think we might have a record of it if someone had ordered a pair of dementors to go strolling through little whinging barked fudge 
 
 not if the dementors are taking orders from someone other than the ministry of magic these days said dumbledore calmly i have already given you my views on this matter cornelius 
 
 yes you have said fudge forcefully and i have no reason to believe that your views are anything other than bilge dumbledore the dementors remain in place in azkaban and are doing everything we ask them to 
 
 then said dumbledore quietly but clearly we must ask ourselves why somebody within the ministry ordered a pair of dementors into that alleyway on the second of august 
 
 in the complete silence that greeted these words the witch to the right of fudge leaned forwards so that harry saw her for the first time 
 
 he thought she looked just like a large pale toad she was rather squat with a broad flabby face as little neck as uncle vernon and a very wide slack mouth her eyes were large round and slightly bulging even the little black velvet bow perched on top of her short curly hair put him in mind of a large fly she was about to catch on a long sticky tongue 
 
 the chair recognises dolores jane umbridge senior undersecretary to the minister said fudge 
 
 the witch spoke in a fluttery girlish voice that took harry aback he had been expecting a croak 
 
 sure i must have misunderstood you professor dumbledore she said with a simper that left her big round eyes as cold as ever so silly of me but it sounded for a teensy moment as though you were suggesting that the ministry of magic had ordered an attack on this boy 
 
 she gave a silvery laugh that made the hairs on the back of neck stand up a few other members of the wizengamot laughed with her it could not have been plainer that not one of them was really amused 
 
 if it is true that the dementors are taking orders only from the ministry of magic and it is also true that two dementors attacked harry and his cousin a week ago then it follows logically that somebody at the ministry might have ordered the attacks said dumbledore politely of course these particular dementors may have been outside ministry control 
 
 there are no dementors outside ministry control snapped fudge who had turned brick red 
 
 dumbledore inclined his head in a little bow 
 
 then undoubtedly the ministry will be making a full inquiry into why two dementors were so very far from azkaban and why they attacked without authorisation 
 
 it is not for you to decide what the ministry of magic does or does not do dumbledore snapped fudge now a shade of magenta of which uncle vernon would have been proud 
 
 of course it said dumbledore mildly i was merely expressing my confidence that this matter will not go uninvestigated 
 
 he glanced at madam bones who readjusted her monocle and stared back at him frowning slightly 
 
 i would remind everybody that the behaviour of these dementors if indeed they are not figments of this imagination is not the subject of this hearing said fudge we are here to examine harry offences under the decree for the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery 
 
 of course we are said dumbledore but the presence of dementors in that alleyway is highly relevant clause seven of the decree states that magic may be used before muggles in exceptional circumstances and as those exceptional circumstances include situations which threaten the life of the wizard or witch himself or any witches wizards or muggles present at the time of the 
 
 we are familiar with clause seven thank you very much snarled fudge 
 
 of course you are said dumbledore courteously then we are in agreement that use of the patronus charm in these circumstances falls precisely into the category of exceptional circumstances the clause describes 
 
 if there were dementors which i doubt 
 
 you have heard it from an eyewitness dumbledore interrupted 
 
 if you still doubt her truthfulness call her back question her again i am sure she would not object 
 
 ithatnot blustered fudge fiddling with the papers before him want this over with today dumbledore 
 
 but naturally you would not care how many times you heard from a witness if the alternative was a serious miscarriage of justice said dumbledore 
 
 serious miscarriage my hat said fudge at the top of his voice have you ever bothered to tot up the number of stories this boy has come out with dumbledore while trying to cover up his flagrant misuse of magic out of school i suppose forgotten the hover charm he used three years ago 
 
 that me it was a said harry 
 
 you see roared fudge gesturing flamboyantly in direction a in a muggle house i ask you 
 
 the in question is currently in the employ of hogwarts school said dumbledore i can summon him here in an instant to give evidence if you wish 
 
 inoti got time to listen to anyway not the onlyhe blew up his aunt for sake fudge shouted banging his fist on the bench and upsetting a bottle of ink 
 
 and you very kindly did not press charges on that occasion accepting i presume that even the best wizards cannot always control their emotions said dumbledore calmly as fudge attempted to scrub the ink off his notes 
 
 and i even started on what he gets up to at school 
 
 but as the ministry has no authority to punish hogwarts students for misdemeanours at school behaviour there is not relevant to this hearing said dumbledore as politely as ever but now with a suggestion of coolness behind his words 
 
 oho said fudge not our business what he does at school eh you think so 
 
 the ministry does not have the power to expel hogwarts students cornelius as i reminded you on the night of the second of august said dumbledore nor does it have the right to confiscate wands until charges have been successfully proven again as i reminded you on the night of the second of august in your admirable haste to ensure that the law is upheld you appear inadvertently i am sure to have overlooked a few laws yourself 
 
 laws can be changed said fudge savagely 
 
 of course they can said dumbledore inclining his head and you certainly seem to be making many changes cornelius why in the few short weeks since i was asked to leave the wizengamot it has already become the practice to hold a full criminal trial to deal with a simple matter of underage magic 
 
 a few of the wizards above them shifted uncomfortably in their seats fudge turned a slightly deeper shade of puce the toadlike witch on his right however merely gazed at dumbledore her face quite expressionless 
 
 as far as i am aware dumbledore continued there is no law yet in place that says this job is to punish harry for every bit of magic he has ever performed he has been charged with a specific offence and he has presented his defence all he and i can do now is to await your verdict 
 
 dumbledore put his fingertips together again and said no more fudge glared at him evidently incensed harry glanced sideways at dumbledore seeking reassurance he was not at all sure that dumbledore was right in telling the wizengamot in effect that it was about time they made a decision again however dumbledore seemed oblivious to attempt to catch his eye he continued to look up at the benches where the entire wizengamot had fallen into urgent whispered conversations 
 
 harry looked at his feet his heart which seemed to have swollen to an unnatural size was thumping loudly under his ribs he had expected the hearing to last longer than this he was not at all sure that he had made a good impression he had not really said very much he ought to have explained more fully about the dementors about how he had fallen over about how both he and dudley had nearly been kissed 
 
 twice he looked up at fudge and opened his mouth to speak but his swollen heart was now constricting his air passages and both times he merely took a deep breath and looked back down at his shoes 
 
 then the whispering stopped harry wanted to look up at the judges but found that it was really much much easier to keep examining his laces 
 
 those in favour of clearing the witness of all charges said madam boness booming voice 
 
 head jerked upwards there were hands in the air many of them more than half breathing very fast he tried to count but before he could finish madam bones had said and those in favour of conviction 
 
 fudge raised his hand so did half a dozen others including the witch on his right and the wizard and the witch in the second row 
 
 fudge glanced around at them all looking as though there was something large stuck in his throat then lowered his own hand he took two deep breaths and said in a voice distorted by suppressed rage very well very well cleared of all charges 
 
 excellent said dumbledore briskly springing to his feel pulling out his wand and causing the two chintz armchairs to vanish well i must be getting along good day to you all 
 
 and without looking once at harry he swept from the dungeon 
 
 rowling
