 part 
 
 ext ridge day 
 up on a ridge a group of riders watch stumble clear of the 
 decrepit city feels their presence and looks up very different 
 from the tuaregs they have blue tinted skin and faces covered in strange 
 the mumia still watching grave after all this 
 time 
 the mumia leader is a huge fierce man in black robes with dual scimitars 
 across his waist his face is both handsome and horrible blue and 
 tattooed meet ardeth bay his dark eyes watch stagger off into 
 the open desert 
 ext cairo day 
 cairo a city so old the stars have actually changed their positions in the 
 sky since birth a city teeming with every form of life a strange 
 mysterious wonderful city we superimpose name across the screen 
 cairo 
 int cairo museum of antiquities day 
 deep in the bowels of the museum lie the stacks rows upon rows of towering 
 bookshelves filled with literature on the antiquities standing at the top 
 of a tall ladder between two of these rows and leaning against one of the 
 bookshelves is a rather uninteresting british girl 
 long boring dress your typical prudish nightmare this is 
 evelyn carnarvon going to fall in love with her 
 evelyn pulls a book out from a stack under her arm blows the dust off it 
 then places it on a shelf with other books whose titles all begin with the 
 letter o then she grabs another book out from under her arm and reads 
 the title 
 evelyn 
 tuthmosis now how did you get up here 
 carefully so as not to lose her balance she looks over her shoulder to 
 the bookshelf behind her where all the titles begin with the letter to 
 then she looks down a long way to the bottom evelyn gently sets the 
 other books down on the top shelf then turns and gingerly starts to reach 
 across the aisle with the tuthmosis book a little too far so she 
 stretches reaching holding the top of the ladder with 
 her fingertips almost got it closer now closer 
 and when the ladder pulls away from the shelf evelyn yelps flings 
 the tuthmosis book and grabs the top of the ladder which stands straight 
 up evelyn holds her breath swaying precariously a long beat and then 
 she loses her balance the ladder swings around and evelyn starts 
 stiltwalking down the aisle 
 evelyn 
 oheiugm ahhhhhh 
 the ladder crosses the aisle does an about face and heads back the way it 
 came evelyn clings to the top struggling for balance the ladder teeters 
 out into the main aisle and picks up speed evelyn screams as it does a 
 spins into another aisle and finally crashes to a stop at the top of a 
 bookshelf evelyn holds her breath then sighs heavily 
 and when the bookshelf falls away from her and crashes into the next 
 bookshelf evelyn slides down the ladder and plops to the floor she looks 
 up just as the domino effect each bookshelf crashing into the 
 next and onward it goes bookshelf after bookshelf thousands of volumes 
 flinging off shelves and scattering across the floor it finally ends as 
 the last shelf crashes into a wall eyes are closed she opens one 
 eye looks left then right then opens the other eye and stares at the 
 huge mess 
 evelyn 
 oops 
 the egyptian curator storms in 
 curator 
 look at this sons of the messiah give 
 me frogs flies locusts anything but this 
 compared to you the other plagues were a joy 
 evelyn quickly gets up and starts gathering books 
 evelyn 
 sorry it was an accident 
 curator 
 when ramesses destroyed syria it was an 
 accident you are a catastrophe why do i 
 put up with you 
 evelyn turns to him trying to contain herself 
 evelyn 
 you put up with me because i can read and 
 write ancient egyptian decipher hieroglyphs 
 and hieratic and the only person within a 
 thousand miles who knows how to properly code 
 and catalogue this library 
 curator 
 who needs smart women i put up with you because 
 your mother and father were our finest patrons 
 allah rest their souls now straighten up this 
 mess 
 the curator storms out evelyn just stands there steaming and then she 
 hears a noise and quickly turns around a beat 
 evelyn 
 hello 
 quiet eerie and then she hears it again like feet slowly shuffling 
 across the floor coming from a nearby gallery 
 evelyn 
 abdul mohammed bob 
 evelyn walks through the stacks and enters 
 int the ramesseum 
 filled with treasures and plunder from the middle kingdom very dark 
 and quiet in here the only light is from flickering torches at either end 
 of the spooky gallery 
 the noise again from the far side of the room feet slowly shuffling 
 plodding across the floor evelyn grabs a torch looks a statue 
 of anubis another of horus they stare down at evelyn who is starting to 
 get scared now she walks down the aisle past a closed sarcophagus past 
 cases of ancient artifacts past another sarcophagus only this one is 
 open evelyn freezes swallows hard nervously looks around to see who 
 could have opened it then she slowly leans forward with the torch and 
 peers inside 
 a hideous rotted mummy sits up and screeches at her evelyn 
 screams drops the torch and backs away scared out of her wits and then 
 coming from inside the sarcophagus she hears a man laughing her eyes 
 narrow as a foppish cad crawls out from behind the mummy laughing his ass 
 off half drunk 
 evelyn 
 you you 
 jonathan 
 drunkard fool please call 
 me something original 
 meet jonathan carnarvon as he crawls out of the sarcophagus evelyn pulls 
 a cigarette out of the mouth 
 evelyn 
 have you no respect for the dead 
 jonathan 
 right now i only wish to join them 
 he grins drunkenly evelyn punches him hard in the chest 
 evelyn 
 well i wish do it sooner rather than 
 later before you ruin my 
 career the way ruined yours 
 jonathan 
 my dear sweet baby sister have you 
 know that at this moment my career is on a high note 
 he belches then falls back and sits on the edge of a tomb 
 evelyn 
 high note ha for five years been 
 scrounging around egypt and what have you 
 to show for it nothing 
 jonathan excitedly starts scrounging around in his jacket 
 jonathan 
 oh yes i do i have something right here 
 evelyn 
 oh no not another worthless trinket 
 jonathan if i bring one more 
 piece of junk to the curator to try 
 and sell for you 
 jonathan pulls out a small ancient box the collapsed key to 
 sarcophagus and coffin evelyn is instantly curious she grabs the box out 
 of his hand 
 evelyn 
 where did you get this 
 jonathan knows her weaknesses gives her a mischievous smile 
 jonathan 
 on a dig down in thebes 
 evelyn rolls the box around in her hands mumbling to herself as she 
 translates the hieratics and hieroglyphs covering it jonathan licks his 
 lips in anticipation 
 jonathan 
 my whole life never found 
 anything evy tell me 
 found something 
 fingers play with the various little slats on the box shifting 
 them this way and that way like a puzzle box then suddenly it 
 unfolds itself turning itself into the key sitting 
 inside the open is a folded piece of golden papyrus an ancient 
 map 
 evelyn 
 jonathan 
 jonathan 
 yes 
 evelyn 
 i think you found something 
 int office day 
 the curator sits at his desk staring through a eyepiece at the evelyn hovers behind him excited 
 evelyn 
 see the cartouche there the official 
 royal seal of seti the first sure of it 
 curator 
 perhaps 
 jonathan leans in from across the desk 
 jonathan 
 two questions who the hell is seti the first 
 and was he rich 
 evelyn 
 he was the last pharaoh of the old kingdom 
 said to be the wealthiest pharaoh of them all 
 jonathan 
 alright good good i like this fellow 
 like him very much 
 the curator picks up the map actually the exact same map that we 
 established in the opening scenes of the movie 
 evelyn 
 already dated it this map 
 is almost four thousand years old 
 and the hieratics over here 
 inhales deeply 
 hamunaptra 
 the curator freezes suddenly very nervous then he recovers 
 curator 
 my dear girl be ridiculous 
 we are scholars not treasure 
 hunters hamunaptra is a myth 
 jonathan 
 are we talking about the hamunaptra 
 evelyn 
 yes the city of the dead where the early 
 pharaohs were said to have 
 hidden the wealth of egypt 
 jonathan 
 right right in a big underground treasure 
 chamber everybody knows the story the entire 
 necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand on 
 command a flick of the switch and the 
 whole place could disappear beneath the dunes 
 evelyn 
 all we know is that the city mysteriously 
 vanished around 
 the curator holds the map closer to the burning 
 curator 
 as the americans would say all fairy 
 tales and hokum 
 the map accidentally catches on fire the curator throws it to the 
 floor jonathan drops to his knees and quickly puts it out lifts it up 
 the left third of the map is now missing 
 jonathm 
 you burned it you burned off the part with the lost city 
 curator 
 for the best sure many men have 
 wasted their lives in the foolish pursuit of 
 hamunaptra no one has ever found it most have 
 never returned 
 jonathan devastated 
 you killed my map 
 curator 
 sure it was a fake anyway 
 surprised at you miss 
 carnarvon to be so fooled 
 the curator reaches for the evelyn quickly snatches it off the 
 desk and gives him a very angry suspicious look

 to the princess

 he bows and leaves 
 
 doctor 
 bowing smiling at the princess 
 goodnight 
 
 ann 
 goodnight doctor 
 the doctor leaves followed by the countess who turns off the light and looking back at the princess shuts the door behind her 
 alone the princess looks around the large room at the lavish ancient ornamentation on the ceiling and the huge sculpted headboard she lies back and then remembering eagerly climbs out of bed and runs to the window she looks out longingly at the dancing below the breeze blowing in her face then out over the city the buildings lit up in the night far in the distance thinking she looks back at the door and then back out the window then she runs to her wardrobe and starts rummaging in the clothes hung there 
 
 later dressed in a plain white blouse and skirt and picking up her gloves from the dresser she peers out the door of the bedchambers she sees a guard sat at the end of the wall stir in his pausing as she closes the door she goes out of the side window onto the balcony outside she walks along to the edge of the adjacent balcony jumping down with a slight noise onto the ground glancing furtively around she goes inside to a large empty room she pauses for moment to look around on either side and then continues going through the door she finds herself on a corridor upstairs encircling the large central area she runs along to the end turning the corner and then onto the other side she continues on reaches a staircase and goes down it towards the exit 
 outside still in the grounds of the embassy she runs along a courtyard area the shadow of a man walking appears where she has just come from but she reaches safety at the other end before he can see her 
 running through the buildings further she pauses her back against a wall looking round the corner she sees a man jump out of a small supply truck while he is gone she runs over and quietly hops into the back of the truck the man comes back and throws a couple of bags into the back where she is hiding he then gets in starts the motor and drives off guards at the entrace of the embassy grounds open the doors and the little truck drives out ann peers back over the top of a bag to see the guards closing the doors again as the embassy recede into the distance she looks round with delight moving the bag out of the way leaning her arm on some goods to see out the back better she watches the truck go past a sidewalk cafe busy with people then waves to a couple driving behind on a scooter the woman waves back at her the goods rattle in the back as the truck bounces around and ann rests on a box closing her eyes 
 the truck continues through the city but ann is awakened when the truck stops for a couple walking across the street in front as it is stopped she hops out running to the footpath as the truck screeches away she leans against a tree yawning then continues on 
 crossing a street she walks straight across the passenger cabin of a carriage parked alongside the pavement to the bewilderment of the passengers and driver the cab drives away as ann continues on 
 a light pours from the window of a room on the second floor of the building the carriage was parked in front of

 janenice going dad 
 lester looks up her sheepishly then at carolyn 
 his pov she looks down at us slightly contemptuous but alsobored as if she gave up expecting anything more long ago 
 lesteri keep meaning to get this thing fixed 
 he smiles trying to lighten the moment but expression change she opens the door and gets into the drivers seat jane takes the passenger seat and lester climbs into the back the ml starts to slowly back out of the driveway 
 lester my family and this is my think i miss it so much 
 int ml a short time later

 lester my wife and my daughter think this gigantic loser 
 he has a paper cup of coffee in one hand haphazardly holdingit against his knee slowly it tips over spilling onto his pants leg he remains asleep 
 lester right lost something very important not exactly sure what it is but i know i always fell this sedated 
 finally lester opens one eye 
 pov from the front of the path train zooming along aboveground unnaturally fast heading toward a tunnel 
 lester you know what never too late to get it back 
 and we accelerate into the tunnel and blackness 
 int office building dayclose on a computer monitor scrolling copy moving by too quickly for us to read but we can make out words here and there marketing profits strategy etc 
 lester sits at his workstation in a beige cubicle surrounded by several identical beige cubicles staring at the monitor and talking on a headset phone the light friendly tone of his voice is at odds with the beleaguered expression on his face 
 
 lesterhello this is lester burnham from media monthly magazine calling for actually already left a message about four messages to be exact i understand but i have questions about the new product launch that your press release quite cover 
 brad an affable man in his early thirties appears behindlester lester is immediately aware of his presence

 bradgood why we talk in my smiles and crosses off lester watches him go frowning 
 int office moments later 
 brad is seated behind his desk

 lester sits across from him scowling like a teenager been sent to the office 
 lestersure times are tight and you need to free up cash gotta spend money to make money 
 bradexactly 
 brad stands ready to usher lester out but lester remainsseated 
 when our editorial director used the company mastercard to pay for a hooker and then she used the card number to stay at the st regis for what was it three months 
 unsubstantiated gossip 
 fifty thousand dollars salary somebody probably gonna get fired because craig has to pay women to fuck him 
 bradjesus calm down getting fired yet why having everyone write a job description mapping out in detail how they contribute that way management can assess valuable and 
 lesterexpendable 
 just business

 one of the good guys les i trying to level with you this is your one chance to save your job 
 lester leans back in his chair incredulous 
 int commuter train a short time later

 as lester and carolyn get out of the ml and head towardtheir front door

 janemom do we always have to listen to this elevator music

 a long beat lester suddenly turns to jane 
 lesterso janie how was school

 lesterwant to know how things went at my job

 lester hired this efficiency expert really friendly and i really hate his guts see going to lay somebody off but in the interest of being democratic everybody gets to write a job description for him in the hopes the assholes in management will read it and say whoa we without this guy 
 he trails off obviously waiting for a response from jane 
 lester possibly care any less could you 
 carolyn is watching this closely

 looking to her for a little help here but too uncomfortable with this sudden intimacy to give him any 
 lester know you always have to wait for me to come to you 
 great so now my fault 
 ext burnham house continuous 
 on video looking at lester and jane through greenhouse windows into the kitchen we hear what saying but obvious not going well jane puts her plate in the dishwasher and leaves we follow her out the door then the camera jerks back to lester calling after her 
 close on the lens of a portable video camera as wepull back the camera drops down to reveal ricky fitts whom we recognize as the young man in jail at the beginning his short hair and starched clothes give him a appearance we linger on his placid face for a moment then 
 int burnham kitchen continuous 
 lester stands at the sink rinsing off his plate his facedark his head suddenly jerks up and he looks out the window as if he realizes he s being watched 
 his pov looking at the pint where ricky was just standing but no longer there 
 lester frowns then turns off the faucet grabs a towel anddries his hands he tosses the towel on the snack bar on his way out where it lands next to a framed photograph 
 we zoom slowly toward the photograph of lester carolyn and a jane taken several years earlier at an amusement park starling how happy they look

 the law of club and fang 
 
 
 first day on the yea beach was like a nightmare every hour was filled with shock and surprise he had been suddenly jerked from the heart of civilization and flung into the heart of things primordial no lazy life was this with nothing to do but loaf and be bored here was neither peace nor rest nor a safety all was confusion and action and every moment life and limb were in peril there was imperative need to be constantly alert for these dogs and men were not town dogs and men they were savages all of them who knew no law but the law of club and fang 
 he had never seen dogs fight as these wolfish creatures fought and his first experience taught him an unforgettable lesson it is true it was a vicarious experience else he would not have lived to profit by it curly was the victim they were camped near the log store where she in her friendly way made advances to a husky dog the size of a wolf though not half so large as she there was no warning only a leap in like a flash a metallic clip of teeth a leap out equally swift and face was ripped open from eye to jaw 
 it was the wolf manner of fighting to strike and leap away but there was more to it than this thirty or forty huskies ran to the spot and surrounded the combatants in an intent and silent circle buck did not comprehend that silent intentness nor the eager way with which they were licking their chops curly rushed her antagonist who struck again and leaped aside he met her next rush with his chest in a peculiar fashion that tumbled her off her feet she never regained them this was what the onlooking huskies had waited for they closed in upon her snarling and yelping and she was buried screaming with agony beneath the bristling mass of bodies 
 so sudden was it and so unexpected that buck was taken aback he saw spitz run out his scarlet tongue in a way he had of laughing and he saw francois swinging an axe spring into the mess of dogs three men with clubs were helping him to scatter them it did not take long two minutes from the time curly went down the last of her assailants were clubbed off but she lay there limp and lifeless in the bloody trampled snow almost literally torn to pieces the swart standing over her and cursing horribly the scene often came back to buck to trouble him in his sleep so that was the way no fair play once down that was the end of you well he would see to it that he never went down spitz ran out his tongue and laughed again and from that moment buck hated him with a bitter and deathless hatred 
 before he had recovered from the shock caused by the tragic passing of curly he received another shock francois fastened upon him an arrangement of straps and buckles it was a harness such as he had seen the grooms put on the horses at home and as he had seen horses work so he was set to work hauling francois on a sled to the forest that fringed the valley and returning with a load of firewood though his dignity was sorely hurt by thus being made a draught animal he was too wise to rebel he buckled down with a will and did his best though it was all new and strange francois was stern demanding instant obedience and by virtue of his whip receiving instant obedience while dave who was an experienced wheeler nipped hindquarters whenever he was in error spitz was the leader likewise experienced and while he could not always get at buck he growled sharp reproof now and again or cunningly threw his weight in the traces to jerk buck into the way he should go buck learned easily and under the combined tuition of his two mates and francois made remarkable progress ere they returned to camp he knew enough to stop at ho to go ahead at mush to swing wide on the bends and to keep clear of the wheeler when the loaded sled shot downhill at their heels 
 three very good dogs francois told perrault dat buck him pull like hell i teach him quick as anything 
 by afternoon perrault who was in a hurry to be on the trail with his dispatches returned with two more dogs billee and joe he called them two brothers and true huskies both sons of the one mother though they were they were different as day and night one fault was his excessive good nature while joe was the very opposite sour and introspective with a perpetual snarl and a malignant eye buck received them in comradely fashion dave ignored them while spitz proceeded to thrash first one and then the other billee wagged his tail appeasingly turned to run when he saw that appeasement was of no avail and cried still appeasingly when sharp teeth scored his flank but no matter how spitz circled joe whirled around on his heels to face him mane bristling ears laid back lips writhing and snarling jaws clipping together as fast as he could snap and eyes diabolically incarnation of belligerent fear so terrible was his appearance that spitz was forced to forego disciplining him but to cover his own discomfiture he turned upon the inoffensive and wailing billee and drove him to the confines of the camp 
 by evening perrault secured another dog an old husky long and lean and gaunt with a face and a single eye which flashed a warning of prowess that commanded respect he was called which means the angry one like dave he asked nothing gave nothing expected nothing and when he marched slowly and deliberately into their midst even spitz left him alone he had one peculiarity which buck was unlucky enough to discover he did not like to be approached on his blind side of this offense buck was unwittingly guilty and the first knowledge he had of his indiscretion was when whirled upon him and slashed his shoulder to the bone for three inches up and down forever after buck avoided his blind side and to the last of their comradeship had no more his only apparent ambition like was to be left alone though as buck was afterward to learn each of them possessed one other and even more vital ambition 
 that night buck faced the great problem of sleeping the tent illumined by a candle glowed warmly in the midst of the white plain and when he as a matter of course entered it both perrault and francois bombarded him with curses and cooking utensils till he recovered from his consternation and fled ignominiously into the outer cold a chill wind was blowing that nipped him sharply and bit with especial venom into his wounded shoulder he lay down on the snow and attempted to sleep but the frost soon drove him shivering to his feet miserable and disconsolate he wandered about among the many tents only to find that one place was as cold as another here and there savage dogs rushed upon him but he bristled his and snarled for he was learning fast and they let him go his way unmolested 
 finally an idea came to him he would return and see how his own teammates were making out to his astonishment they had disappeared again he wandered about through the great camp looking for them and again he returned were they in the tent no that could not be else he would not have been driven out then where could they possibly be with drooping tail and shivering body very forlorn indeed he aimlessly circled the tent suddenly the snow gave way beneath his fore legs and he sank down something wriggled under his feet he sprang back bristling and snarling fearful of the unseen and unknown but a friendly little yelp reassured him and he went back to investigate a whiff of warm air ascended to his nostrils and there curled up under the snow in a snug ball lay billee he whined placatingly squirmed and wriggled to show his good will and intentions and even ventured as a bribe for peace to lick face with his warm wet tongue 
 another lesson so that was the way they did it eh buck confidently selected a spot and with much fuss and wasted effort proceeded to dig a hole for himself in a trice the heat from his body filled the confined space and he was asleep the day had been long and arduous and he slept soundly and comfortably though he growled and barked and wrestled with bad dreams 
 nor did he open his eyes till roused by the noises of the waking camp at first he did not know where he was it had snowed during the night and he was completely buried the snow walls pressed him on every side and a great surge of fear swept through fear of the wild thing for the trap it was a token that he was harking back through his own life to the lives of his forebears for he was a civilized dog an unduly civilized dog and of his own experience knew no trap and so could not of himself fear it the muscles of his whole body contracted spasmodically and instinctively the hair on his neck and shoulders stood on end and with a ferocious snarl he bounded straight up into the blinding day the snow flying about him in a flashing cloud ere he landed on his feet he saw the white camp spread out before him and knew where he was and remembered all that had passed from the time he went for a stroll with manuel to the hole he had dug for himself the night before 
 a shout from francois hailed his appearance what i say the cried to perrault dat buck for sure learn quick as anything 
 perrault nodded gravely as courier for the canadian government bearing important dispatches he was anxious to secure the best dogs and he was particularly gladdened by the possession of buck 
 three more huskies were added to the team inside an hour making a total of nine and before another quarter of an hour had passed they were in harness and swinging up the trail toward the yea canyon buck was glad to be gone and though the work was hard he found he did not particularly despise it he was surprised at the eagerness which animated the whole team and which was communicated to but still more surprising was the change wrought in dave and they were new dogs utterly transformed by the harness all passiveness and unconcern had dropped from them they were alert and active anxious that the work should go well and fiercely irritable with whatever by delay or confusion retarded that work the toil of the traces seemed the supreme expression of their being and all that they lived for and the only thing in which they took delight 
 dave was wheeler or sled dog pulling in front of him was buck then came the rest of the team was strung out ahead single file to the leader which position was filled by spitz 
 buck had been purposely placed between dave and so that he might receive instruction apt scholar that he was they were equally apt teachers never allowing him to linger long in error and enforcing their teaching with their sharp teeth dave was fair and very wise he never nipped buck without cause and he never failed to nip him when he stood in need of it as francois whip backed him up buck found it to be cheaper to mend his ways than to retaliate once during a brief halt when he got tangled in the traces and delayed the start both dave and flew at him and administered a sound trouncing the resulting tangle was even worse but buck took good care to keep the traces clear thereafter and ere the day was done so well had he mastered his work his mates about ceased nagging him francois whip snapped less frequently and perrault even honored buck by lifting up his feet and carefully examining them 
 it was a hard run up the canyon through sheep camp past the scales and the timber line across glaciers and snowdrifts hundreds of feet deep and over the great chilcoot divide which stands between the salt water and the fresh and guards forbiddingly the sad and lonely north they made good time down the chain of lakes which fills the craters of extinct volcanoes and late that night pulled into the huge camp at the head of lake bennett where thousands of were building boats against the breakup of the ice in the spring buck made his hole in the snow and slept the sleep of the exhausted just but all too early was routed out in the cold darkness and harnessed with his mates to the sled 
 that day they made forty miles the trail being packed but the next day and for many days to follow they broke their own trail worked harder and made poorer time as a rule perrault traveled ahead of the team packing the snow with webbed shoes to make it easier for them francois guiding the sled at the sometimes exchanged places with him but not often perrault was in a hurry and he prided himself on his knowledge of ice which knowledge was indispensable for the fall ice was very thin and where there was swift water there was no ice at all 
 day after day for days unending buck toiled in the traces always they broke camp in the dark and the first gray of dawn found them hitting the trail with fresh miles reeled off behind them and always they pitched camp after dark eating their bit of fish and crawling to sleep into the snow buck was ravenous the pound and a half of sundried salmon which was his ration for each day seemed to go nowhere he never had enough and suffered from perpetual hunger pangs yet the other dogs because they weighed less and were born to the life received a pound only of the fish and managed to keep in good condition 
 he swiftly lost the fastidiousness which had characterized his old life a dainty eater he found that his mates finishing first robbed him of his unfinished ration there was no defending it while he was fighting off two or three it was disappearing down the throats of the others to remedy this he ate as fast as they and so greatly did hunger compel him he was not above taking what did not belong to him he watched and learned when he saw pike one of the new dogs a clever malingerer and thief slyly steal a slice of bacon when back was turned he duplicated the performance the following day getting away with the whole chunk a great uproar was raised but he was unsuspected while dub an awkward blunderer who was always getting caught was punished for misdeed 
 this first theft marked buck as fit to survive in the hostile northland environment it marked his adaptability his capacity to adjust himself to changing conditions the lack of which would have meant swift and terrible death it marked further the decay or going to pieces of his moral nature a vain thing and a handicap in the ruthless struggle for existence it was all well enough in the southland under the law of love and fellowship to respect private property and personal feeling but in the northland under the law of club and fang whoso took such things into account was a fool and in so far as he observed them he would fail to prosper 
 not that buck reasoned it out he was fit that was all and unconsciously he accommodated himself to the new mode of life all his days no matter what the odds he had never run from a fight but the club of the man in the red sweater had beaten into him a more fundamental and primitive code civilized he could have died for a moral consideration say the defense of judge riding whip but the completeness of his decivilization was now evidenced by his ability to flee from the defense of a moral consideration and so save his hide he did not steal for joy of it but because of the clamor of his stomach he did not rob openly but stole secretly and cunningly out of respect for club and fang in short the things he did were done because it was easier to do them than not to do them 
 his development or retrogression was rapid his muscles became hard as iron and he grew callous to all ordinary pain he achieved an internal as well as external economy he could eat anything no matter how loathsome or indigestible and once eaten the juices of his stomach extracted the last least particle of nutriment and his blood carried it to the farthest reaches of his body building it into the toughest and stoutest of tissues sight and scent became remarkably keen while his hearing developed such acuteness that in his sleep he heard the faintest sound and knew whether it heralded peace or peril he learned to bite the ice out with his teeth when it collected between his toes and when he was thirsty and there was a thick scum of ice over the water hole he would break it by rearing and striking it with stiff fore legs his most conspicuous trait was an ability to scent the wind and forecast it a night in advance no matter how breathless the air when he dug his nest by tree or bank the wind that later blew inevitably found him to leeward sheltered and snug 
 and not only did he learn by experience but instincts long dead became alive again the domesticated generations fell from him in vague ways he remembered back to the youth of the breed to the time the wild dogs ranged in packs through the primeval forest and killed their meat as they ran it down it was no task for him to learn to fight with cut and slash and the quick wolf snap in this manner had fought forgotten ancestors they quickened the old life within him and the old tricks which they had stamped into the heredity of the breed were his tricks they came to him without effort or discovery as though they had been his always and when on the still cold nights he pointed his nose at a star and howled long and it was his ancestors dead and dust pointing nose at star and howling down through the centuries and through him and his cadences were their cadences the cadences which voiced their woe and what to them was the meaning of the stillness and the cold and dark 
 thus as token of what a puppet thing life is the ancient song surged through him and he came into his own again and he came because men had found a yellow metal in the north and because manuel was a helper whose wages did not lap over the needs of his wife and divers small copies of himself

 the creature slipped off the bed and bowed so low that the end of its long thin nose touched the carpet harry noticed that it was wearing what looked like an old pillowcase with rips for arm and 
 
 er hello said harry nervously

 harry thought he heard the voices downstairs falter 
 
 sorry he whispered i mean to offend you or anything 
 
 offend dobby choked the elf dobby has never been asked to sit down by a wizard like an equal 
 
 harry trying to say shh and look comforting at the same time ushered dobby back onto the bed where he sat hiccoughing looking like a large and very ugly doll at last he managed to control himself and sat with his great eyes fixed on harry in an expression of watery adoration 
 
 you have met many decent wizards said harry trying to cheer him up 
 
 dobby shook his head then without warning he leapt up and started banging his head furiously on the window shouting bad dobby bad dobby 
 
 what are you doing harry hissed springing up and pulling dobby back onto the bed hedwig had woken up with a particularly loud screech and was beating her wings wildly against the bars of her cage 
 
 dobby had to punish himself sir said the elf who had gone slightly dobby almost spoke ill of his family sir 
 
 your family 
 
 the wizard family dobby serves sir dobby is a bound to serve one house and one family forever

 dobby shuddered 
 
 oh no sir no dobby will have to punish himself most grievously for coming to see you sir dobby will have to shut his ears in the oven door for this if they ever knew sir 
 
 but they notice if you shut your ears in the oven door 
 
 dobby doubts it sir dobby is always having to punish himself for something sir they lets dobby get on with it sir sometimes they reminds me to do extra punishments 
 
 but why you leave escape 
 
 a must be set free sir and the family will never set dobby free dobby will serve the family until he dies sir

 please harry whispered frantically please be quiet if the dursleys hear anything if they know here 
 
 harry potter asks if he can help dobby dobby has heard of your greatness sir but of your goodness dobby never knew 
 
 harry who was feeling distinctly hot in the face said whatever heard about my greatness is a load of rubbish not even top of my year at hogwarts hermione she 
 
 but he stopped quickly because thinking about hermione was painful 
 
 harry potter is humble and modest said dobby reverently his eyes aglow harry potter speaks not of his triumph over 
 
 voldemort said harry 
 
 dobby clapped his hands over his bat ears and moaned ah speak not the name sir speak not the name 
 
 sorry said harry quickly i know lots of people like it my friend ron 
 
 he stopped again thinking about ron was painful too 
 
 dobby leaned toward harry his eyes wide as headlights 
 
 dobby heard tell he said hoarsely that harry potter met the dark lord for a second time just weeks ago that harry potter escaped yet again 
 
 harry nodded and eyes suddenly shone with tears 
 
 ah sir he gasped dabbing his face with a corner of the grubby pillowcase he was wearing harry potter is valiant and bold he has braved so many dangers already but dobby has come to protect harry potter to warn him even if he does have to shut his ears in the oven door later harry potter must not go back to hogwarts 
 
 there was a silence broken only by the chink of knives and forks from downstairs and the distant rumble of uncle voice 
 
 harry stammered but got to go back term starts on september first all keeping me going you know what like here i belong here i belong in your world at hogwarts 
 
 no no no squeaked dobby shaking his head so hard his ears flapped harry potter must stay where he is safe he is too great too good to lose if harry potter goes back to hogwarts he will be in mortal danger 
 
 why said harry in surprise 
 
 there is a plot harry potter a plot to make most terrible things happen at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry this year whispered dobby suddenly trembling all over dobby has known it for months sir harry potter must not put himself in peril he is too important sir 
 
 what terrible things said harry at once plotting them 
 
 dobby made a funny choking noise and then banged his head frantically against the wall 
 
 all right cried harry grabbing the arm to stop him you tell me i understand but why are you warning me a sudden unpleasant thought struck him hang on this got anything to do with vol sorry with has it you could just shake or nod he added hastily as head tilted worryingly close to the wall again 
 
 slowly dobby shook his head 
 
 not not sir 
 
 but eyes were wide and he seemed to be trying to give harry a hint harry however was completely lost 
 
 he got a brother has he 
 
 dobby shook his head his eyes wider than ever 
 
 well then i think who else would have a chance of making horrible things happen at hogwarts said harry i mean dumbledore for one thing you know who dumbledore is you 
 
 dobby bowed his head 
 
 albus dumbledore is the greatest headmaster hogwarts has ever had dobby knows it sir dobby has heard powers rival those of at the height of his strength but sir voice dropped to an urgent whisper there are powers dumbledore powers no decent wizard 
 
 and before harry could stop him dobby bounded off the bed seized desk lamp and started beating himself around the head with earsplitting yelps 
 
 a sudden silence fell downstairs two seconds later harry heart thudding madly heard uncle vernon coming into the hall calling dudley must have left his television on again the little tyke 
 
 quick in the closet hissed harry stuffing dobby in shutting the door and flinging himself onto the bed just as the door handle turned 
 
 what the devil are you doing said uncle vernon through gritted teeth his face horribly close to just ruined the punch line of my japanese golfer joke one more sound and wish never been born boy 
 
 he stomped from the room 
 
 shaking harry let dobby out of the closet 
 
 see what like here he said see why got to go back to hogwarts the only place got well i think got friends 
 
 friends who even write to harry potter said dobby slyly 
 
 i expect just been wait a minute said harry frowning how do you know my friends been writing to me 
 
 dobby shuffled his feet 
 
 harry potter be angry with dobby dobby did it for the best 
 
 have you been stopping my letters 
 
 dobby has them here sir said the elf stepping nimbly out of reach he pulled a thick wad of envelopes from the inside of the pillowcase he was wearing harry could make out neat writing untidy scrawl and even a scribble that looked as though it was from the hogwarts gamekeeper hagrid 
 
 dobby blinked anxiously up at harry 
 
 harry potter be angry dobby hoped if harry potter thought his friends had forgotten him harry potter might not want to go back to school sir 
 
 harry listening he made a grab for the letters but dobby jumped out of reach 
 
 harry potter will have them sir if he gives dobby his word that he will not return to hogwarts ah sir this is a danger you must not face say you go back sir 
 
 no said harry angrily give me my 
 
 then harry potter leaves dobby no choice said the elf sadly 
 
 before harry could move dobby had darted to the bedroom door pulled it open and sprinted down the stairs 
 
 mouth dry stomach lurching harry sprang after him trying not to make a sound he jumped the last six steps landing catlike on the hall carpet looking around for dobby from the dining room he heard uncle vernon saying tell petunia that very funny story about those american plumbers mr mason been dying to hear 
 
 harry ran up the hall into the kitchen and felt his stomach disappear 
 
 aunt masterpiece of a pudding the mountain of cream and sugared violets was floating up near the ceiling on top of a cupboard in the corner crouched dobby 
 
 no croaked harry please kill me 
 
 harry potter must say not going back to school 
 
 dobby please 
 
 say it sir 
 
 i 
 
 dobby gave him a tragic look 
 
 then dobby must do it sir for harry own good 
 
 the pudding fell to the floor with a crash cream splattered the windows and walls as the dish shattered with a crack like a whip dobby vanished 
 
 there were screams from the dining room and uncle vernon burst into the kitchen to find harry rigid with shock covered from head to foot in aunt pudding 
 
 at first it looked as though uncle vernon would manage to gloss the whole thing over just our nephew very disturbed meeting strangers upsets him so we kept him upstairs he shooed the shocked masons back into the dining room promised harry he would flay him to within an inch of his life when the masons had left and handed him a mop aunt petunia dug some ice cream out of the freezer and harry still shaking started scrubbing the kitchen clean 
 
 uncle vernon might still have been able to make his deal if it been for the owl 
 
 aunt petunia was just passing around a box of mints when a huge barn owl swooped through the dining room window dropped a letter on mrs head and swooped out again mrs mason screamed like a banshee and ran from the house shouting about lunatics mr mason stayed just long enough to tell the dursleys that his wife was mortally afraid of birds of all shapes and sizes and to ask whether this was their idea of a joke 
 
 harry stood in the kitchen clutching the mop for support as uncle vernon advanced on him a demonic glint in his tiny eyes 
 
 read it he hissed evilly brandishing the letter the owl had delivered go on read it 
 
 harry took it it did not contain birthday greetings 
 
 dear mr potter 
 
 we have received intelligence that a hover charm was used at your place of residence this evening at twelve minutes past nine 
 
 as you know underage wizards are not permitted to perform spells outside school and further spellwork on your part may lead to expulsion from said school decree for the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery paragraph c 
 
 we would also ask you to remember that any magical activity that risks notice by members of the non magical community muggles is a serious offense under section of the international confederation of of secrecy 
 
 enjoy your holidays 
 
 yours sincerely 
 
 mafalda hopkirk 
 
 improper use of magic office 
 
 ministry of magic 
 
 harry looked up from the letter and gulped 
 
 you tell us you allowed to use magic outside school said uncle vernon a mad gleam dancing in his eyes forgot to mention it slipped your mind i daresay 
 
 he was bearing down on harry like a great bulldog all his teeth bared well got news for you boy locking you up never going back to that school never and if you try and magic yourself out expel you 
 
 and laughing like a maniac he dragged harry back upstairs 
 
 uncle vernon was as bad as his word the following morning he paid a man to fit bars on window he himself fitted a in the bedroom door so that small amounts of food could be pushed inside three times a day they let harry out to use the bathroom morning and evening otherwise he was locked in his room around the clock 
 
 three days later the dursleys were showing no sign of relenting and harry see any way out of his situation he lay on his bed watching the sun sinking behind the bars on the window and wondered miserably what was going to happen to him 
 
 what was the good of magicking himself out of his room if hogwarts would expel him for doing it yet life at privet drive had reached an low now that the dursleys knew they going to wake up as fruit bats he had lost his only weapon dobby might have saved harry from horrible happenings at hogwarts but the way things were going probably starve to death anyway 
 
 the rattled and aunt petunias hand appeared pushing a bowl of canned soup into the room harry whose insides were aching with hunger jumped off his bed and seized it the soup was but he drank half of it in one gulp then he crossed the room to cage and tipped the soggy vegetables at the bottom of the bowl into her empty food tray she ruffled her feathers and gave him a look of deep disgust 
 
 no good turning your beak up at it all got said harry grimly 
 
 he put the empty bowl back on the floor next to the and lay back down on the bed somehow even hungrier than he had been before the soup 
 
 supposing he was still alive in another four weeks hat would happen if he turn up at hogwarts would someone be sent to see why he come back would they be able to make the dursleys let him go 
 
 the room was growing dark exhausted stomach rumbling mind spinning over the same unanswerable questions harry fell into an uneasy sleep 
 
 he dreamed that he was on show in a zoo with a card reading underage wizard attached to his cage people goggled through the bars at him as he lay starving and weak on a bed of straw he saw face in the crowd and shouted out asking for help but dobby called harry potter is safe there sir and vanished then the dursleys appeared and dudley rattled the bars of the cage laughing at him 
 
 stop it harry muttered as the rattling pounded in his sore head leave me alone cut it out trying to sleep 
 
 he opened his eyes moonlight was shining through the bars on the window and someone was goggling through the bars at him a someone 
 
 ron weasley was outside window 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the chamber of secrets 
 

lionfish nov chapter two aunt big mistakecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry went down to breakfast the next morning to find the three dursleys already sitting around the kitchen table they were watching a television a present for dudley who had been complaining loudly about the long walk between the fridge and the television in the living room dudley had spent most of the summer in the kitchen his piggy little eyes fixed on the screen and his five chins wobbling as he ate continually 
 
 harry sat down between dudley and uncle vernon a large beefy man with very little neck and a lot of mustache far from wishing harry a happy birthday none of the dursleys made any sign that they had noticed harry enter the room but harry was far too used to this to care he helped himself to a piece of toast and then looked up at the reporter on the television who was halfway through a report on an escaped convict 
 
 the public is warned that black is armed and extremely dangerous a special hot line has been set up and any sighting of black should be reported immediately 
 
 no need to tell us no good snorted uncle vernon staring over the top of his newspaper at the prisoner look at the state of him the filthy layabout look at his hair 
 
 he shot a nasty look sideways at harry whose untidy hair had always been a source of great annoyance to uncle vernon compared to the man on the television however whose gaunt face was surrounded by a matted tangle harry felt very well groomed indeed 
 
 the reporter had reappeared 
 
 the ministry of agriculture and fisheries will announce today 
 
 hang on barked uncle vernon staring furiously at the reporter you tell us where that escaped from what use is that lunatic could be coming up the street right now 
 
 aunt petunia who was bony and whipped around and peered intently out of the kitchen window harry knew aunt petunia would simply love to be the one to call the hot line number she was the nosiest woman in the world and spent most of her life spying on the boring neighbors 
 
 when will they learn said uncle vernon pounding the table with his large purple fist that the only way to deal with these people 
 
 very true said aunt petunia who was still squinting into next 
 
 uncle vernon drained his teacup glanced at his watch and added better be off in a minute petunia train gets in at ten 
 
 harry whose thoughts had been upstairs with the broomstick servicing kit was brought back to earth with an unpleasant bump 
 
 aunt marge he blurted out not coming here is she 
 
 aunt marge was uncle sister even though she was not a blood relative of whose mother had been aunt sister he had been forced to call her aunt all his life aunt marge lived in the country in a house with a large garden where she bred bulldogs she often stay at privet drive because she bear to leave her precious dogs but each of her visits stood out horribly vividly in mind 
 
 at fifth birthday party aunt margo had whacked harry around the shins with her walking stick to stop him from beating dudley at musical statues a few years later she had turned up at christmas with a computerized robot for dudley and a box of dog biscuits for harry on her last visit the year before harry started at hogwarts harry had accidentally trodden on the tail of her favorite dog ripper had chased harry out into the garden and up a tree and aunt marge had refused to call him off until past midnight the memory of this incident still brought tears of laughter to eyes 
 
 be here for a week uncle vernon snarled and while on the subject he pointed a fat finger threateningly at harry we need to get a few things straight before i go and collect her 
 
 dudley smirked and withdrew his gaze from the television watching harry being bullied by uncle vernon was favorite form of entertainment 
 
 firstly growled uncle vernon keep a civil tongue in your head when talking to marge 
 
 all right said harry bitterly if she does when talking to me 
 
 secondly said uncle vernon acting as though he had not heard reply as marge know anything about your abnormality i want any any funny stuff while here you behave yourself got me 
 
 i will if she does said harry through gritted teeth 
 
 and thirdly said uncle vernon his mean little eyes now slits in his great purple face told marge you attend st secure center for incurably criminal boys 
 
 what harry yelled 
 
 and be sticking to that story boy or be trouble spat uncle vernon 
 
 harry sat there and furious staring at uncle vernon hardly able to believe it aunt marge coming for a weeklong visit it was the worst birthday present the dursleys had ever given him including that pair of uncle old socks 
 
 well petunia said uncle vernon getting heavily to his feet be off to the station then want to come along for the ride dudders 
 
 no said dudley whose attention had returned to the television now that uncle vernon had finished threatening harry 
 
 got to make himself smart for his auntie said aunt petunia smoothing thick blond hair bought him a lovely new 
 
 uncle vernon clapped dudley on his porky shoulder 
 
 see you in a bit then he said and he left the kitchen 
 
 harry who had been sitting in a kind of horrified trance had a sudden idea abandoning his toast he got quickly to his feet and followed uncle vernon to the front door 
 
 uncle vernon was pulling on his car coat 
 
 not taking you he snarled as he turned to see harry watching him 
 
 like i wanted to come said harry coldly i want to ask you something 
 
 uncle vernon eyed him suspiciously 
 
 third years at hog at my school are allowed to visit the village sometimes said harry 
 
 so snapped uncle vernon taking his car keys from a hook next to the door 
 
 i need you to sign the permission form said harry in a rush 
 
 and why should i do that sneered uncle vernon 
 
 well said harry choosing his words carefully be hard work pretending to aunt marge i go to that st whatsits 
 
 st secure center for incurably criminal boys bellowed uncle vernon and harry was pleased to hear a definite note of panic in uncle voice 
 
 exactly said harry looking calmly up into uncle large purple face a lot to remember have to make it sound convincing i what if i accidentally let something slip 
 
 get the stuffing knocked out of you you roared uncle vernon advancing on harry with his fist raised but harry stood his ground 
 
 knocking the stuffing out of me make aunt marge forget what i could tell her he said grimly 
 
 uncle vernon stopped his fist still raised his face an ugly puce 
 
 but if you sign my permission form harry went on quickly i swear ill remember where supposed to go to school and ill act like a mug like normal and everything 
 
 harry could tell that uncle vernon was thinking it over even if his teeth were bared and a vein was throbbing in his temple 
 
 right he snapped finally i shall monitor your behavior carefully during visit if at the end of it toed the line and kept to the story ill sign your ruddy form 
 
 he wheeled around pulled open the front door and slammed it so hard that one of the little panes of glass at the top fell out 
 
 harry return to the kitchen he went back upstairs to his bedroom if he was going to act like a real muggle heed better start now slowly and sadly he gathered up all his presents and his birthday cards and hid them under the loose floorboard with his homework then he went to cage errol seemed to have recovered he and hedwig were both asleep heads under their wings harry sighed then poked them both awake 
 
 hedwig he said gloomily going to have to clear off for a week go with errol look after you ill write him a note explaining and look at me like that large amber eyes were reproachful not my fault the only way be allowed to visit hogsmeade with ron and hermione 
 
 ten minutes later errol and hedwig who had a note to ron bound to her leg soared out of the window and out of sight harry now feeling thoroughly miserable put the empty cage away inside the wardrobe 
 
 but harry have long to brood in next to no time aunt petunia was shrieking up the stairs for harry to come down and get ready to welcome their guest 
 
 do something about your hair aunt petunia snapped as he reached the hall 
 
 harry see the point of trying to make his hair lie flat aunt marge loved criticizing him so the untidier he looked the happier she would be 
 
 all too soon there was a crunch of gravel outside as uncle car pulled back into the driveway then the clunk of the car doors and footsteps on the garden path 
 
 get the door aunt petunia hissed at harry 
 
 a feeling of great gloom in his stomach harry pulled the door open 
 
 on the threshold stood aunt marge she was very like uncle vernon large beefy and she even had a mustache though not as bushy as his in one hand she held an enormous suitcase and tucked under the other was an old and bulldog 
 
 my dudders roared aunt marge my neffy poo 
 
 dudley came waddling down the hall his blond hair plastered flat to his fat head a bow tie just visible under his many chins aunt marge thrust the suitcase into stomach knocking the wind out of him seized dudley in a tight hug and planted a large kiss on his cheek 
 
 harry knew perfectly well that dudley only put up with aunt hugs because he was well paid for it and sure enough when they broke apart dudley had a crisp note clutched in his fat fist 
 
 petunia shouted aunt marge striding past harry as though he was a aunt marge and aunt petunia kissed or rather aunt marge bumped her large jaw against aunt petunias bony cheekbone 
 
 uncle vernon now came in smiling jovially as he shut the door 
 
 tea marge he said and what will ripper take 
 
 ripper can have some tea out of my saucer said aunt marge as they all proceeded into the kitchen leaving harry alone in the hall with the suitcase but harry complaining any excuse not to be with aunt marge was fine by him so he began to heave the case upstairs into the spare bedroom taking as long as he could 
 
 
 by the time he got back to the kitchen aunt marge had been supplied with tea and fruitcake and ripper was lapping noisily in the corner harry saw aunt petunia wince slightly as specks of tea and drool flecked her clean floor aunt petunia hated animals 
 
 looking after the other dogs marge uncle vernon asked 
 
 oh got colonel fubster managing them boomed aunt marge retired now good for him to have something to do but i leave poor old ripper he pines if away from me 
 
 ripper began to growl again as harry sat down this directed aunt attention to harry for the first time 
 
 so she barked still here are you 
 
 yes said harry 
 
 you say yes in that ungrateful tone aunt marge growled damn good of vernon and petunia to keep you have done it myself have gone straight to an orphanage if been dumped on my doorstep 
 
 harry was bursting to say that rather live in an orphanage than with the dursleys but the thought of the hogsmeade form stopped him he forced his face into a painful smile 
 
 you smirk at me boomed aunt marge i can see you improved since i last saw you i hoped school would knock some manners into you she took a large gulp of tea wiped her mustache and said where is it that you send him again vernon 
 
 st said uncle vernon promptly a institution for hopeless cases 
 
 i see said aunt marge do they use the cane at st boy she barked across the table 
 
 er 
 
 uncle vernon nodded curtly behind aunt back 
 
 yes said harry then feeling he might as well do the thing properly he added all the time 
 
 excellent said aunt marge i have this nonsense about not hitting people who deserve it a good thrashing is needed in cases out of a hundred have you been beaten often 
 
 oh yeah said harry loads of times 
 
 aunt marge narrowed her eyes 
 
 i still like your tone boy she said if you can speak of your beatings in that casual way they clearly hitting you hard enough petunia write if i were you make it clear that you approve the use of extreme force in this case 
 
 perhaps uncle vernon was worried that harry might forget their bargain in any case he changed the subject abruptly 
 
 heard the news this morning marge what about that escaped prisoner eh 
 
 
 
 as aunt marge started to make herself at home harry caught himself thinking almost longingly of life at number four without her uncle vernon and aunt petunia usually encouraged harry to stay out of their way which harry was only too happy to do aunt marge on the other hand wanted harry under her eye at all times so that she could boom out suggestions for his improvement she delighted in comparing harry with dudley and took huge pleasure in buying dudley expensive presents while glaring at harry as though daring him to ask why he got a present too she also kept throwing out dark hints about what made harry such an unsatisfactory person 
 
 you blame yourself for the way the turned out vernon she said over lunch on the third day if something rotten on the inside nothing anyone can do about it 
 
 harry tried to concentrate on his food but his hands shook and his face was starting to burn with anger remember the form he told himself think about hogsmeade say anything rise 
 
 aunt marge reached for her glass of wine 
 
 one of the basic rules of breeding she said you see it all the time with dogs if something wrong with the bitch be something wrong with the pup 
 
 at that moment the wineglass aunt marge was holding exploded in her hand shards of glass flew in every direction and aunt marge sputtered and blinked her great ruddy face dripping 
 
 marge squealed aunt petunia marge are you all right 
 
 not to worry grunted aunt marge mopping her face with her napkin must have squeezed it too hard did the same thing at colonel the other day no need to fuss petunia i have a very firm grip 
 
 but aunt petunia and uncle vernon were both looking at harry suspiciously so he decided better skip dessert and escape from the table as soon as he could 
 
 outside in the hall he leaned against the wall breathing deeply it had been a long time since lost control and made something explode he afford to let it happen again the hogsmeade form the only thing at stake if he carried on like that be in trouble with the ministry of magic 
 
 harry was still an underage wizard and he was forbidden by wizard law to do magic outside school his record exactly clean either only last summer gotten an official warning that had stated quite clearly that if the ministry got wind of any more magic in privet drive harry would face expulsion from hogwarts 
 
 he heard the dursleys leaving the table and hurried upstairs out of the way 
 
 
 
 harry got through the next three days by forcing himself to think about his handbook of broomcare whenever aunt marge started on him this worked quite well though it seemed to give him a glazed look because aunt marge started voicing the opinion that he was mentally subnormal 
 
 at last at long last the final evening of stay arrived aunt petunia cooked a fancy dinner and uncle vernon uncorked several bottles of wine they got all the way through the soup and the salmon without a single mention of faults during the lemon meringue pie uncle vernon bored them a with a long talk about grunnings his company then aunt petunia made coffee and uncle vernon brought out a bottle of brandy 
 
 can i tempt you marge 
 
 aunt marge had already had quite a lot of wine her huge face was very red 
 
 just a small one then she chuckled a bit more than thatand a bit the ticket 
 
 dudley was eating his fourth slice of pie aunt petunia was sipping coffee with her little finger sticking out harry really wanted to disappear into his bedroom but he met uncle angry little eyes and knew he would have to sit it out 
 
 aah said aunt marge smacking her lips and putting the empty brandy glass back down excellent nosh petunia normally just a for me of an evening with twelve dogs to look after she burped richly and patted her great tweed stomach pardon me but i do like to see a boy she went on winking at dudley be a man dudders like your father yes have a spot more brandy vernon 
 
 now this one here 
 
 she jerked her head at harry who felt his stomach clench the handbook he thought quickly 
 
 this got a mean runty look about him you get that with dogs i had colonel fubster drown one last year ratty little thing it was weak underbred 
 
 harry was trying to remember page twelve of his book a charm to cure reluctant reversers 
 
 it all comes down to blood as i was saying the other day bad blood will out now saying nothing against your family petunia she patted aunt bony hand with her one but your sister was a bad egg they turn up in the best families then she ran off with a wastrel and the result right in front of us 
 
 harry was staring at his plate a funny ringing in his ears grasp your broom firmly by the tail he thought but he remember what came next aunt voice seemed to be boring into him like one of uncle drills 
 
 this potter said aunt marge loudly seizing the brandy bottle and splashing more into her glass and over the tablecloth you never told me what he did 
 
 uncle vernon and aunt petunia were looking extremely tense dudley had even looked up from his pie to gape at his parents 
 
 he work said uncle vernon with half a glance at harry unemployed 
 
 as i expected said aunt marge taking a huge swig of brandy and wiping her chin on her sleeve a lazy scrounger who 
 
 he was not said harry suddenly the table went very quiet harry was shaking all over he had never felt so angry in his life 
 
 more brandy yelled uncle vernon who had gone very white he emptied the bottle into aunt glass you boy he snarled at harry go to bed go on 
 
 no vernon hiccuped aunt marge holding up a hand her tiny bloodshot eyes fixed on go on boy go on proud of your parents are you they go and get themselves killed in a car crash drunk i expect 
 
 they die in a car crash said harry who found himself on his feet 
 
 they died in a car crash you nasty little liar and left you to be a burden on their decent hardworking relatives screamed aunt marge swelling with fury you are an insolent ungrateful little 
 
 but aunt marge suddenly stopped speaking for a moment it looked as though words had failed her she seemed to be swelling with inexpressible anger but the swelling stop her great red face started to expand her tiny eyes bulged and her mouth stretched too tightly for speech next second several buttons had just burst from her tweed jacket and pinged off the walls she was inflating like a monstrous balloon her stomach bursting free of her tweed waistband each of her fingers blowing up like a salami 
 
 marge yelled uncle vernon and aunt petunia together as aunt whole body began to rise off her chair toward the ceiling she was entirely round now like a vast life buoy with piggy eyes and her hands and feet stuck out weirdly as she drifted up into the air making apoplectic popping noises ripper came skidding into the room barking madly 
 
 nooooooo 
 
 uncle vernon seized one of feet and tried to pull her down again but was almost lifted from the floor himself a second later ripper leapt forward and sank his teeth into uncle leg 
 
 harry tore from the dining room before anyone could stop him heading for the cupboard under the stairs the cupboard door burst magically open as he reached it in seconds he had heaved his trunk to the front door he sprinted upstairs and threw himself under the bed wrenching up the loose floorboard and grabbed the pillowcase full of his books and birthday presents he wriggled out seized empty cage and dashed back downstairs to his trunk just as uncle vernon burst out of the dining room his trouser leg in bloody tatters 
 
 come back in here he bellowed come back and put her right 
 
 but a reckless rage had come over harry he kicked his trunk open pulled out his wand and pointed it at uncle vernon 
 
 she deserved it harry said breathing very fast she deserved what she got you keep away from me 
 
 he fumbled behind him for the latch on the door 
 
 going harry said had enough 
 
 and in the next moment he was out in the dark quiet street heaving his heavy trunk behind him cage under his arm 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the prisoner of azkaban 
 

lionfish nov chapter two the scarcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry lay flat on his back breathing hard as though he had been running he had awoken from a vivid dream with his hands pressed over his face the old scar on his forehead which was shaped like a bolt of lightning was burning beneath his fingers as though someone had just pressed a wire to his skin 
 
 he sat up one hand still on his scar the other hand reaching out in the darkness for his glasses which were on the bedside table he put them on and his bedroom came into clearer focus lit by a faint misty orange light that was filtering through the curtains from the street lamp outside the window 
 
 harry ran his fingers over the scar again it was still painful he turned on the lamp beside him scrambled out of bed crossed the room opened his wardrobe and peered into the mirror on the inside of the door a skinny boy of fourteen looked back at him his bright green eyes puzzled under his untidy black hair he examined the scar of his reflection more closely it looked normal but it was still stinging 
 
 harry tried to recall what he had been dreaming about before he had awoken it had seemed so realthere had been two people he knew and one he concentrated hard frowning trying to remember 
 
 the dim picture of a darkened room came to himthere had been a snake on a hearth ruga small man called peter nicknamed wormtailand a cold high voicethe voice of lord voldemort harry felt as though an ice cube had slipped down into his stomach at the very thought 
 
 he closed his eyes tightly and tried to remember what voldemort had looked like but it was impossibleall harry knew was that at the moment when chair had swung around and he harry had seen what was sitting in it he had felt a spasm of horror which had awoken himor had that been the pain in his scar 
 
 and who had the old man been for there had definitely been an old man harry had watched him fall to the ground it was all becoming confused harry put his face into his hands blocking out his bedroom trying to hold on to the picture of that dimly lit room but it was like trying to keep water in his cupped hands the details were now trickling away as fast as he tried to hold on to themvoldemort and wormtail had been talking about someone they had killed though harry could not remember the nameand they had been plotting to kill someone elsehim 
 
 harry took his face out of his hands opened his eyes and stared around his bedroom as though expecting to see something unusual there as it happened there was an extraordinary number of unusual things in this room a large wooden trunk stood open at the foot of his bed revealing a cauldron broomstick black robes and assorted spellbooks rolls of parchment littered that part of his desk that was not taken up by the large empty cage in which his snowy owl hedwig usually perched on the floor beside his bed a book lay open harry had been reading it before he fell asleep last night the pictures in this book were all moving men in bright orange robes were zooming in and out of sight on broomsticks throwing a red ball to one another 
 
 harry walked over to the book picked it up and watched one of the wizards score a spectacular goal by putting the ball through a hoop then he snapped the book shut even quidditch in opinion the best sport in the world distract him at the moment he placed flying with the cannons on his bedside table crossed to the window and drew back the curtains to survey the street below 
 
 privet drive looked exactly as a respectable suburban street would be expected to look in the early hours of saturday morning all the curtains were closed as far as harry could see through the darkness there a living creature in sight not even a cat 
 
 and yetand yetharry went restlessly back to the bed and sat down on it running a finger over his scar again it the pain that bothered him harry was no stranger to pain and injury he had lost all the bones from his right arm once and had them painfully regrown in a night the same arm had been pierced by a venomous fang not long afterward only last year harry had fallen fifty feet from an airborne broomstick he was used to bizarre accidents and injuries they were unavoidable if you attended hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry and had a knack for attracting a lot of trouble 
 
 no the thing that was bothering harry was the last time his scar had hurt him it had been because voldemort had been close bybut voldemort be here nowthe idea of voldemort lurking in privet drive was absurd impossible 
 
 harry listened closely to the silence around him was he half expecting to hear the creak of a stair or the swish of a cloak and then he jumped slightly as he heard his cousin dudley give a tremendous grunting snore from the next room 
 
 harry shook himself mentally he was being stupid there was no one in the house with him except uncle vernon aunt petunia and dudley and they were plainly still asleep their dreams untroubled and painless 
 
 asleep was the way harry liked the dursleys best it as though they were ever any help to him awake uncle vernon aunt petunia and dudley were only living relatives they were muggles who hated and despised magic in any form which meant that harry was about as welcome in their house as dry rot they had explained away long absences at hogwarts over the last three years by telling everyone that he went to st secure center for incurably criminal boys they knew perfectly well that as an underage wizard harry allowed to use magic outside hogwarts but they were still apt to blame him for anything that went wrong about the house harry had never been able to confide in them or tell them anything about his life in the wizarding world the very idea of going to them when they awoke and telling them about his scar hurting him and about his worries about voldemort was laughable 
 
 and yet it was because of voldemort that harry had come to live with the dursleys in the first place if it been for voldemort harry would not have had the lightning scar on his forehead if it been for voldemort harry would still have had parents 
 
 harry had been a year old the night that voldemort the most powerful dark wizard for a century a wizard who had been gaining power steadily for eleven years arrived at his house and killed his father and mother voldemort had then turned his wand on harry he had performed the curse that had disposed of many witches and wizards in his steady rise to power and incredibly it had not worked instead of killing the small boy the curse had rebounded upon voldemort harry had survived with nothing but a cut on his forehead and voldemort had been reduced to something barely alive his powers gone his life almost extinguished voldemort had fled the terror in which the secret community of witches and wizards had lived for so long had lifted followers had disbanded and harry potter had become famous 
 
 it had been enough of a shock for harry to discover on his eleventh birthday that he was a wizard it had been even more disconcerting to find out that everyone in the hidden wizarding world knew his name harry had arrived at hogwarts to find that heads turned and whispers followed him wherever he went but he was used to it now at the end of this summer he would be starting his fourth year at hogwarts and harry was already counting the days until he would be back at the castle again 
 
 but there was still a fortnight to go before he went back to school he looked hopelessly around his room again and his eye paused on the birthday cards his two best friends had sent him at the end of july what would they say if harry wrote to them and told them about his scar hurting 
 
 at once hermione voice seemed to fill his head shrill and panicky 
 
 your scar hurt harry really seriouswrite to professor dumbledore nd go and check common magical ailments and afflictionsmaybe something in there about curse scars 
 
 yes that would be advice go straight to the headmaster of hogwarts and in the meantime consult a book harry stared out of the window at the inky sky he doubted very much whether a book could help him now as far as he knew he was the only living person to have survived a curse like it was highly unlikely therefore that he would find his symptoms listed in common magical ailments and afflictions as for informing the headmaster harry had no idea where dumbledore went during the summer holidays he amused himself for a moment picturing dumbledore with his long silver beard full length robes and pointed hat stretched out on a beach somewhere rubbing suntan lotion onto his long crooked nose wherever dumbledore was though harry was sure that hedwig would be able to find him owl had never yet failed to deliver a letter to anyone even without an address but what would he write 
 
 dear professor dumbledore sorry to bother you but my scar hurt this morning yours sincerely harry potter 
 
 even inside his head the words sounded stupid 
 
 and so he tried to imagine his other best friend ron reaction and in a moment red hair and freckled face seemed to swim before harry wearing a bemused expression 
 
 your scar hurt butbut be near you now can he i know you be trying to do you in again be i dunno harry maybe curse scars always twinge a ask dad 
 
 mr weasley was a fully qualified wizard who worked in the misuse of muggle artifacts office at the ministry of magic but he have any particular expertise in the matter of curses as far as harry knew in any case harry like the idea of the whole weasley family knowing that he harry was getting jumpy about a few moments pain mrs weasley would fuss worse than hermione and fred and george sixteen year old twin brothers might think harry was losing his nerve the weasleys were favorite family in the world he was hoping that they might invite him to stay any time now ron had mentioned something about the quidditch world cup and he somehow want his visit punctuated with anxious inquiries about his scar 
 
 harry kneaded his forehead with his knuckles what he really wanted and it felt almost shameful to admit it to himself was someone like someone like a parent an adult wizard whose advice he could ask without feeling stupid someone who cared about him who had had experience with dark magic 
 
 and then the solution came to him it was so simple and so obvious that he believe it had taken so long sirius 
 
 harry leapt up from the bed hurried across the room and sat down at his desk he pulled a piece of parchment toward him loaded his quill with ink wrote dear sirius then paused wondering how best to phrase his problem still marveling at the fact that he thought of sirius straight away but then perhaps it so surprising after all he had only found out that sirius was his godfather two months ago 
 
 there was a simple reason for complete absence from life until then sirius had been in azkaban the terrifying wizard jail guarded by creatures called dementors sightless fiends who had come to search for sirius at hogwarts when he had escaped yet sirius had been innocent the murders for which he had been convicted had been committed by wormtail supporter whom nearly everybody now believed dead harry ron and hermione knew otherwise however they had come with wormtail only the previous year though only professor dumbledore had believed their story 
 
 for one glorious hour harry had believed that he was leaving the dursleys at last because sirius had offered him a home once his name had been cleared but the chance had been snatched away from him wormtail had escaped before they could take him to the ministry of magic and sirius had had to flee for his life harry had helped him escape on the back of a hippogriff called buckbeak and since then sirius had been on the run the home harry might have had if wormtail had not escaped had been haunting him all summer it had been doubly hard to return to the dursleys knowing that he had so nearly escaped them forever 
 
 nevertheless sirius had been of some help to harry even if he be with him it was due to sirius that harry now had all his school things in his bedroom with him the dursleys had never allowed this before their general wish of keeping harry as miserable as possible coupled with their fear of his powers had led them to lock his school trunk in the cupboard under the stairs every summer prior to this but their attitude had changed since they had found out that harry had a dangerous murderer for a godfather for harry had conveniently forgotten to tell them that sirius was innocent 
 
 harry had received two letters from sirius since he had been back at privet drive both had been delivered not by owls as was usual with wizards but by large brightly colored tropical birds hedwig had not approved of these flashy intruders she had been most reluctant to allow them to drink from her water tray before flying off again harry on the other hand had liked them they put him in mind of palm trees and white sand and he hoped that wherever sirius was sirius never said in case the letters were intercepted he was enjoying himself somehow harry found it hard to imaging dementors surviving for long in bright sunlight perhaps that was why sirius had gone south letters which were now hidden beneath the highly useful loose floorboards under bed sounded cheerful and in both of them he had reminded harry to call on him if ever harry needed to well he needed to right now all right 
 
 lamp seemed to grow dimmer as the cold gray light that precedes sunrise slowly crept into the room finally when the sun had risen when his bedroom walls had turned gold and when sounds of movement could be heard from uncle vernon and aunt room harry cleared his desk of crumpled pieces of parchment and reread his finished letter 
 
 dear sirius 
 thanks for your last letter that bird was enormous it could hardly get through my window things are the same as usual here diet going too well my aunt found him smuggling doughnuts into his room yesterday they told him have to cut his pocket money if he keeps doing it so he got really angry and chucked his playstation out of the window a sort of computer thing you can play games on bit stupid really now he even got part three to take his mind off things 
 okay mainly because the dursleys are terrified you might turn up and turn them all into bats if i ask you to 
 a weird thing happened this morning though my scar hurt again last time that happened it was because voldemort was at hogwarts but i reckon he can be anywhere near me now can he do you know if curse scars sometimes hurt years afterward 
 send this with hedwig when she gets back off hunting at the moment say hello to buckbeak for me 
 harry 
 yes thought harry that looked all right there was no point putting in the dream he want it to look as though he was too worried he folded up the parchment and laid it aside on his desk ready for when hedwig returned then he got to his feet stretched and opened his wardrobe once more without glancing at his reflection he started to get dressed before going down to breakfast

lionfish nov chapter two a peck of owlscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 what said harry blankly 
 
 he left said mrs figg wringing her hands left to see someone about a batch of cauldrons that fell off the back of a broom i told him flay him alive if he went and now look dementors just lucky i put mr tibbles on the case but we got time to stand around hurry now got to get you back oh the trouble this is going to cause i will kill him 
 
 but 
 
 the revelation that his batty old neighbour knew what dementors were was almost as big a shock to harry as meeting two of them down the alleyway a witch 
 
 a squib as mundungus knows full well so how on earth was i supposed to help you fight off dementors he left you completely without cover when warned him 
 
 this mundungus has been following me hang onit was him he disapparated from the front of my house 
 
 yes yes yes but luckily stationed mr tibbles under a car just in case and mr tibbles came and warned me but by the time i got to your house gone and nowoh dumbledore going to say you she shrieked at dudley still supine on the alley floor get your fat bottom off the ground quick 
 
 you know dumbledore said harry staring at her 
 
 of course i know dumbledore who know dumbledore but come on be no help if they come back never so much as transfigured a teabag 
 
 she stooped down seized one of massive arms in her wizened hands and tugged 
 
 get up you useless lump get up 
 
 but dudley either could not or would not move he remained on the ground trembling and his mouth shut very tight 
 
 do it harry took hold of arm and heaved with an enormous effort he managed to hoist him to his feet dudley seemed to be on the point of fainting his small eyes were rolling in their sockets and sweat was beading his face the moment harry let go of him he swayed dangerously 
 
 hurry up said mrs figg hysterically 
 
 harry pulled one of massive arms around his own shoulders and dragged him towards the road sagging slightly under the weight mrs figg tottered along in front of them peering anxiously around the corner 
 
 keep your wand out she told harry as they entered wisteria walk never mind the statute of secrecy now going to be hell to pay anyway we might as well be hanged for a dragon as an egg talk about the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery this was exactly what dumbledore was afraid that at the end of the street oh just mr prentice put your wand away boy i keep telling you no use 
 
 it was not easy to hold a wand steady and haul dudley along at the same time harry gave his cousin an impatient dig in the ribs but dudley seemed to have lost all desire for independent movement he was slumped on shoulder his large feet dragging along the ground 
 
 why you tell me a squib mrs figg asked harry panting with the effort to keep walking all those times i came round your housewhy you say anything 
 
 orders i was to keep an eye on you but not say anything you were too young sorry i gave you such a miserable time harry but the dursleys would never have let you come if thought you enjoyed it it easy you know but oh my word she said tragically wringing her hands once more when dumbledore hears about thishow could mundungus have left he was supposed to be on duty until midnightwhere is he how am i going to tell dumbledore happened i apparate 
 
 got an owl you can borrow her harry groaned wondering whether his spine was going to snap under weight 
 
 harry you understand dumbledore will need to act as quickly as possible the ministry have their own ways of detecting underage magic know already you mark my words 
 
 but i was getting rid of dementors i had to use going to be more worried about what dementors were doing floating around wisteria walk surely 
 
 oh my dear i wish it were so but afraid mundungus fletcher i am going to kill you 
 
 there was a loud crack and a strong smell of drink mingled with stale tobacco filled the air as a squat unshaven man in a tattered overcoat materialised right in front of them he had short bandy legs long straggly ginger hair and bloodshot baggy eyes that gave him the doleful look of a basset hound he was also clutching a silvery bundle that harry recognised at once as an invisibility cloak 
 
 s up figgy he said staring from mrs figg to harry and dudley what appened to staying undercover 
 
 give you undercover cried mrs figg dementors you useless skiving sneak thief 
 
 dementors repeated mundungus aghast dementors here 
 
 yes here you worthless pile of bat droppings here shrieked mrs figg dementors attacking the boy on your watch 
 
 blimey said mundungus weakly looking from mrs figg to harry and back again blimey i 
 
 and you off buying stolen cauldrons i tell you not to go i 
 
 iwell i mundungus looked deeply uncomfortable it it was a very good business opportunity see 
 
 mrs figg raised the arm from which her string bag dangled and whacked mundungus around the face and neck with it judging by the clanking noise it made it was full of cat food 
 
 ouchgerroff gerroff you mad old bat gotta tell dumbledore 
 
 yesthey have yelled mrs figg swinging the bag of cat food at every bit of mundungus she could reach andithadbetterbeyouandyoucantell 
 
 keep your airnet on said mundungus his arms over his head cowering going going 
 
 and with another loud crack he vanished 
 
 i hope dumbledore murders him said mrs figg furiously now come on harry what are you waiting for 
 
 harry decided not to waste his remaining breath on pointing out that he could barely walk under bulk he gave the dudley a heave and staggered onwards 
 
 take you to the door said mrs figg as they turned into privet drive just in case there are more of them around oh my word what a catastrophe and you had to fight them off yourself and dumbledore said we were to keep you from doing magic at all costs well no good crying over spilt potion i suppose but the among the pixies now 
 
 so harry panted been having me followed 
 
 of course he has said mrs figg impatiently did you expect him to let you wander around on your own after what happened in june good lord boy they told me you were intelligent right get inside and stay there she said as they reached number four i expect someone will be in touch with you soon enough 
 
 what are you going to do asked harry quickly 
 
 going straight home said mrs figg staring around the dark street and shuddering need to wait for more instructions just stay in the house goodnight 
 
 hang on go yet i want to know 
 
 but mrs figg had already set off at a trot carpet slippers flopping string bag clanking 
 
 wait harry shouted after her he had a million questions to ask anyone who was in contact with dumbledore but within seconds mrs figg was swallowed by the darkness scowling harry readjusted dudley on his shoulder and made his slow painful way up number garden path 
 
 the hall light was on harry stuck his wand back inside the waistband of his jeans rang the bell and watched aunt outline grow larger and larger oddly distorted by the rippling glass in the front door 
 
 diddy about time too i was getting quitequite diddy the matter 
 
 harry looked sideways at dudley and ducked out from under his arm just in time dudley swayed on the spot for a moment his face pale green then he opened his mouth and vomited all over the doormat 
 
 diddy diddy the matter with you vernon vernon 
 
 uncle came galumphing out of the living room walrus moustache blowing hither and thither as it always did when he was agitated he hurried forwards to help aunt petunia negotiate a dudley over the threshold while avoiding stepping in the pool of sick 
 
 ill vernon 
 
 what is it son happened did mrs polkiss give you something foreign for tea 
 
 why are you all covered in dirt darling have you been lying on the ground 
 
 hang onyou been mugged have you son 
 
 aunt petunia screamed 
 
 phone the police vernon phone the police diddy darling speak to mummy what did they do to you 
 
 in all the kerfuffle nobody seemed to have noticed harry which suited him perfectly he managed to slip inside just before uncle vernon slammed the door and while the dursleys made their noisy progress down the hall towards the kitchen harry moved carefully and quietly towards the stairs 
 
 who did it son give us names get them worry 
 
 shh trying to say something vernon what is it diddy tell mummy 
 
 foot was on the stair when dudley found his voice 
 
 him 
 
 harry froze foot on the stair face screwed up braced for the explosion 
 
 boy come here 
 
 with a feeling of mingled dread and anger harry removed his foot slowly from the stair and turned to follow the dursleys 
 
 the scrupulously clean kitchen had an oddly unreal glitter after the darkness outside aunt petunia was ushering dudley into a chair he was still very green and uncle vernon was standing in front of the draining board glaring at harry through tiny narrowed eyes 
 
 what have you done to my son he said in a menacing growl 
 
 nothing said harry knowing perfectly well that uncle vernon believe him 
 
 what did he do to you diddy aunt petunia said in a quavering voice now sponging sick from the front of leather jacket was itwas it darling did he usehis thing 
 
 slowly tremulously dudley nodded 
 
 i harry said sharply as aunt petunia let out a wail and uncle vernon raised his fists i do anything to him it me it was 
 
 but at that precise moment a screech owl swooped in through the kitchen window narrowly missing the top of uncle head it soared across the kitchen dropped the large parchment envelope it was carrying in its beak at feet turned gracefully the tips of its wings just brushing the top of the fridge then zoomed outside again and off across the garden 
 
 owls bellowed uncle vernon the vein in his temple pulsing angrily as he slammed the kitchen window shut owls again i will not have any more owls in my house 
 
 but harry was already ripping open the envelope and pulling out the letter inside his heart pounding somewhere in the region of his apple 
 
 dear mr potter 
 
 we have received intelligence that you performed the patronus charm at minutes past nine this evening in a area and in the presence of a muggle 
 
 the severity of this breach of the decree for the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery has resulted in your expulsion from hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry ministry representatives will be calling at your place of residence shortly to destroy your wand 
 
 as you have already received an official warning for a previous offence under section of the international confederation of warlocks statute of secrecy we regret to inform you that your presence is required at a disciplinary hearing at the ministry of magic at on the twelfth of august 
 
 hoping you are well 
 
 yours sincerely

 ministry of magic 
 
 harry read the letter through twice he was only vaguely aware of uncle vernon and aunt petunia talking inside his head all was icy and numb one fact had penetrated his consciousness like a paralysing dart he was expelled from hogwarts it was all over he was never going back 
 
 he looked up at the dursleys uncle vernon was shouting his fists still raised aunt petunia had her arms around dudley who was retching again 
 
 temporarily stupefied brain seemed to reawaken ministry representatives will be calling at your place of residence shortly to destroy your wand there was only one thing for it he would have to runnow where he was going to go harry know but he was certain of one thing at hogwarts or outside it he needed his wand in an almost dreamlike state he pulled his wand out and turned to leave the kitchen 
 
 where think going yelled uncle venon when harry reply he pounded across the kitchen to block the doorway into the hall i finished with you boy 
 
 get out of the way said harry quietly 
 
 going to stay here and explain how my son 
 
 if you get out of the way going to jinx you said harry raising the wand 
 
 you pull that one on me snarled uncle vernon i know not allowed to use it outside that madhouse you call a school 
 
 the madhouse has chucked me out said harry so i can do whatever i like got three seconds onetwo 
 
 a resounding crack filled the kitchen aunt petunia screamed uncle vernon yelled and ducked but for the third time that night harry was searching for the source of a disturbance he had not made he spotted it at once a dazed and barn owl was sitting outside on the kitchen sill having just collided with the closed window 
 
 ignoring uncle anguished yell of owls harry crossed the room at a run and wrenched the window open the owl stuck out its leg to which a small roll of parchment was tied shook its feathers and took off the moment harry had taken the letter hands shaking harry unfurled the second message which was written very hastily and blotchily in black ink 
 
 harry 
 
 just arrived at the ministry and trying to sort it all out do not leave your aunt and house do not do any more magic do not surrender your wand 
 
 arthur weasley 
 
 dumbledore was trying to sort it all out what did that mean how much power did dumbledore have to override the ministry of magic was there a chance that he might be allowed back to hogwarts then a small shoot of hope burgeoned in chest almost immediately strangled by panichow was he supposed to refuse to surrender his wand without doing magic have to duel with the ministry representatives and if he did that be lucky to escape azkaban let alone expulsion 
 
 his mind was racing he could run for it and risk being captured by the ministry or stay put and wait for them to find him here he was much more tempted by the former course but he knew mr weasley had his best interests at heart and after all dumbledore had sorted out much worse than this before 
 
 right harry said changed my mind staying 
 
 he flung himself down at the kitchen table and faced dudley and aunt petunia the dursleys appeared taken aback at his abrupt change of mind aunt petunia glanced despairingly at uncle vernon the vein in his purple temple was throbbing worse than ever 
 
 who are all these ruddy owls from he growled 
 
 the first one was from the ministry of magic expelling me said harry calmly he was straining his ears to catch any noises outside in case the ministry representatives were approaching and it was easier and quieter to answer uncle questions than to have him start raging and bellowing the second one was from my friend dad who works at the ministry 
 
 ministry of magic bellowed uncle vernon people like you in government oh this explains everything everything no wonder the going to the dogs 
 
 when harry did not respond uncle vernon glared at him then spat out and why have you been expelled 
 
 because i did magic 
 
 aha roared uncle vernon slamming his fist down on top of the fridge which sprang open several of snacks toppled out and burst on the floor so you admit it what did you do to dudley 
 
 nothing said harry slightly less calmly that me 
 
 was muttered dudley unexpectedly and uncle vernon and aunt petunia instantly made flapping gestures at harry to quieten him while they both bent low over dudley 
 
 go on son said uncle vernon what did he do 
 
 tell us darling whispered aunt petunia 
 
 pointed his wand at me dudley mumbled 
 
 yeah i did but i use harry began angrily but 
 
 shut up roared uncle vernon and aunt petunia in unison 
 
 go on son repeated uncle vernon moustache blowing about furiously 
 
 all dark dudley said hoarsely shuddering everything dark and then i things inside head 
 
 uncle vernon and aunt petunia exchanged looks of utter horror if their least favourite thing in the world was magic closely followed by neighbours who cheated more than they did on the hosepipe ban people who heard voices were definitely in the bottom ten they obviously thought dudley was losing his mind 
 
 what sort of things did you hear popkin breathed aunt petunia very and with tears in her eyes 
 
 but dudley seemed incapable of saying he shuddered again and shook his large blond head and despite the sense of numb dread that had settled on harry since the arrival of the first owl he felt a certain curiosity dementors caused a person to relive the worst moments of their life what would spoiled pampered bullying dudley have been forced to hear 
 
 how come you fell over son said uncle vernon in an unnaturally quiet voice the kind of voice he might adopt at the bedside of a very ill person 
 
 said dudley shakily and then 
 
 he gestured at his massive chest harry understood dudley was remembering the clammy cold that filled the lungs as hope and happiness were sucked out of you 
 
 horrible croaked dudley cold really cold 
 
 ok said uncle vernon in a voice of forced calm while aunt petunia laid an anxious hand on forehead to feel his temperature what happened then dudders 
 
 felt felt felt as if as if 
 
 as if never be happy again harry supplied dully 
 
 yes dudley whispered still trembling 
 
 so said uncle vernon voice restored to full and considerable volume as he straightened up you put some crackpot spell on my on so hear voices and believe he waswas doomed to misery or something did you 
 
 how many times do i have to tell you said harry temper and voice both rising it me it was a couple of dementors 
 
 a couple this codswallop 
 
 dementors said harry slowly and clearly two of them 
 
 and what the ruddy hell are dementors 
 
 they guard the wizard prison azkaban said aunt petunia 
 
 two seconds of ringing silence followed these words before aunt petunia clapped her hand over her mouth as though she had let slip a disgusting swear word uncle vernon was goggling at her brain reeled mrs figg was one thingbutaunt petunia 
 
 how know that he asked her astonished 
 
 aunt petunia looked quite appalled with herself she glanced at uncle vernon in fearful apology then lowered her hand slightly to reveal her horsy teeth 
 
 i heardthat awful boytelling her about themyears ago she said jerkily 
 
 if you mean my mum and dad why you use their names said harry loudly but aunt petunia ignored him she seemed horribly flustered 
 
 harry was stunned except for one outburst years ago in the course of which aunt petunia had screamed that mother had been a freak he had never heard her mention her sister he was astounded that she had remembered this scrap of information about the magical world for so long when she usually put all her energies into pretending it exist 
 
 uncle vernon opened his mouth closed it again opened it once more shut it then apparently struggling to remember how to talk opened it for a third time and croaked sosotheyertheyerthey actually exist do theyer 
 
 aunt petunia nodded 
 
 uncle vernon looked from aunt petunia to dudley to harry as if hoping somebody was going to shout april fool when nobody did he opened his mouth yet again but was spared the struggle to find more words by the arrival of the third owl of the evening it zoomed through the window like a feathery and landed with a clatter on the kitchen table causing all three of the dursleys to jump with fright harry tore a second envelope from the beak and ripped it open as the owl swooped back out into the night 
 
 enougheffingowls muttered uncle vernon distractedly stomping over to the window and slamming it shut again 
 
 dear mr potter 
 
 further to our letter of approximately minutes ago the ministry of magic has revised its decision to destroy your wand forthwith you may retain your wand until your disciplinary hearing on the twelfth of august at which time an official decision will be taken 
 
 following discussions with the headmaster of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry the ministry has agreed that the question of your expulsion will also be decided at that time you should therefore consider yourself suspended from school pending further enquiries 
 
 with best wishes 
 
 yours sincerely

 ministry of magic 
 
 harry read this letter through three times in quick succession the miserable knot in his chest loosened slightly with the relief of knowing he was not yet definitely expelled though his fears were by no means banished everything seemed to hang on this hearing on the twelfth of august 
 
 well said uncle vernon recalling harry to his surroundings what now have they sentenced you to anything do your lot have the death penalty he added as a hopeful afterthought 
 
 got to go to a hearing said harry 
 
 and sentence you there 
 
 i suppose so 
 
 i give up hope then said uncle vernon nastily 
 
 well if all said harry getting to his feet he was desperate to be alone to think perhaps to send a letter to ron hermione or sirius 
 
 no it ruddy well is not all bellowed uncle vernon sit back down 
 
 what now said harry impatiently 
 
 dudley roared uncle vernon i want to know exactly what happened to my son 
 
 fine yelled harry and in his temper red and gold sparks shot out of the end of his wand still clutched in his hand all three dursleys flinched looking terrified 
 
 dudley and i were in the alleyway between magnolia crescent and wisteria walk said harry speaking fast fighting to control his temper dudley thought be smart with me i pulled out my wand but use it then two dementors turned up 
 
 but what are dementoids asked uncle vernon furiously what do they do 
 
 i told youthey suck all the happiness out of you said harry and if they get the chance they kiss you 
 
 kiss you said uncle vernon his eyes popping slightly kiss you 
 
 what they call it when they suck the soul out of your mouth 
 
 aunt petunia uttered a soft scream 
 
 his soul they still got his 
 
 she seized dudley by the shoulders and shook him as though testing to see whether she could hear his soul rattling around inside him 
 
 of course they get his soul know if they had said harry exasperated 
 
 fought em off did you son said uncle vernon loudly with the appearance of a man struggling to bring the conversation back on to a plane he understood gave em the old did you 
 
 you give a dementor the old said harry through clenched teeth 
 
 he all right then blustered uncle vernon why he all empty then 
 
 because i used the patronus 
 
 whoosh with a clattering a whirring of wings and a soft fall of dust a fourth owl came shooting out of the kitchen fireplace 
 
 for sake roared uncle vernon pulling great clumps of hair out of his moustache something he been driven to do in a long time i will not have owls here i will not tolerate this i tell you 
 
 but harry was already pulling a roll of parchment from the leg he was so convinced that this letter had to be from dumbledore explaining everythingthe dementors mrs figg what the ministry was up to how he dumbledore intended to sort everything outthat for the first time in his life he was disappointed to see handwriting ignoring uncle vernons ongoing rant about owls and narrowing his eyes against a second cloud of dust as the most recent owl took off back up the chimney harry read message 
 
 arthur has just told us happened leave the house again whatever you do 
 
 harry found this such an inadequate response to everything that had happened tonight that he turned the piece of parchment over looking for the rest of the letter but there was nothing else 
 
 and now his temper was rising again anybody going to say well done for fighting off two dementors both mr weasley and sirius were acting as though misbehaved and were saving their until they could ascertain how much damage had been done 
 
 a peck i mean pack of owls shooting in and out of my house i have it boy i 
 
 i stop the owls coming harry snapped crushing letter in his fist 
 
 i want the truth about what happened tonight barked uncle vernon if it was demenders who hurt dudley how come been expelled you did admitted it 
 
 harry took a deep steadying breath his head was beginning to ache again he wanted more than anything to get out of the kitchen and away from the dursleys 
 
 i did the patronus charm to get rid of the dementors he said forcing himself to remain calm the only thing that works against them 
 
 but what were dementoids doing in little whinging said uncle vernon in an outraged tone 
 
 tell you said harry wearily no idea 
 
 his head was pounding in the glare of the now his anger was ebbing away he felt drained exhausted the dursleys were all staring at him 
 
 you said uncle vernon forcefully got something to do with you boy i know it why else would they turn up here why else would they be down that alleyway got to be the onlythe only evidently he bring himself to say the word wizard the only for miles 
 
 i know why they were here 
 
 but at uncle words exhausted brain had ground back into action why had the dementors come to little whinging how could it be coincidence that they had arrived in the alleyway where harry was had they been sent had the ministry of magic lost control of the dementors had they deserted azkaban and joined voldemort as dumbledore had predicted they would 
 
 these demembers guard some weirdo prison asked uncle vernon lumbering along in the wake of train of thought 
 
 yes said harry 
 
 if only his head would stop hurting if only he could just leave the kitchen and get to his dark bedroom and think 
 
 oho they were coming to arrest you said uncle vernon with the triumphant air of a man reaching an unassailable conclusion it it boy on the run from the law 
 
 of course not said harry shaking his head as though to scare off a fly his mind racing now 
 
 then why 
 
 he must have sent them said harry quietly more to himself than to uncle vernon 
 
 that who must have sent them 
 
 lord voldemort said harry 
 
 he registered dimly how strange it was that the dursleys who flinched winced and squawked if they heard words like wizard magic or wand could hear the name of the most evil wizard of all time without the slightest tremor 
 
 lordhang on said uncle vernon his face screwed up a look of dawning comprehension coming into his piggy eyes heard that name that was the one who 
 
 murdered my parents yes harry said dully 
 
 but gone said uncle vernon impatiently without the slightest sign that the murder of parents might be a painful topic that giant bloke said so gone 
 
 back said harry heavily 
 
 it felt very strange to be standing here in aunt surgically clean kitchen beside the fridge and the television talking calmly of lord voldemort to uncle vernon the arrival of the dementors in little whinging seemed to have breached the great invisible wall that divided the relentlessly world of privet drive and the world beyond two lives had somehow become fused and everything had been turned the dursleys were asking for details about the magical world and mrs figg knew albus dumbledore dementors were soaring around little whinging and he might never return to hogwarts head throbbed more painfully 
 
 back whispered aunt petunia 
 
 she was looking at harry as she had never looked at him before and all of a sudden for the very first time in his life harry fully appreciated that aunt petunia was his sister he could not have said why this hit him so very powerfully at this moment all he knew was that he was not the only person in the room who had an inkling of what lord voldemort being back might mean aunt petunia had never in her life looked at him like that before her large pale eyes so unlike her sisters were not narrowed in dislike or anger they were wide and fearful the furious pretence that aunt petunia had maintained all lifethat there was no magic and no world other than the world she inhabited with uncle vernonseemed to have fallen away 
 
 yes harry said talking directly to aunt petunia now he came back a month ago i saw him 
 
 her hands found massive shoulders and clutched them 
 
 hang on said uncle vernon looking from his wife to harry and back again apparently dazed and confused by the unprecedented understanding that seemed to have sprung up between them hang on this lord back you say 
 
 yes 
 
 the one who murdered your parents 
 
 yes 
 
 and now sending dismembers after you 
 
 looks like it said harry 
 
 i see said uncle vernon looking from his wife to harry and hitching up his trousers he seemed to be swelling his great purple face stretching before eyes well that settles it he said his shirt front straining as he inflated himself you can get out of this house boy 
 
 what said harry 
 
 you heard meout uncle vernon bellowed and even aunt petunia and dudley jumped out out i done this years ago owls treating the place like a rest home puddings exploding half the lounge destroyed tail marge bobbing around on the ceiling and that flying ford angliaout out had it history not staying here if some after you not endangering my wife and son not bringing trouble down on us if going the same way as your useless parents had it out 
 
 harry stood rooted to the spot the letters from the ministry mr weasley and sirius were all crushed in his left hand leave the house again whatever you do do not leave your aunt and house 
 
 you heard me said uncle vernon bending forwards now his massive purple face coming so close to he actually felt flecks of spit hit his face get going you were all keen to leave half an hour ago right behind you get out and never darken our doorstep again why we ever kept you in the first place i know marge was right it should have been the orphanage we were too damn soft for our own good thought we could squash it out of you thought we could turn you normal but been rotten from the beginning and had enoughowls 
 
 the fifth owl zoomed down the chimney so fast it actually hit the floor before zooming into the air again with a loud screech harry raised his hand to seize the letter which was in a scarlet envelope but it soared straight over his head flying directly at aunt petunia who let out a scream and ducked her arms over her face the owl dropped the red envelope on her head turned and flew straight back up the chimney 
 
 harry darted forwards to pick up the letter but aunt petunia beat him to it 
 
 you can open it if you like said harry but hear what it says anyway a howler 
 
 let go of it petunia roared uncle vernon touch it it could be dangerous 
 
 addressed to me said aunt petunia in a shaking voice addressed to me vernon look mrs petunia dursley the kitchen number four privet drive 
 
 she caught her breath horrified the red envelope had begun to smoke 
 
 open it harry urged her get it over with happen anyway 
 
 no 
 
 aunt hand was trembling she looked wildly around the kitchen as though looking for an escape route but too latethe envelope burst into flames aunt petunia screamed and dropped it 
 
 an awful voice filled the kitchen echoing in the confined space issuing from the burning letter on the table 
 
 remember my last petunia 
 
 aunt petunia looked as though she might faint she sank into the chair beside dudley her face in her hands the remains of the envelope smouldered into ash in the silence 
 
 what is this uncle vernon said hoarsely whati 
 
 aunt petunia said nothing dudley was staring stupidly at his mother his mouth hanging open the silence spiralled horribly harry was watching his aunt utterly bewildered his head throbbing fit to burst 
 
 petunia dear said uncle vernon timidly 
 
 she raised her head she was still trembling she swallowed 
 
 the boythe boy will have to stay vernon she said weakly 
 
 
 
 he stays she said she was not looking at harry she got to her feet again 
 
 he but petunia 
 
 if we throw him out the neighbours will talk she said she was rapidly regaining her usual brisk snappish manner though she was still very pale ask awkward questions want to know where gone have to keep him 
 
 uncle vernon was deflating like an old tyre 
 
 but petunia dear 
 
 aunt petunia ignored him she turned to harry 
 
 to stay in your room she said not to leave the house now get to bed 
 
 harry move 
 
 who was that howler from

lionfish nov chapter two endcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 many miles away the chilly mist that had pressed against the prime windows drifted over a dirty river that wound between overgrown banks an immense chimney relic of a disused mill reared up shadowy and ominous there was no sound apart from the whisper of the black water and no sign of life apart from a scrawny fox that had slunk down the bank to nose hopefully at some old wrappings in the tall grass 
 
 but then with a very faint pop a slim hooded figure appeared out of thin air on the edge of the river the fox froze wary eyes fixed upon this strange new phenomenon the figure seemed to take its bearings for a few moments then set off with light quick strides its long cloak rustling over the grass 
 
 with a second and louder pop another hooded figure materialized 
 
 wait 
 
 the harsh cry startled the fox now crouching almost flat in the undergrowth it leapt from its hiding place and up the bank there was a flash of green light a yelp and the fox fell back to the ground dead 
 
 the second figure turned over the animal with its toe 
 
 just a fox said a voice dismissively from under the hood i thought perhaps an aurorcissy wait 
 
 but her quarry who had paused and looked back at the flash of light was already scrambling up the bank the fox had just fallen down 
 
 cissynarcissalisten to me 
 
 the second woman caught the first and seized her arm but the other wrenched it away 
 
 go back bella 
 
 you must listen to me 
 
 listened already made my decision leave me alone 
 
 the woman named narcissa gained the top of the bank where a line of old railings separated the river from a narrow cobbled street the other woman bella followed at once side by side they stood looking across the road at the rows and rows of dilapidated brick houses their windows dull and blind in the darkness 
 
 he lives here asked bella in a voice of contempt here in this muggle dunghill we must be the first of our kind ever to set foot 
 
 but narcissa was not listening she had slipped through a gap in the rusty railings and was already hurrying across the road 
 
 cissy wait 
 
 bella followed her cloak streaming behind and saw narcissa darting through an alley between the houses into a second almost identical street some of the streetlamps were broken the two women were running between patches of light and deep darkness the pursuer caught up with her prey just as she turned another corner this time succeeding in catching hold of her arm and swinging her around so that they faced each other 
 
 cissy you must not do this you trust him 
 
 the dark lord trusts him he 
 
 the dark lord is i believe mistaken bella panted and her eyes gleamed momentarily under her hood as she looked around to check that they were indeed alone in any case we were told not to speak of the plan to anyone this is a betrayal of the dark 
 
 let go bella snarled narcissa and she drew a wand from beneath her cloak holding it threateningly in the face bella merely laughed 
 
 cissy your own sister you 
 
 there is nothing i do anymore narcissa breathed a note of hysteria in her voice and as she brought down the wand like a knife there was another flash of light bella let go of her arm as though burned 
 
 narcissa 
 
 but narcissa had rushed ahead rubbing her hand her pursuer followed again keeping her distance now as they moved deeper into the deserted labyrinth of brick houses at last narcissa hurried up a street named end over which the towering mill chimney seemed to hover like a giant admonitory finger her footsteps echoed on the cobbles as she passed boarded and broken windows until she reached the very last house where a dim light glimmered through the curtains in a downstairs room 
 
 she had knocked on the door before bella cursing under her breath had caught up together they stood waiting panting slightly breathing in the smell of the dirty river that was carried to them on the night breeze after a few seconds they heard movement behind the door and it opened a crack a sliver of a man could be seen looking out at them a man with long black hair parted in curtains around a sallow face and black eyes 
 
 narcissa threw back her hood she was so pale that she seemed to shine in the darkness the long blonde hair streaming down her back gave her the look of a drowned person 
 
 narcissa said the man opening the door a little wider so that the light fell upon her and her sister too what a pleasant surprise 
 
 severus she said in a strained whisper may i speak to you urgent 
 
 but of course 
 
 he stood back to allow her to pass him into the house her sister followed without invitation 
 
 snape she said curtly as she passed him 
 
 bellatrix he replied his thin mouth curling into a slightly mocking smile as he closed the door with a snap behind them 
 
 they had stepped directly into a tiny sitting room which had the feeling of a dark padded cell the walls were completely covered in books most of them bound in old black or brown leather a threadbare sofa an old armchair and a rickety table stood grouped together in a pool of dim light cast by a lamp hung from the ceiling the place had an air of neglect as though it was not usually inhabited 
 
 snape gestured narcissa to the sofa she threw off her cloak cast it aside and sat down staring at her white and trembling hands clasped in her lap bellatrix lowered her hood more slowly dark as her sister was fair with heavily lidded eyes and a strong jaw she did not take her gaze from snape as she moved to stand behind narcissa 
 
 so what can i do for you snape asked settling himself in the armchair opposite the two sisters 
 
 we we are alone we narcissa asked quietly 
 
 yes of course well here but not counting vermin are we 
 
 he pointed his wand at the wall of books behind him and with a bang a hidden door flew open revealing a narrow staircase upon which a small man stood frozen 
 
 as you have clearly realized wormtail we have guests said snape lazily 
 
 the man crept hunchbacked down the last few steps and moved into the room he had small watery eyes a pointed nose and wore an unpleasant simper his left hand was caressing his right which looked as though it was encased in a bright silver glove 
 
 narcissa he said in a squeaky voice and bellatrix how charming 
 
 wormtail will get us drinks if like them said snape and then he will return to his bedroom 
 
 wormtail winced as though snape had thrown something at him 
 
 i am not your servant he squeaked avoiding eye 
 
 really i was under the impression that the dark lord placed you here to assist me 
 
 to assist yesbut not to make you drinks andand clean your house 
 
 i had no idea wormtail that you were craving more dangerous assignments said snape silkily this can be easily arranged i shall speak to the dark lord 
 
 i can speak to him myself if i want to 
 
 of course you can said snape sneering but in the meantime bring us drinks some of the wine will do 
 
 wormtail hesitated for a moment looking as though he might argue but then turned and headed through a second hidden door they heard banging and a clinking of glasses within seconds he was back bearing a dusty bottle and three glasses upon a tray he dropped these on the rickety table and scurried from their presence slamming the door behind him 
 
 snape poured out three glasses of wine and handed two of them to the sisters narcissa murmured a word of thanks whilst bellatrix said nothing but continued to glower at snape this did not seem to discompose him on the contrary he looked rather amused 
 
 the dark lord he said raising his glass and draining it 
 
 the sisters copied him snape refilled their glasses 
 
 as narcissa took her second drink she said in a rush severus sorry to come here like this but i had to see you i think you are the only one who can help me 
 
 snape held up a hand to stop her then pointed his wand again at the concealed staircase door there was a loud bang and a squeal followed by the sound of wormtail scurrying back up the stairs 
 
 my apologies said snape he has lately taken to listening at doors i know what he means by it you were saying narcissa 
 
 she took a great shuddering breath and started again 
 
 severus i know i ought not to be here i have been told to say nothing to anyone but 
 
 then you ought to hold your tongue snarled bellatrix particularly in present company 
 
 present company repeated snape sardonically and what am i to understand by that bellatrix 
 
 that i trust you snape as you very well know 
 
 narcissa let out a noise that might have been a dry sob and covered her face with her hands snape set his glass down upon the table and sat back again his hands upon the arms of his chair smiling into glowering face 
 
 narcissa i think we ought to hear what bellatrix is bursting to say it will save tedious interruptions well continue bellatrix said snape why is it that you do not trust me 
 
 a hundred reasons she said loudly striding out from behind the sofa to slam her glass upon the table where to start where were you when the dark lord fell why did you never make any attempt to find him when he vanished what have you been doing all these years that lived in pocket why did you stop the dark lord procuring the stone why did you not return at once when the dark lord was reborn where were you a few weeks ago when we battled to retrieve the prophecy for the dark lord and why snape is harry potter still alive when you have had him at your mercy for five years 
 
 she paused her chest rising and falling rapidly the color high in her cheeks behind her narcissa sat motionless her face still hidden in her hands 
 
 snape smiled 
 
 before i answer youoh yes bellatrix i am going to answer you can carry my words back to the others who whisper behind my back and carry false tales of my treachery to the dark lord before i answer you i say let me ask a question in turn do you really think that the dark lord has not asked me each and every one of those questions and do you really think that had i not been able to give satisfactory answers i would be sitting here talking to you 
 
 she hesitated 
 
 i know he believes you but 
 
 you think he is mistaken or that i have somehow hoodwinked him fooled the dark lord the greatest wizard the most accomplished legilimens the world has ever seen 
 
 bellatrix said nothing but looked for the first time a little discomfited snape did not press the point he picked up his drink again sipped it and continued you ask where i was when the dark lord fell i was where he had ordered me to be at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry because he wished me to spy upon albus dumbledore you know i presume that it was on the dark orders that i took up the post 
 
 she nodded almost imperceptibly and then opened her mouth but snape forestalled her 
 
 you ask why i did not attempt to find him when he vanished for the same reason that avery yaxley the carrows greyback lucius he inclined his head slightly to narcissa and many others did not attempt to find him i believed him finished i am not proud of it i was wrong but there it is if he had not forgiven we who lost faith at that time he would have very few followers left 
 
 have me said bellatrix passionately i who spent many years in azkaban for him 
 
 yes indeed most admirable said snape in a bored voice of course you a lot of use to him in prison but the gesture was undoubtedly fine 
 
 gesture she shrieked in her fury she looked slightly mad while i endured the dementors you remained at hogwarts comfortably playing pet 
 
 not quite said snape calmly he give me the defense against the dark arts job you know seemed to think it might ah bring about a relapse tempt me into my old ways 
 
 this was your sacrifice for the dark lord not to teach your favorite subject she jeered why did you stay there all that time snape still spying on dumbledore for a master you believed dead 
 
 hardly said snape although the dark lord is pleased that i never deserted my post i had sixteen years of information on dumbledore to give him when he returned a rather more useful present than endless reminiscences of how unpleasant azkaban is 
 
 but you stayed 
 
 yes bellatrix i stayed said snape betraying a hint of impatience for the first time i had a comfortable job that i preferred to a stint in azkaban they were rounding up the death eaters you know protection kept me out of jail it was most convenient and i used it i repeat the dark lord does not complain that i stayed so i do not see why you do 
 
 i think you next wanted to know he pressed on a little more loudly for bellatrix showed every sign of interrupting why i stood between the dark lord and the stone that is easily answered he did not know whether he could trust me he thought like you that i had turned from faithful death eater to stooge he was in a pitiable condition very weak sharing the body of a mediocre wizard he did not dare reveal himself to a former ally if that ally might turn him over to dumbledore or the ministry i deeply regret that he did not trust me he would have returned to power three years sooner as it was i saw only greedy and unworthy quirrell attempting to steal the stone and i admit i did all i could to thwart him 
 
 mouth twisted as though she had taken an unpleasant dose of medicine 
 
 but you return when he came back you fly back to him at once when you felt the dark mark burn 
 
 correct i returned two hours later i returned on orders 
 
 on she began in tones of outrage 
 
 think said snape impatient again think by waiting two hours just two hours i ensured that i could remain at hogwarts as a spy by allowing dumbledore to think that i was only returning to the dark side because i was ordered to i have been able to pass information on dumbledore and the order of the phoenix ever since consider bellatrix the dark mark had been growing stronger for months i knew he must be about to return all the death eaters knew i had plenty of time to think about what i wanted to do to plan my next move to escape like karkaroff i 
 
 the dark initial displeasure at my lateness vanished entirely i assure you when i explained that i remained faithful although dumbledore thought i was his man yes the dark lord thought that i had left him forever but he was wrong 
 
 but what use have you been sneered bellatrix what useful information have we had from you 
 
 my information has been conveyed directly to the dark lord said snape if he chooses not to share it with you 
 
 he shares everything with me said bellatrix firing up at once he calls me his most loyal his most faithful 
 
 does he said snape his voice delicately inflected to suggest his disbelief does he still after the fiasco at the ministry 
 
 that was not my fault said bellatrix flushing the dark lord has in the past entrusted me with his most preciousif lucius 
 
 you you dare blame my husband said narcissa in a low and deadly voice looking up at her sister 
 
 there is no point apportioning blame said snape smoothly what is done is done 
 
 but not by you said bellatrix furiously no you were once again absent while the rest of us ran dangers were you not snape 
 
 my orders were to remain behind said snape perhaps you disagree with the dark lord perhaps you think that dumbledore would not have noticed if i had joined forces with the death eaters to fight the order of the phoenix andforgive meyou speak of dangers you were facing six teenagers were you not 
 
 they were joined as you very well know by half of the order before long snarled bellatrix and while we are on the subject of the order you still claim you cannot reveal the whereabouts of their headquarters you 
 
 i am not the i cannot speak the name of the place you understand how the enchantment works i think the dark lord is satisfied with the information i have passed him on the order it led as perhaps you have guessed to the recent capture and murder of emmeline vance and it certainly helped dispose of sirius black though i give you full credit for finishing him off 
 
 he inclined his head and toasted her her expression did nor soften 
 
 you are avoiding my last question snape harry potter you could have killed him at any point in the past five years you have not done it why 
 
 have you discussed this matter with the dark lord asked snape 
 
 he lately we i am asking you snape 
 
 if i had murdered harry potter the dark lord could not have used his blood to regenerate making him invincible 
 
 you claim you foresaw his use of the boy she jeered 
 
 i do not claim it i had no idea of his plans i have already confessed that i thought the dark lord dead i am merely trying to explain why the dark lord is not sorry that potter survived at least until a year ago 
 
 but why did you keep him alive 
 
 have you not understood me it was only protection that was keeping me out of azkaban do you disagree that murdering his favorite student might have turned him against me but there was more to it than that i should remind you that when potter first arrived at hogwarts there were still many stories circulating about him rumors that he himself was a great dark wizard which was how he had survived the dark attack indeed many of the dark old followers thought potter might be a standard around which we could all rally once more i was curious i admit it and not at all inclined to murder him the moment he set foot in the castle 
 
 of course it became apparent to me very quickly that he had no extraordinary talent at all he has fought his way out of a number of tight corners by a simple combination of sheer luck and more talented friends he is mediocre to the last degree though as obnoxious and as was his father before him i have done my utmost to have him thrown out of hogwarts where i believe he scarcely belongs but kill him or allow him to be killed in front of me i would have been a fool to risk it with dumbledore close at hand 
 
 and through all this we are supposed to believe dumbledore has never suspected you asked bellatrix he has no idea of your true allegiance he trusts you implicitly still 
 
 i have played my part well said snape and you overlook greatest weakness he has to believe the best of people i spun him a tale of deepest remorse when i joined his staff fresh from my death eater days and he embraced me with open armsthough as i say never allowing me nearer the dark arts than he could help dumbledore has been a great wizardoh yes he has for bellatrix had made a scathing noise the dark lord acknowledges it i am pleased to say however that dumbledore is growing old the duel with the dark lord last month shook him he has since sustained a serious injury because his reactions are slower than they once were but through all these years he has never stopped trusting severus snape and therein lies my great value to the dark lord 
 
 bellatrix still looked unhappy though she appeared unsure how best to attack snape next taking advantage of her silence snape turned to her sister 
 
 now you came to ask me for help narcissa 
 
 narcissa looked up at him her face eloquent with despair 
 
 yes severus think you are the only one who can help me i have nowhere else to turn lucius is in jail and 
 
 she closed her eyes and two large tears seeped from beneath her eyelids 
 
 the dark lord has forbidden me to speak of it narcissa continued her eyes still closed he wishes none to know of the plan it is very secret but 
 
 if he has forbidden it you ought not to speak said snape at once the dark word is law 
 
 narcissa gasped as though he had doused her with cold water bellatrix looked satisfied for the first time since she had entered the house 
 
 there she said triumphantly to her sister even snape says so you were told not to talk so hold your silence 
 
 but snape had gotten to his feet and strode to the small window peered through the curtains at the deserted street then closed them again with a jerk he turned around to face narcissa frowning 
 
 it so happens that i know of the plan he said in a low voice i am one of the few the dark lord has told nevertheless had i not been in on the secret narcissa you would have been guilty of great treachery to the dark lord 
 
 i thought you must know about it said narcissa breathing more freely he trusts you so severus 
 
 you know about the plan said bellatrix her fleeting expression of satisfaction replaced by a look of outrage you know 
 
 certainly said snape but what help do you require narcissa if you are imagining i can persuade the dark lord to change his mind i am afraid there is no hope none at all 
 
 severus she whispered tears sliding down her pale cheeks my son my only son 
 
 draco should be proud said bellatrix indifferently the dark lord is granting him a great honor and i will say this for draco he shrinking away from his duty he seems glad of a chance to prove himself excited at the prospect 
 
 narcissa began to cry in earnest gazing beseechingly all the while at snape 
 
 because he is sixteen and has no idea what lies in store why severus why my son it is too dangerous this is vengeance lor mistake i know it 
 
 snape said nothing he looked away from the sight of her tears as though they were indecent but he could not pretend not to hear her 
 
 why chosen draco it she persisted to punish lucius 
 
 if draco succeeds said snape still looking away from her he will be honored above all others 
 
 but he succeed sobbed narcissa how can he when the dark lord himself 
 
 bellatrix gasped narcissa seemed to lose her nerve 
 
 i only meant that nobody has yet succeeded severus please you are you have always been favorite teacher you are old friend i beg you you are the dark favorite his most trusted advisor will you speak to him persuade him 
 
 the dark lord will not be persuaded and i am not stupid enough to attempt it said snape flatly i cannot pretend that the dark lord is not angry with lucius lucius was supposed to be in charge he got himself captured along with how many others and failed to retrieve the prophecy into the bargain yes the dark lord is angry narcissa very angry indeed 
 
 then i am right he has chosen draco in revenge choked narcissa he does not mean him to succeed he wants him to be killed trying 
 
 when snape said nothing narcissa seemed to lose what little she still possessed standing up she staggered to snape and seized the front of his robes her face close to his her tears falling onto his chest she gasped you could do it you could do it instead of draco severus you would succeed of course you would and he would reward you beyond all of us 
 
 snape caught hold of her wrists and removed her clutching hands looking down into her tearstained face he said slowly he intends me to do it in the end i think but he is determined that draco should try first you see in the unlikely event that draco succeeds i shall be able to remain at hogwarts a little longer fulfilling my useful role as spy 
 
 in other words it matter to him if draco is killed 
 
 the dark lord is very angry repeated snape quietly he failed to hear the prophecy you know as well as i do narcissa that he does not forgive easily 
 
 she crumpled falling at his feet sobbing and moaning on the floor 
 
 my only son my only son 
 
 you should be proud said bellatrix ruthlessly if i had sons i would be glad to give them up to the service of the dark lord 
 
 narcissa gave a little scream of despair and clutched at her long blonde hair snape stooped seized her by the arms lifted her up and steered her back onto the sofa he then poured her more wine iind forced the glass into her hand 
 
 narcissa enough drink this listen to me 
 
 she quieted a little slopping wine down herself she took a shaky sip 
 
 it might be possible for me to help draco 
 
 she sat up her face her eyes huge 
 
 severusoh severusyou would help him would you look after him see he comes to no harm 
 
 i can try 
 
 she flung away her glass it skidded across the table as she slid off the sofa into a kneeling position at feet seized his hand in both of hers and pressed her lips to it 
 
 if you are there to protect him severus will you swear it will you make the unbreakable vow 
 
 the unbreakable vow 
 
 expression was blank unreadable bellatrix however let out a cackle of triumphant laughter 
 
 you listening narcissa oh try sure the usual empty words the usual slithering out of action oh on the dark orders of course 
 
 snape did not look at bellatrix his black eyes were fixed upon blue ones as she continued to clutch his hand 
 
 certainly narcissa i shall make the unbreakable vow he said quietly perhaps your sister will consent to be our bonder 
 
 mouth fell open snape lowered himself so that he was kneeling opposite narcissa beneath astonished gaze they grasped right hands 
 
 you will need your wand bellatrix said snape coldly 
 
 she drew it still looking astonished 
 
 and you will need to move a little closer he said 
 
 she stepped forward so that she stood over them and placed the tip of her wand on their linked hands 
 
 narcissa spoke 
 
 will you severus watch over my son draco as he attempts ta fulfill the dark wishes 
 
 i will said snape 
 
 a thin tongue of brilliant flame issued from the wand and wound its way around their hands like a wire 
 
 and will you to the best of your ability protect him from harm 
 
 i will said snape 
 
 a second tongue of flame shot from the wand and interlinked with the first making a fine glowing chain 
 
 and should it prove necessary if it seems draco will fail whispered narcissa hand twitched within hers but he did not draw away will you carry out the deed that the dark lord has ordered draco to perform 
 
 there was a silence bellatrix watched her wand upon their clasped hands her eyes wide 
 
 i will said snape 
 
 astounded face glowed red in the blaze of a third unique flame which shot from the wand twisted with the others and bound itself thickly around their clasped hands like a fiery snake

 harry was bleeding clutching his right hand in his left and swearing under his breath he shouldered open his bedroom door there was a crunch of breaking china he had trodden on a cup of cold tea that had been sitting on the floor outside his bedroom door 
 
 what the c 
 
 he looked around the landing of number four privet drive was deserted possibly the cup of tea was dudleys idea of a clever booby trap keeping his bleeding hand elevated harry scraped the fragments of cup together with the other hand and threw them into the already crammed bin just visible inside his bedroom door then he tramped across to the bathroom to run his finger under the tap 
 
 it was stupid pointless irritating beyond belief that he still had four days left of being unable to perform magicbut he had to admit to himself that this jagged cut in his finger would have defeated him he had never learned how to repair wounds and now he came to think of it c particularly in light of his immediate plans c this seemed a serious flaw in his magical education making a mental note to ask hermione how it was done he used a large wad of toilet paper to mop up as much of the tea as he could before returning to his bedroom and slamming the door behind him 
 
 harry had spent the morning completely emptying his school trunk for the first time since he had packed it six years ago at the start of the intervening school years he had merely skimmed off the topmost three quarters of the contents and replaced or updated them leaving a layer of general debris at the bottom c old quills desiccated beetle eyes single socks that no longer fit minutes previously harry had plunged his hand into this mulch experienced a stabbing pain in the fourth finger of his right hand and withdrawn it to see a lot of blood 
 
 he now proceeded a little more cautiously kneeling down beside the trunk again he groped around in the bottom and after retrieving an old badge that flickered feebly between support cedric diggory and potter stinks a cracked and sneakoscope and a gold locket inside which a note signed had been hidden he finally discovered the sharp edge that had done the damage he recognized it at once it was a fragment of the enchanted mirror that his dead godfather sirius had given him harry laid it aside and felt cautiously around the trunk for the rest but nothing more remained of his godfathers last gift except powdered glass which clung to the deepest layer of debris like glittering grit 
 
 harry sat up and examined the jagged piece on which he had cut himself seeing nothing but his own bright green eye reflected back at him then he placed the fragment on top of that mornings daily prophet which lay unread on the bed and attempted to stem the sudden upsurge of bitter memories the stabs of regret and of longing the discovery of the broken mirror had occasioned by attacking the rest of the rubbish in the trunk 
 
 it took another hour to empty it completely throw away the useless items and sort the remainder in piles according to whether or not he would need them from now on his school and quidditch robes cauldron parchment quills and most of his textbooks were piled in a corner to be left behind he wondered what his aunt and uncle would do with them burn them in the dead of night probably as if they were evidence of some dreadful crime his muggle clothing invisibility cloak kit certain books the photograph album hagrid had once given him a stack of letters and his wand had been repacked into an old rucksack in a front pocket were the marauders map and the locket with the note signed inside it the locket was accorded this place of honor not because it was valuable c in all usual senses it was worthless c but because of what it had cost to attain it 
 
 this left a sizable stack of newspapers sitting on his desk beside his snowy owl hedwig one for each of the days harry had spent at privet drive this summer 
 
 he got up off the floor stretched and moved across to his desk hedwig made no movement as he began to flick through newspapers throwing them into the rubbish pile one by one the owl was asleep or else faking she was angry with harry about the limited amount of time she was allowed out of her cage at the moment 
 
 as he neared the bottom of the pile of newspapers harry slowed down searching for one particular issue that he knew had arrived shortly after he had returned to privet drive for the summer he remembered that there had been a small mention on the front about the resignation of charity burbage the muggle studies teacher at hogwarts at last he found it turning to page ten he sank into his desk chair and reread the article he had been looking for 
 
 albus dumbledore remembered 
 by elphias doge 
 i met albus dumbledore at the age of eleven on our first day at hogwarts our mutual attraction was undoubtedly due to the fact that we both felt ourselves to be outsiders i had contracted dragon pox shortly before arriving at school and while i was no longer contagious my visage and greenish hue did not encourage many to approach me for his part albus had arrived at hogwarts under the burden of unwanted notoriety scarcely a year previously his father percival had been convicted of a savage and attack upon three young muggles 
 
 albus never attempted to deny that his father who was to die in azkaban had committed this crime on the contrary when i plucked up courage to ask him he assured me that he knew his father to be guilty beyond that dumbledore refused to speak of the sad business though many attempted to make him do so some indeed were disposed to praise his fathers action and assumed that albus too was a they could not have been more mistaken as anybody who knew albus would attest he never revealed the remotest tendency indeed his determined support for muggle rights gained him many enemies in subsequent years 
 
 in a matter of months however albuss own fame had begun to eclipse that of his father by the end of his first year he would never again be known as the son of a but as nothing more or less than the most brilliant student ever seen at the school those of us who were privileged to be his friends benefited from his example not to mention his help and encouragement with which he was always generous he confessed to me later in life that he knew even then that his greatest pleasure lay in teaching 
 
 he not only won every prize of note that the school offered he was soon in regular correspondence with the most notable magical names of the day including nicolas flamel the celebrated alchemist bathilda bagshot the noted historian and adalbert waffling the magical theoretician several of his papers found their way into learned publications such as transfiguration today challenges in charming and the practical potioneer dumbledores future career seemed likely to be meteoric and the only question that remained was when he would become minister of magic though it was often predicted in later years that he was on the point of taking the job however he never had ministerial ambitions 
 
 three years after we had started at hogwarts albuss brother aberforth arrived at school they were not alike aberforth was never bookish and unlike albus preferred to settle arguments by dueling rather than through reasoned discussion however it is quite wrong to suggest as some have that the brothers were not friends they rubbed along as comfortably as two such different boys could do in fairness to aberforth it must be admitted that living in albuss shadow cannot have been an altogether comfortable experience being continually outshone was an occupational hazard of being his friend and cannot have been any more pleasurable as a brother when albus and i left hogwarts we intended to take the tour of the world together visiting and observing foreign wizards before pursuing our separate careers however tragedy intervened on the very eve of our trip albuss mother kendra died leaving albus the head and sole breadwinner of the family i postponed my departure long enough to pay my respects at kendras funeral then left for what was now to be a solitary journey with a younger brother and sister to care for and little gold left to them there could no longer be any question of albus accompanying me 
 
 that was the period of our lives when we had least contact i wrote to albus describing perhaps insensitively the wonders of my journey from narrow escapes from chimaeras in greece to the experiments of the egyptian alchemists his letters told me little of his life which i guessed to be frustratingly dull for such a brilliant wizard immersed in my own experiences it was with horror that i heard toward the end of my years travels that another tragedy had struck the dumbledores the death of his sister ariana 
 
 though ariana had been in poor health for a long time the blow coming so soon after the loss of their mother had a profound effect on both of her brothers all those closest to albus c and i count myself one of that lucky number c agree that arianas death and albuss feeling of personal responsibility for it though of course he was guiltless left their mark upon him forevermore 
 
 i returned home to find a young man who had experienced a much older persons suffering albus was more reserved than before and much less to add to his misery the loss of ariana had led not to a renewed closeness between albus and aberforth but to an estrangement in time this would lift c in later years they reestablished if not a close relationship then certainly a cordial one however he rarely spoke of his parents or of ariana from then on and his friends learned not to mention them 
 
 other quills will describe the triumphs of the following years dumbledores innumerable contributions to the store of wizarding knowledge including his discovery of the twelve uses of dragons blood will benefit generations to come as will the wisdom he displayed in the many judgments while chief warlock of the wizengamot they say still that no wizarding duel ever matched that between dumbledore and grindelwald in those who witnessed it have written of the terror and the awe they felt as they watched these two extraordinary wizards to battle dumbledores triumph and its consequences for the wizarding world are considered a turning point in magical history to match the introduction of the international statute of secrecy or the downfall of 
 
 albus dumbledore was never proud or vain he could find something to value in anyone however apparently insignificant or wretched and i believe that his early losses endowed him with great humanity and sympathy i shall miss his friendship more than i can say but my loss is nothing compared to the wizarding worlds that he was the most inspiring and best loved of all hogwarts headmasters cannot be in question he died as he lived working always for the greater good and to his last hour as willing to stretch out a hand to a small boy with dragon pox as he was on the day i met him 
 
 harry finished reading but continued to gaze at the picture accompanying the obituary dumbledore was wearing his familiar kindly smile but as he peered over the top of his spectacles he gave the impression even in newsprint of harry whose sadness mingled with a sense of humiliation 
 
 he had thought he knew dumbledore quite well but ever since reading this obituary he had been forced to recognize that he had barely known him at all never once had he imagined dumbledores childhood or youth it was as though he had sprung into being as harry had known him venerable and and old the idea of a teenage dumbledore was simply odd like trying to imagine a stupid hermione or a friendly skrewt 
 
 he had never thought to ask dumbledore about his past no doubt it would have felt strange impertinent even but after all it had been common knowledge that dumbledore had taken part in that legendary duel with grindelwald and harry had not thought to ask dumbledore what that had been like nor about any of his other famous achievements no they had always discussed harry harrys past harrys future harrys plans and it seemed to harry now despite the fact that his future was so dangerous and so uncertain that he had missed irreplaceable opportunities when he had failed to ask dumbledore more about himself even though the only personal question he had ever asked his headmaster was also the only one he suspected that dumbledore had not answered honestly 
 
 what do you see when you look in the mirror 
 
 i i see myself holding a pair of thick woolen socks 
 
 after several minutes thought harry tore the obituary out of the prophet folded it carefully and tucked it inside the first volume of practical defensive magic and its use against the dark arts then he threw the rest of the newspaper onto the rubbish pile and turned to face the room it was much tidier the only things left out of place were todays daily prophet still lying on the bed and on top of it the piece of broken mirror 
 
 harry moved across the room slid the mirror fragment off todays prophet and unfolded the newspaper he had merely glanced at the headline when he had taken the paper from the delivery owl early that morning and thrown it aside after noting that it said nothing about voldemort harry was sure that the ministry was leaning on the prophet to suppress news about voldemort it was only now therefore that he saw what he had missed 
 
 across the bottom half of the front page a smaller headline was set over a picture of dumbledore striding along looking harried 
 
 dumbledore c the truth at last 
 coming next week the shocking story of the flawed genius considered by many to be the greatest wizard of his generation striping away the popular image of serene wisdom rita skeeter reveals the disturbed childhood the lawless youth the feuds and the guilty secrets that dumbledore carried to his grave why was the man tipped to be the minister of magic content to remain a mere headmaster what was the real purpose of the secret organization known as the order of the phoenix how did dumbledore really meet his end 
 
 the answers to these and many more questions are explored in the explosive new biography the life and lies of albus dumbledore by rita skeeter exclusively interviewed by berry braithwaite page inside 
 
 harry ripped open the paper and found page thirteen the article was topped with a picture showing another familiar face a woman wearing jeweled glasses with elaborately curled blonde hair her teeth bared in what was clearly supposed to be a winning smile wiggling her fingers up at him doing his best to ignore this nauseating image harry read on 
 
 in person rita skeeter is much warmer and softer than her famously ferocious might suggest greeting me in the hallway of her cozy home she leads me straight into the kitchen for a cup of tea a slice of pound cake and it goes without saying a steaming vat of freshest gossip 
 
 well of course dumbledore is a biographers dream says skeeter such a long full life im sure my book will be the first of very very many 
 
 skeeter was certainly quick off the mark her book was completed in a mere four weeks after dumbledores mysterious death in june i ask her how she managed this superfast feat 
 
 oh when youve been a journalist as long as i have working to a deadline is second nature i knew that the wizarding world was clamoring for the full story and i wanted to be the first to meet that need 
 
 i mention the recent widely publicized remarks of elphias doge special advisor to the wizengamot and longstanding friend of albus dumbledores that skeeters book contains less fact than a chocolate frog card 
 
 skeeter throws back her head and laughs 
 
 darling dodgy i remember interviewing him a few years back about merpeople rights bless him completely gaga seemed to think we were sitting at the bottom of lake windermere kept telling me to watch out for trout 
 
 and yet elphias doges accusations of inaccuracy have been echoed in many places does skeeter really feel that four short weeks have been enough to gain a full picture of dumbledores long and extraordinary life 
 
 oh my dear beams skeeter rapping me affectionately across the knuckles you know as well as i do how much information can be generated by a fat bag of galleons a refusal to hear the word no and a nice sharp quill people were queuing to dish the dirt on dumbledore anyway not everyone thought he was so wonderful you know c he trod on an awful lot of important toes but old dodgy doge can get off his high hippogriff because ive had access to a source most journalists would swap their wands for one who has never spoken in public before and who was close to dumbledore during the most turbulent and disturbing phase of his youth 
 
 the advance publicity for skeeters biography has certainly suggested that there will be shocks in store for those who believe dumbledore to have led a blameless life what were the biggest surprises she uncovered i ask 
 
 now come off it betty im not giving away all the highlights before anybodys bought the book laughs skeeter but i can promise that anybody who still thinks dumbledore was white as his beard is in for a rude awakening lets just say that nobody hearing him rage against would have dreamed that he dabbled in the dark arts himself in his youth and for a wizard who spent his later years pleading for tolerance he wasnt exactly when he was younger yes albus dumbledore had an extremely murky past not to mention that very fishy family which he worked so hard to keep hushed up 
 
 i ask whether skeeter is referring to dumbledores brother aberforth whose conviction by the wizengamot for misuse of magic caused a minor scandal fifteen years ago 
 
 oh aberforth is just the tip of the dung heap laughs skeeter no no im talking about much worse than a brother with a fondness for fiddling about with goats worse even than the father c dumbledore couldnt keep either of them quiet anyway they were both charged by the wizengamot no its the mother and the sister that intrigued me and a little digging uncovered a positive nest of nastiness c but as i say youll have to wait for chapters nine to twelve for full details all i can say now is its no wonder dumbledore never talked about how his nose got broken 
 
 family skeletons notwithstanding does skeeter deny the brilliance that led to dumbledores many magical discoveries 
 
 he had brains she concedes although many now question whether he could really take full credit for all of his supposed achievements as i reveal in chapter sixteen ivor dillonsby claims he had already discovered eight uses of dragons blood when dumbledore borrowed his papers 
 
 but the importance of some of dumbledores achievements cannot i venture be denied what of his famous defeat of grindelwald 
 
 oh now im glad you mentioned grindelwald says skeeter with such a tantalizing smile im afraid those who go over dumbledores spectacular victory must brace themselves for a bombshell c or perhaps a dungbomb very dirty business indeed all ill say is dont be so sure that there really was a spectacular duel of legend after theyve read my book people may be forced to conclude that grindelwald simply conjured a white handkerchief from the end of his wand and came quietly 
 
 skeeter refuses to give any more away on this intriguing subject so we turn instead to the relationship that will undoubtedly fascinate her readers more than any other 
 
 oh yes says skeeter nodding briskly i devote an entire chapter to the whole relationship its been called unhealthy even sinister again your readers will have to buy my book for the whole story but there is no question that dumbledore took an unnatural interest in potter from the word go whether that was really in the boys best interests c well well see its certainly an open secret that potter has had a most troubled adolescence 
 
 i ask whether skeeter is still in touch with harry potter whom she so famously interviewed last year a breakthrough piece in which potter spoke exclusively of his conviction that had returned 
 
 oh yes weve developed a closer bond says skeeter poor potter has few real friends and we met at one of the most testing moments of his life c the triwizard tournament i am probably one of the only people alive who can say that they know the real harry potter 
 
 which leads us neatly to the many rumors still circulating about dumbledores final hours does skeeter believe that potter was there when dumbledore died 
 
 well i dont want to say too much c its all in the book c but eyewitnesses inside hogwarts castle saw potter running away from the scene moments after dumbledore fell jumped or was pushed potter later gave evidence against severus snape a man against whom he has a notorious grudge is everything as it seems that is for the wizarding community to decide c once theyve read my book 
 
 on that intriguing note i take my leave there can be no doubt that skeeter has quilled an instant bestseller dumbledores legion of admirers meanwhile may well be trembling at what is soon to emerge about their hero 
 
 
 
 
 harry reached the bottom of the article but continued to stare blankly at the page revulsion and fury rose in him like vomit he balled up the newspaper and threw it with all his force at the wall where it joined the rest of the rubbish heaped around his overflowing bin 
 
 he began to stride blindly around the room opening empty drawers and picking up books only to replace them on the same piles barely conscious of what he was doing as random phrases from ritas article echoed in his head an entire chapter to the whole relationship its been called unhealthy even sinister he dabbled in the dark arts himself in his youth ive had access to a source most journalists would swap their wands for 
 
 lies harry bellowed and through the window he saw the neighbor who had paused to restart his lawn mower look up nervously 
 
 harry sat down hard on the bed the broken bit of mirror danced away from him he picked it up and turned it over in his fingers thinking thinking of dumbledore and the lies with which rita skeeter was defaming him 
 
 a flash of brightest blue harry froze his cut finger slipping on the jagged edge of the mirror again he had imagined it he must have done he glanced over his shoulder but the wall was a sickly peach color of aunt petunias choosing there was nothing blue there for the mirror to reflect he peered into the mirror fragment again and saw nothing but his own bright green eye looking back at him 
 
 he had imagined it there was no other explanation imagined it because he had been thinking of his dead headmaster if anything was certain it was that the bright blue eyes of albus dumbledore would never pierce him again

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 a great grief 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 this story really consists of two parts the first part might be left out but it gives us a few particulars and these are useful we were staying in the country at a seat where it happened that the master was absent for a few days in the meantime there arrived from the next town a lady she had a pug dog with her and came she said to dispose of shares in her she had her papers with her and we advised her to put them in an envelope and to write thereon the address of the proprietor of the knight c 
 she listened to us attentively seized the pen paused and begged us to repeat the direction slowly we complied and she wrote but in the midst of the general war she struck fast sighed deeply and said i am only a woman her puggie had seated itself on the ground while she wrote and growled for the dog had come with her for amusement and for the sake of its health and then the bare floor ought not to be offered to a visitor his outward appearance was characterized by a snub nose and a very fat back 
 he bite said the lady he has no teeth he is like one of the family faithful and grumpy but the latter is my fault for they have teased him they play at wedding and want to give him the part of the bridesmaid and too much for him poor old fellow and she delivered her papers and took puggie upon her arm and this is the first part of the story which might have been left out 
 puggie died the second part it was about a week afterwards we arrived in the town and put up at the inn our windows looked into the which was divided into two parts by a partition of planks in one half were many skins and hides raw and tanned here was all the apparatus necessary to carry on a tannery and it belonged to the widow puggie had died in the morning and was to be buried in this part of the yard the grandchildren of the widow that is of the widow for puggie had never been married filled up the grave and it was a beautiful grave it must have been quite pleasant to lie there the grave was bordered with pieces of and strewn over with sand quite at the top they had stuck up half a beer bottle with the neck upwards and that was not at all allegorical 
 the children danced round the grave and the eldest of the boys among them a practical youngster of seven years made the proposition that there should be an exhibition of for all who lived in the lane the price of admission was to be a trouser button for every boy would be sure to have one and each might also give one for a little girl this proposal was adopted by acclamation 
 and all the children out of the lane yes even out of the little lane at the back flocked to the place and each gave a button 
 many were noticed to go about on that afternoon with only one suspender but then they had seen grave and the sight was worth much more 
 but in front of the close to the entrance stood a little girl clothed in rags very pretty to look at with curly hair and eyes so blue and clear that it was a pleasure to look into them the child said not a word nor did she cry but each time the little door was opened she gave a long long look into the yard she had not a button that she knew right well and therefore she remained standing sorrowfully outside till all the others had seen the grave and had gone away then she sat down held her little brown hands before her eyes and burst into tears this girl alone had not seen grave it was a grief as great to her as any grown person can experience 
 we saw this from above and looked at from above how many a grief of our own and of others can make us smile that is the story and whoever does not understand it may go and purchase a share in the from the window

 of unity in religion 
 religion being the chief band of human society it is a happy thing when itself is 
 well contained within the true band of unity the quarrels and divisions about 
 religion were evils unknown to the heathen the reason was because the religion of the heathen consisted rather in rites and ceremonies than in any constant belief 
 for you may imagine what kind of faith theirs was when the chief doctors and fathers of their church were the poets but the true god haul this attribute that he is a jealous god and therefore his worship and religion will endure no mixture nor partner we shall therefore speak a few words concerning the unity of the church what are the fruits thereof what the bounds and what means 
 the fruits of unity next unto the well pleasing of god which is all in all are 
 two me one towards those that are without the church the other towards those that are within for the former it is certain that heresies and schisms are of all others the greatest scandals yea more than corruption of manners for as in the natural body a wound or solution of continuity is worse than a corrupt humour so in the spiritual so that nothing doth so much keep men out of the church and drive men out of the church as breach of unity and therefore whensoever it cometh to that pass that one saith ecce in deserto another saith ecce in penetralibus that is when some men seek christ in the conventicles of heretics and others in an outward face of a church that voice had need continually to sound in ears nolite exire go not out the doctor of the gentiles the propriety of whose vocation drew him to have a special care of those without saith if an heathen come in and hear you speak with several tongues will he not say that you are mad and certainly it is lime better when atheists and profane persons do hear of so many discordant and contrary opinions in religion it doth avert them from the church and maketh them to sit down in the chair of the scorners it is but a light thing to be vouched in so serious a matter but yet it expressed well the deformity 
 there is a master of scoffing that in his catalogue of books of a feigned library sets down this title of a book the moms dance of heretics for indeed every sect of them hath a diverse posture or cringe by themselves which cannot but move derision in worldlings and depraved politics who are apt to contemn holy things as for the fruit towards those that are within it is peace which containe infinite blessings it establisheth faith it kindleth charity the outward peace of the church distilleth into peace of conscience and it turneth the labours of writing and reading of controversies into treaties of mortification and devotion 
 concerning the bounds of unity the true placing of them importeth exceedingly 
 there appear to be two extremes for to certain zealants all speech of pacification is odious is it peace jehu what hast thou to do with peace turn thee behind me peace is not the matter but following and party contrariwise certain laodiceans and lukewarm persons think they may accommodate points of religion by middle ways and taking part of both and witty reconcilements as if they would make an arbitrement between god and man both these extremes are to be avoided which will be done if the league of christians penned by our saviour himself were in the two cross clauses thereof soundly and plainly expounded he that is not with us is against us and again he that is not against us is with us that is if the points fundamental and of substance in religion were truly discerned and distinguished from points not merely of faith but of opinion order or good intention 
 this is a thing may seem to many a matter trivial and done already but if it were done less partially it would be embraced more generally of this i may give only this advice according to my small model men ought to take heed of rending church by two kinds of controversies the one is when the matter of me point controverted is too small and light not worth the heat and strife 
 about it kindled only by contradiction for as it is noted by one of the fathers 
 coat indeed had no seam but the vesture was of divers colours whereupon he saith in veste varietas sit scissura non sit they be two things unity and uniformity the other is when the matter of the point controverted is great but it is driven to an subtlety and obscurity so that it becometh a thing rather ingenious then substantial 
 a man that is of judgement and understanding shall sometimes hear ignorant men differ and know well within himself mat those which so differ mean one thing and yet they themselves would never agree and if it come so to pass in that distance of judgement which is between man and man shall we not think that god above that knows the heart doth not discern that frail men in some of their contradictions intend the same thing and accepteth of both the nature of such controversies is excellently expressed by st paul in the warning and precept that he giveth concerning the same devita profanas vocum oppositiones falsi nominis scientiae men create oppositions which are not and put them into new terms so fixed as whereas the meaning ought to govern 
 the term the term in effect govemeth the meaning there be also two false peaces or unities the one when the peace is grounded but upon an implicit ignorance for all colours will agree in the dark me other when it is pieced up upon a direct admission of contraries in fundamental points for truth and falsehood in such things are like the iron and clay in the toes of image they may cleave but they will not incorporate 
 concerning the means of procuring unity men must beware that in the procuring or muniting of religious unity they do not dissolve and deface the laws of charity and of human society there be two swords amongst christians the spiritual and temporal and both have their due office and place in the maintenance of religion 
 but we may not take up the third sword which is sword or like unto it that is to propagate religion by wars or by sanguinary prosecutions to force consciences except it be in cases of overt scandal blasphemy or intermixture of practice against the state much less to nourish seditions to authorise conspiracies and rebellions to put the sword into the hands and the like tending to the subversion of all government which is the ordinance of god for this is but to dash the first table against the second and so to consider men as christians as we forget that they are men lucretius the poet when he beheld the act of agamemnon that could endure the sacrificing of his own daughter exclaimed tantum religio potuit suadere malorum 
 
 what would he have said if he had known of the massacre in france or the powder treason of england he would have been seven times more epicure and atheist than he was for as the temporal sword is to be drawn with great circumspection in cases of religion so it is a thing monstrous to put it into the hands of the common people 
 
 let that be left unto the anabaptists and other furies it was great blasphemy when the devil said i will ascend and be like the highest but it is greater blasphemy to personate god and bring him in saying i will descend 
 and be like the prince of darkness and what is it better to make the cause of 
 religion to descend to the cruel and execrable actions of murdering princes butchery of people and subversion of states and governments surely this is to bring down the holy ghost in stead of the likeness of a dove in the shape of a vulture or raven and to set out of the bark of a christian church a flag 
 of a barque of pirates and assassins therefore it is most necessary that the church by doctrine and decree princes by their sword and all learnings both christian and moral as by their mercury rod do damn and send to hell for ever those facts and opinions tending to the support of me same as hath been already in good part done surely in counsels concerning religion that counsel of the apostle would be prefixed ira hominis non implet justitiam dei and it was a notable observation of a wise father and no less ingenuously confessed that those which held and persuaded pressure of consciences were commonly interested therein themselves for their own ends

 book just man 
 chapter ii 
 
 m myriel becomes m welcome 
 the episcopal palace of d adjoins the hospital 
 the episcopal palace was a huge and beautiful house built of stone at the beginning of the last century by m henri puget doctor of theology of the faculty of paris abbe of simore who had been bishop of d in 
 this palace was a genuine seignorial residence everything about it had a grand apartments of the bishop the the chambers the principal courtyard which was very large with walks encircling it under arcades in the old florentine fashion and gardens planted with magnificent trees in the a long and superb gallery which was situated on the and opened on the gardens m henri puget had entertained in state on july my lords charles brulart de genlis archbishop prince antoine de mesgrigny the capuchin bishop of grasse philippe de vendome grand prior of france abbe of saint honore de lerins francois de berton de crillon bishop baron de vence cesar de sabran de forcalquier bishop seignor of glandeve and jean soanen priest of the oratory preacher in ordinary to the king bishop seignor of senez the portraits of these seven reverend personages decorated this apartment and this memorable date the th of july was there engraved in letters of gold on a table of white marble 
 the hospital was a low and narrow building of a single story with a small garden 
 three days after his arrival the bishop visited the hospital the visit ended he had the director requested to be so good as to come to his house 
 monsieur the director of the hospital said he to him how many sick people have you at the present moment 
 monseigneur 
 that was the number which i counted said the bishop 
 the beds pursued the director are very much crowded against each other 
 that is what i observed 
 the halls are nothing but rooms and it is with difficulty that the air can be changed in them 
 so it seems to me 
 and then when there is a ray of sun the garden is very small for the convalescents 
 that was what i said to myself 
 in case of have had the typhus fever this year we had the sweating sickness two years ago and a hundred patients at know not what to do 
 that is the thought which occurred to me 
 what would you have monseigneur said the director 
 one must resign self 
 this conversation took place in the gallery on the 
 the bishop remained silent for a moment then he turned abruptly to the director of the hospital 
 monsieur said he how many beds do you think this hall alone would hold 
 exclaimed the stupefied director 
 the bishop cast a glance round the apartment and seemed to be taking measures and calculations with his eyes 
 it would hold full twenty beds said he as though speaking to himself 
 then raising his voice 
 hold monsieur the director of the hospital i will tell you something there is evidently a mistake here 
 there are of you in five or six small rooms 
 there are three of us here and we have room for sixty 
 there is some mistake i tell you you have my house and i have yours 
 give me back my house you are at home here 
 on the following day the patients were installed in the palace and the bishop was settled in the hospital 
 m myriel had no property his family having been ruined by the revolution 
 his sister was in receipt of a yearly income of five hundred francs which sufficed for her personal wants at the vicarage 
 m myriel received from the state in his quality of bishop a salary of fifteen thousand francs 
 on the very day when he took up his abode in the hospital m myriel settled on the disposition of this sum once for all in the following manner we transcribe here a note made by his own hand 
 note on the regulation of my household expenses 
 for the little seminary livres 
 society of the mission 
 for the lazarists of montdidier 
 seminary for foreign missions in paris 
 congregation of the holy spirit 
 religious establishments of the holy land 
 charitable maternity societies 
 extra for that of arles 
 work for the amelioration of prisons 
 work for the relief and delivery of prisoners 
 to liberate fathers of families incarcerated for debt 
 addition to the salary of the poor teachers of thediocese 
 public granary of the 
 congregation of the ladies of d of manosque and of sisteron for the gratuitous instruction of poor girls 
 for the poor 
 my personal expenses 
 total 
 m myriel made no change in this arrangement during the entire period that he occupied the see of d as has been seen he called it regulating his household expenses 
 this arrangement was accepted with absolute submission by mademoiselle baptistine 
 this holy woman regarded monseigneur of d as at one and the same time her brother and her bishop her friend according to the flesh and her superior according to the church she simply loved and venerated him 
 when he spoke she bowed when he acted she yielded her adherence 
 their only servant madame magloire grumbled a little 
 it will be observed that monsieur the bishop had reserved for himself only one thousand livres which added to the pension of mademoiselle baptistine made fifteen hundred francs a year 
 on these fifteen hundred francs these two old women and the old man subsisted 
 and when a village curate came to d the bishop still found means to entertain him thanks to the severe economy of madame magloire and to the intelligent administration of mademoiselle baptistine 
 one day after he had been in d about three months the bishop said 
 and still i am quite cramped with it all 
 i should think so exclaimed madame magloire 
 monseigneur has not even claimed the allowance which the department owes him for the expense of his carriage in town and for his journeys about the diocese 
 it was customary for bishops in former days 
 hold cried the bishop you are quite right madame magloire 
 and he made his demand 
 some time afterwards the general council took this demand under consideration and voted him an annual sum of three thousand francs under this heading 
 allowance to m the bishop for expenses of carriage expenses of posting and expenses of pastoral visits 
 this provoked a great outcry among the local burgesses and a senator of the empire a former member of the council of the five hundred which favored the brumaire and who was provided with a magnificent senatorial office in the vicinity of the town of d wrote to m bigot de preameneu the minister of public worship a very angry and confidential note on the subject from which we extract these authentic lines 
 expenses of carriage 
 what can be done with it in a town of less than four thousand inhabitants 
 expenses of journeys 
 what is the use of these trips in the first place 
 next how can the posting be accomplished in these mountainous parts 
 there are no roads no one travels otherwise than on horseback 
 even the bridge between durance and can barely support these priests are all thus greedy and avaricious 
 this man played the good priest when he first came 
 now he does like the rest he must have a carriage and a he must have luxuries like the bishops of the olden days 
 oh all this priesthood things will not go well m le comte until the emperor has freed us from these rascals 
 down with the pope 
 matters were getting embroiled with rome for my part i am for caesar alone etc etc 
 on the other hand this affair afforded great delight to madame magloire good said she to mademoiselle baptistine monseigneur began with other people but he has had to wind up with himself after all he has regulated all his charities 
 now here are three thousand francs for us 
 at last 
 that same evening the bishop wrote out and handed to his sister a memorandum conceived in the following terms 
 expenses of carriage and circuit 
 for furnishing meat soup to the patients in the hospital livres 
 for the maternity charitable society of aix 
 for the maternity charitable society of draguignan 
 for foundlings 
 for orphans 
 total 
 such was m budget 
 as for the chance episcopal perquisites the fees for marriage bans dispensations private baptisms sermons benedictions of churches or chapels marriages etc the bishop levied them on the wealthy with all the more asperity since he bestowed them on the needy 
 after a time offerings of money flowed in 
 those who had and those who lacked knocked at m latter in search of the alms which the former came to deposit 
 in less than a year the bishop had become the treasurer of all benevolence and the cashier of all those in distress 
 considerable sums of money passed through his hands but nothing could induce him to make any change whatever in his mode of life or add anything superfluous to his bare necessities 
 far from it 
 as there is always more wretchedness below than there is brotherhood above all was given away so to speak before it was received 
 it was like water on dry soil no matter how much money he received he never had any 
 then he stripped himself 
 the usage being that bishops shall announce their baptismal names at the head of their charges and their pastoral letters the poor people of the had selected with a sort of affectionate instinct among the names and prenomens of their bishop that which had a meaning for them and they never called him anything except monseigneur bienvenu welcome we will follow their example and will also call him thus when we have occasion to name him 
 moreover this appellation pleased him 
 i like that name said he 
 bienvenu makes up for the monseigneur 
 we do not claim that the portrait herewith presented is probable we confine ourselves to stating that it resembles the original

 a new hope 
 ii 
 
 it was an old saying that you could burn your eyes out faster by staringstraight and hard at the flatlands of tatooine than by looking directly atits two huge suns themselves so powerful was the penetrating glare reflected fromthose endless wastes despite the flare life could and did exist in the flatlandsformed by seabeds one thing made it possible the reintroductionof water 
 for human purposes however the water of tatooine was only marginallyaccessible the atmosphere yielded its moisture with reluctance it had to becoaxed down out of the hard blue forced yanked down to the parchedsurface two figures whose concern was obtaining that moisture were standing on aslight rise of one of those inhospitable flats one of the pair was stiff and vaporator sunk securely through sand and into deeper rock the figurenext to it was a food deal more animated though no less 
 luke skywalker was twice the age of the vaporator but much lesssecure at the moment he was swearing softly at a recalcitrant valve adjuster on thetemperamental device from time to time he resorted to some unsubtle pounding inplace of using the appropriate tool neither method worked very well luke wassure that the lubricants used on the vaporator went out of their way to attract seductively to small abrasive particles with an oily gleam he wipedsweat from his forehead and leaned back for a moment the most prepossessingthing about the young man was his name a light breeze tugged at his shaggy hairand baggy work tunic as he regarded the device no point in staying angry at it hecounseled himself only an unintelligent machine 
 as luke considered his predicament a third figure appeared scooting out frombehind the vaporator to fumble awkwardly at the damaged section only three of thetreadwell model six arms were functioning and these had seen more wearthan the boots on feet the machine moved with unsteady 
 luke gazed at it sadly then inclined his head to study the sky still no sign of acloud and he knew there never would be unless he got that vaporator working hewas about to try once again when a small intense gleam of light caught his he slipped the carefully cleaned set of macrobinoculars from his utility beltand focused the lenses skyward 
 for long moments he stared wishing all the while that he had a real telescopeinstead of the binocs as he stared vaporators the heat and the remainingchores were forgotten clipping the binoculars back onto his belt luke turned anddashed for the landspeeder halfway to the vehicle he thought to call behind him 
 hurry up he shouted impatiently what are you waiting for get it ingear 
 the treadwell started toward him hesitated and then commenced spinning in atight circle smoke belching from every joint luke shouted further instruction thenfinally gave up in disgust when he realized that it would take more than words tomotivate the treadwell again 
 for a moment luke hesitated at leaving the machine he argued tohimself its vital components were obviously shot so he jumped into thelandspeeder causing the recently repaired repulsion floater to list alarmingly to oneside until he was able to equalize weight distribution by sliding behind the its altitude slightly above the sandy ground the transportvehicle steadied itself like a boat in a heavy sea luke gunned the engine whichwhined in protest and sand erupted behind the floater as he aimed the craft toward thedistant town of anchorhead 
 behind him a pitiful beacon of black smoke from the burning robot continued torise into the clear desert air it be there when luke returned there werescavengers of metal as well as flesh in the wide wastes of tatooine 
 metal and stone structures bleached white by the glaze of twin tatoo i and iihuddled together tightly for company as much as for protection they formed thenexus of the widespread farming community of anchorhead 
 presently the dusty unpaved streets were quiet deserted sandflies buzzedlazily in the cracked eaves of pourstone building a dog barked in the distance thesole sign of habitation until a lone old woman appeared and started across the metallic sun shawl was pulled tight around her 
 something made her look up tired eyes squinting into the distance the soundsuddenly leaped in volume as a shining rectangular shape came roaring around a farcorner her eyes popped as the vehicle bore down on her showing no sign ofaltering its path she had to scramble to get out of its way 
 panting and waving an angry fist after the landspeeder she raised her voice overthe sound of its passage you kids ever learn to slow down 
 luke might have seen her but he certainly hear her in both cases hisattention was focused elsewhere as he pulled up behind a low long concrete coils and rods jutted from its top and sides relentless sand wavesbroke in frozen yellow spume against the walls no one had bothered toclear them away there was no point they would only return again the followingday 
 luke slammed the front door aside and shouted hey 
 a rugged young man in dress sat sprawled in a chair behind unkempt control desk sunscreen oil had kept his skin from burning theskin of the girl on his lap had been equally protected and there was a great deal moreof the protected area in view somehow even dried sweat looked good on her 
 hey everybody luke yelled again having elicited something less than anoverwhelming response with his first cry he ran toward the instrument room at therear of the station while the mechanic half asleep ran a hand across his face andmumbled did i hear a young noise blast through here 
 the girl on his lap stretched sensuously her clothing tugging invarious intriguing directions her voice was casually throaty oh she was just wormie on one of his rampages 
 deak and windy looked up from the pool game as luke burstinto the room they were dressed much like luke although their clothing was ofbetter fit and somewhat less exercised 
 all three youths contrasted strikingly with the burly handsome player at the farside of the table from neatly clipped hair to his uniform he stood outin the room like an oriental poppy in a sea of oats behind the three humans a softhum came from where a repair robot was working patiently on a broken piece ofstation equipment 
 shape it up you guys luke yelled excitedly then he noticed the older manin the uniform the subject of his suddenly startled gaze recognized himsimultaneously 
 biggs 
 the face twisted in a half grin hello luke then they wereembracing each other warmly 
 luke finally stood away openly admiring the uniform i knowyou were back when did you get in 
 the confidence in the voice bordered the realm of smugness withoutquite entering it just a little while ago i wanted to surprise you hotshot heindicated the room i thought be here with these other two and windy both smiled i certainly expect you to be out laughed easily a laugh few people found resistible 
 the academy change you much luke commented but backso soon his expression grew concerned hey what you getyour commission 
 there was something evasive about biggs as he replied looking slightly course i got it signed to serve aboard the freighter rand ecliptic just last mate biggs darklighter at your service he performed a twisting salute halfserious and half humorous then grinned that over bearing yet ingratiating grin again 
 i just came back to say to all you unfortunate landlocked all laughed until luke suddenly remembered what had brought him here in suchhurry 
 i almost forgot he told them his initial excitement returning a battlegoing on right here in our system come and look 
 deak looked disappointed not another one of your epic battles you dreamed up enough of them forget it 
 forget it serious a battle all right 
 with words and shoves he managed to cajole the occupants of the station out intothe strong sunlight camie in particular looked disgusted 
 this had better be worth it luke she warned him shading her eyes against theglare 
 luke already had his macrobinoculars out and was searching the heavens ittook only a moment for him to fix on a particular spot i told you he they are 
 biggs moved alongside him and reached for the binoculars as the other strainedunaided eyes a slight readjustment provided just enough magnification for biggs toout two silvery specks against the dark blue 
 no battle hotshot he decided lowering the binocs and regarding hisfriend gently just sitting there two ships all a bargeloading a freighter since tatooine got an orbital station 
 there was a lot of luke added his initial enthusiasm wasbeginning to falter under the withering assurance of his older friend 
 camie grabbed the binoculars away from biggs banging them slightly against asupport pillar in the process luke took them away from her quickly inspecting thecasing for damage take it easy with those 
 worry so much wormie she sneered luke took a step toward halted as the huskier mechanic easily interposed himself between them andfavored luke with a warning smile luke considered shrugged the incident away 
 i keep telling you luke the mechanic said with the air of a man tired ofrepeating the same story to no avail the rebellion is a long way from here i doubtif the empire would fight to keep this system believe me tatooine is a big hunk ofnothing 
 his audience began to fade back into the station before luke could mutter a had his arm around camie and the two of them were chuckling over even deak and windy were murmuring among was certain 
 he followed them but not without a last glance back and up to the distant thing he was sure of were the flashes of light he had seen between the two been caused by the suns of tatooine reflecting off metal 
 the binding that locked the hands behind her back was primitive andeffective the constant attention the squad of heavily armed troopers favored herwith might have been out of place for one small female except for the fact that theirlives depended on her being delivered safely 
 when she deliberately slowed her pace however it became apparent that hercaptors did not mind mistreating her a little one of the armored figures shoved herbrutally in the small of the back and she nearly fell turning she gave the offendingsoldier a vicious look but she could not tell if it had any effect since the facewas completely hidden by his armored helmet 
 the hallway they eventually emerged into was still smoking around the edges ofthe smoldering cavity blasted through the hull of the fighter a portable accesswayhad been sealed to it and a circlet of light showed at the far end of the tunnel bridgingspace between the rebel craft and the cruiser a shadow moved over her as sheturned from inspecting the accessway startling her despite her usually 
 above her toward the threatening bulk of darth vader red eyes glaring behindthe hideous breath mask a muscle twitched in one smooth cheek but other thanthat the girl react nor was there the slightest shake in her voice 
 darth vaderi should have known only you would be so sostupid well the imperial senate will not sit still for this when they hear that youhave attacked a diplomatic miss 
 senator leia organa vader rumbled softly though strongly enough tooverride her protests his pleasure at finding her was evident in the way he savoredevery syllable 
 play games with me your highness he continued ominously on any mercy mission this time you passed directly through a restrictedsystem ignoring numerous warnings and completely disregarding orders to it no longer mattered 
 the huge metal skull dipped close i know that several transmissions werebeamed to this vessel by spies within that system when we traced thosetransmissions back to the individuals with whom they originated they had the poorgrace to kill themselves before they could be questioned i want to know whathappened to the data they sent you 
 neither words nor his inimical presence appeared to have any effect onthe girl i know what blathering about she snapped looking awayfrom him a member of the senate on a diplomatic mission to 
 to your part of the rebel alliance vader declared cutting her off also a traitor his gaze went to a nearby officer take her away 
 she succeeded in reaching him with her spit which hissed against battlearmor he wiped the offensive matter away silently watching her with interest asshe was marched through the accessway into the cruiser 
 a tall slim soldier wearing the sign of an imperial commander attracted as he came up next to him holding her is dangerous he looking after her as she was escorted toward the cruiser if word of thisdoes get out there will be much unrest in the senate it will generate sympathy forthe rebels the commander looked up at the unreadable metal face then added inan manner she should be destroyed immediately 
 no my first duty is to locate that hidden fortress of theirs vader repliedeasily all the rebel spies have been our hand or by their she is now my only key to discovering its location i intend to make fulluse of her if necessary i will use her i will learn the location of the rebelbase 
 the commander pursed his lips shook his head slightly perhaps a bitsympathetically as he considered the woman die before she gives you anyinformation reply was chilling in its indifference leave that to considered a moment then went on send out a distress that the ship encountered an unexpected meteorite cluster it couldnot avoid readings indicate that the shift shields were overridden and the ship washulled to the point of vacating percent of its atmosphere inform herfather and the senate that all aboard were killed 
 a cluster of troops marched purposefully up to their commanderand the dark lord vader eyed them expectantly 
 the data tapes in question are not aboard the ship there is no valuableinformation in the storage banks and no evidence of bank erasure the officerin charge recited mechanically nor were any transmissions directed outward fromthe ship from the time we made contact a malfunctioning lifeboat pod was ejectedduring the fighting but it was confirmed at the time that no life forms were on board 
 vader appeared thoughtful it could have been a malfunctioning pod hemused that might also have contained the tapes tapes are not life forms in allprobability any native finding them would be ignorant of their importance and wouldlikely clear them for his own use still 
 send down a detachment to retrieve them or to make certain they are not in thepod he finally ordered the commander and attentive officer be as subtle aspossible there is no need to attract attention even on this miserable outpost world 
 as the officer and troops departed vader turned his gaze back to the this want to leave anything as for the pod i cannottake the chance it was a simple malfunction the data it might contain could provetoo damaging see to this personally commander if those data tapes exist theymust be retrieved or destroyed at all costs then he added with satisfaction withthat accomplished and the senator in our hands we will see the end of this absurdrebellion 
 it shall be as you direct lord vader the commander acknowledged bothmen entered the accessway to the cruiser 
 what a forsaken place this is 
 threepio turned cautiously to look back at where the pod lay half buried in internal gyros were still unsteady from the rough landing landing mereapplication of the term unduly flattered his dull associate 
 on the other hand he supposed he ought to be grateful they had come down inone piece although he mused as he studied the barren landscape he still they were better off here than they would have been had they remained on thecaptured cruiser high sandstone mesas dominated the skyline to one side everyother direction showed only endless series of marching dunes like long yellow teethstretching for kilometer on kilometer into the distance sand ocean blended into until it was impossible to distinguish where one ended and the other began 
 a faint cloud of minute dust particles rose in their wake as the two robotsmarched away from the pod that vehicle its intended function fully now quite useless neither robot had been designed for pedal locomotion onthis kind of terrain so they had to fight their way across the unstable surface 
 we seem to have been made to suffer threepio moaned in arotten existence something squeaked in his right leg and he winced got torest before i fall apart my internals still recovered from that headlong crashyou called a landing 
 he paused but artoo detoo did not the little automation had performed asharp turn and was now ambling slowly but steadily in the direction of the nearestoutjut of mesa 
 hey threepio yelled artoo ignored the call and continued do you think you are going 
 now artoo paused emitting a stream of electronic explanation as threepioexhaustedly walked over to join him 
 well not going that way threepio declared when artoo had concluded hisexplanation too rocky he gestured in the direction they had been an angle away from the cliffs this way is much easier a metal hand waveddisparagingly at the high mesas what makes you think there are settlements thatway anyhow 
 a long whistle issued from the depths of artoo 
 get technical with me threepio warned had just about enoughof your decisions 
 artoo beeped once 
 all right go your way threepio announced grandly be sandloggedwithin a day you nearsighted scrap pile he gave the artoo unit a contemptuousshove sending the smaller robot tumbling down a slight dune as it struggled at thebottom to regain its feet threepio started off toward the blurred glaring back over his shoulder let me catch you following me begging forhelp he warned because you get it 
 below the crest of the dune the artoo unit righted itself it paused briefly toclean its single electronic eye with an auxiliary arm then it produced an electronicsqueal which was almost though not quite a human expression of rage hummingquietly to itself then it turned and trudged off toward the sandstone ridges as ifnothing had happened 
 several hours later a straining threepio his internal thermostat overloaded andedging dangerously toward overheat shutdown struggled up the top of what he hopedwas the last towering the dune nearby a pillars and buttresses of bleached bones of some enormous beast formed an unpromising landmark reaching thecrest of the dune threepio peered anxiously ahead instead of the of human civilization he saw only several dozen more dunes identical inform and promise to the one he now stood upon the farthest rose even higher thanthe one he presently surmounted 
 threepio turned and looked back toward the now rocky plateau whichwas beginning to grow indistinct with distance and heat distortion youmalfunctioning little twerp he muttered unable even now to admit to himself thatperhaps just possibly the artoo unit might have been right this is all your tricked me into going this way but do no better 
 nor would he if he continue on so he took a step forward and heardsomething grind dully within a leg joint sitting down in an electronic funk hebegan picking sand from his encrusted joints 
 he could continue on his present course he told himself or he could confessto an error in judgment and try to catch up again with artoo detoo neither prospectheld much appeal for him 
 but there was a third choice he could sit here shining in the sunlight until hisjoints locked his internals overheated and the ultraviolet burned out hisphotoreceptors he would become another monument to the destructive power ofthe binary like the colossal organism whose picked corpse he had just encountered 
 already his receptors were beginning to go he reflected it seemed he sawsomething moving in the distance heat distortion probably wasdefinitely light on metal and it was moving toward him his hopes the warnings from his damaged leg he rose and began waving frantically 
 it was he saw now definitely a vehicle though of a type unfamiliar to a vehicle it was and that implied intelligence and technology 
 he neglected in his excitement to consider the possibility that it might not be ofhuman origin 
 so i cut off my power shut down the afterburners and dropped in low tail luke finished waving his arms wildly he and biggs were walking inthe shade outside the power station sounds of metal being worked came fromsomewhere within where fixer had finally joined his robot assistant in was so close to him luke continued excitedly i thought i was going to fry myinstrumentation as it was i busted up the skyhopper pretty bad thatrecollection inspired a frown 
 uncle owen was pretty upset he grounded me for the rest of the depression was brief memory of his feat overrode its immorality 
 you should have been there biggs 
 you ought to take it a little easier his friend cautioned you may be thehottest bush pilot this side of mos eisley luke but those little skyhoppers can bedangerous they move awfully fast for tropospheric than they need playing engine jockey with one and someday whammo he slammed one fistviolently into his open palm going to be nothing more than a dark spot onthe damp side of a canyon wall 
 look talking luke retorted now that been on a few bigautomatic starships beginning to sound like my uncle gotten soft inthe cities he swung spiritedly at biggs who blocked the movement easily makinga halfhearted gesture of counterattack 
 easygoing smugness dissolved into something warmer missedyou kid 
 luke looked away embarrassed things exactly been the same sinceyou left either biggs been so luke hunted for the right word and finallyfinished helplessly so quiet his gaze traveled across the sandy deserted streets ofanchorhead its always been quiet really 
 biggs grew silent thinking he glanced around they were along out else was back inside the comparative coolness of the power station as heleaned close luke sense an unaccustomed solemness in his tone 
 luke i come back just to say or to crow over everyone becausei got through the academy again he hesitate unsure of himself then he blurtedout rapidly not giving himself a chance to back down but i want somebody to tell my parents 
 gaping at biggs luke could only gulp know what what are you talkingabout 
 talking about the talking been going on at the otherplaces luke strong talking i made some new friends outsystem friends weagreed about the way certain things are developing and his voice we reach one of the peripheral systems going to jumpship and join the alliance 
 luke stared back at his friend tried to picture patriot afire with rebellious fervor 
 going to join the rebellion he started got to be 
 damp down will you the bigger man cautioned got a mouth like acrater 
 sorry luke whispered rapidly how quiet i am youcan barely hear me 
 biggs cut him off and continued a friend of mine from the academy has afriend on bestine who might enable us to make contact with an armed rebel friend of crazy luke announced with conviction certain his friendhad gone mad you could wander around forever trying to find a real rebel of them are only myths this twice removed friend could be an imperial end up on kessel or worse if rebel outposts were so easy to find the empirewould have wiped them out years ago 
 i know a long shot biggs admitted reluctantly if i contact peculiar light came into eyes a conglomeration of newfoundmaturity andsomething do what i can on my own 
 he stared intensely at his friend luke not going to wait for the empire toconscript me into its service in spite of what you hear over the official informationchannels the rebellion is growing spreading and i want to be on the right side i believe in his voice altered unpleasantly and luke wondered what hesaw in his eye 
 you should have heard some of the stories heard luke learned of some ofthe outrages learned about the empire may have been great and beautiful the people in charge now he shook his head sharply rotten 
 and i do a damn thing luke muttered morosely stuck kicked futilely at the sand of anchorhead 
 i though you were going to enter the academy soon biggs observed so then have your chance to get off this sandpile 
 luke snorted derisively not likely i had to withdraw my application helooked away unable to meet his disbelieving stare i had to beena lot of unrest among the sandpeople since you left biggs even raided theoutskirts of anchorhead 
 biggs shook his head disregarding the excuse your uncle could hold off awhole colony of raiders with one blaster 
 from the house sure luke agreed but uncle finally got enoughvaporators installed and running to make the farm pay off big but he guard allthat land by himself and he says he needs me for one more season i run outon him now 
 biggs sighed sadly i feel for you luke someday going to have tolearn to separate what seems to be important from what really is important hegestured around them 
 what good is all your work if taken over by the empire that starting to imperialize commerce in all the outlying systems be long before your uncle and everyone else on tatooine are just tenantsslaving for the greater glory of the empire 
 that happen here luke objected with a confidence he quitefeel said it empire bother with this rock 
 things change luke only the threat is completely there aretwo things men have never been able to satisfy their curiosity and their much the high imperial bureaucrats are curious about 
 both men stood silent a sandwhirl traversed the street in silent against a wall to send newborn baby zephyrs in all directions 
 i wish i was going with you luke finally murmured he glanced up willyou be around long 
 no as a matter of fact leaving in the morning to rendezvous with theecliptic 
 then i seeing you again 
 maybe someday biggs declared he brightened grinning that disarming keep a look out for you brother try not to run into any canyon walls in themeantime 
 be at the academy the season after luke insisted more to encouragehimself than biggs after that who knows where end up he soundeddetermined i be drafted into the starfleet for sure tale care ofyourself be the best friend got there was no need for ahandshake these two had long since passed beyond that 
 so long then luke biggs said simply he turned and reentered the powerstation 
 luke watched him disappear through the door his own thoughts as chaotic andfrenetic as one of spontaneous dust storms 
 there were any numbers of extraordinary features unique to among them were the mysterious mists which rose regularly from theground at the points where desert sands washed up against unyielding cliffs and mesas 
 fog in a steaming desert seemed as out of place as cactus on a glacier but itexisted nonetheless meteorologists and geologists argued its origin amongthemselves muttering theories about water suspended in sandstoneveins beneath the sand and incomprehensible chemical reactions which made waterrise when the ground cooled then fall underground again with the double sunrise itwas all very backward and very real 
 neither the mist nor the alien moans of nocturnal desert dwellers troubled artoodetoo however as he made his careful way up the rocky arroyo hunting for theeasiest pathway to the mesa top his squarish broad footpads made clicking soundsloud in the evening light as sand underfoot gave way gradually to gravel 
 for a moment he paused he seemed to detect a metal on of him instead of rock on rock the sound repeated though and hequickly resumed his ambling ascent 
 up the arroyo too far up to be seen from below a pebble trickled loose from thestone wall the tiny figure which had accidentally dislodged the pebble into shadow two glowing points of light showed under overlappingfolds of brown cape a meter from the narrowing canyon wall 
 only the reaction of the unsuspecting robot indicated the presence of the whiningbeam as it struck him for a moment artoo detoo fluoresced eerily in the dimminglight there was a single short electronic squeak then the tripodal supportunbalanced and the tiny automation toppled over onto its back the lights on its frontblinking on and off erratically from the effects of the paralyzing beam 
 three travesties of men scurried out from behind concealing boulders theirmotions were more indicative of rodent than humankind and they stood little tallerthan the artoo unit when they saw that the single burst of enervation energy hadimmobilized the robot they holstered their peculiar weapons nevertheless theyapproached the listless machine cautiously with the trepidation of hereditary cowards 
 their cloaks were thickly coated with dust and sand unhealthy glowed catlike from the depths of their hoods as they studied their jawas conversed in low guttural croaks and scrambled analogs of human as anthropologists hypothesized they had ever been human they had long sincedegenerated past anything resembling the human race 
 several more jawas appeared together they succeeded in alternately hoistingand dragging the robot back down the arroyo 
 at the bottom of some monstrous prehistoric asandcrawler as enormous as its owners and operators were tiny several dozenmeters high the vehicle towered above the ground on multiple treads that were tallerthan a tall man its metal epidermis was battered and pitted from sandstorms 
 on reaching the crawler the jawas resumed jabbering among detoo could hear them but failed to comprehend anything he need not havebeen embarrassed at his failure if they so wished only jawas could understandother jawas for they employed a randomly variable language that drove linguists mad 
 one of them removed a small disk from a belt pouch and sealed it to the flank a large tube protruded from one side of the gargantuan vehicle theyrolled him over to it and then moved clear there was a brief moan the whoosh ofpowerful vacuum and the small robot was sucked into the bowels of the sandcrawleras neatly as a pea up a straw this part of the job completed the jawas engaged inanother bout of jabbering following which they scurried into the crawler via tubesand ladders for all the world like a nest of mice returning to their holes 
 none too gently the suction tube deposited artoo in a small cubical inaddition to varied piles of broken instruments and outright scrap a dozen or so robotsof differing shapes and sizes populated the prison a few were locked in electronicconversation others muddled aimlessly about but when artoo tumbled into thechamber one voice burst out in surprise 
 artoo you you called an excited threepio from the neardarkness he made his way over to the still immobilized repair unit and embraced itmost unmechanically spotting the small disk sealed onto side threepioturned his gaze thoughtfully down to his own chest where a similar device hadlikewise been attached 
 massive gears poorly lubricated started to move with a groaning andgrinding the monster sandcrawler turned and lumbered with relentless patience intothe desert night

 chapter iii 
 
 anna reception was in full swing the spindles hummedsteadily and ceaselessly on all sides with the exception of the whom sat only one elderly lady who with her thin careworn facewas rather out of place in this brilliant society the whole companyhad settled into three groups one chiefly masculine had formedround the abbe another of young people was grouped round thebeautiful princess helene prince daughter and the littleprincess bolkonskaya very pretty and rosy though rather too plumpfor her age the third group was gathered round mortemart and annapavlovna 
 the vicomte was a young man with soft features andpolished manners who evidently considered himself a celebrity but outof politeness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle inwhich he found himself anna pavlovna was obviously serving him upas a treat to her guests as a clever maitre serves up as aspecially choice delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seenit in the kitchen would have cared to eat so anna pavlovna servedup to her guests first the vicomte and then the abbe as peculiarlychoice morsels the group about mortemart immediately began discussingthe murder of the duc the vicomte said that the had perished by his own magnanimity and that there wereparticular reasons for hatred of him 
 ah yes do tell us all about it vicomte said anna a pleasant feeling that there was something a la louis xv inthe sound of that sentence contez nous cela vicomte 
 the vicomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of his willingnessto comply anna pavlovna arranged a group round him inviting everyoneto listen to his tale 
 the vicomte knew the duc personally whispered anna pavlovna to ofthe guests the vicomte is a wonderful raconteur said she toanother how evidently he belongs to the best society said she to athird and the vicomte was served up to the company in the choicestand most advantageous style like a joint of roast beefon a hot dish 
 the vicomte wished to begin his story and gave a subtle smile 
 come over here helene dear said anna pavlovna to thebeautiful young princess who was sitting some way off the center ofanother group 
 the princess smiled she rose with the same unchanging smile withwhich she had first entered the room the smile of a perfectlybeautiful woman with a slight rustle of her white dress trimmedwith moss and ivy with a gleam of white shoulders glossy hair andsparkling diamonds she passed between the men who made way for looking at any of them but smiling on all as if graciouslyallowing each the privilege of admiring her beautiful figure andshapely shoulders back and bosom which in the fashion of those dayswere very much exposed and she seemed to bring the glamour of aballroom with her as she moved toward anna pavlovna helene was solovely that not only did she not show any trace of coquetry but onthe contrary she even appeared shy of her unquestionable and all toovictorious beauty she seemed to wish but to be unable to diminishits effect 
 how lovely said everyone who saw her and the vicomte liftedhis shoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by somethingextraordinary when she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him alsowith her unchanging smile 
 madame i doubt my ability before such an audience said inclining his head 
 the princess rested her bare round arm on a little table andconsidered a reply unnecessary she smilingly waited all the time thestory was being told she sat upright glancing now at her beautifulround arm altered in shape by its pressure on the table now at herstill more beautiful bosom on which she readjusted a diamondnecklace from time to time she smoothed the folds of her dress andwhenever the story produced an effect she glanced at anna pavlovna atonce adopted just the expression she saw on the maid of and again relapsed into her radiant smile 
 the little princess had also left the tea table and followed helene 
 wait a moment get my work now then what are you thinkingof she went on turning to prince hippolyte fetch me my workbag 
 there was a general movement as the princess smiling and talkingmerrily to everyone at once sat down and gaily arranged herself inher seat 
 now i am all right she said and asking the vicomte to begin shetook up her work 
 prince hippolyte having brought the workbag joined the circleand moving a chair close to hers seated himself beside her 
 le charmant hippolyte was surprising by his extraordinaryresemblance to his beautiful sister but yet more by the fact thatin spite of this resemblance he was exceedingly ugly his featureswere like his but while in her case everything was lit up bya joyous youthful and constant smile of by the wonderful classic beauty of her figure his face on thecontrary was dulled by imbecility and a constant expression ofsullen while his body was thin and weak his and mouth all seemed puckered into a vacant wearied his arms and legs always fell into unnatural positions 
 not going to be a ghost story said he sitting down besidethe princess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette as if without thisinstrument he could not begin to speak 
 why no my dear fellow said the astonished narrator shrugginghis shoulders 
 because i hate ghost stories said prince hippolyte in a tonewhich showed that he only understood the meaning of his words after hehad uttered them 
 he spoke with such that his hearers could not besure whether what he said was very witty or very stupid he wasdressed in a dress coat knee breeches of the color ofcuisse de nymphe effrayee as he called it shoes and silk stockings 
 the vicomte told his tale very neatly it was an anecdote thencurrent to the effect that the duc had gone secretly toparis to visit mademoiselle george that at her house he came uponbonaparte who also enjoyed the famous actress favors and that inhis presence napoleon happened to fall into one of the fainting fitsto which he was subject and was thus at the mercy the latterspared him and this magnanimity bonaparte subsequently repaid bydeath 
 the story was very pretty and interesting especially at the pointwhere the rivals suddenly recognized one another and the ladieslooked agitated 
 charming said anna pavlovna with an inquiring glance at thelittle princess 
 charming whispered the little princess sticking the needleinto her work as if to testify that the interest and fascination ofthe story prevented her from going on with it 
 the vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefullyprepared to continue but just then anna pavlovna who had kept awatchful eye on the young man who so alarmed her noticed that hewas talking too loudly and vehemently with the abbe so she hurried tothe rescue pierre had managed to start a conversation with the abbeabout the balance of power and the latter evidently interested bythe young eagerness was explaining his pettheory both were talking and listening too eagerly and too was why anna pavlovna disapproved 
 the means are the balance of power in europe and the rights ofthe people the abbe was saying it is only necessary for onepowerful nation like russia barbaric as she is said to be to placeherself disinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for itsobject the maintenance of the balance of power of europe and it wouldsave the world 
 but how are you to get that balance pierre was beginning 
 at that moment anna pavlovna came up and looking severely atpierre asked the italian how he stood russian climate face instantly changed and assumed an offensivelyaffected sugary expression evidently habitual to him when conversingwith women 
 i am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of thesociety more especially of the feminine society in which i havehad the honor of being received that i have not yet had time to thinkof the climate said he 
 not letting the abbe and pierre escape anna pavlovna the moreconveniently to keep them under observation brought them into thelarger circle

 chapter 
 
 while leading the way upstairs she recommended that i should hide the candle and not make a noise for her master had an odd notion about the chamber she would put me in and never let anybody lodge there willingly i asked the reason she did not know she answered she had only lived there a year or two and they had so many queer goings on she could not begin to be curious 
 too stupefied to be curious myself i fastened my door and glanced round for the bed the whole furniture consisted of a chair a and a large oak case with squares cut out near the top resembling coach windows having approached this structure i looked inside and perceived it to be a singular sort of couch very conveniently designed to obviate the necessity for every member of the family having a room to himself in fact it formed a little closet and the ledge of a window which it enclosed served as a table i slid back the panelled sides got in with my light pulled them together again and felt secure against the vigilance of heathcliff and everyone else 
 the ledge where i placed my candle had a few mildewed books piled up in one corner and it was covered with writing scratched on the paint this writing however was nothing but a name repeated in all kinds of characters large and earnshaw here and there varied to catherine heathcliff and again to catherine linton 
 in vapid listlessness i leant my head against the window and continued spelling over catherine till my eyes closed but they had not rested five minutes when a glare of white letters started from the dark as vivid as air swarmed with catherines and rousing myself to dispel the obtrusive name i discovered my candle wick reclining on one of the antique volumes and perfuming the place with an odour of roasted calfskin i snuffed it off and very ill at ease under the influence of cold and lingering nausea sat up and spread open the injured tome on my knee it was a testament in lean type and smelling dreadfully musty a bore the inscription catherine earnshaw her book and a date some quarter of a century back i shut it and took up another and another till i had examined all library was select and its state of dilapidation proved it to have been well used though not altogether for a legitimate purpose scarcely one chapter had escaped a least the appearance of every morsel of blank that the printer had left some were detached sentences other parts took the form of a regular diary scrawled in an unformed childish hand at the top of an extra page quite a treasure probably when first lighted on i was greatly amused to behold an excellent caricature of my friend yet powerfully sketched an immediate interest kindled within me for the unknown catherine and i began forthwith to decipher her faded hieroglyphics 
 an awful sunday commenced the paragraph beneath i wish my father were back again hindley is a detestable substitute his conduct to heathcliff is and i are going to took our initiatory step this evening 
 all day had been flooding with rain we could not go to church so joseph must needs get up a congregation in the garret and while hindley and his wife basked downstairs before a comfortable anything but reading their bibles answer for myself and the unhappy were commanded to take our prayer books and mount we were ranged in a row on a sack of corn groaning and shivering and hoping that joseph would shiver too so that he might give us a short homily for his own sake a vain idea the service lasted precisely three hours and yet my brother had the face to exclaim when he saw us descending what done already on sunday evenings we used to be permitted to play if we did not make much noise now a mere titter is sufficient to send us into comers 
 you forget you have a master here says the tyrant demolish the first who puts me out of temper i insist on perfect sobriety and silence oh boy was that you frances darling pull his hair as you go by i heard him snap his fingers frances pulled his hair heartily and then went and seated herself on her knee and there they were like two babies kissing and talking nonsense by the palaver that we should be ashamed of we made ourselves as snug as our means allowed in the arch of the dresser i had just fastened our pinafores together and hung them up for a curtain when in comes joseph on an errand from the stables he tears down my handiwork boxes my ears and croaks 
 t maister nobbut just buried and sabbath nut und t sahnd uh t gospel still i yer lugs and yah darr be laiking shame on ye sit ye dahn ill childer good books eneugh if read em sit ye dahn and think uh yer sowls 
 saying this he compelled us so to square our positions that we might receive from the fire a dull ray to show us the text of the lumber thrust upon us i could not bear the employment i took my dingy volume by the scroop and hurled it into the dog kennel vowing i hated a good book heathcliff kicked his to the same place then there was a hubbub 
 maister hindley shouted our chaplain maister coom hither miss riven th back off th helmet uh salvation un pawsed his fit intuh t first part uh t brooad way to destruction fair flaysome ut yah let em goa on this gait ech th owd man ud uh laced em goan 
 hindley hurried up from his paradise on the hearth and seizing one of us by the collar and the other by the arm hurled both into the back kitchen where joseph asseverated owd nick would fetch us as sure as we were living and so comforted we each sought a separate nook to await his advent i reached this book and a pot of ink from a shelf and pushed the house door ajar to give me light and i have got the time on with writing for twenty minutes but my companion is impatient and proposes that we should appropriate the cloak and have a scamper on the moors under its shelter a pleasant then if the surly old man come in he may believe his prophecy cannot be damper or colder in the rain than we are here 
 
 
 i suppose catherine fulfilled her project for the next sentence took up another subject she waxed lachrymose 
 how little did i dream that hindley would ever make me cry so she wrote my head aches till i cannot keep it on the pillow and still i give over poor heathcliff hindley calls him a vagabond and let him sit with us nor eat with us any more and he says he and i must not play together and threatens to turn him out of the house if we break his orders he has been blaming our father how dared he for treating h too liberally and swears he will reduce him to his right place 
 
 i began to nod drowsily over the dim page my eye wandered from manuscript to print i saw a red ornamented times seven and the first of the a pious discourse delivered by the reverend jabes branderham in the chapel of gimmerden sough and while i was half consciously worrying my brain to guess what jabes branderham would make of his subject i sank back in bed and fell asleep alas for the effects of bad tea and bad temper what else could it be that made me pass such a terrible night i remember another that i can at all compare with it since i was capable of suffering 
 i began to dream almost before i ceased to be sensible of my locality i thought it was morning and i had set out on my way home with joseph for a guide the snow lay yards deep in our road and as we floundered on my companion wearied me with constant reproaches that i had not brought a staff telling me that i could never get into the house without one and boastfully flourishing a cudgel which i understood to be so denominated for a moment i considered it absurd that i should need such a weapon to gain admittance into my own residence then a new idea flashed across me i was not going there we were journeying to hear the famous jabes branderham preach from the times seven and either joseph the preacher or i had committed the first of the and were to be publicly exposed and excommunicated 
 we came to the chapel i have passed it really in my walks twice or thrice it lies in a hollow between two hills an elevated hollow near a swamp whose peaty moisture is said to answer all the purposes of embalming on the few corpses deposited there the roof has been kept whole hitherto but as the stipend is only twenty pounds per annum and a house with two rooms threatening speedily to determine into one no clergyman will undertake the duties of pastor especially as it is currently reported that his flock would rather let him starve than increase the living by one penny from their own pockets however in my dream jabes had a full and attentive congregation and he god what a sermon divided into four hundred and ninety parts each fully equal to an ordinary address from the pulpit and each discussing a separate sin where he searched for them i cannot tell he had his private manner of interpreting the phrase and it seemed necessary the brother should sin different sins on every occasion they were of the most curious character odd transgressions that i never imagined previously 
 oh how weary i grew how i writhed and yawned and nodded and revived how i pinched and pricked myself and rubbed my eyes and stood up and sat down again and nudged joseph to inform me if he would ever have done i was condemned hear all out finally he reached the first of the at that crisis a sudden inspiration descended on me i was moved to rise and denounce jabes branderham as the sinner of the sin that no christian need pardon 
 sir i exclaimed sitting here within these four walls at one stretch i have endured and forgiven the four hundred and ninety heads of your discourse seventy times seven times have i plucked up my hat and been about to times seven times have you preposterously forced me to resume my seat the four hundred and is too much have at him drag him down and crush him to atoms that the place which knows him may know him no more 
 thou art the man cries jabes after a solemn pause leaning over his cushion seventy times seven times didst thou gapingly contort thy times seven did i take counsel with my this is human weakness this also may be absolved the first of the is come brethren execute upon him the judgment written such honour have all his saints 
 with that concluding word the whole assembly exalting their staves rushed round me in a body and i having no weapon to raise in commenced grappling with joseph my nearest and most ferocious assailant for his in the confluence of the multitude several clubs crossed blows aimed at me fell on other sconces presently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and every hand was against his neighbour and branderham unwilling to remain idle poured forth his zeal in a shower of loud taps on the boards of the pulpit which responded so smartly that at last to my unspeakable relief they woke me and what was it that had suggested the tremendous tumult what had played part in the row merely the branch of a fir tree that touched my lattice as the blast wailed by and rattled its dry cones against the panes i listened doubtingly an instant detected the disturber then turned and dozed and dreamt again if possible still more disagreeably than before 
 this time i remembered i was lying in the oak closet and i heard distinctly the gusty wind and the driving of the snow i heard also the fir bough repeat its teasing sound and ascribed it to the right cause but it annoyed me so much that i resolved it if possible and i thought i rose and endeavoured to unhasp the casement the hook was soldered into the staple a circumstance observed by me when awake but forgotten i must stop it nevertheless i muttered knocking my knuckles through the glass and stretching an arm out to seize the importunate branch instead of which my fingers closed on the fingers of a little hand the intense horror of nightmare came over me i tried to draw back my arm but the hand clung to it and a most melancholy voice sobbed let me me in who are you i asked struggling meanwhile to disengage myself catherine linton it replied shiveringly why did i think of linton i had read earnshaw twenty times for linton come home lost my way on the moor as it spoke i discerned obscurely a face looking through the window terror made me cruel and finding it useless to attempt shaking the creature off i pulled its wrist on to the broken pane and rubbed it to and fro till the blood ran down and soaked the bedclothes still it wailed let me in and maintained its tenacious grip almost maddening me with fear how can i i said at length let me go if you want me to let you in the fingers relaxed i snatched mine through the hole hurriedly piled the books up in a pyramid against it and stopped my ears to exclude the lamentable prayer i seemed to keep them closed above a quarter of an hour yet the instant i listened again there was the doleful cry moaning on begone i shouted never let you in not if you beg for twenty years it is twenty years mourned the voice twenty years been a waif for twenty years thereat began a feeble scratching outside and the pile of books moved as if thrust forward i tried to jump up but could not stir a limb and so yelled aloud in a frenzy of fright to my confusion i discovered the yell was not ideal hasty footsteps approached my chamber door somebody pushed it open with a vigorous hand and a light glimmered through the squares at the top of the bed i sat shuddering yet and wiping the perspiration from my forehead the intruder appeared to hesitate and muttered to himself at last he said in a plainly not expecting an answer is any one here i considered it best to confess my presence for i knew accents and feared he might search further if i kept quiet with this intention i turned and opened the panels i shall not soon forget the effect my action produced 
 heathcliff stood near the entrance in his shirt and trousers with a candle dripping over his fingers and his face as white as the wall behind him the first creak of the oak startled him like an electric shock the light leaped from his hold to a distance of some feet and his agitation was so extreme that he could hardly pick it up 
 it is only your guest sir i called out desirous to spare him the humiliation of exposing his cowardice further i had the misfortune to scream in my sleep owing to a frightful nightmare sorry i disturbed you 
 oh god confound you mr lockwood i wish you were at the commenced my host setting the candle on a chair because he found it impossible to hold it steady and who showed you up into this room he continued crushing his nails into his palms and grinding his teeth to subdue the maxillary convulsions who was it a good mind to turn them out of the house this moment 
 it was your servant zillah i replied flinging myself on to the floor and rapidly resuming my garments i should not care if you did mr heathcliff she richly deserves it i suppose that she wanted to get another proof that the place was haunted at my expense well it with ghosts and goblins you have reason in shutting it up i assure you no one will thank you for a doze in such a den 
 what do you mean asked heathcliff and what are you doing lie down and finish out the night since you are here but for sake repeat that horrid noise nothing could excuse it unless you were having your throat cut 
 if the little fiend had got in at the window she probably would have strangled me i returned not going to endure the persecutions of your hospitable ancestors again was not the reverend jabes branderham akin to you on the side and that minx catherine linton or earnshaw or however she was must have been a little soul she told me she had been walking the earth these twenty years a just punishment for her mortal transgressions no doubt 
 scarcely were these words uttered when i recollected the association of with name in the had completely slipped from my memory till thus awakened i blushed at my inconsideration but without showing further consciousness of the offence i hastened to truth is sir i passed the first part of the night i stopped was about to say perusing those old volumes then it would have revealed my knowledge of their written as well as their printed contents so correcting myself i went on in spelling over the name scratched on that a monotonous occupation calculated to set me asleep like counting or 
 what can you mean by talking in this way to me thundered heathcliff with savage vehemence dare you under my mad to speak so and he struck his forehead with rage 
 i did not know whether to resent this language or pursue my explanation but he seemed so powerfully affected that i took pity and proceeded with my dreams affirming i had never heard the appellation of catherine linton before but reading it often over produced an impression which personified itself when i had no longer my imagination under control heathcliff gradually fell back into the shelter of the bed as i spoke finally sitting down almost concealed behind it i guessed however by his irregular and intercepted breathing that he struggled to vanquish an excess of violent emotion not liking to show him that i had heard the conflict i continued my toilette rather noisily looking at my watch and soliloquized on the length of the night not three yet i could have taken oath it had been six time stagnates here we must surely have retired to rest at eight 
 always at nine in winter and always rise at four said my host suppressing a groan and as i fancied by the motion of his arm dashing a tear from his eyes mr lockwood he added you may go into my room only be in the way coming downstairs so early and your childish outcry has sent sleep to the devil for me 
 and for me too i replied walk in the yard till daylight and then be off and you need not dread a repetition of my intrusion now quite cured of seeking pleasure in society be it country or town a sensible man ought to find sufficient company in himself 
 delightful company muttered heathcliff take the candle and go where you please i shall join you directly keep out of the yard though the dogs are unchained and the mounts sentinel there you can only ramble about the steps and passages but away with you come in two minutes 
 i obeyed so far as to quit the chamber when ignorant where the narrow lobbies led i stood still and was witness involuntarily to a piece of superstition on the part of my landlord which belied oddly his apparent sense he got on to the bed and wrenched open the lattice bursting as he pulled at it into an uncontrollable passion of tears come in come in he sobbed cathy do come oh more oh my darling hear me this time catherine at last the spectre showed a ordinary caprice it gave no sign of being but the snow and wind whirled wildly through even reaching my station and blowing out the light 
 there was such anguish in the gust of grief that accompanied this raving that my compassion made me overlook its folly and i drew off half angry to have listened at all and vexed at having related my ridiculous nightmare since it produced that agony though why was beyond my comprehension i descended cautiously to the lower regions and landed in the back kitchen where a gleam of fire raked compactly together enabled me to rekindle my candle nothing was stirring except a bridled grey cat which crept from the ashes and saluted me with a querulous mew 
 two benches shaped in sections of a circle nearly enclosed the hearth on one of these i stretched myself and grimalkin mounted the other we were both of us nodding ere anyone invaded our retreat and then it was joseph shuffling down a wooden ladder that vanished in the roof through a trap the ascent to his garret i suppose he cast a sinister look at the little flame which i had enticed to play between the ribs swept the cat from its elevation and bestowing himself in the vacancy commenced the operation of stuffing a pipe with tobacco my presence in his sanctum was evidently esteemed a piece of impudence too shameful for remark he silently applied the tube to his lips folded his arms and puffed away i let him enjoy the luxury unannoyed and after sucking out his last wreath and heaving a profound sigh he got up and departed as solemnly as he came 
 a more elastic footstep entered next and now i opened my mouth for a good morning but closed it again the salutation unachieved for hareton earnshaw was performing his orisons sotto voce in a series of curses directed against every object he touched while he rummaged a corner for a spade or shovel to dig through the drifts he glanced over the back of the bench dilating his nostrils and thought as little of exchanging civilities with me as with my companion the cat i guessed by his preparations that egress was allowed and leaving my hard couch made a movement to follow him he noticed this and thrust at an inner door with the end of his spade intimating by an inarticulate sound that there was the place where i must go if i changed my locality 
 it opened into the house where the females were already astir zillah urging flakes of flame up the chimney with a colossal bellows and mrs heathcliff kneeling on the hearth reading a book by the aid of the blaze she held her hand interposed between the furnace heat and her eyes and seemed absorbed in her occupation desisting from it only to chide the servant for covering her with sparks or to push away a dog now and then that snoozled its nose into her face i was surprised to see heathcliff there also he stood by the fire his back towards me just finishing a stormy scene to poor zillah who ever and anon interrupted her labour to pluck up the corner of her apron and heave an indignant groan 
 and you you broke out as i entered turning to his and employing an epithet as harmless as duck or sheep but generally represented by a dash there you are at your idle tricks again the rest of them do earn their live on my charity put your trash away and find something to do you shall pay me for the plague of having you eternally in my you hear damnable jade 
 put my trash away because you can make me if i refuse answered the young lady closing her book and throwing it on a chair but not do anything though you should swear your tongue out except what i please 
 heathcliff lifted his hand and the speaker sprang to a safer distance obviously acquainted with its weight having no desire to be entertained by a combat i stepped forward briskly as if eager to partake the warmth of the hearth and innocent of any knowledge of the interrupted dispute each had enough decorum to suspend further hostilities heathcliff placed his fist out of temptation in his pockets mrs heathcliff curled her lip and walked to a seat far off where she kept her word by playing the part of a statue during the remainder of my stay that was not long i declined joining their breakfast and at the first gleam of dawn took an opportunity of escaping into the free air now clear and still and cold as impalpable ice 
 my landlord hallooed for me to stop ere i reached the bottom of the garden and offered to accompany me across the moor it was well he did for the whole was one billowy white ocean the swells and falls not indicating corresponding rises and depressions in the ground many pits at least were filled to a level and entire ranges of mounds the refuse of the quarries blotted from the chart which my walk left pictured in my mind i had remarked on one side of the road at intervals of six or seven yards a line of upright stones continued through the whole length of the barren these were erected and daubed with lime on purpose to serve as guides in the dark and also when a fall like the present confounded the deep swamps on either hand with the firmer path but excepting a dirty dot pointing up here and there all traces of their existence had vanished and my companion found it necessary to warn me frequently to steer to the right or left when i imagined i was following correctly the windings of the road we exchanged little conversation and he halted at the entrance of thrushcross park saying i could make no error there our adieux were limited to a hasty bow and then i pushed forward trusting to my own resources for the lodge is untenanted as yet the distance from the gate to the grange is two miles i believe i managed to make it four what with losing myself among the trees and sinking up to the neck in snow a predicament which only those who have experienced it can appreciate at any rate whatever were my wanderings the clock chimed twelve as i entered the house and that gave exactly an hour for every mile of the usual way from wuthering heights 
 my human fixture and her satellites rushed to welcome me exclaiming tumultuously they had completely given me up everybody conjectured that i perished last night and they were wondering how they must set about the search for my remains i bid them be quiet now that they saw me returned and benumbed to my very heart i dragged upstairs whence after putting on dry clothes and pacing to and fro thirty or forty minutes to restore the animal heat i am adjourned to my study feeble as a kitten almost too much so to enjoy the cheerful fire and smoking coffee which the servant has prepared for my refreshment

 chapter three 
 
 jo jo where are you cried meg at the foot of the garret stairs 
 here answered a husky voice from above and running up meg found her sister eating apples and crying over the heir of redclyffe wrapped up in a comforter on an old sofa by the sunny window this was favorite refuge and here she loved to retire with half a dozen russets and a nice book to enjoy the quiet and the society of a pet rat who lived near by and mind her a particle as meg appeared scrabble whisked into his hole jo shook the tears off her cheeks and waited to hear the news 
 such fun only see a regular note of invitation from mrs gardiner for tomorrow night cried meg waving the precious paper and then proceeding to read it with girlish delight 
 mrs gardiner would be happy to see miss march and miss josephine at a little dance on new eve marmee is willing we should go now what shall we wear 
 the use of asking that when you know we shall wear our poplins because we got anything else answered jo with her mouth full 
 if i only had a silk sighed meg mother says i may when eighteen perhaps but two years is an everlasting time to wait 
 sure our pops look like silk and they are nice enough for us yours is as good as new but i forgot the burn and the tear in mine whatever shall i do the burn shows badly and i take any out 
 you must sit still all you can and keep your back out of sight the front is all right i shall have a new ribbon for my hair and marmee will lend me her little pearl pin and my new slippers are lovely and my gloves will do though they as nice as like 
 mine are spoiled with lemonade and i get any new ones so i shall have to go without said jo who never troubled herself much about dress 
 you must have gloves or i go cried meg decidedly gloves are more important than anything else you dance without them and if you i should be so mortified then stay still i care much for company dancing no fun to go sailing round i like to fly about and cut capers 
 you ask mother for new ones they are so expensive and you are so careless she said when you spoiled the others that she get you any more this winter you make them do 
 i can hold them crumpled up in my hand so no one will know how stained they are all i can do no tell you how we can manage each wear one good one and carry a bad one you see 
 your hands are bigger than mine and you will stretch my glove dreadfully began meg whose gloves were a tender point with her 
 then go without i care what people say cried jo taking up her book 
 you may have it you may only stain it and do behave nicely put your hands behind you or stare or say christopher columbus will you 
 worry about me be as prim ad i can and not get into any scrapes if i can help it now go and answer your note and let me finish this splendid story 
 so meg went away to accept with thanks look over her dress and sing blithely as she did up her one real lace frill while jo finished her story her four apples and had a game of romps with scrabble 
 on new eve the parlor was deserted for the two younger girls played dressing maids and the two elder were absorbed in the business of getting ready for the party simple as the toilets were there was a great deal of running up and down laughing and talking and at one time a strong smell of burned hair pervaded the house meg wanted a few curls about her face and jo undertook to pinch the papered locks with a pair of hot tongs 
 ought they to smoke like that asked beth from her perch on the bed 
 the dampness drying replied jo 
 what a queer smell like burned feathers observed amy smoothing her own pretty curls with a superior air 
 there now take off the papers and see a cloud of little ringlets said jo putting down the tongs 
 she did take off the papers but no cloud of ringlets appeared for the hair came with the papers and the horrified hairdresser laid a row of little scorched bundles on the bureau before her victim 
 oh oh oh what have you done spoiled i go my hair oh my hair wailed meg looking with despair at the uneven frizzle on her forehead 
 just my luck you have asked me to do it i always spoil everything so sorry but the tongs were too hot and so made a mess groaned poor jo regarding the little black pancakes with tears of regret 
 it spoiled just frizzle it and tie your ribbon so the ends come on your forehead a bit and it will look like the last fashion seen many girls do it so said amy consolingly 
 serves me right for trying to be fine i wish let my hair alone cried meg petulantly 
 so do i it was so smooth and pretty but it will soon grow out again said beth coming to kiss and comfort the shorn sheep 
 after various lesser mishaps meg was finished at last and by the united exertions of the entire family hair was got up and her dress on they looked very well in their simple suits in silvery drab with a blue velvet snood lace frills and the pearl pin jo in maroon with a stiff gentlemanly linen collar and a white chrysanthemum or two for her only ornament each put on one nice light glove and carried one soiled one and all pronounced the effect quite easy and fine slippers were very tight and hurt her though she would not own it and nineteen hairpins all seemed stuck straight into her head which was not exactly comfortable but dear me let us be elegant or die 
 have a good time dearies said mrs march as the sisters went daintily down the walk eat much supper and come away at eleven when i send hannah for you as the gate clashed behind them a voice cried from a window 
 girls girls have you you both got nice pocket handkerchiefs 
 yes yes spandy nice and meg has cologne on hers cried jo adding with a laugh as they went on i do believe marmee would ask that if we were all running away from an earthquake 
 it is one of her aristocratic tastes and quite proper for a real lady is always known by neat boots gloves and handkerchief replied meg who had a good many little aristocratic tastes of her own 
 now forget to keep the bad breadth out of sight jo is my sash right and does my hair look very bad said meg as she turned from the glass in mrs dressing room after a prolonged prink 
 i know i shall forget if you see me doing anything wrong just remind me by a wink will you returned jo giving her collar a twitch and her head a hasty brush 
 no winking ladylike lift my eyebrows if any thing is wrong and nod if you are all right now hold your shoulder straight and take short steps and shake hands if you are introduced to anyone it the thing 
 how do you learn all the proper ways i never can that music gay 
 down they went feeling a trifle timid for they seldom went to parties and informal as this little gathering was it was an event to them mrs gardiner a stately old lady greeted them kindly and handed them over to the eldest of her six daughters meg knew sallie and was at her ease very soon but jo who care much for girls or girlish gossip stood about with her back carefully against the wall and felt as much out of place as a colt in a flower garden half a dozen jovial lads were talking about skates in another part of the room and she longed to go and join them for skating was one of the joys of her life she telegraphed her wish to meg but the eyebrows went up so alarmingly that she dared not stir no one came to talk to her and one by one the group dwindled away till she was left alone she could not roam about and amuse herself for the burned breadth would show so she stared at people rather forlornly till the dancing began meg was asked at once and the tight slippers tripped about so briskly that none would have guessed the pain their wearer suffered smilingly jo saw a big red headed youth approaching her corner and fearing he meant to engage her she slipped into a curtained recess intending to peep and enjoy herself in peace unfortunately another bashful person had chosen the same refuge for as the curtain fell behind her she found herself face to face with the laurence boy 
 dear me i know anyone was here stammered jo preparing to back out as speedily as she had bounced in 
 but the boy laughed and said pleasantly though he looked a little startled mind me stay if you like 
 i disturb you 
 not a bit i only came here because i know many people and felt rather strange at first you know 
 so did i go away please unless rather 
 the boy sat down again and looked at his pumps till jo said trying to be polite and easy i think had the pleasure of seeing you before you live near us you 
 next door and he looked up and laughed outright for prim manner was rather funny when he remembered how they had chatted about cricket when he brought the cat home 
 that put jo at her ease and she laughed too as she said in her heartiest way we did have such a good time over your nice christmas present 
 grandpa sent it 
 but you put it into his head you now 
 how is your cat miss march asked the boy trying to look sober while his black eyes shone with fun 
 nicely thank you mr laurence but i am not miss march only jo returned the young lady 
 not mr laurence only laurie 
 laurie laurence what an odd name 
 my first name is theodore but i like it for the fellows called me dora so i made the say laurie instead 
 i hate my name too so sentimental i wish every one would say jo instead of josephine how did you make the boys stop calling you dora 
 i thrashed em 
 i thrash aunt march so i suppose i shall have to bear it and jo resigned herself with a sigh 
 you like to dance miss jo asked laurie looking as if he thought the name suited her 
 i like it well enough if there is plenty of room and everyone is lively in a place like this sure to upset something tread on toes or do something dreadful so i keep out of mischief and let meg sail about you dance 
 sometimes you see been abroad a good many years and been into company enough yet to know how you do things here 
 abroad cried jo oh tell me about it i love dearly to hear people describe their travels 
 laurie seem to know where to begin but eager questions soon set him going and he told her how he had been at school in vevay where the boys never wore hats and had a fleet of boats on the lake and for holiday fun went on walking trips about switzerland with their teachers 
 i wish been there cried jo did you go to paris 
 we spent last winter there 
 can you talk french 
 we were not allowed to speak anything else at vevay 
 do say some i can read it but pronounce 
 quel nom a cetter jeune demoiselle en les pantoulles jolis 
 how nicely you do it let me said who is the young lady in the pretty slippers you 
 oui mademoiselle 
 my sister margaret and you knew it was do you think she is pretty 
 yes she makes me think of the german girls she looks so fresh and quiet and dances like a lady 
 jo quite glowed with pleasure at this boyish praise of her sister and stored it up to repeat to meg both peeped and critisized and chatted till they felt like old acquaintances bashfulness soon wore off for gentlemanly demeanor amused and set him at his ease and jo was her merry self again because her dress was forgotten and nobody lifted their eyebrows at her she liked the laurence boy better than ever and took several good looks at him so that she might describe him to the girls for they had no brothers very few male cousins and boys were almost unknown creatures to them 
 curly black hair brown skin big black eyes handsome nose fine teeth small hands and feet taller than i am very polite for a boy and altogether jolly wonder how old he is 
 it was on the tip of tongue to ask but she checked herself in time and with unusual tact tried to find out in a way 
 i suppose you are going to college soon i see you pegging away at your books no i mean studying hard and jo blushed at the dreadful pegging which had escaped her 
 laurie smiled but seem shocked and answered with a shrug not for a year or two i go before seventeen anyway 
 you but fifteen asked jo looking at the tall lad whom she had imagined seventeen already 
 sixteen next month 
 how i wish i was going to college you look as if you liked it 
 i hate it nothing but grinding or skylarking and i like the way fellows do either in this country what do you like 
 to live in italy and to enjoy myself in my own way 
 jo wanted very much to ask what his own way was but his black brows looked rather threatening as he knit them so she changed the subject by saying as her foot kept time a splendid polka why you go and try it 
 if you will come too he answered with a gallant little bow 
 i for i told meg i because there jo stopped and looked undecided whether to tell or to laugh 
 because what 
 you tell 
 never 
 well i have a bad trick of standing before the fire and so i burn my frocks and i scorched this one and though nicely mended it shows and meg told me to keep still so no one would see it you may laugh if you want to it is funny i know 
 but laurie laugh he only looked dawn a minute and the expression of his face puzzled jo when he said very gently never mind that tell you how we can manage a long hall out there and we can dance grandly and no one will see us please come 
 jo thanked him and gladly went wishing she had two neat gloves when she saw the nice ones her partner wore the hall was empty and they had a grand polka for laurie danced well and taught her the german step which delighted jo being full of swing and spring when the music stopped they sat down on the stairs to get their breath and laurie was in the midst of an account of a students festival at heidelberg when meg appeared in search of her sister she beckoned and jo reluctantly followed her into a side room where she found her on a sofa holding her foot and looking pale 
 sprained my ankle that stupid high heel turned and gave me a sad wrench it aches so i can hardly stand and i know how ever going to get home she said rocking to and fro in pain 
 i knew hurt your feet with those silly shoes sorry but i see what you can do except get a carriage or stay here all night answered jo softly rubbing the poor ankle as she spoke 
 i have a carriage without its costing ever so much i dare say i get one at all for most people come in their own and a long way to the stable and no one to send 
 go 
 no indeed past nine and dark as egypt i stop here for the house is full sallie has some girls staying with her rest till hannah comes and then do the best i can 
 ask laurie he will go said jo looking relieved as the idea occurred to her 
 mercy no ask or tell anyone get me my rubbers and put these slippers with our things i dance anymore but as soon as supper is over watch for hannah and tell me the minute she are going out to supper now stay with you rather 
 
 no dear run along and bring me some coffee so tired i stir so meg reclined with rubbers well hidden and jo went blundering away to the dining room which she found after going into a china closet and opening the door of a room where old mr gardiner was taking a little private refreshment making a dart at the table she secured the coffee which she immediately spilled thereby making the front of her dress as bad as the back 
 oh dear what a blunderbuss i am exclaimed jo finishing glove by scrubbing her gown with it 
 can i help you said a friendly voice and there was laurie with a full cup in one hand and a plate of ice in the other 
 i was trying to get something for meg who is very tired and someone shook me and here i am in a nice state answered jo glancing dismally from the stained skirt to the glove 
 too bad i was looking for someone to give this to may i take it to your sister 
 oh thank you show you where she is i offer to take it myself for i should only get into another scrape if i did 
 jo led the way and as if used to waiting on ladies laurie drew up a little table brought a second installment of coffee and ice for jo and was so obliging that even particular meg pronounced him a nice boy they had a merry time over the bonbons and mottoes and were in the midst of a quiet game of buzz with two or thre other young people who had strayed in when hannah appeared meg forgot her foot and rose so quickly that she was forced to catch hold of jo with an exclamation of pain 
 hush say anything she whispered adding aloud nothing i turned my foot a little all and limped upstairs to put her things on 
 hannah scolded meg cried and jo was at her wits end till se decided to take things into her own hands slipping out she ran down and finding a servant asked if he could get her a carriage it happened to be a hired waiter who knew nothing about the neighborhood and jo was looking round for help when laurie who had heard what she said came up and offered his carriage which had just come for him he said 
 so early you mean to go yet began jo looking relieved but hesitating to accept the offer 
 i always go early i do truly please let me take you home all on my way you know and it rains they say 
 that settled it and telling him of mishap jo gratefully accepted and rushed up to bring down the rest of the party hannah hated rain as much as a cat does so she made no trouble and they rolled away in the luxurious close carriage feeling very festive and elegant laurie went on the box so meg could keep her foot up and the girls talked over their party in freedom 
 i had a capital time did you asked jo rumpling up her hair and making herself comfortable 
 yes till i hurt myself friend annie moffat took a fancy to me and asked me to come and spend a week with her when sallie does she is going in the spring when the opera comes and it will be perfectly splendid if mother only lets me go answered meg cheering up at the thought 
 i saw you dancing with the red headed man i ran away from was he nice 
 oh very his hair is auburn not red and he was very polite and i had a delicious redowa with him 
 he looked like a grasshopper in a fit when he did the new step laurie and i help laughing did you hear us 
 no but it was very rude what were you about all that time hidden away there 
 jo told her adventures and by the time she had finished they were at home with many thanks they said good night and crept in hoping to disturb no one but the instant their door creaked two little nightcaps bobbed up and two sleepy but eager voices cried out 
 tell about the party tell about the party 
 with what meg called a great want of manners jo had saved some bonbons for the little girls and they soon subsided after hearing the most thrilling events of the evening 
 i declare it really seems like being a fine young lady to come home from the party in a carriage and sit in my dressing gown wit a maid to wait on me said meg as jo bound up her foot with arnica and brushed her hair 
 i believe fine young ladies enjoy themselves a bit more than we do in spite of our burned hair old gowns one glove apiece and tight slippers that sprain our ankles when we are silly enough to wear them and i think jo was quite right

 she will die in the desert 
 curator 
 no she has seen too much she 
 knows too much 
 the curator leans across his desk fear in his eyes 
 curator 
 not only does she have a map 
 but she has the key 
 spooks the hell out of the mumia guys 
 hook 
 the key she has the lost key 
 curator 
 yes no one has ever had so much 
 been so close we must stop her 
 or it will be the end of us all 
 hook 
 then we will kill her we will 
 kill her and all those with her 
 curator 
 and burn the map and retrieve the key 
 hook 
 it will be done but what of 
 the american expedition they 
 leave tomorrow as well 
 curator 
 forget the bumbling americans 
 they will be like all the others 
 without the map to guide them how 
 can they possibly find hamunaptra 
 ext giza port day 
 smash cut to our old traitorous friend beni 
 beni 
 it is three days down the nile 
 then two days by camel sahibs 
 we crane back to reveal beni standing on the bow of a 
 passenger barge surrounded by daniels henderson and burns 
 daniels 
 for all the money paying 
 you something better 
 well be under that sand 
 we keep craning back as henderson slaps daniels on the back 
 henderson 
 hamunaptra daniels 
 all ya gotta keep sayin to 
 yourself hamunaptra 
 now we see all of giza port team of explorers swarm the 
 docks across the nile the pyramids spike the sky evelyn 
 and jonathan walk along the boardwalk besieged by hawkers 
 selling everything from toy tombs to king tut action figures 
 evelyn 
 do you really think show up 
 jonathan 
 undoubtedly i know the breed 
 he may be a cowboy but his 
 word is his word 
 evelyn 
 personally i think filthy 
 rude and a complete scoundrel 
 i like him one bit 
 
 anyone i know 
 they both turn walks up shaved showered spit 
 and polished with a new haircut and clothes he looks more 
 dashing and handsome than ever evelyn is suitably impressed 
 evelyn 
 oh 
 jonathan grabs arm and shakes his hand 
 jonathan 
 smashing day for the start of 
 an adventure eh 
 quickly checks his pockets 
 
 yeah sure smashing 
 he finds his wallet and relaxes directly above him on the 
 bow of the barge burns wipes his bifocals and turns to beni 
 burns 
 sure hamunaptra is out there 
 beni 
 along with the scorched bones 
 of my entire garrison sahib 
 and when beni spots beni shakes his head 
 as if seeing a mirage then starts backing away from the men 
 beni 
 a thousand pardons my good sahibs 
 but there is much work to be done 
 beni quickly scurries off vanishing down into the hold 
 back down with evelyn recovering she clears her throat 
 evelyn 
 mister can you look 
 me in the eye and guarantee me 
 this is not some sort of flimflam 
 because if it is warning you 
 steps up close to evelyn invading her space 
 looks her straight in the eye evelyn back away 
 
 all i can tell you miss is that my 
 colonel found that map in an ancient 
 fortress and the whole damn garrison 
 believed in it so much that without 
 orders we marched halfway across 
 libya and into egypt to find that city 
 like i told ya all i saw was sand 
 everybody else was by 
 tuareg warriors take your bags 
 takes her bags and heads up the gangplank and onto 
 the same passenger barge that beni and the americans are on 
 eyes follow him a bit wistfully jonathan sees it 
 jonathan 
 yes yes right filthy 
 rude a complete scoundrel 
 nothing to like there at all 
 evelyn gives him a look jonathan just grins and when 
 the warden suddenly brushes past tipping his raggedy hat 
 warden 
 a bright good morning to all 
 evelyn 
 what are you doing here 
 warden 
 i have come to protect my 
 investment thank you very much 
 and up the plank he goes evelyn and jonathan share a look 
 we go wide again as the barge pulls out and heads down the 
 nile we tilt up to the sun which then dissolves into 
 ext river nile night 
 the moon shining down on the desert the three vicious 
 mumia quietly glide a narrow skiff out onto the river the 
 one with the hook sits in the middle of the skiff the other 
 two row heading for the passenger barge coming their way 
 ext the bar at the bow night 
 jonathan and the three americans are playing poker 
 comes out a door carrying a 
 jonathan 
 sit down sit down 
 we could use another good player 
 
 i only gamble with my life 
 never my money 
 daniels 
 never what if i were to wager 
 five hundred dollars says we 
 get to hamunaptra before you 
 returns cocky look 
 
 
 yer on 
 burns slips on his dirty bifocals 
 burns 
 what makes you so confident sir 
 
 what makes you 
 henderson spits a wad of chew into a spittoon 
 henderson 
 we got us a man actually been there 
 poker face drops perplexed same with jonathan 
 jonathan 
 i say what a coincidence why 
 accidentally hits him in the ribs with the 
 shutting him up jonathan quickly covers 
 jonathan 
 whose deal is it is it my deal 
 i thought i just dealt 
 ext barge night 
 evelyn sits on a table staring out over the passing river 
 the drops onto the table startling her 
 
 sorry mean to scare ya 
 elvelyn 
 the only thing that scares me 
 mister are your manners 
 
 still angry that i kissed ya huh 
 evelyn 
 if you call that a kiss 
 reaches into the and starts pulling out 
 revolvers pistols hunting knives a massive elephant gun 
 and a half dozen carefully wrapped sticks of dynamite 
 evelyn 
 did i miss something are we 
 going into battle 
 
 the last time i was at that place 
 everybody i was with died 
 this takes the smile off face starts 
 dismantling and cleaning the guns 
 
 something out there you 
 know something under that sand 
 evelyn 
 yes hoping to find a certain 
 artifact a book actually my 
 brother thinks treasure 
 what do you think is out there 
 looks into eyes 
 
 evil the tuaregs and the bedouin 
 believe that hamunaptra is cursed 
 they call it the doorway to hell 
 evelyn 
 ahmar is ossirion passageway 
 to the underworld actually 
 she gives him a grin 
 evelyn 
 i believe in fairy tales 
 and hokum mister connell but 
 i do believe that one of the most 
 famous books in history is buried 
 out there the book of the living 
 what first interested me in 
 egypt as a child why i came 
 here sort of a pursuit 
 
 and the fact that they say 
 made out of pure gold makes no 
 nevermind to you right 
 evelyn is surprised by his knowledge 
 evelyn 
 you know your history 
 
 i know my treasure 
 
 evelyn gets up to go then she hesitates nervous she turns 
 back to and as as possible says 
 evelyn 
 by the way why did you kiss me 
 cleaning his guns just shrugs his shoulders 
 
 i was about to be hanged seemed 
 like a good idea at the time 
 eyes widen furious she turns and storms off 
 looks up watching her leave a bit perplexed 
 
 what i say 
 then he hears someone snickering under the table he quickly 
 reaches down grabs that someone and lifts him up beni 
 beni 
 my very good friend what a surprise 
 
 why if it my little buddy 
 beni i outta kill you 
 sticks a knife under throat beni swallows 
 hard then tries to weasel his way out with a big grin 
 beni 
 you never were any good with 
 the ladies 
 
 so the one leading the 
 americans i shoulda figured 
 so the scam you get em 
 out in the middle of the desert 
 then leave em to rot 
 beni 
 unfortunately no these americans 
 are smart they pay me only half 
 now half when i get them back to 
 cairo so i must go all the way 
 pulls the knife away beni relaxes rubs his neck 
 beni 
 you never believed in hamunaptra 
 why are you going back 
 the devil himself lives out there 
 
 they look as they hear evelyn yelp a single camel in the 
 horse paddock takes another bite at her she yelps again and 
 backs away grins as evelyn flees down the deck 
 
 the girl saved my life figured 
 it was the least i could do 
 keep her out of trouble 
 beni 
 you always did have more balls 
 than brains 
 eyes narrow at the insult he looks back at beni 
 
 make us even shall we 
 beni 
 even 
 grabs him and chucks him over the side of the 
 barge beni splashes into the river takes his 
 and starts walking off down the deck 
 
 i am going to kill 
 you for this 
 
 sounds familiar 
 and when he spots three sets of wet footprints coming 
 up over the railing from the river and heading down the deck 
 quickly looks around immediately on the alert

 chapter 
 
 the dominant primordial beast 
 
 
 the dominant primordial beast was strong in buck and under the fierce conditions of trail life it grew and grew yet it was a secret growth his newborn cunning gave him poise and control he was too busy adjusting himself to the new life to feel at ease and not only did he not pick fights but he avoided them whenever possible a certain deliberateness characterized his attitude he was not prone to rashness and precipitate action and in the bitter hatred between him and spitz he betrayed no impatience shunned all offensive acts 
 on the other hand possibly because he divined in buck a dangerous rival spitz never lost an opportunity of showing his teeth he even went out of his way to bully buck striving constantly to start the fight which could end only in the death of one or the other 
 early in the trip this might have taken place had it not been for an unwonted accident at the end of this day they made a bleak and miserable camp on the shore of lake le barge driving snow a wind that cut like a knife and darkness had forced them to grope for a camping place they could hardly have fared worse at their backs rose a perpendicular wall of rock and perrault and francois were compelled to make their fire and spread their sleeping robes on the ice of the lake itself the tent they had discarded at yea in order to travel light a few sticks of driftwood furnished them with a fire that thawed down through the ice and left them to eat supper in the dark 
 close in under the sheltering rock buck made his nest so snug and warm was it that he was loath to leave it when francois distributed the fish which he had first thawed over the fire but when buck finished his ration and returned he found his nest occupied a warning snarl told him that the trespasser was spitz till now buck had avoided trouble with his enemy but this was too much the beast in him roared he sprang upon spitz with a fury which surprised them both and spitz particularly for his whole experience with buck had gone to teach him that his rival was an unusually timid dog who managed to hold his own only because of his great weight and size 
 francois was surprised too when they shot out in a tangle from the disrupted nest and he divined the cause of the trouble he cried to buck give it to him by gar give it to him the dirty thief 
 spitz was equally willing he was crying with sheer rage and eagerness as he circled back and forth for a chance to spring in buck was no less eager and no less cautious as he likewise circled back and forth for the advantage but it was then that the unexpected happened the thing which projected their struggle for supremacy far into the future past many a weary mile of trail and toil 
 an oath from perrault the resounding impact of a club upon a bony frame and a shrill yelp of pain heralded the breaking forth of pandemonium the camp was suddenly discovered to be alive with skulking furry huskies four or five score of them who had scented the camp from some indian village they had crept in while buck and spitz were fighting and when the two men sprang among them with stout clubs they showed their teeth and fought back they were crazed by the smell of the food perrault found one with head buried in the his club landed heavily on the gaunt ribs and the was capsized on the ground on the instant a score of the famished brutes were scrambling for the bread and bacon the clubs fell upon them unheeded they yelped and howled under the rain of blows but struggled none the less madly till the last crumb had been devoured 
 in the meantime the astonished had burst out of their nests only to be set upon by the fierce invaders never had buck seen such dogs it seemed as though their bones would burst through their skins they were mere skeletons draped loosely in draggled hides with blazing eyes and slavered fangs but the made them terrifying irresistible there was no opposing them the were swept back against the cliff at the first onset buck was beset by three huskies and in a trice his head and shoulders were ripped and slashed the din was frightful billee was crying as usual dave and dripping blood from a score of wounds were fighting bravely side by side joe was snapping like a demon once his teeth closed on the fore leg of a husky and he crunched down through the bone pike the malingerer leaped upon the crippled animal breaking its neck with a quick flash of teeth and a jerk buck got a frothing adversary by the throat and was sprayed with blood when his teeth sank through the jugular the warm taste of it in his mouth goaded him to greater fierceness he flung himself upon another and at the same time felt teeth sink into his own throat it was spitz treacherously attacking from the side 
 perrault and francois having cleaned out their part of the camp hurried to save their the wild wave of famished beasts rolled back before them and buck shook himself free but is was only for a moment the two men were compelled to run back to save the grub upon which the huskies returned to the attack on the team billee terrified into bravery sprang through the savage circle and fled away over the ice pike and dub followed on his heels with the rest of the team behind as buck drew himself together to spring after them out of the tail of his eye he saw spitz rush upon him with the evident intention of overthrowing him once off his feet and under that mass of huskies there was no hope for him but he braced himself to the shock of charge then joined the flight out on the lake 
 later the nine gathered together and sought shelter in the forest though unpursued they were in a sorry plight there was not one who was not wounded in four or five places while some were wounded grievously dub was badly injured in a hind leg dolly the last husky added to the team at yea had a badly torn throat joe had lost an eye while billee the with an ear chewed and rent to ribbons cried and whimpered throughout the night at daybreak they limped warily back to camp to find the marauders gone and the two men in bad tempers fully half their grub supply was gone the huskies had chewed through the sled lashings and canvas coverings in fact nothing no matter how remotely eatable had escaped them they had eaten a pair of moccasins chunks out of the leather traces and even two feet of lash from the end of whip he broke from a mournful contemplation of it to look over his wounded dogs 
 ah my friends he said softly mebbe it make you mad dog those many bites mebbe all mad dog sacredam what you think eh perrault 
 the courier shook his head dubiously with four hundred miles of trail still between him and dawson he could ill afford to have madness break out among his dogs two hours of cursing and exertion got the harnesses into shape and the team was under way struggling painfully over the hardest part of the trail they had yet encountered and for that matter the hardest between them and dawson 
 the thirty mile river was wide open its wild water defied the frost and it was in the eddies only and in the quiet places that the ice held at all six days of exhausting toil were required to cover those thirty terrible miles and terrible they were for every foot of them was accomplished at the risk of life to dog and man a dozen times perrault nosing the way broke through the ice bridges being saved by the long pole he carried which he so held that it fell each time across the hole made by his body but a cold snap was on the thermometer registering fifty below zero and each time he broke through he was compelled for very life to build a fire and dry his garments 
 nothing daunted him it was because nothing daunted him that he had been chosen for government courier he took all manner of risks resolutely thrusting his little weazened face into the frost and struggling on from dim dawn to dark he skirted the frowning shores on rim ice that bent and crackled under foot and upon which they dared not halt once the sled broke through with dave and buck and they were and all but drowned by the time they were dragged out the usual fire was necessary to save them they were coated solidly with ice and the two men kept them on the run around the fire sweating and thawing so close that they were singed by the flames 
 at another time spitz went through dragging the whole team after him up to buck who strained backward with all his strength his fore paws on the slippery edge and the ice quivering and snapping all around but behind him was dave likewise straining backward and behind the sled was francois pulling till his tendons cracked 
 again the rim ice broke away before and behind and there was no escape except up the cliff perrault scaled it by a miracle while francois prayed for just that miracle and with every thong and sled lashing and the last bit of harness rove into a long rope the dogs were hoisted one by one to the cliff crest francois came up last after the sled and load then came the search for a place to descend which descent was ultimately made by the aid of the rope and night found them back on the river with a quarter of a mile to the credit 
 by the time they made the hootalinqua and good ice buck was played out the rest of the dogs were in like condition but perrault to make up lost time pushed them late and early the first day they covered miles to the big salmon the next day more to the little salmon the third day forty miles which brought them well up toward the five fingers 
 feet were not so compact and hard as the feet of the huskies his had softened during the many generations since the day his last wild ancestor was tamed by a cave dweller or river man all day long he limped in agony and camp once made lay down like a dead dog hungry as he was he would not move to receive his ration of fish which francois had to bring to him also the rubbed feet for half an hour each night after supper and sacrificed the tops of his own moccasins to make four moccasins for buck this was a great relief and buck caused even the weazened face of perrault to twist itself into a grin one morning when francois forgot the moccasins and buck lay on his back his four feet waving appealingly in the air and refused to budge without them later his feet grew hard to the trail and the footgear was thrown away 
 at the pelly one morning as they were harnessing up dolly who had never been conspicuous for anything went suddenly mad she announced her condition by a long wolf howl that sent every dog bristling with fear then sprang straight for buck he had never seen a dog go mad nor did he have any reason to fear madness yet he knew that here was horror and fled away from it in a panic straight away he raced with dolly panting and frothing one leap behind nor could she gain on him so great was his terror nor could he leave her so great was her madness he plunged through the wooded breast of the island flew down to the lower end crossed a back channel filled with rough ice to another island gained a third island curved back to the main river and in desperation started to cross it and all the time though he did not look he could hear her snarling just one leap behind francois called to him a quarter of a mile away and he doubled back still one leap ahead gasping painfully for air and putting all his faith in that francois would save him the held the axe poised in his hand and as buck shot past him the axe crashed down upon mad head 
 buck staggered over against the sled exhausted sobbing for breath helpless this was opportunity he sprang upon buck and twice his teeth sank into his unresisting foe and ripped and tore the flesh to the bone then francois lash descended and buck had the satisfaction of watching spitz receive the worst whipping as yet administered to any of the team 
 one devil dat spitz remarked perrault some dam day him kill dat buck 
 dat buck two devils was rejoinder all de time i watch dat buck i know for sure lissen some dam fine day him get mad like hell and den him chew dat spitz all up and spit him out on de snow sure i know 
 from then on it was war between them spitz as and acknowledged master of the team felt his supremacy threatened by this strange southland and strange buck was to him for of the many southland dogs he had known not one had shown up worthily in camp and on trail they were all too soft dying under the toil the frost and starvation buck was the exception he alone endured and prospered matching the husky in strength savagery and then he was a masterful dog and what made him dangerous was the fact that the club of the man in the red sweater had knocked all blind pluck and rashness out of his desire for mastery he was preeminently cunning and could bide his time with a patience that was nothing less than primitive 
 it was inevitable that the clash for leadership should come buck wanted it he wanted it because it was his nature because he had been gripped tight by that nameless incomprehensible pride of the trail and pride which holds dogs in the toil to the last gasp which lures them to die joyfully in the harness and breaks their hearts if they are cut out of the harness this was the pride of dave as of as he pulled with all his strength the pride that laid hold of them at break of camp transforming them from sour and sullen brutes into straining eager ambitious creatures the pride that spurred them on all day and dropped them at pitch of camp at night letting them fall back into gloomy unrest and discontent this was the pride that bore up spitz and made him thrash the who blundered and shirked in the traces or hid away at time in the morning likewise it was this pride that made him fear buck as a possible and this was pride too 
 he openly threatened the leadership he came between him and the shirks he should have punished and he did it deliberately one night there was a heavy snowfall and in the morning pike the malingerer did not appear he was securely hidden in his nest under a foot of snow francois called him and sought him in vain spitz was wild with wrath he raged through the camp smelling and digging in every likely place snarling so frightfully that pike heard and shivered in his 
 but when he was at last unearthed and spitz flew at him to punish him buck flew with equal rage in between so unexpected was it and so shrewdly managed that spitz was hurled backward and off his feet pike who had been trembling abjectly took heart at this open mutiny and sprang upon his overthrown leader buck to whom fair play was a forgotten code likewise sprang upon spitz but francois chuckling at the incident while unswerving in the administration of justice brought his lash down upon buck with all his might this failed to drive buck from his prostrate rival and the butt of the whip was brought into play by the blow buck was knocked backward and the lash laid upon him again and again while spitz soundly punished the many times offending pike 
 in the days that followed as dawson grew closer and closer buck still continued to interfere between spitz and the culprits but he did it craftily when francois was not around with the covert mutiny of buck a general insubordination sprang up and increased dave and were unaffected but the rest of the team went from bad to worse things no longer went right there was continual bickering and jangling trouble was always afoot and at the bottom of it was buck he kept francois busy for the was in constant apprehension of the struggle between the two which he knew must take place sooner or later and on more than one night the sounds of quarreling and strife among the other dogs turned him out of his sleeping robe fearful that buck and spitz were at it 
 but the opportunity did not present itself and they pulled into dawson one dreary afternoon with the great fight still to come here were many men and countless dogs and buck found them all at work it seemed the ordained order of things that dogs should work all day they swung up and down the main street in long teams and in the night their jingling bells still went by they hauled cabin logs and firewood freighted up to the mines and did all manner of work that horses did in the santa clara valley here and there buck met southland dogs but in the main they were the wild wolf husky breed every night regularly at nine at twelve and three they lifted a nocturnal song a weird and eerie chant in which it was delight to join 
 with the aurora borealis flaming coldly overhead or the stars leaping in the frost dance and the land numb and frozen under its pall of snow this song of the huskies might have been the defiance of life only it was pitched in minor key with wailings and and was more the pleading of life the articulate travail of existence it was an old song old as the breed of the first songs of the younger world in a day when songs were sad it was invested with the woe of unnumbered generations this plaint by which buck was so strangely stirred when he moaned and sobbed it was with the pain of living that was of old the pain of his wild fathers and the fear and mystery of the cold and dark that was to them fear and mystery and that he should be stirred by it marked the completeness with which he harked back through the ages of fire and roof to the raw beginnings of life in the howling ages 
 seven days from the time they pulled into dawson they dropped down the steep bank by the barracks to the yukon trail and pulled for yea and salt water perrault was carrying dispatches if anything more urgent than those he had brought in also the travel pride had gripped him and he purposed to make the record trip of the year several things favored him in this the rest had recuperated the dogs and put them in thorough trim the trail they had broken into the country was packed hard by later journeyers and further the police had arranged in two or three places deposits of grub for dog and man and he was traveling light 
 they made sixty mile which is a run on the first day and the second day saw them booming up the yukon well on their way to pelly but such splendid running was achieved not without great trouble and vexation on the part of francois the insidious revolt led by buck had destroyed the solidarity of the team it no longer was as one dog leaping in the traces the encouragement buck gave the rebels led them into all kinds of petty misdemeanors no more was spitz a leader greatly to be feared the old awe departed and they grew equal to challenging his authority pike robbed him of half a fish one night and gulped it down under the protection of buck another night dub and joe fought spitz and made him forego the punishment they deserved and even billee the was less and whined not half so placatingly as in former days buck never came near spitz without snarling and bristling menacingly in fact his conduct approached that of a bully and he was given to swaggering up and down before very nose 
 the breaking down of discipline likewise affected the dogs in their relations with one another they quarreled and bickered more than ever among themselves till at times the camp was a howling bedlam dave and alone were unaltered though they were made irritable by the unending squabbling francois swore strange barbarous oaths and stamped the snow in futile rage and tore his hair his lash was always singing among the dogs but it was of small avail directly his back was turned they were at it again he backed up spitz with his whip while buck backed up the remainder of the team francois knew he was behind all the trouble and buck knew he knew but buck was too clever ever again to be caught he worked faithfully in the harness for the toil had become a delight to him yet it was a greater delight slyly to precipitate a fight amongst his mates and tangle the traces 
 at the mouth of the tahkeena one night after supper dub turned up a snowshoe rabbit blundered it and missed in a second the whole team was in full cry a hundred yards away was a camp of the northwest police with fifty dogs huskies all who joined the chase the rabbit sped down the river turned off into a small creek up the frozen bed of which it held steadily it ran lightly on the surface of the snow while the dogs plowed through by main strength buck led the pack sixty strong around bend after bend but he could not gain he lay down low to the race whining eagerly his splendid body flashing forward leap by leap in the wan white moonlight and leap by leap like some pale frost wraith the snowshoe rabbit flashed on ahead 
 all that stirring of old instincts which at stated periods drives men out from the sounding cities to forest and plain to kill things by chemically propelled leaden pellets the bloodlust the joy to this was only it was infinitely more intimate he was ranging at the head of the pack running the wild thing down the living meat to kill with his own teeth and wash his muzzle to the eyes in warm blood 
 there is an ecstasy that marks the summit of life and beyond which life cannot rise and such is the paradox of living this ecstasy comes when one is most alive and it comes as a complete forgetfulness that one is alive this ecstasy this forgetfulness of living comes to the artist caught up and out of himself in a sheet of flame it comes to the soldier on a stricken field and refusing quarter and it came to buck leading the pack sounding the old straining after the food that was alive and that fled swiftly before him through the moonlight he was sounding the deeps of his nature and of the parts of his nature that were deeper than he going back into the womb of time he was mastered by the sheer surging of life the tidal wave of being the perfect joy of each separate muscle joint and sinew in that it was everything that was not death that it was aglow and rampant expressing itself in movement flying exultantly under the stars and over the face of dead matter that did not move 
 but spitz cold and calculating even in his supreme moods left the pack and cut across a narrow neck of land where the creek made a long bend around buck did not know of this and as he rounded the bend the frost wraith of a rabbit still flitting before him he saw another and larger frost wraith leap from the overhanging bank into the immediate path of the rabbit it was spitz the rabbit could not turn and as the white teeth broke its back in mid air it shrieked as loudly as a stricken man may shriek at sound of this the cry of life plunging down from apex in the grip of death the full pack at heels raised a chorus of delight 
 buck did not cry out he did not check himself but drove in upon spitz shoulder to shoulder so hard that he missed the throat they rolled over and over in the powdery snow spitz gained his feet almost as though he had not been overthrown slashing buck down the shoulder and leaping clear twice his teeth clipped together like the steel jaws of a trap as he backed away for better footing with lean and lifting lips that writhed and snarled 
 in a flash buck knew it the time had come it was to the death as they circled about snarling ears laid back keenly watchful for the advantage the scene came to buck with a sense of familiarity he seemed to remember it white woods and earth and moonlight and the thrill of battle over the whiteness and silence brooded a ghostly calm there was not the faintest whisper of moved not a leaf quivered the visible breaths of the dogs rising slowly and lingering in the frosty air they had made short work of the snowshoe rabbit these dogs that were wolves and they were now drawn up in an expectant circle they too were silent their eyes only gleaming and their breaths drifting slowly upward to buck it was nothing new or strange this scene of old time it was as though it had always been the wonted way of things 
 spitz was a practiced fighter from spitzbergen through the arctic and across canada and the barrens he had held his own with all manner of dogs and achieved to mastery over them bitter rage was his but never blind rage in passion to rend and destroy he never forgot that his enemy was in like passion to rend and destroy he never rushed till he was prepared to receive a rush never attacked till he had first defended that attack 
 in vain buck strove to sink his teeth in the neck of the big white dog wherever his fangs struck for the softer flesh they were countered by the fangs of spitz fang clashed fang and lips were cut and bleeding but buck could not penetrate his guard then he warmed up and enveloped spitz in a whirlwind of rushes time and time again he tried for the throat where life bubbled near to the surface and each time and every time spitz slashed him and got away then buck took to rushing as though for the throat when suddenly drawing back his head and curving in from the side he would drive his shoulder at the shoulder of spitz as a ram by which to overthrow him but instead shoulder was slashed down each time as spitz leaped lightly away 
 spitz was untouched while buck was streaming with blood and panting hard the fight was growing desperate and all the while the silent and wolfish circle waited to finish off whichever dog went down as buck grew winded spitz took to rushing and he kept him staggering for footing once buck went over and the whole circle of sixty dogs started up but he recovered himself almost in mid air and the circle sank down again and waited 
 but buck possessed a quality that made for he fought by instinct but he could fight by head as well he rushed as though attempting the old shoulder trick but at the last instant swept low to the snow and in his teeth closed on left fore leg there was a crunch of breaking bone and the white dog faced him on three legs thrice he tried to knock him over then repeated the trick and broke the right fore leg despite the pain and helplessness spitz struggled madly to keep up he saw the silent circle with gleaming eyes lolling tongues and silvery breaths drifting upward closing in upon him as he had seen similar circles close in upon beaten antagonists in the past only this time he was the one who was beaten 
 there was no hope for him buck was inexorable mercy was a thing reserved for gentler climes he maneuvered for the final rush the circle had tightened till he could feel the breaths of the huskies on his flanks he could see them beyond spitz and to either side for the spring their eyes fixed upon him a pause seemed to fall every animal was motionless as though turned to stone only spitz quivered and bristled as he staggered back and forth snarling with horrible menace as though to frighten off impending death then buck sprang in and out but while he was in shoulder had at last squarely met shoulder the dark circle became a dot on the moon flooded snow as spitz disappeared from view buck stood and looked on the successful champion the dominant primordial beast who had made his kill and found it good

 ext fire 
 in the alley below trinity sees agent smith staring at 
 her she can only go up 
 
 ext roof 
 on the roof trinity is running as agent brown rises over 
 the parapet leading the cops in pursuit 
 trinity begins to jump from one roof to the next her 
 moverents so clean gliding in and out of each jump 
 contrasted to the wild jumps of the cops 
 agent brown however has the same unnatural grace 
 the metal scream of an el train is heard and trinity 
 turns to it racing for the back of the building 
 the edge falls away into a wide back alley the next 
 building is over feet away but face is 
 perfectly calm staring at some point beyond the other 
 roof 
 the cops slow realizing they are about to see something 
 ugly as trinity drives at the edge launching herself 
 into the air 
 from above the ground seems to flow beneath her as she 
 hangs in flight 
 then hitting somersaulting up still running hard 
 cop 
 motherfucker impossible 
 they stare as agent brown duplicates the 
 move exactly landing rolling over a shoulder up onto 
 one knee 
 just below the building are the runbling tracks of 
 riveted steel the train screeches beneath her a 
 rattling blur of gray metal trinity junps landing 
 easily 
 she looks back just as agent brown hurls through the air 
 barely reaching the last car 
 agent brown stands yanking out a gun 
 trinity is running hard as bullets whistle past her head 
 ahead she sees her only chance feet beyond the point 
 where the train has begun to turn there is 
 a window a yellow glow in the midst of a dark brick 
 building 
 trinity zeroes in on it running as hard as she can her 
 speed compounded by the train the scream of the steel 
 rises as she nears the edge where the train rocks into the 
 turn 
 trinity hurtles into the empty night space her body 
 leveling into a dive she falls arms covering her head 
 as 
 the whole world seems to spin on its axis 
 and she crashes with an explosion of glass and wood then falls onto a back stairwell tumbling bouncing down 
 stairs bleeding broken 
 but still alive 
 through the smashed window she glimpses agent brown 
 still on the train his tie and coat whipping in the 
 wind he touches his ear piece as the train 
 slides him past the window 
 trinity tries to move everything hurts 
 trinity 
 get up trinity fine 
 get up just get up 
 she stands and limps down the rest of the stairs 
 
 ext street 
 trinity emerges from the shadows of an alley and at the 
 end of the block in a pool of white street light she 
 sees it 
 the telephone booth 
 obviously hurt she starts down the concrete walk 
 focusing in completely her pace quickening as the phone 
 begins to ring 
 across the street a garbage truck suddenly its 
 tires screaming as it accelerates 
 trinity sees the headlights on the truck arcing at the 
 telephone booth as if taking aim 
 gritting through the pain she races the truck 
 slamming into the booth the headlights blindingly 
 bright bearing down on the box of plexiglas just as 
 she answers the phone 
 there is a frozen instant of silence before the hulking 
 mass of dark metal lurches up onto the sidewalk 
 barreling through the booth bulldozing it into a brick 
 wall smashing it to plexiglas pulp 
 after a moment a black loafer steps down from the cab of 
 the garbage truck agent smith inspects the wreckage 
 there is no body trinity is gone 
 his jaw sets as he grinds his molars in frustration 
 agent jones walks up behind him 
 agent smith 
 did you get anything from the room 
 agent jones 
 their next target the name is neo 
 the handset of the pay phone lays on the ground 
 separated in the crash like a severed limb

 agent jones 
 already begun 
 we are sucked towards the mouthpiece of the phone closer 
 and closer until the smooth gray plastic spreads out 
 like a horizon and the small holes widen until we fall 
 through one 
 swallowed by the darkness that becomes 
 a computer screen 
 we are inside a chat room called the matrix 
 it is an exklusive where hackers hang out 
 screen

 we drift back from the electric conversation entering 
 
 int apartment 
 it is a studio apartirent that seems overgrown with 
 technology 
 cables coil everywhere into 
 thickets that wind up and around the legs of several 
 desks 
 tabletops are filled with cannibalized equipment that lay 
 open like an autopsied corpse 
 we turn towards the center of this of 
 technology following the slurping and crunching of 
 cereal we pass an open box of capln crunch as we find 
 neo a younger man who knows more about living inside a 
 computer than living outside one 
 neo 
 fuckin idiots know shit 
 he finishes his cereal and is about to disconnect when an 
 anonynous message slices onto the screen

 a chill runs down his spine and when someone knocks on 
 his door he almost jumps out of his chair 
 he looks at the door then back at the computer but the 
 message is gone 
 he shakes his head not completely sure what happened 
 again someone knocks 
 cautiously neo approaches the door

lionfish nov chapter three the burrowcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 ron breathed harry creeping to the window and pushing it up so they could talk through the bars ron how did you what the 
 
 mouth fell open as the full impact of what he was seeing hit him ron was leaning out of the back window of an old turquoise car which was parked in midair grinning at harry from the front seats were fred and george elder twin brothers 
 
 all right harry asked george 
 
 been going on said ron why you been answering my letters asked you to stay about twelve times and then dad came home and said got an official warning for using magic in front of muggles 
 
 it me and how did he know 
 
 he works for the ministry said ron you know not supposed to do spells outside school 
 
 you should talk said harry staring at the floating car 
 
 oh this count said ron only borrowing this we enchant it but doing magic in front of those muggles you live with 
 
 i told you i but take too long to explain now look can you tell them at hogwarts that the dursleys have locked me up and let me come back and obviously i magic myself out because the think the second spell done in three days so 
 
 stop gibbering said ron come to take you home with us 
 
 but you magic me out either 
 
 we need to said ron jerking his head toward the front seat and grinning you forget who got with me 
 
 tie that around the bars said fred throwing the end of a rope to harry 
 
 if the dursleys wake up dead said harry as he tied the rope tightly around a bar and fred revved up the car 
 
 worry said fred and stand back 
 
 harry moved back into the shadows next to hedwig who seemed to have realized how important this was and kept still and silent the car revved louder and louder and suddenly with a crunching noise the bars were pulled clean out of the window as fred drove straight up in the air harry ran back to the window to see the bars dangling a few feet above the ground panting ron hoisted them up into the car harry listened anxiously but there was no sound from the 
 
 when the bars were safely in the back seat with ron fred reversed as close as possible to window 
 
 get in ron said 
 
 but all my hogwarts stuff my wand my broomstick 
 
 where is it 
 
 locked in the cupboard under the stairs and i get out of this room 
 
 no problem said george from the front passenger seat out of the way harry 
 
 fred and george climbed catlike through the window into room you had to hand it to them thought harry as george took an ordinary hairpin from his pocket and started to pick the lock 
 
 a lot of wizards think a waste of time knowing this sort of muggle trick said fred but we feel skills worth learning even if they are a bit slow 
 
 there was a small click and the door swung open 
 
 so get your trunk you grab anything you need from your room and hand it out to ron whispered george 
 
 watch out for the bottom stair it creaks harry whispered back as the twins disappeared onto the dark landing 
 
 harry dashed around his room collecting his things and passing them out of the window to ron then he went to help fred and george heave his trunk up the stairs harry heard uncle vernon cough 
 
 at last panting they reached the landing then carried the trunk through room to the open window fred climbed back into the car to pull with ron and harry and george pushed from the bedroom side inch by inch the trunk slid through the window 
 
 uncle vernon coughed again 
 
 a bit more panted fred who was pulling from inside the car one good push 
 
 harry and george threw their shoulders against the trunk and it slid out of the window into the back seat of the car 
 
 okay go george whispered 
 
 but as harry climbed onto the windowsill there came a sudden loud screech from behind him followed immediately by the thunder of uncle voice 
 
 that ruddy owl 
 
 forgotten hedwig 
 
 harry tore back across the room as the landing light clicked on he snatched up cage dashed to the window and passed it out to ron he was scrambling back onto the chest of drawers when uncle vernon hammered on the unlocked door and it crashed open 
 
 for a split second uncle vernon stood framed in the doorway then he let out a bellow like an angry bull and dived at harry grabbing him by the ankle 
 
 ron fred and george seized arms and pulled as hard as they could 
 
 petunia roared uncle vernon getting away getting away 
 
 but the weasleys gave a gigantic tug and leg slid out of uncle grasp harry was in the car slammed the door shut 
 
 put your foot down fred yelled ron and the car shot suddenly toward the moon 
 
 harry believe it he was free he rolled down the window the night air whipping his hair and looked back at the shrinking rooftops of privet drive uncle vernon aunt petunia and dudley were all hanging dumbstruck out of window 
 
 see you next summer harry yelled 
 
 the weasleys roared with laughter and harry settled back in his seat grinning from ear to ear 
 
 let hedwig out he told ron she can fly behind us she had a chance to stretch her wings for ages 
 
 george handed the hairpin to ron and a moment later hedwig soared joyfully out of the window to glide alongside them like a ghost 
 
 so the story harry said ron impatiently been happening 
 
 harry told them all about dobby the warning given harry and the fiasco of the violet pudding there was a long shocked silence when he had finished 
 
 very fishy said fred finally 
 
 definitely dodgy agreed george so he even tell you supposed to be plotting all this stuff 
 
 i think he could said harry i told you every time he got close to letting something slip he started banging his head against the wall 
 
 he saw fred and george look at each other 
 
 what you think he was lying to me said harry 
 
 well said fred put it this way have got powerful magic of their own but they usually use it without their permission i reckon old dobby was sent to stop you coming back to hogwarts idea of a joke can you think of anyone at school with a grudge against you 
 
 yes said harry and ron together instantly 
 
 draco malfoy harry explained he hates me 
 
 draco malfoy said george turning around not lucius son 
 
 must be not a very common name is it said harry 
 
 heard dad talking about him said george he was a big supporter of 
 
 and when disappeared said fred craning around to look at harry lucius malfoy came back saying never meant any of it load of dung dad reckons he was right in you inner circle 
 
 harry had heard these rumors about family before and they surprise him at all malfoy made dudley dursley look like a kind thoughtful and sensitive boy 
 
 i know whether the malfoys own a said harry 
 
 well whoever owns him will be an old wizarding family and be rich said fred 
 
 yeah always wishing we had a to do the ironing said george but all got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all over the garden come with big old manors and castles and places like that you catch one in our house 
 
 harry was silent judging by the fact that draco malfoy usually had the best of everything his family was rolling in wizard gold he could just see malfoy strutting around a large manor house sending the family servant to stop harry from going back to hogwarts also sounded exactly like the sort of thing malfoy would do had harry been stupid to take dobby seriously 
 
 glad we came to get you anyway said ron i was getting really worried when you answer any of my letters i thought it was fault at first 
 
 errol 
 
 our owl ancient it be the first time collapsed on a delivery so then i tried to borrow hermes 
 
 who 
 
 the owl mum and dad bought percy when he was made prefect said fred from the front 
 
 but percy lend him to me said ron said he needed him 
 
 been acting very oddly this summer said george frowning and he has been sending a lot of letters and spending a load of time shut up in his room i mean only so many times you can polish a prefect badge driving too far west fred he added pointing at a compass on the dashboard fred twiddled the steering wheel 
 
 so does your dad know got the car said harry guessing the answer 
 
 er no said ron he had to work tonight hopefully be able to get it back in the garage without mum noticing we flew it 
 
 what does your dad do at the ministry of magic anyway 
 
 he works in the most boring department said ron the misuse of muggle artifacts office 
 
 the what 
 
 all to do with bewitching things that are you know in case they end up back in a muggle shop or house like last year some old witch died and her tea set was sold to an antiques shop this muggle woman bought it took it home and tried to serve her friends tea in it it was a nightmare dad was working overtime for weeks 
 
 what happened 
 
 the teapot went berserk and squirted boiling tea all over the place and one man ended up in the hospital with the sugar tongs clamped to his nose dad was going frantic only him and an old warlock called perkins in the office and they had to do memory charms and all sorts of stuff to cover it up 
 
 but your dad this car 
 
 fred laughed yeah crazy about everything to do with muggles our full of muggle stuff he takes it apart puts spells on it and puts it back together again if he raided our house have to put himself under arrest it drives mum mad 
 
 the main road said george peering down through the windshield be there in ten minutes just as well getting light 
 
 a faint pinkish glow was visible along the horizon to the east 
 
 fred brought the car lower and harry saw a dark patchwork of fields and clumps of trees 
 
 a little way outside the village said george ottery st catchpole 
 
 lower and lower went the flying car the edge of a brilliant red sun was now gleaming through the trees 
 
 touchdown said fred as with a slight bump they hit the ground they had landed next to a tumbledown garage in a small yard and harry looked out for the first time at house 
 
 it looked as though it had once been a large stone pigpen but extra rooms had been added here and there until it was several stories high and so crooked it looked as though it were held up by magic which harry reminded himself it probably was four or five chimneys were perched on top of the red roof a lopsided sign stuck in the ground near the entrance read the burrow around the front door lay a jumble of rubber boots and a very rusty cauldron several fat brown chickens were pecking their way around the yard 
 
 not much said ron 
 
 wonderful said harry happily thinking of privet drive 
 
 they got out of the car 
 
 now go upstairs really quietly said fred and wait for mum to call us for breakfast then ron you come bounding downstairs going mum look who turned up in the be all pleased to see harry and no one need ever know we flew the car 
 
 right said ron come on harry i sleep at the at the top 
 
 ron had gone a nasty greenish color his eyes fixed on the house the other three wheeled around 
 
 mrs weasley was marching across the yard scattering chickens and for a short plump woman it was remarkable how much she looked like a tiger 
 
 ah said fred 
 
 oh dear said george 
 
 mrs weasley came to a halt in front of them her hands on her hips staring from one guilty face to the next she was wearing a flowered apron with a wand sticking out of the pocket 
 
 so she said 
 
 morning mum said george in what he clearly thought was a jaunty winning voice 
 
 have you any idea how worried been said mrs weasley in a deadly whisper 
 
 sorry mum but see we had to 
 
 all three of mrs sons were taller than she was but they cowered as her rage broke over them 
 
 beds empty no note car gone could have crashed out of my mind with worry did you care never as long as lived you wait until your father gets home we never had trouble like this from bill or charlie or percy 
 
 perfect percy muttered fred 
 
 you could do with taking a leaf out of book yelled mrs weasley prodding a finger in chest you could have died you could have been seen you could have lost your father his job 
 
 it seemed to go on for hours mrs weasley had shouted herself hoarse before she turned on harry who backed away 
 
 very pleased to see you harry dear she said come in and have some breakfast 
 
 she turned and walked back into the house and harry after a nervous glance at ron who nodded encouragingly followed her 
 
 the kitchen was small and rather cramped there was a scrubbed wooden table and chairs in the middle and harry sat down on the edge of his seat looking around he had never been in a wizard house before 
 
 the clock on the wall opposite him had only one hand and no numbers at all written around the edge were things like time to make tea time to feed the chickens and late books were stacked three deep on the mantelpiece books with titles like charm your own cheese enchantment in baking and one minute feasts magic and unless ears were deceiving him the old radio next to the sink had just announced that coming up was witching hour with the popular singing sorceress celestina warbeck 
 
 mrs weasley was clattering around cooking breakfast a little haphazardly throwing dirty looks at her sons as she threw sausages into the frying pan every now and then she muttered things like know what you were thinking of and never would have believed it 
 
 i blame you dear she assured harry tipping eight or nine sausages onto his plate arthur and i have been worried about you too just last night we were saying come and get you ourselves if you written back to ron by friday but really she was now adding three fried eggs to his plate flying an illegal car halfway across the country anyone could have seen you 
 
 she flicked her wand casually at the dishes in the sink which began to clean themselves clinking gently in the background 
 
 it was cloudy mum said fred 
 
 you keep your mouth closed while eating mrs weasley snapped 
 
 they were starving him mum said george 
 
 and you said mrs weasley but it was with a slightly softened expression that she started cutting harry bread and buttering it for him 
 
 at that moment there was a diversion in the form of a small redheaded figure in a long nightdress who appeared in the kitchen gave a small squeal and ran out again 
 
 ginny said ron in an undertone to harry my sister been talking about you all summer 
 
 yeah be wanting your autograph harry fred said with a grin but he caught his eye and bent his face over his plate without another word nothing more was said until all four plates were clean which took a surprisingly short time 
 
 blimey tired yawned fred setting down his knife and fork at last i think go to bed and 
 
 you will not snapped mrs weasley your own fault been up all night going to the garden for me getting completely out of hand again 
 
 oh mum 
 
 and you two she said glaring at ron and fred you can go up to bed dear she added to harry you ask them to fly that wretched car 
 
 but harry who felt wide awake said quickly help ron never seen a 
 
 very sweet of you dear but dull work said mrs weasley now see what got to say on the subject 
 
 and she pulled a heavy book from the stack on the mantelpiece george groaned 
 
 mum we know how to a garden 
 
 harry looked at the cover of mrs book written across it in fancy gold letters were the words gilderoy guide to household pests there was a big photograph on the front of a very wizard with wavy blond hair and bright blue eyes as always in the wizarding world the photograph was moving the wizard who harry supposed was gilderoy lockhart kept winking cheekily up at them all mrs weasley beamed down at him 
 
 oh he is marvelous she said he knows his household pests all right a wonderful book 
 
 mum fancies him said fred in a very audible whisper 
 
 be so ridiculous fred said mrs weasley her cheeks rather pink all right if you think you know better than lockhart you can go and get on with it and woe betide you if a single gnome in that garden when i come out to inspect it 
 
 yawning and grumbling the weasleys slouched outside with harry behind them the garden was large and in eyes exactly what a garden should be the dursleys have liked it there were plenty of weeds and the grass needed cutting but there were gnarled trees all around the walls plants harry had never seen spilling from every flower bed and a big green pond full of frogs 
 
 muggles have garden gnomes too you know harry told ron they crossed the lawn 
 
 yeah seen those things they think are gnomes said ron bent double with his head in a peony bush like fat little santa clauses with fishing rods 
 
 there was a violent scuffling noise the peony bush shuddered and ron straightened up this is a gnome he said grimly 
 
 gerroff me gerroff me squealed the gnome 
 
 it was certainly nothing like santa claus it was small and leathery looking with a large knobby bald head exactly like a potato ron held it at length as it kicked out at him with its horny little feet he grasped it around the ankles and turned it upside down 
 
 this is what you have to do he said he raised the gnome above his head gerroff me and started to swing it in great circles like a lasso seeing the shocked look on face ron added it hurt them just got to make them really dizzy so they find their way back to the gnome holes 
 
 he let go of the ankles it flew twenty feet into the air and landed with a thud in the field over the hedge 
 
 pitiful said fred i bet i can get mine beyond that stump 
 
 harry learned quickly not to feel too sorry for the gnomes he decided just to drop the first one he caught over the hedge but the gnome sensing weakness sank its teeth into finger and he had a hard job shaking it off until 
 
 wow harry that been fifty feet 
 
 the air was soon thick with flying gnomes 
 
 see not too bright said george seizing five or six gnomes at once the moment they know the going on they storm up to have a look think have learned by now just to stay put 
 
 soon the crowd of gnomes in the field started walking away in a straggling line their little shoulders hunched 
 
 be back said ron as they watched the gnomes disappear into the hedge on the other side of the field they love it here too soft with them he thinks funny 
 
 just then the front door slammed 
 
 back said george home 
 
 they hurried through the garden and back into the house 
 
 mr weasley was slumped in a kitchen chair with his glasses off and his eyes closed he was a thin man going bald but the little hair he had was as red as any of his he was wearing long green robes which were dusty and 
 
 what a night he mumbled groping for the teapot as they all sat down around him nine raids nine and old mundungus fletcher tried to put a hex on me when i had my back turned 
 
 mr weasley took a long gulp of tea and sighed 
 
 find anything dad said fred eagerly 
 
 all i got were a few shrinking door keys and a biting kettle yawned mr weasley there was some pretty nasty stuff that my department though mortlake was taken away for questioning about some extremely odd ferrets but the committee on experimental charms thank goodness 
 
 why would anyone bother making door keys shrink said george 
 
 just sighed mr weasley sell them a key that keeps shrinking to nothing so they can never find it when they need it of course very hard to convict anyone because no muggle would admit their key keeps shrinking insist they just keep losing it bless them go to any lengths to ignore magic even if staring them in the face but the things our lot have taken to enchanting you believe 
 
 like cars for instance 
 
 mrs weasley had appeared holding a long poker like a sword mr eyes jerked open he stared guiltily at his wife 
 
 molly dear 
 
 yes arthur cars said mrs weasley her eyes flashing imagine a wizard buying a rusty old car and telling his wife all he wanted to do with it was take it apart to see how it worked while really he was enchanting it to make it fly 
 
 mr weasley blinked 
 
 well dear i think find that he would be quite within the law to do that even if er he maybe would have done better to um tell his wife the truth a loophole in the law find as long as he intending to fly the car the fact that the car could fly 
 
 arthur weasley you made sure there was a loophole when you wrote that law shouted mrs weasley just so you could carry on tinkering with all that muggle rubbish in your shed and for your information harry arrived this morning in the car you intending to fly 
 
 harry said mr weasley blankly harry who 
 
 he looked around saw harry and jumped 
 
 good lord is it harry potter very pleased to meet you told us so much about 
 
 your sons flew that car to house and back last night shouted mrs weasley what have you got to say about that eh 
 
 did you really said mr weasley eagerly did it go all right i i mean he faltered as sparks flew from mrs eyes that that was very wrong boys very wrong indeed 
 
 leave them to it ron muttered to harry as mrs weasley swelled like a bullfrog come on show you my bedroom 
 
 they slipped out of the kitchen and down a narrow passageway to an uneven staircase which wound its way zigzagging up through the house on the third landing a door stood ajar harry just caught sight of a pair of bright brown eyes staring at him before it closed with a snap 
 
 ginny said ron you know how weird it is for her to be this shy she never shuts up normally 
 
 they climbed two more flights until they reached a door with peeling paint and a small plaque on it saying room 
 
 harry stepped in his head almost touching the sloping ceiling and blinked it was like walking into a furnace nearly everything in room seemed to be a violent shade of orange the bedspread the walls even the ceiling then harry realized that ron had covered nearly every inch of the shabby wallpaper with posters of the same seven witches and wizards all wearing bright orange robes carrying broomsticks and waving energetically 
 
 your quidditch team said harry 
 
 the chudley cannons said ron pointing at the orange bedspread which was emblazoned with two giant black and a speeding cannonball ninth in the league 
 
 school spellbooks were stacked untidily in a corner next to a pile of comics that all seemed to feature the adventures of martin miggs the mad muggle magic wand was lying on top of a fish tank full of frog spawn on the windowsill next to his fat gray rat scabbers who was snoozing in a patch of sun 
 
 harry stepped over a pack of playing cards on the floor and looked out of the tiny window in the field far below he could see a gang of gnomes sneaking one by one back through the then he turned to look at ron who was watching him almost nervously as though waiting for his opinion 
 
 a bit small said ron quickly not like that room you had with the muggles and right underneath the ghoul in the attic always banging on the pipes and groaning 
 
 but harry grinning widely said this is the best house ever been in 
 
 ears went pink 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the chamber of secrets 
 

lionfish nov chapter three the knight buscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry was several streets away before he collapsed onto a low wall in magnolia crescent panting from the effort of dragging his trunk he sat quite still anger still surging through him listening to the frantic thumping of his heart 
 
 but after ten minutes alone in the dark street a new emotion overtook him panic whichever way he looked at it he had never been in a worse fix he was stranded quite alone in the dark muggle world with absolutely nowhere to go and the worst of it was he had just done serious magic which meant that he was almost certainly expelled from hogwarts he had broken the decree for the restriction of underage wizardry so badly he was surprised ministry of magic representatives swooping down on him where he sat 
 
 harry shivered and looked up and down magnolia crescent 
 
 what was going to happen to him would he be arrested or would he simply be outlawed from the wizarding world he thought of ron and hermione and his heart sank even lower harry was sure that criminal or not ron and hermione would want to help him now but they were both abroad and with hedwig gone he had no means of contacting them 
 
 he have any muggle money either there was a little wizard gold in the money bag at the bottom of his trunk but the rest of the fortune his parents had left him was stored in a vault at gringotts wizarding bank in london never be able to drag his trunk all the way to london unless 
 
 he looked down at his wand which he was still clutching in his hand if he was already expelled his heart was now thumping painfully fast a bit more magic hurt he had the invisibility cloak he had inherited from his father what if he bewitched the trunk to make it tied it to his broomstick covered himself in the cloak and flew to london then he could get the rest of his money out of his vault andbegin his life as an outcast it was a horrible prospect but he sit on this wall forever or find himself trying to explain to muggle police why he was out in the dead of night with a trunk full of spell books and a broomstick 
 
 harry opened his trunk again and pushed the contents aside looking for the invisibility cloak but before he had found it he straightened up suddenly looking around him once more 
 
 a funny prickling on the back of his neck had made harry feel he was being watched but the street appeared to be deserted and no lights shone from any of the large square houses 
 
 he bent over his trunk again but almost immediately stood up once more his hand clenched on his wand he had sensed rather than heard it someone or something was standing in the narrow gap between the garage and the fence behind him harry squinted at the black alleyway if only it would move then know whether it was just a stray cat or something else 
 
 lumos harry muttered and a light appeared at the end of his wand almost dazzling him he held it high over his head and the walls of number two suddenly sparkled the garage door gleamed and between them harry saw quite distinctly the hulking outline of something very big with wide gleaming eyes 
 
 harry stepped backward his legs hit his trunk and he tripped his wand flew out of his hand as he flung out an arm to break his fall and he landed hard in the gutter 
 
 there was a deafening bang and harry threw up his hands to shield his eyes against a sudden blinding light 
 
 with a yell he rolled back onto the pavement just in time a second later a gigantic pair of wheels and headlights screeched to a halt exactly where harry had just been lying they belonged as harry saw when he raised his head to a violently purple bus which had appeared out of thin air gold lettering over the windshield spelled the knight bus 
 
 for a split second harry wondered if he had been knocked silly by his fall then a conductor in a purple uniform leapt out of the bus and began to speak loudly to the night 
 
 welcome to the knight bus emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard just stick out your wand hand step on board and we can take you anywhere you want to go my name is stan shunpike and i will be your conductor this eve 
 
 the conductor stopped abruptly he had just caught sight of harry who was still sitting on the ground harry snatched up his wand again and scrambled to his feet close up he saw that stan shunpike was only a few years older than he was eighteen or nineteen at most with large protruding ears and quite a few pimples 
 
 what were you doin down there said stan dropping his professional manner 
 
 fell over said harry 
 
 choo fall over for sniggered stan 
 
 i do it on purpose said harry annoyed one of the knees in his jeans was torn and the hand he had thrown out to break his fall was bleeding he suddenly remembered why he had fallen over and turned around quickly to stare at the alleyway between the garage and fence the knight headlamps were flooding it with light and it was empty 
 
 choo lookin at said stan 
 
 there was a big black thing said harry pointing uncertainly into the gap like a dogbut massive 
 
 he looked around at stan whose mouth was slightly open with a feeling of unease harry saw eyes move to the scar on forehead 
 
 woss that on your ead said stan abruptly 
 
 nothing said harry quickly flattening his hair over his scar if the ministry of magic was looking for him he want to make it too easy for them 
 
 woss your name stan persisted 
 
 neville longbottom said harry saying the first name that came into his head so so this bus he went on quickly hoping to distract stan did you say it goes anywhere 
 
 yep said stan proudly anywhere you like long on land do nuffink underwater 
 
 ere he said looking suspicious again you did flag us down dincha stuck out your wand and dincha 
 
 yes said harry quickly listen how much would it be to get to london 
 
 eleven sickles said stan but for firteen you get ot chocolate and for fifteen you get an bottle an a toofbrush in the color of your choice 
 
 harry rummaged once more in his trunk extracted his money bag and shoved some gold into hand he and stan then lifted his trunk with cage balanced on top up the steps of the bus 
 
 there were no seats instead half a dozen brass bedsteads stood beside the curtained windows candles were burning in brackets beside each bed illuminating the walls a tiny wizard in a nightcap at the rear of the bus muttered not now thanks pickling some slugs and rolled over in his sleep 
 
 you ave this one stan whispered shoving trunk under the bed right behind the driver who was sitting in an armchair in front of the steering wheel this is our driver ernie prang this is neville longbottom ern 
 
 ernie prang an elderly wizard wearing very thick glasses nodded to harry who nervously flattened his bangs again and sat down on his bed 
 
 take er away ern said stan sitting down in the armchair next to 
 
 there was another tremendous bang and the next moment harry found himself flat on his bed thrown backward by the speed of the knight bus pulling himself up harry stared out of the dark window and saw that they were now bowling along a completely different street stan was watching stunned face with great enjoyment 
 
 this is where we was before you flagged us down he said where are we ern somewhere in wales 
 
 ar said ernie 
 
 how come the muggles hear the bus said harry 
 
 them said stan contemptuously don listen properly do they don look properly either never notice nuffink they don 
 
 best go wake up madam marsh stan said ern be in abergavenny in a minute 
 
 stan passed bed and disappeared up a narrow wooden staircase harry was still looking out of the window feeling increasingly nervous ernie seem to have mastered the use of a steering wheel the knight bus kept mounting the pavement but it hit anything lines of lampposts mailboxes and trash cans jumped out of its way as it approached and back into position once it had passed 
 
 stan came back downstairs followed by a faintly green witch wrapped in a traveling cloak 
 
 ere you go madam marsh said stan happily as ern stamped on the brake and the beds slid a foot or so toward the front of the bus madam marsh clamped a handkerchief to her mouth and tottered down the steps stan threw her bag out after her and rammed the doors shut there was another loud bang and they were thundering down a narrow country lane trees leaping out of the way 
 
 harry have been able to sleep even if he had been traveling on a bus that keep banging loudly and jumping a hundred miles at a time his stomach churned as he fell back to wondering what was going to happen to him and whether the dursleys had managed to get aunt marge off the ceiling yet 
 
 stan had unfurled a copy of the daily prophet and was now reading with his tongue between his teeth a large photograph of a man with long matted hair blinked slowly at harry from the front page he looked strangely familiar 
 
 that man harry said forgetting his troubles for a moment he was on the muggle news 
 
 stanley turned to the front page and chuckled 
 
 sirius black he said nodding course e was on the muggle news neville where you been 
 
 he gave a superior sort of chuckle at the blank look on face removed the front page and handed it to harry 
 
 you oughta read the papers more neville 
 
 harry held the paper up to the candlelight and read 
 
 black still at large 
 sirius black possibly the most infamous prisoner ever to be held in azkaban fortress is still eluding capture the ministry of magic confirmed today 
 we are doing all we can to recapture black said the minister of magic cornelius fudge this morning and we beg the magical community to remain calm 
 fudge has been criticized by some members of the international federation of warlocks for informing the muggle prime minister of the crisis 
 well really i had to you know said an irritable fudge black is mad a danger to anyone who crosses him magic or muggle i have the prime assurance that he will not breathe a word of true identity to anyone and face it believe him if he did 
 while muggles have been told that black is carrying a gun a kind of metal wand that muggles use to kill each other the magical community lives in fear of a massacre like that of twelve years ago when black murdered thirteen people with a single curse 
 harry looked into the shadowed eyes of sirius black the only part of the sunken face that seemed alive harry had never met a vampire but he had seen pictures of them in his defense against the dark arts classes and black with his waxy white skin looked just like one 
 
 fing inee said stan who had been watching harry read 
 
 he murdered thirteen people said harry handing the page back to stan with one curse 
 
 yep said stan in front of witnesses an all broad daylight big trouble it caused dinnit ern 
 
 ar said ern darkly 
 
 stan swiveled in his armchair his hands on the back the better to look at harry 
 
 black woz a big supporter of he said 
 
 what voldemort said harry without thinking 
 
 even pimples went white ern jerked the steering wheel so hard that a whole farmhouse had to jump aside to avoid the bus 
 
 you outta your tree yelped stan choo say is name for 
 
 sorry said harry hastily sorry i i forgot 
 
 forgot said stan weakly blimey my goin that fast 
 
 so so black was a supporter of harry prompted apologetically 
 
 yeah said stan still rubbing his chest yeah right very close to they sayanyway when little arry potter got the better of harry nervously flattened his bangs down again all supporters was tracked down they ern most of em knew it was all over wiv gone and they came quiet but not sirius black i eard he thought be once ad taken over 
 
 anyway they cornered black in the middle of a street full of muggles an black took out is wand and e blasted alf the street apart an a wizard got it an so did a dozen muggles what got in the way orrible eh an you know what black did then stan continued in a dramatic whisper 
 
 what said harry

 gas explosion grunted ernie 
 
 an now out said stan examining the newspaper picture of gaunt face again never been a breakout from azkaban before as there ern beats me ow e did it frightenin eh mind i fancy is chances against them azkaban guards eh ern 
 
 ernie suddenly shivered talk about summat else stan a good lad them azkaban guards give me the collywobbles 
 
 stan put the paper away reluctantly and harry leaned against the window of the knight bus feeling worse than ever he help imagining what stan might be telling his passengers in a few nights time 
 
 ear about that arry potter blew up is aunt we ad im ere on the knight bus we ern e was tryin to run for it 
 
 he harry had broken wizard law just like sirius black was inflating aunt marge bad enough to land him in azkaban harry know anything about the wizard prison though everyone ever heard speak of it did so in the same fearful tone hagrid the hogwarts gamekeeper had spent two months there only last year harry soon forget the look of terror on face when he had been told where he was going and hagrid was one of the bravest people harry knew 
 
 the knight bus rolled through the darkness scattering bushes and wastebaskets telephone booths and trees and harry lay restless and miserable on his feather bed after a while stan remembered that harry had paid for hot chocolate but poured it all over pillow when the bus moved abruptly from anglesea to aberdeen one by one wizards and witches in dressing gowns and slippers descended from the upper floors to leave the bus they all looked very pleased to go 
 
 finally harry was the only passenger left 
 
 right then neville said stan clapping his hands whereabouts in london 
 
 diagon alley said harry 
 
 righto said stan old tight then 
 
 bang 
 
 they were thundering along charing cross road harry sat up and watched buildings and benches squeezing themselves out of the knight way the sky was getting a little lighter he would lie low for a couple of hours go to gringotts the moment it opened then set off where he know 
 
 ern slammed on the brakes and the knight bus skidded to a halt in front of a small and pub the leaky cauldron behind which lay the magical entrance to diagon alley 
 
 thanks harry said to ern 
 
 he jumped down the steps and helped stan lower his trunk and cage onto the pavement 
 
 well said harry bye then 
 
 but stan paying attention still standing in the doorway to the bus he was goggling at the shadowy entrance to the leaky cauldron 
 
 there you are harry said a voice 
 
 before harry could turn he felt a hand on his shoulder at the same time stan shouted blimey ern come ere come ere 
 
 harry looked up at the owner of the hand on his shoulder and felt a bucketful of ice cascade into his stomach he had walked right into cornelius fudge the minister of magic himself 
 
 stan leapt onto the pavement beside them 
 
 what didja call neville minister he said excitedly 
 
 fudge a portly little man in a long pinstriped cloak looked cold and exhausted 
 
 neville he repeated frowning this is harry potter 
 
 i knew it stan shouted gleefully ern ern guess oo neville is ern arry potter i can see is scar 
 
 yes said fudge testily well very glad the knight bus picked harry up but he and i need to step inside the leaky cauldron now 
 
 fudge increased the pressure on shoulder and harry found himself being steered inside the pub a stooping figure bearing a lantern appeared through the door behind the bar it was tom the wizened toothless landlord 
 
 got him minister said tom will you be wanting anything beer brandy 
 
 perhaps a pot of tea said fudge who still let go of harry 
 
 there was a loud scraping and puffing from behind them and stan and ern appeared carrying trunk and cage and looking around excitedly 
 
 ow come you tell us oo you are eh neville said stan beaming at harry while owlish face peered interestedly over shoulder 
 
 and a private parlor please tom said fudge pointedly 
 
 bye harry said miserably to stan and ern as tom beckoned fudge toward the passage that led from the bar 
 
 bye neville called stan 
 
 fudge marched harry along the narrow passage after lantern and then into a small parlor tom clicked his fingers a fire burst into life in the grate and he bowed himself out of the room 
 
 sit down harry said fudge indicating a chair by the fire 
 
 harry sat down feeling goose bumps rising up his arms despite the glow of the fire fudge took off his pinstriped cloak and tossed it aside then hitched up the trousers of his suit and sat down opposite harry 
 
 i am cornelius fudge harry the minister of magic 
 
 harry already knew this of course he had seen fudge once before but as he had been wearing his invisibility cloak at the time fudge to know that 
 
 tom the innkeeper reappeared wearing an apron over his nightshirt and bearing a tray of tea and crumpets he placed the tray on a table between fudge and harry and left the parlor closing the door behind him 
 
 well harry said fudge pouring out tea had us all in a right flap i mind telling you running away from your aunt and house like that started to thinkbut safe and what matters 
 
 fudge buttered himself a crumpet and pushed the plate toward harry 
 
 eat harry you look dead on your feet now thenyou will be pleased to hear that we have dealt with the unfortunate of miss marjorie dursley two members of the accidental magic reversal department were dispatched to privet drive a few hours ago miss dursley has been punctured and her memory has been modified she has no recollection of the incident at all so that and no harm done 
 
 fudge smiled at harry over the rim of his teacup rather like an uncle surveying a favorite nephew harry who believe his ears opened his mouth to speak think of anything to say and closed it again 
 
 ah worrying about the reaction of your aunt and uncle said fudge well i deny that they are extremely angry harry but they are prepared to take you back next summer as long as you stay at hogwarts for the christmas and easter holidays 
 
 harry unstuck his throat 
 
 i always stay at hogwarts for the christmas and easter holidays he said and i ever want to go back to privet drive 
 
 now now sure feel differently once calmed down said fudge in a worried tone they are your family after all and sure you are fond of each other er very deep down 
 
 it occur to harry to put fudge right he was still waiting to hear what was going to happen to him now 
 
 so all that remains said fudge now buttering himself a second crumpet is to decide where going to spend the last two weeks of your vacation i suggest you take a room here at the leaky cauldron and 
 
 hang on blurted harry what about my punishment 
 
 fudge blinked punishment 
 
 i broke the law harry said the decree for the restriction of underage wizardry 
 
 oh my dear boy not going to punish you for a little thing like that cried fudge waving his crumpet impatiently it was an accident we send people to azkaban just for blowing up their aunts 
 
 but this tally at all with past dealings with the ministry of magic 
 
 last year i got an official warning just because a smashed a pudding in my house he told fudge frowning the ministry of magic said be expelled from hogwarts if there was any more magic there 
 
 unless eyes were deceiving him fudge was suddenly looking awkward 
 
 circumstances change harrywe have to take into accountin the present climatesurely you want to be expelled 
 
 of course i said harry 
 
 well then all the fuss about laughed fudge now have a crumpet harry while i go and see if got a room for you 
 
 fudge strode out of the parlor and harry stared after him there was something extremely odd going on why had fudge been waiting for him at the leaky cauldron if not to punish him for what done and now harry came to think of it surely it usual for the minister of magic himself to get involved in matters of underage magic 
 
 fudge came back accompanied by tom the innkeeper 
 
 room free harry said fudge i think be very comfortable just one thing and sure understandi want you wandering off into muggle london all right keep to diagon alley and to be back here before dark each night sure understand tom will be keeping an eye on you for me 
 
 okay said harry slowly but why 
 
 want to lose you again do we said fudge with a hearty laugh no nobest we know where you arei mean 
 
 fudge cleared his throat loudly and picked up his pinstriped cloak 
 
 well be off plenty to do you know 
 
 have you had any luck with black yet harry asked 
 
 finger slipped on the silver fastenings of his cloak 
 
 that oh heard well no not yet but only a matter of time the azkaban guards have never yet failedand they are angrier than ever seen them 
 
 fudge shuddered slightly 
 
 so say 
 
 he held out his hand and harry shaking it had a sudden idea 
 
 er minister can i ask you something 
 
 certainly said fudge with a smile 
 
 well third years at hogwarts are allowed to visit hogsmeade but my aunt and uncle sign the permission form think you could 
 
 fudge was looking uncomfortable 
 
 ah he said no no very sorry harry but as not your parent or guardian 
 
 but the minister of magic said harry eagerly if you gave me permission 
 
 no sorry harry but rules are rules said fudge flatly 
 
 perhaps be able to visit hogsmeade next year in fact i think best if you be off enjoy your stay harry 
 
 and with a last smile and shake of hand fudge left the room tom now moved forward beaming at harry 
 
 if follow me mr potter he said already taken your things up 
 
 harry followed tom up a handsome wooden staircase to a door with a brass number eleven on it which tom unlocked and opened for him 
 
 inside was a very bed some highly polished oak furniture a cheerfully crackling fire and perched on top of the wardrobe 
 
 hedwig harry gasped 
 
 the snowy owl clicked her beak and fluttered down onto arm 
 
 very smart owl got there chuckled tom arrived about five minutes after you did if anything you need mr potter hesitate to ask 
 
 he gave another bow and left 
 
 harry sat on his bed for a long time absentmindedly stroking hedwig the sky outside the window was changing rapidly from deep velvety blue to cold steely gray and then slowly to pink shot with gold harry could hardly believe that left privet drive only a few hours ago that he expelled and that he was now facing two completely weeks 
 
 been a very weird night hedwig he yawned 
 
 and without even removing his glasses he slumped back onto his pillows and fell asleep 
 
 rowling

 the prisoner of azkaban 
 

lionfish nov chapter three the invitationcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 by the time harry arrived in the kitchen the three dursleys were already seated around the table none of them looked up as he entered or sat down uncle large red face was hidden behind the daily mail and aunt petunia was cutting a grapefruit into quarters her lips pursed over her teeth 
 
 dudley looked furious and sulky and somehow seemed to be taking up even more space than usual this was saying something as he always took up an entire side of the square table by himself when aunt petunia put a quarter of unsweetened grapefruit onto plate with a tremulous there you are diddy darling dudley glowered at her his life had taken a most unpleasant turn since he had come home for the summer with his report 
 
 uncle vernon and aunt petunia had managed to find excuses for his bad marks as usual aunt petunia always insisted that dudley was a very gifted boy whose teachers understand him while uncle vernon maintained that he want some swotty little nancy boy for a son anyway they also skated over the accusations of bullying in the report a boisterous little boy but he hurt a fly aunt petunia had said tearfully 
 
 however at the bottom of the report there were a few comments from the school nurse that not even uncle vernon and aunt petunia could explain away no matter how much aunt petunia wailed that dudley was and that his poundage was really puppy fat and that he was a growing boy who needed plenty of food the fact remained that the school outfitters stock knickerbockers big enough for him anymore the school nurse had seen what aunt eyes so sharp when it came to spotting fingerprints on her gleaming walls and in observing the comings and goings of the neighbors simply refused to see that far from needing extra nourishment dudley had reached roughly the size and weight of a young killer whale 
 
 so after many tantrums after arguments that shook bedroom floor and many tears from aunt petunia the new regime had begun the diet sheet that had been sent by the smeltings school nurse had been taped to the fridge which had been emptied of all favorite things fizzy drinks and cakes chocolate bars and burgers and filled instead with fruit and vegetables and the sorts of things that uncle vernon called rabbit food to make dudley feel better about it all aunt petunia had insisted that the whole family follow the diet too she now passed a grapefruit quarter to harry he noticed that it was a lot smaller than aunt petunia seemed to feet that the best way to keep up morale was to make sure that he did at least get more to eat than harry 
 
 but aunt petunia know what was hidden under the loose floorboard upstairs she had no idea that harry was not following the diet at all the moment he had got wind of the fact that he was expected to survive the summer on carrot sticks harry had sent hedwig to his friends with pleas for help and they had risen to the occasion magnificently hedwig had returned from house with a large box stuffed full of snacks parents were dentists hagrid the hogwarts gamekeeper had obliged with a sack full of his own homemade rock cakes harry touched these he had had too much experience of cooking mrs weasley however had sent the family owl errol with an enormous fruitcake and assorted meat pies poor errol who was elderly and feeble had needed a full five days to recover from the journey and then on birthday which the dursleys had completely ignored he had received four superb birthday cakes one each from ron hermione hagrid and sirius harry still had two of them left and so looking forward to a real breakfast when he got back upstairs he ate his grapefruit without complaint 
 
 uncle vernon laid aside his paper with a deep sniff of disapproval and looked down at his own grapefruit quarter 
 
 is this it he said grumpily to aunt petunia 
 
 aunt petunia gave him a severe look and then nodded pointedly at dudley who had already finished his own grapefruit quarter and was eyeing with a very sour look in his piggy little eyes 
 
 uncle vernon gave a great sigh which ruffled his large bushy mustache and picked up his spoon 
 
 the doorbell rang uncle vernon heaved himself out of his chair and set off down the hall quick as a flash while his mother was occupied with the kettle dudley stole the rest of uncle grapefruit 
 
 harry heard talking at the door and someone laughing and uncle vernon answering curtly then the front door closed and the sound of ripping paper came from the hall 
 
 aunt petunia set the teapot down on the table and looked curiously around to see where uncle vernon had got to she have to wait long to find out after about a minute he was back he looked livid 
 
 you he barked at harry in the living room now 
 
 bewildered wondering what on earth he was supposed to have done this time harry got up and followed uncle vernon out of the kitchen and into the next room uncle vernon closed the door sharply behind both of them 
 
 so he said marching over to the fireplace and turning to face harry as though he were about to pronounce him under arrest so 
 
 harry would have dearly loved to have said so what but he feel that uncle temper should be tested this early in the morning especially when it was already under severe strain from lack of food he therefore settled for looking politely puzzled 
 
 this just arrived said uncle vernon he brandished a piece of purple writing paper at harry a letter about you 
 
 confusion increased who would be writing to uncle vernon about him who did he know who sent letters by the postman 
 
 uncle vernon glared at harry then looked down at the letter and began to read aloud 
 
 dear mr and mrs dursley 
 we have never been introduced but i am sure you have heard a great deal from harry about my son ron 
 as harry might have told you the final of the quidditch world cup takes place this monday night and my husband arthur has just managed to get prime tickets through his connections at the department of magical games and sports 
 i do hope you will allow us to take harry to the match as this really is a opportunity britain hosted the cup for thirty years and tickets are extremely hard to come by we would of course be glad to have harry stay for the remainder of the summer holidays and to see him safely onto the train back to school 
 it would be best for harry to send us your answer as quickly as possible in the normal way because the muggle postman has never delivered to our house and i am not sure he even knows where it is 
 hoping to see harry soon 
 yours sincerely 
 molly weasley 
 i do hope put enough stamps on 
 uncle vernon finished reading put his hand back into his breast pocket and drew out something else 
 
 look at this he growled 
 
 he held up the envelope in which mrs letter had come and harry had to fight down a laugh every bit of it was covered in stamps except for a square inch on the front into which mrs weasley had squeezed the dursleys address in minute writing 
 
 she did put enough stamps on then said harry trying to sound as though mrs was a mistake anyone could make his eyes flashed 
 
 the postman noticed he said through gritted teeth very interested to know where this letter came from he was why he rang the doorbell seemed to think it was funny 
 
 harry say anything other people might not understand why uncle vernon was making a fuss about too many stamps but harry had lived with the dursleys too long not to know how touchy they were about anything even slightly out of the ordinary their worst fear was that someone would find out that they were connected however distantly with people like mrs weasley 
 
 uncle vernon was still glaring at harry who tried to keep his expression neutral if he do or say anything stupid he might just be in for the treat of a lifetime he waited for uncle vernon to say something but he merely continued to glare harry decided to break the silence 
 
 so can i go then he asked 
 
 a slight spasm crossed uncle large purple face the mustache bristled harry thought he knew what was going on behind the mustache a furious battle as two of uncle most fundamental instincts came into conflict allowing harry to go would make harry happy something uncle vernon had struggled against for thirteen years on the other hand allowing harry to disappear to the weasleys for the rest of the summer would get rid of him two weeks earlier than anyone could have hoped and uncle vernon hated having harry in the house to give himself thinking time it seemed he looked down at mrs letter again 
 
 who is this woman he said staring at the signature with distaste 
 
 seen her said harry my friend mother she was meeting him off the hog off the school train at the end of last term 
 
 he had almost said hogwarts express and that was a sure way to get his temper up nobody ever mentioned the name of school aloud in the dursley household 
 
 uncle vernon screwed up his enormous face as though trying to remember something very unpleasant 
 
 dumpy sort of woman he growled finally load of children with red hair 
 
 harry frowned he thought it was a bit rich of uncle vernon to call anyone dumpy when his own son dudley had finally achieved what been threatening to do since the age of three and become wider than he was tall 
 
 uncle vernon was perusing the letter again 
 
 quidditch he muttered under his breath quidditch what is this rubbish 
 
 harry felt a second stab of annoyance 
 
 a sport he said shortly played on broom 
 
 all right all right said uncle vernon loudly harry saw with some satisfaction that his uncle looked vaguely panicky apparently his nerves stand the sound of the word broomsticks in his living room he took refuge in perusing the letter again harry saw his lips form the words send us your answerin the normal way he scowled 
 
 what does she mean the normal way he spat 
 
 normal for us said harry and before his uncle could stop him he added you know owl post normal for wizards 
 
 uncle vernon looked as outraged as if harry had just uttered a disgusting swearword shaking with anger he shot a nervous look through the window as though expecting to see some of the neighbors with their ears pressed against the glass 
 
 how many times do i have to tell you not to mention that unnaturalness under my roof he hissed his face now a rich plum color you stand there in the clothes petunia and i have put on your ungrateful back 
 
 only after dudley finished with them said harry coldly and indeed he was dressed in a sweatshirt so large for him that he had had to roll back the sleeves five times so as to be able to use his hands and which fell past the knees of his extremely baggy jeans 
 
 i will not be spoken to like that said uncle vernon trembling with rage 
 
 but harry going to stand for this gone were the days when he had been forced to take every single one of the dursleys stupid rules he following diet and he going to let uncle vernon stop him from going to the quidditch world cup not if he could help it harry took a deep steadying breath and then said okay i see the world cup can i go now then only got a letter to sirius i want to finish you know my godfather 
 
 he had done it he had said the magic words now he watched the purple recede blotchily from uncle face making it look like badly mixed black currant ice cream 
 
 writing to him are you said uncle vernon in a calm voice but harry had seen the pupils of his tiny eyes contract with sudden fear 
 
 well yeah said harry casually been a while since he heard from me and you know if he he might start thinking wrong 
 
 he stopped there to enjoy the effect of these words he could almost see the cogs working under uncle thick dark neatly parted hair if he tried to stop harry writing to sirius sirius would think harry was being mistreated if he told harry he go to the quidditch world cup harry would write and tell sirius who would know harry was being mistreated there was only one thing for uncle vernon to do harry could see the conclusion forming in his mind as though the great mustached face were transparent harry tried not to smile to keep his own face as blank as possible and then 
 
 well all right then you can go to this ruddythis stupidthis world cup thing you write and tell these these weasleys to pick you up mind i got time to go dropping you off all over the country and you can spend the rest of the summer there and you can tell your your godfathertell himtell him going 
 
 okay then said harry brightly 
 
 he turned and walked toward the living room door fighting the urge to jump into the air and whoop he was goinghe was going to the weasleys he was going to watch the quidditch world cup 
 
 outside in the hall he nearly ran into dudley who had been lurking behind the door clearly hoping to overhear harry being told off he looked shocked to see the broad grin on face 
 
 that was an excellent breakfast it said harry i feel really full you 
 
 laughing at the astonished look on face harry took the stairs three at a time and hurled himself back into his bedroom 
 
 the first thing he saw was that hedwig was back she was sitting in her cage staring at harry with her enormous amber eyes and clicking her beak in the way that meant she was annoyed about something exactly what was annoying her became apparent almost at once 
 
 ouch said harry as what appeared to be a small gray feathery tennis ball collided with the side of his head harry massaged the spot furiously looking up to see what had hit him and saw a minute owl small enough to fit into the palm of his hand whizzing excitedly around the room like a loose firework harry then realized that the owl had dropped a letter at his feet harry bent down recognized handwriting then tore open the envelope inside was a hastily scribbled note 
 
 harry dad got the tickets ireland versus bulgaria monday night writing to the muggles to ask you to stay they might already have the letter i know how fast muggle post is thought send this with pig anyway 
 harry stared at the word pig then looked up at the tiny owl now zooming around the light fixture on the ceiling he had never seen anything that looked less like a pig maybe he read writing he went back to the letter 
 
 coming for you whether the muggles like it or not you miss the world cup only mum and dad reckon better if we pretend to ask their permission first if they say yes send pig back with your answer pronto and come and get you at five on sunday if they say no send pig back pronto and come and get you at five on sunday anyway 
 arriving this afternoon started work the department of international magical cooperation mention anything about abroad while here unless you want the pants bored off you 
 see you soon 
 ron 
 calm down harry said as the small owl flew low over his head twittering madly with what harry could only assume was pride at having delivered the letter to the right person come here i need you to take my answer back 
 
 the owl fluttered down on top of cage hedwig looked coldly up at it as though daring it to try and come any closer 
 
 harry seized his quill once more grabbed a fresh piece of parchment and wrote 
 
 ron all okay the muggles say i can come see you five tomorrow wait 
 harry 
 he folded this note up very small and with immense difficulty tied it to the tiny leg as it hopped on the spot with excitement the moment the note was secure the owl was off again it zoomed out of the window and out of sight 
 
 harry turned to hedwig 
 
 feeling up to a long journey he asked her 
 
 hedwig hooted in a dignified sort of a way 
 
 can you take this to sirius for me he said picking up his letter hang oni just want to finish it 
 
 he unfolded the parchment and hastily added a postscript 
 
 if you want to contact me be at my friend ron for the rest of the summer his got us tickets for the quidditch world cup 
 the letter finished he tied it to leg she kept unusually still as though determined to show him how a real post owl should behave 
 
 be at when you get back all right harry told her 
 
 she nipped his finger affectionately then with a soft swooshing noise spread her enormous wings and soared out of the open window 
 
 harry watched her out of sight then crawled under his bed wrenched up the loose floorboard and pulled out a large chunk of birthday cake he sat there on the floor eating it savoring the happiness that was flooding through him he had cake and dudley had nothing but grapefruit it was a bright day he would be leaving privet drive tomorrow his scar felt perfectly normal again and he was going to watch the quidditch world cup it was hard just now to feel worried about anything even lord voldemort

 the goblet of fire 
 

lionfish nov chapter three the advance guardcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 just been attacked by dementors and i might be expelled from hogwarts i want to know going on and when going to get out of here 
 
 harry copied these words on to three separate pieces of parchment the moment he reached the desk in his dark bedroom he addressed the first to sirius the second to ron and the third to hermione his owl hedwig was off hunting her cage stood empty on the desk harry paced the bedroom waiting for her to come back his head pounding his brain too busy for sleep even though his eyes stung and itched with tiredness his back ached from hauling dudley home and the two lumps on his head where the window and dudley had hit him were throbbing painfully 
 
 up and down he paced consumed with anger and frustration grinding his teeth and clenching his fists casting angry looks out at the empty sky every time he passed the window dementors sent to get him mrs figg and mundungus fletcher tailing him in secret then suspension from hogwarts and a hearing at the ministry of magicand still no one was telling him what was going on 
 
 and what what had that howler been about whose voice had echoed so horribly so menacingly through the kitchen 
 
 why was he still trapped here without information why was everyone treating him like some naughty kid do any more magic stay in the house 
 
 he kicked his school trunk as he passed it but far from relieving his anger he felt worse as he now had a sharp pain in his toe to deal with in addition to the pain in the rest of his body 
 
 just as he limped past the window hedwig soared through it with a soft rustle of wings like a small ghost 
 
 about time harry snarled as she landed lightly on top of her cage you can put that down got work for you 
 
 large round amber eyes gazed at him reproachfully over the dead frog clamped in her beak 
 
 come here said harry picking up the three small rolls of parchment and a leather thong and tying the scrolls to her scaly leg take these straight to sirius ron and hermione and come back here without good long replies keep pecking them till written answers if got to understand 
 
 hedwig gave a muffled hooting noise her beak still full of frog 
 
 get going then said harry 
 
 she took off immediately the moment gone harry threw himself down on his bed without undressing and stared at the dark ceiling in addition to every other miserable feeling he now felt guilty that been irritable with hedwig she was the only friend he had at number four privet drive but make it up to her when she came back with the answers from sirius ron and hermione 
 
 they were bound to write back quickly they possibly ignore a dementor attack probably wake up tomorrow to three fat letters full of sympathy and plans for his immediate removal to the burrow and with that comforting idea sleep rolled over him stifling all further thought 
 
 
 
 
 but hedwig return next morning harry spent the day in his bedroom leaving it only to go to the bathroom three times that day aunt petunia shoved food into his room through the uncle vernon had installed three summers ago every time harry heard her approaching he tried to question her about the howler but he might as well have interrogated the doorknob for all the answers he got otherwise the dursleys kept well clear of his bedroom harry see the point of forcing his company on them another row would achieve nothing except perhaps make him so angry perform more illegal magic 
 
 so it went on for three whole days harry was alternately filled with restless energy that made him unable to settle to anything during which time he paced his bedroom furious at the whole lot of them for leaving him to stew in this mess and with a lethargy so complete that he could lie on his bed for an hour at a time staring dazedly into space aching with dread at the thought of the ministry hearing 
 
 what if they ruled against him what if he was expelled and his wand was snapped in half what would he do where would he go he could not return to living with the dursleys not now he knew the other world the one to which he really belonged might he be able to move into house as sirius had suggested a year ago before he had been forced to flee from the ministry would harry be allowed to live there alone given that he was still underage or would the matter of where he went next be decided for him had his breach of the international statute of secrecy been severe enough to land him in a cell in azkaban whenever this thought occurred harry invariably slid off his bed and began pacing again 
 
 on the fourth night after departure harry was lying in one of his apathetic phases staring at the ceiling his exhausted mind quite blank when his uncle entered his bedroom harry looked slowly around at him uncle vernon was wearing his best suit and an expression of enormous smugness 
 
 going out he said 
 
 sorry 
 
 wethat is to say your aunt dudley and iare going out 
 
 fine said harry dully looking back at the ceiling 
 
 you are not to leave your bedroom while we are away 
 
 ok 
 
 you are not to touch the television the stereo or any of our possessions 
 
 right 
 
 you are not to steal food from the fridge 
 
 ok 
 
 i am going to lock your door 
 
 you do that 
 
 uncle vernon glared at harry clearly suspicious of this lack of argument then stomped out of the room and closed the door behind him harry heard the key turn in the lock and uncle footsteps walking heavily down the stairs a few minutes later he heard the slamming of car doors the rumble of an engine and the unmistakeable sound of the car sweeping out of the drive 
 
 harry had no particular feeling about the dursleys leaving it made no difference to him whether they were in the house or not he could not even summon the energy to get up and turn on his bedroom light the room grew steadily darker around him as he lay listening to the night sounds through the window he kept open all the time waiting for the blessed moment when hedwig returned 
 
 the empty house creaked around him the pipes gurgled harry lay there in a kind of stupor thinking of nothing suspended in misery 
 
 then quite distinctly he heard a crash in the kitchen below 
 
 he sat bolt upright listening intently the dursleys be back it was much too soon and in any case he heard their car 
 
 there was silence for a few seconds then voices 
 
 burglars he thought sliding off the bed on to his feetbut a split second later it occurred to him that burglars would keep their voices down and whoever was moving around in the kitchen was certainly not troubling to do so 
 
 he snatched up his wand from the bedside table and stood facing his bedroom door listening with all his might next moment he jumped as the lock gave a loud click and his door swung open 
 
 harry stood motionless staring through the open doorway at the dark upstairs landing straining his ears for further sounds but none came he hesitated for a moment then moved swiftly and silently out of his room to the head of the stairs 
 
 his heart shot upwards into his throat there were people standing in the shadowy hall below silhouetted against the streetlight glowing through the glass door eight or nine of them all as far as he could see looking up at him 
 
 lower your wand boy before you take eye out said a low growling voice 
 
 heart was thumping uncontrollably he knew that voice but he did not lower his wand 
 
 professor moody he said uncertainly 
 
 i know so much about professor growled the voice never got round to much teaching did i get down here we want to see you properly 
 
 harry lowered his wand slightly but did not relax his grip on it nor did he move he had very good reason to be suspicious he had recently spent nine months in what he had thought was company only to find out that it moody at all but an impostor an impostor moreover who 
 
 all right harry come to take you away 
 
 heart leapt he knew that voice too though he heard it for over a year 
 
 lupin he said disbelievingly is that you 
 
 why are we all standing in the dark said a third voice this one completely unfamiliar a lumos 
 
 a flared illuminating the hall with magical light harry blinked the people below were crowded around the foot of the stairs gazing up at him intently some craning their heads for a better look 
 
 remus lupin stood nearest to him though still quite young lupin looked tired and rather ill he had more grey hairs than when harry had last said to him and his robes were more patched and shabbier than ever nevertheless he was smiling broadly at harry who tried to smile back despite his state of shock 
 
 oooh he looks just like i thought he would said the witch who was holding her lit wand aloft she looked the youngest there she had a pale face dark twinkling eyes and short spiky hair that was a violent shade of violet wotcher harry 
 
 yeah i see what you mean remus said a bald black wizard standing furthest back he had a deep slow voice and wore a single gold hoop in his ear he looks exactly like james 
 
 except the eyes said a wizard at the back eyes 
 
 moody who had long grizzled grey hair and a large chunk missing from his nose was squinting suspiciously at harry through his mismatched eyes one eye was small dark and beady the other large round and electric bluethe magical eye that could see through walls doors and the back of own head 
 
 are you quite sure him lupin he growled be a nice lookout if we bring back some death eater impersonating him we ought to ask him something only the real potter would know unless anyone brought any veritaserum 
 
 harry what form does your patronus take lupin asked 
 
 a stag said harry nervously 
 
 him said lupin 
 
 very conscious of everybody still staring at him harry descended the stairs stowing his wand in the back pocket of his jeans as he came 
 
 put your wand there boy roared moody what if it ignited better wizards than you have lost buttocks you know 
 
 who know lost a buttock the woman asked interestedly 
 
 never you mind you just keep your wand out of your back pocket growled elementary nobody bothers about it any more he stumped off towards the kitchen and i saw that he added irritably as the woman rolled her eyes towards the ceiling 
 
 lupin held out his hand and shook 
 
 how are you he asked looking closely at harry 
 
 
 
 harry could hardly believe this was real four weeks with nothing not the tiniest hint of a plan to remove him from privet drive and suddenly a whole bunch of wizards was standing in the house as though this was a arrangement he glanced at the people surrounding lupin they were still gazing avidly at him he felt very conscious of the fact that he had not combed his hair for four days 
 
 really lucky the dursleys are out he mumbled 
 
 lucky ha said the woman it was me who lured them out of the way sent a letter by muggle post telling them been for the best kept suburban lawn competition heading off to the right now or they think they are 
 
 harry had a fleeting vision of uncle face when he realised there was no best kept suburban lawn competition 
 
 we are leaving we he asked soon 
 
 almost at once said lupin just waiting for the 
 
 where are we going the burrow harry asked hopefully 
 
 not the burrow no said lupin motioning harry towards the kitchen the little knot of wizards followed all still eyeing harry curiously too risky set up headquarters somewhere taken a while 
 
 moody was now sitting at the kitchen table swigging from a hip flask his magical eye spinning in all directions taking in the dursleys many appliances 
 
 this is alastor moody harry lupin continued pointing towards moody 
 
 yeah i know said harry uncomfortably it felt odd to be introduced to somebody thought known for a year 
 
 and this is nymphadora 
 
 call me nymphadora remus said the young witch with a shudder tonks 
 
 nymphadora tonks who prefers to be known by her surname only finished lupin 
 
 so would you if your fool of a mother had called you nymphadora muttered tonks 
 
 and this is kingsley indicated the tall black wizard who wizard diggle 
 
 met before squeaked the excitable diggle dropping his top hat 
 
 emmeline witch in an emerald green shawl inclined her wizard with thick hair hestia jones a witch waved from next to the toaster 
 
 harry inclined his head awkwardly at each of them as they were introduced he wished they would look at something other than him it was as though he had suddenly been ushered he also wondered why so many of them were there 
 
 a surprising number of people volunteered to come and get you said lupin as though he had read mind the corners of his mouth twitched slightly 
 
 yeah well the more the better said moody darkly your guard potter 
 
 just waiting for the signal to tell us safe to set off said lupin glancing out of the kitchen window got about fifteen minutes 
 
 very clean they these muggles said the witch called tonks who was looking around the kitchen with great interest my and a right old slob i suppose it varies just as it does with wizards 
 
 eryeah said harry turned back to going on i heard anything from anyone vol 
 
 several of the witches and wizards made odd hissing noises dedalus diggle dropped his hat again and moody growled shut up 
 
 what said harry 
 
 not discussing anything here too risky said moody turning his normal eye on harry his magical eye remained focused on the ceiling damn it he added angrily putting a hand up to the magical eye it keeps getting stuckever since that scum wore it 
 
 and with a nasty squelching sound much like a plunger being pulled from a sink he popped out his eye 
 
 you do know disgusting you said tonks conversationally 
 
 get me a glass of water would you harry requested moody 
 
 harry crossed to the dishwasher took out a clean glass and filled it with water at the sink still watched eagerly by the band of wizards their relentless staring was starting to annoy him 
 
 cheers said moody when harry handed him the glass he dropped the magical eyeball into the water and prodded it up and down the eye whizzed around staring at them all in turn i want three hundred and sixty degrees visibility on the return journey 
 
 we gettingwherever going harry asked 
 
 brooms said lupin only way too young to apparate be watching the floo network and more than our worth to set up an unauthorised portkey 
 
 remus says a good flier said kingsley shacklebolt in his deep voice 
 
 excellent said lupin who was checking his watch anyway better go and get packed harry we want to be ready to go when the signal comes 
 
 come and help you said tonks brightly 
 
 she followed harry back into the hall and up the stairs looking around with much curiosity and interest 
 
 funny place she said a bit too clean know what i mean bit unnatural oh this is better she added as they entered bedroom and he turned on the light 
 
 his room was certainly much messier than the rest of the house confined to it for four days in a very bad mood harry had not bothered tidying up after himself most of the books he owned were strewn over the floor where tried to distract himself with each in turn and thrown it aside cage needed cleaning out and was starting to smell and his trunk lay open revealing a jumbled mixture of muggle clothes and wizards robes that had spilled on to the floor around it 
 
 harry started picking up books and throwing them hastily into his trunk tonks paused at his open wardrobe to look critically at her reflection in the mirror on the inside of the door 
 
 you know i think really my colour she said pensively tugging at a lock of spiky hair think it makes me look a bit peaky 
 
 er said harry looking up at her over the top of quidditch teams of britain and ireland 
 
 yeah it does said tonks decisively she screwed up her eyes in a strained expression as though she was struggling to remember something a second later her hair had turned pink 
 
 how did you do that said harry gaping at her as she opened her eyes again 
 
 a metamorphmagus she said looking back at her reflection and turning her head so that she could see her hair from all directions it means i can change my appearance at will she added spotting puzzled expression in the mirror behind her i was born one i got top marks in concealment and disguise during auror training without any study at all it was great 
 
 an auror said harry impressed being a was the only career ever considered after hogwarts 
 
 yeah said tonks looking proud kingsley is as well a bit higher up than me though i only qualified a year ago nearly failed on stealth and tracking dead clumsy did you hear me break that plate when we arrived downstairs 
 
 can you learn how to be a metamorphmagus harry asked her straightening up completely forgetting about packing 
 
 tonks chuckled 
 
 bet you mind hiding that scar sometimes eh 
 
 her eyes found the scar on forehead 
 
 no i mind harry mumbled turning away he did not like people staring at his scar 
 
 well have to learn the hard way afraid said tonks metamorphmagi are really rare born not made most wizards need to use a wand or potions to change their appearance but got to get going harry supposed to be packing she added guiltily looking around at all the mess on the floor 
 
 ohyeah said harry grabbing a few more books 
 
 be stupid be much quicker if ipack cried tonks waving her wand in a long sweeping movement over the floor 
 
 books clothes telescope and scales all soared into the air and flew into the trunk 
 
 not very neat said tonks walking over to the trunk and looking down at the jumble inside my got this knack of getting stuff to fit itself in neatlyshe even gets the socks to fold themselvesbut never mastered how she does a kind of flick she flicked her wand hopefully 
 
 one of socks gave a feeble sort of wiggle and flopped back on top of the mess in the trunk 
 
 ah well said tonks slamming the lid shut at least all in that could do with a bit of cleaning too she pointed her wand at cage scourgify a few feathers and droppings vanished well a bit better never quite got the hang of these householdy sort of spells rightgot everything cauldron broom wow a firebolt 
 
 her eyes widened as they fell on the broomstick in right hand it was his pride and joy a gift from sirius an broomstick 
 
 and still riding a comet two sixty said tonks enviously ah well wand still in your jeans both buttocks still on ok go locomotor trunk 
 
 trunk rose a few inches into the air holding her wand like a conductors baton tonks made the trunk hover across the room and out of the door ahead of them cage in her left hand harry followed her down the stairs carrying his broomstick 
 
 back in the kitchen moody had replaced his eye which was spinning so fast after its cleaning it made harry feel sick to look at it kingsley shacklebolt and sturgis podmore were examining the microwave and hestia jones was laughing at a potato peeler she had come across while rummaging in the drawers lupin was sealing a letter addressed to the dursleys 
 
 excellent said lupin looking up as tonks and harry entered got about a minute i think we should probably get out into the garden so ready harry left a letter telling your aunt and uncle not to worry 
 
 they said harry 
 
 that safe 
 
 just depress them 
 
 and see them next summer 
 
 do i have to 
 
 lupin smiled but made no answer 
 
 come here boy said moody gruffly beckoning harry towards him with his wand i need to disillusion you 
 
 you need to what said harry nervously 
 
 disillusionment charm said moody raising his wand lupin says got an invisibility cloak but it stay on while flying disguise you better here you go 
 
 he rapped him hard on the top of the head and harry felt a curious sensation as though moody had just smashed an egg there cold trickles seemed to be running down his body from the point the wand had struck 
 
 nice one said tonks appreciatively staring at midriff 
 
 harry looked down at his body or rather what had been his body for it look anything like his any more it was not invisible it had simply taken on the exact colour and texture of the kitchen unit behind him he seemed to have become a human chameleon 
 
 come on said moody unlocking the back door with his wand 
 
 they all stepped outside on to uncle beautifully kept lawn 
 
 clear night grunted moody his magical eye scanning the heavens done with a bit more cloud cover right you he barked at harry going to be flying in close formation be right in front of you keep close on her tail be covering you from below going to be behind you the be circling us we break ranks for anything got me if one of us is killed 
 
 is that likely harry asked apprehensively but moody ignored him 
 
 the others keep flying stop break ranks if they take out all of us and you survive harry the rear guard are standing by to take over keep flying east and join you 
 
 stop being so cheerful think not taking this seriously said tonks as she strapped trunk and cage into a harness hanging from her broom 
 
 just telling the boy the plan growled moody our to deliver him safely to headquarters and if we die in the attempt 
 
 no going to die said kingsley shacklebolt in his deep calming voice 
 
 mount your brooms the first signal said lupin sharply pointing into the sky 
 
 far far above them a shower of bright red sparks had flared among the stars harry recognised them at once as wand sparks he swung his right leg over his firebolt gripped its handle tightly and felt it vibrating very slightly as though it was as keen as he was to be up in the air once more 
 
 second signal go said lupin loudly as more sparks green this time exploded high above them 
 
 harry kicked off hard from the ground the cool night air rushed through his hair as the neat square gardens of privet drive fell away shrinking rapidly into a patchwork of dark greens and blacks and every thought of the ministry hearing was swept from his mind as though the rush of air had blown it out of his head he felt as though his heart was going to explode with pleasure he was flying again flying away from privet drive as been fantasising about all summer he was going home for a few glorious moments all his problems seemed to recede to nothing insignificant in the vast starry sky 
 
 hard left hard left a muggle looking up shouted moody from behind him tonks swerved and harry followed her watching his trunk swinging wildly beneath her broom we need more height give it another quarter of a mile 
 
 eyes watered in the chill as they soared upwards he could see nothing below now but tiny pinpricks of light that were car headlights and streetlamps two of those tiny lights might belong to uncle car the dursleys would be heading back to their empty house right now full of rage about the nonexistent lawn competition and harry laughed aloud at the thought though his voice was drowned by the flapping robes of the others the creaking of the harness holding his trunk and the cage and the whoosh of the wind in their ears as they sped through the air he had not felt this alive in a month or this happy 
 
 bearing south shouted town ahead 
 
 they soared right to avoid passing directly over the glittering spiderweb of lights below 
 
 bear southeast and keep climbing some low cloud ahead we can lose ourselves in called moody 
 
 not going through clouds shouted tonks angrily get soaked 
 
 harry was relieved to hear her say this his hands were growing numb on the handle he wished he had thought to put on a coat he was starting to shiver 
 
 they altered their course every now and then according to instructions eyes were screwed up against the rush of icy wind that was starting to make his ears ache he could remember being this cold on a broom only once before during the quidditch match against hufflepuff in his third year which had taken place in a storm the guard around him was circling continuously like giant birds of prey harry lost track of time he wondered how long they had been flying it felt like an hour at least 
 
 turning southwest yelled moody we want to avoid the motorway 
 
 harry was now so chilled he thought longingly of the snug dry interiors of the cars streaming along below then even more longingly of travelling by floo powder it might be uncomfortable to spin around in fireplaces but it was at least warm in the flames kingsley shacklebolt swooped around him bald pate and earring gleaming slightly in the moonlight now emmeline vance was on his right her wand out her head turning left and right then she too swooped over him to be replaced by sturgis podmore 
 
 we ought to double back for a bit just to make sure not being followed moody shouted 
 
 are you mad tonks screamed from the front all frozen to our brooms if we keep going not going to get there until next week besides nearly there now 
 
 time to start the descent came voice follow tonks harry 
 
 harry followed tonks into a dive they were heading for the largest collection of lights he had yet seen a huge sprawling crisscrossing mass glittering in lines and grids interspersed with patches of deepest black lower and lower they flew until harry could see individual headlights and streetlamps chimneys and television aerials he wanted to reach the ground very much though he felt sure someone would have to unfreeze him from his broom 
 
 here we go called tonks and a few seconds later she had landed 
 
 harry touched down right behind her and dismounted on a patch of unkempt grass in the middle of a small square tonks was already unbuckling trunk shivering harry looked around the grimy fronts of the surrounding houses were not welcoming some of them had broken windows glimmering dully in the light from the streetlamps paint was peeling from many of the doors and heaps of rubbish lay outside several sets of front steps 
 
 where are we harry asked but lupin said quietly in a minute 
 
 moody was rummaging in his cloak his gnarled hands clumsy with cold 
 
 got it he muttered raising what looked like a silver cigarette lighter into the air and clicking it 
 
 the nearest streetlamp went out with a pop he clicked the unlighter again the next lamp went out he kept clicking until every lamp in the square was extinguished and the only remaining light came from curtained windows and the sickle moon overhead 
 
 borrowed it from dumbledore growled moody pocketing the take care of any muggles looking out of the window see now come on quick 
 
 he took harry by the arm and led him from the patch of grass across the road and on to the pavement lupin and tonks followed carrying trunk between them the rest of the guard all with their wands out flanking them 
 
 the muffled pounding of a stereo was coming from an upper window in the nearest house a pungent smell of rotting rubbish came from the pile of bulging just inside the broken gate 
 
 here moody muttered thrusting a piece of parchment towards disillusioned hand and holding his lit wand close to it so as to illuminate the writing read quickly and memorise 
 
 harry looked down at the piece of paper the narrow handwriting was vaguely familiar it said 
 
 the headquarters of the order of the phoenix may be found at number twelve grimmauld place london 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter three will and prev chapter next chapter 
 harry potter was snoring loudly he had been sitting in a chair beside his bedroom window for the best part of four hours staring out at the darkening street and had finally fallen asleep with one side of his face pressed against the cold his glasses askew and his mouth wide open the misty fug his breath had left on the window sparkled in the orange glare of the streetlamp outside and the artificial light drained his face of all color so that he looked ghostly beneath his shock of untidy black hair 
 
 the room was strewn with various possessions and a good smattering of rubbish owl feathers apple cores and sweet wrappers littered the floor a number of spellbooks lay among the tangled robes on his bed and a mess of newspapers sat in a puddle of light on his desk the headline of one blared 
 
 harry potter the chosen one 
 
 rumors continue to fly about the mysterious recent disturbance at the ministry of magic during which was sighted once more 
 
 not allowed to talk about it ask me anything said one agitated obliviator who refused to give his name as he left the ministry last night 
 
 nevertheless highly placed sources within the ministry have confirmed that the disturbance centered on the fabled hall of prophecy 
 
 though ministry spokeswizards have hitherto refused even to confirm the existence of such a place a growing number of the wizarding community believe that the death eaters now serving sentences in azkaban for trespass and attempted theft were attempting to steal a prophecy the nature of that prophecy is unknown although speculation is rife that it concerns harry potter the only person ever known to have survived the killing curse and who is also known to have been at the ministry on the night in question some are going so far as to call potter the chosen one believing that the prophecy names him as the only one who will be able to rid us of 
 
 the current whereabouts of the prophecy if it exists are unknown although cont page column 
 
 a second newspaper lay beside the first this one bore the headline 
 
 scrimgeour succeeds fudge 
 most of this front page was taken up with a large picture of a man with a lionlike mane of thick hair and a rather ravaged face the picture was movingthe man was waving at the ceiling 
 
 rufus scrimgeour previously head of the auror office in the department of magical law enforcement has succeeded cornelius fudge as minister of magic the appointment has largely been greeted with enthusiasm by the wizarding community though rumors of a rift between the new minister and albus dumbledore newly reinstated chief warlock of the wizengamot surfaced within hours of scrimgeour taking office 
 representatives admitted that he had met with dumbledore at once upon taking possession of the top job but refused to comment on the topics under discussion albus dumbledore is known to cont page column 
 to the left of this paper sat another which had been folded so that a story bearing the title ministry guarantees students safety safety was visible 
 
 newly appointed minister of magic rufus scrimgeour spoke today of the tough new measures taken by his ministry to ensure the safety of students returning to hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry this autumn 
 for obvious reasons the ministry will not be going into detail about its stringent new security plans said the minister although an insider confirmed that measures include defensive spells and charms a complex array of and a small task force of aurors dedicated solely to the protection of hogwarts school 
 most seem reassured by the new tough stand on student safety said mrs augusta longbottom my grandson neville good friend of harry incidentally who fought the death eaters alongside him at the ministry in june and 
 but the rest of this story was obscured by the large birdcage standing on top of it inside it was a magnificent snowy owl her amber eyes surveyed the room imperiously her head swiveling occasionally to gaze at her snoring master once or twice she clicked her beak impatiently but harry was too deeply asleep to hear her 
 
 a large trunk stood in the very middle of the room its lid was open it looked expectant yet it was almost empty but for a residue of old underwear sweets empty ink bottles and broken quills that coated the very bottom nearby on the floor lay a purple leaflet emblazoned with the words 
 
 issued on behalf of the ministry of magic 
 
 protecting your home and family against dark forces 
 
 the wizarding community is currently under threat from an organization calling itself the death eaters observing the following simple security guidelines will help protect you your family and your home from attack 
 
 you are advised not to leave the house alone 
 
 particular care should be taken during the hours of darkness wherever possible arrange to complete journeys before night has fallen 
 
 review the security arrangements around your house making sure that all family members are aware of emergency measures such as shield and disillusionment charms and in the case of underage family members 
 
 agree on security questions with close friends and family so as to detect death eaters masquerading as others by use of the polyjuice potion see page 
 
 should you feel that a family member colleague friend or neighbor is acting in a strange manner contact the magical law enforcement squad at once they may have been put under the imperius curse see page 
 
 should the dark mark appear over any dwelling place or other building do not enter but contact the auror office immediately 
 
 unconfirmed sightings suggest that the death eaters may now be using inferi see page any sighting of an inferius or encounter with same should be reported to the ministry immediately 
 
 harry grunted in his sleep and his face slid down the window an inch or so making his glasses still more lopsided but he did not wake up an alarm clock repaired by harry several years ago ticked loudly on the sill showing one minute to eleven beside it held in place by relaxed hand was a piece of parchment covered in thin slanting writing harry had read this letter so often since its arrival three days ago that although it had been delivered in a tightly furled scroll it now lay quite flat 
 
 dear harry 
 
 if it is convenient to you i shall call at number four privet drive this coming friday at eleven to escort you to the burrow where you have been invited to spend the remainder of your school holidays 
 
 if you are agreeable i should also be glad of your assistance in a matter to which i hope to attend on the way to the burrow i shall explain this more fully when i see you 
 
 kindly send your answer by return of this owl hoping to see you this friday 
 
 i am yours most sincerely 
 
 albus dumbledore 
 
 though he already knew it by heart harry had been stealing glances at this missive every few minutes since seven that evening when he had first taken up his position beside his bedroom window which had a reasonable view of both ends of privet drive he knew it was pointless to keep rereading words harry had sent back his yes with the delivering owl as requested and all he could do now was wait either dumbledore was going to come or he was not 
 
 but harry had not packed it just seemed too good to be true that he was going to be rescued from the dursleys after a mere fortnight of their company he could not shrug off the feeling that something was going to go wronghis reply to letter might have gone astray dumbledore could be prevented from collecting him the letter might turn out not to be from dumbledore at all but a trick or joke or trap harry had not been able to face packing and then being let down and having to unpack again the only gesture he had made to the possibility of a journey was to shut his snowy owl hedwig safely in her cage 
 
 the minute hand on the alarm clock reached the number twelve and at that precise moment the outside the window went out 
 
 harry awoke as though the sudden darkness were an alarm hastily straightening his glasses and unsticking his cheek from the glass he pressed his nose against the window instead and squinted down at the pavement a tall figure in a long billowing cloak was walking up the garden path 
 
 harry jumped up as though he had received an electric shock knocked over his chair and started snatching anything and everything within reach from the floor and throwing it into the trunk then as he lobbed a set of robes two spellbooks and a packet of clasps across the room the doorbell rang downstairs in the living room his uncle vernon shouted who the blazes is calling at this lime of night 
 
 harry froze with a brass telescope in one hand and a pair of trainers in the other he had completely forgotten to warn the dursleys that dumbledore might be coming feeling both panicky mid close to laughter he clambered over the trunk and wrenched open his bedroom door in time to hear a deep voice say good evening you must be mr dursley i daresay harry has told you i would be coming for him 
 
 harry ran down the stairs two at a time coming to an abrupt halt several steps from the bottom as long experience had taught him to remain out of reach of his uncle whenever possible there in the doorway stood a tall thin man with silver hair and beard spectacles were perched on his crooked nose and he was wearing a long black traveling cloak and pointed hat vernon dursley whose mustache was quite as bushy as though black and who was wearing a puce dressing gown was staring at the visitor as though he could not believe his tiny eyes 
 
 judging by your look of stunned disbelief harry did not warn you that i was coming said dumbledore pleasantly however let us assume that you have invited me warmly into your house it is unwise to linger overlong on doorsteps in these troubled times 
 
 he stepped smartly over the threshold and closed the front door behind him 
 
 it is a long time since my last visit said dumbledore peering down his crooked nose at uncle vernon i must say your agapanthus are flourishing 
 
 vernon dursley said nothing at all harry did not doubt that speech would return to him and soonthe vein pulsing in his temple was reaching danger pointbut something about dumbledore seemed to have robbed him temporarily of breath it might have been the blatant wizardishness of his appearance but it might too have been that even uncle vernon could sense that here was a man whom it would be very difficult to bully 
 
 ah good evening harry said dumbledore looking up at him through his glasses with a most satisfied expression excellent excellent 
 
 these words seemed to rouse uncle vernon it was clear that as far as he was concerned any man who could look at harry and say excellent was a man with whom he could never see eye to eye 
 
 i mean to be rude he began in a tone that threatened rudeness in every syllable 
 
 yet sadly accidental rudeness occurs alarmingly often dumbledore finished the sentence gravely best to say nothing at all my dear man ah and this must be petunia 
 
 the kitchen door had opened and there stood aunt wearing rubber gloves and a housecoat over her nightdress clearly halfway through her usual of all the kitchen surfaces her rather horsey face registered nothing but shock 
 
 albus dumbledore said dumbledore when uncle vernon failed to effect an introduction we have corresponded of course harry thought this an odd way of reminding aunt petunia that he had once sent her an exploding letter but aunt petunia did not challenge the term and this must be your son dudley 
 
 dudley had that moment peered round the living room door his large blond head rising out of the stripy collar of his pajamas looked oddly disembodied his mouth gaping in astonishment and fear dumbledore waited a moment or two apparently to see whether any of the dursleys were going to say anything but as the silence stretched on he smiled 
 
 shall we assume that you have invited me into your sitting room 
 
 dudley scrambled out of the way as dumbledore passed him harry still clutching the telescope and trainers jumped the last few stairs and followed dumbledore who had settled himself in the armchair nearest the fire and was taking in the surroundings wilh an expression of benign interest he looked quite extraordinarily out of place 
 
 we leaving sir harry asked anxiously 
 
 yes indeed we are but there are a few matters we need to discuss first said dumbledore and i would prefer not to do so in the open we shall trespass upon your aunt and hospitality only a little longer 
 
 you will will you 
 
 vernon dursley had entered the room petunia at his shoulder and dudley skulking behind them both 
 
 yes said dumbledore simply i shall 
 
 he drew his wand so rapidly that harry barely saw it with a casual flick the sofa zoomed forward and knocked the knees out from under all three of the dursleys so that they collapsed upon it in a heap another flick of the wand and the sofa zoomed back to its original position 
 
 we may as well be comfortable said dumbledore pleasantly 
 
 as he replaced his wand in his pocket harry saw that his hand was blackened and shriveled it looked as though his flesh had been burned away 
 
 sirwhat happened to your 
 
 later harry said dumbledore please sit down 
 
 harry took the remaining armchair choosing not to look at the dursleys who seemed stunned into silence 
 
 i would assume that you were going to offer me refreshment dumbledore said to uncle vernon but the evidence so far suggests that that would be optimistic to the point of foolishness 
 
 a third twitch of the wand and a dusty bottle and five glasses appeared in midair the bottle tipped and poured a generous measure of liquid into each of the glasses which then floated to each person in the room 
 
 madam finest mead said dumbledore raising his glass to harry who caught hold of his own and sipped he had never tasted anything like it before but enjoyed it immensely the dursleys after quick scared looks at one another tried to ignore their glasses completely a difficult feat as they were nudging them gently on the sides of their heads harry could not suppress a suspicion that dumbledore was rather enjoying himself 
 
 well harry said dumbledore turning toward him a difficulty has arisen which i hope you will be able to solve for us by us i mean the order of the phoenix but first of all i must tell you that will was discovered a week ago and that he left you everything he owned 
 
 over on the sofa uncle vernons head turned but harry did not look at him nor could he think of anything to say except oh right 
 
 this is in the main fairly straightforward dumbledore went on you add a reasonable amount of gold to your account at gringotts and you inherit all of personal possessions the slightly problematic part of the legacy 
 
 his dead said uncle vernon loudly from the sofa dumbledore and harry both turned to look at him the glass of mead was now knocking quite insistently on the side of head he attempted to beat it away dead his godfather 
 
 yes said dumbledore he did not ask harry why he had not confided in the dursleys our problem he continued to harry as if there had been no interruption is that sirius also left you number twelve grimmauld place 
 
 been left a house said uncle vernon greedily his small eyes narrowing but nobody answered him 
 
 you can keep using it as headquarters said harry i care you can have it i really want it harry never wanted to set foot in number twelve grimmauld place again if he could help it he thought he would be haunted forever by the memory of sirius prowling its dark musty rooms alone imprisoned within the place he had wanted so desperately to leave 
 
 that is generous said dumbledore we have however vacated the building temporarily 
 
 why 
 
 well said dumbledore ignoring the mutterings of uncle vernon who was now being rapped smartly over the head by the persistent glass of mead black family tradition decreed that the house was handed down the direct line to the next male with the name of black sirius was the very last of the line as his younger brother regulus predeceased him and both were childless while his will makes it perfectly plain that he wants you to have the house it is nevertheless possible that some spell or enchantment has been set upon the place to ensure that it cannot be owned by anyone other than a 
 
 a vivid image of the shrieking spitting portrait of mother that hung in the hall of number twelve grimmauld place flashed into mind i bet there has he said 
 
 quite said dumbledore and if such an enchantment exists then the ownership of the house is most likely to pass to the eldest of living relatives which would mean his cousin bellatrix lestrange 
 
 without realizing what he was doing harry sprang to his feet the telescope and trainers in his lap rolled across the floor bellatrix lestrange killer inherit his house 
 
 no he said 
 
 well obviously we would prefer that she get it either said dumbledore calmly the situation is fraught with complications we do not know whether the enchantments we ourselves have placed upon it for example making it unplottable will hold now that ownership has passed from hands it might be that bellatrix will arrive on the doorstep at any moment naturally we had to move out until such time as we have clarified the position 
 
 but how are you going to find out if allowed to own it 
 
 fortunately said dumbledore there is a simple test 
 
 he placed his empty glass on a small table beside his chair but before he could do anything else uncle vernon shouted will you get these ruddy things off us 
 
 harry looked around all three of the dursleys were cowering with their arms over their heads as their glasses bounced up and down on their skulls their contents flying everywhere 
 
 oh so sorry said dumbledore politely and he raised his wand again all three glasses vanished but it would have been better manners to drink it you know 
 
 it looked as though uncle vernon was bursting with any number of unpleasant retorts but he merely shrank back into the cushions with aunt petunia and dudley and said nothing keeping his small piggy eyes on wand 
 
 you see dumbledore said turning back to harry and again speaking as though uncle vernon had not uttered if you have indeed inherited the house you have also inherited 
 
 he flicked his wand for a fifth time there was a loud crack and a appeared with a snout for a nose giant ears and enormous bloodshot eyes crouching on the dursleys shag carpet and covered in grimy rags aunt petunia let out a shriek nothing this filthy had entered her house in living memory dudley drew his large bare pink feet off the floor and sat with them raised almost above his head as though he thought the creature might run up his pajama trousers and uncle vernon bellowed what the hell is that 
 
 kreacher finished dumbledore 
 
 kreacher kreacher kreacher croaked the quite as loudly as uncle vernon stamping his long gnarled feet and pulling his ears kreacher belongs to miss bellatrix oh yes kreacher belongs to the blacks kreacher wants his new mistress kreacher go to the potter brat kreacher 
 
 as you can see harry said dumbledore loudly over continued croaks of wont kreacher is showing a certain reluctance to pass into your ownership 
 
 i care said harry again looking with disgust at the writhing stamping i want him 
 
 
 
 you would prefer him to pass into the ownership of bellatrix lestrange bearing in mind that he has lived at the headquarters of the order of the phoenix for the past year 
 
 
 
 harry stared at dumbledore he knew that kreacher could not be permitted to go and live with bellatrix lestrange but the idea of owning him of having responsibility for the creature that had betrayed sirius was repugnant 
 
 give him an order said dumbledore if he has passed into your ownership he will have to obey if not then we shall have to think of some other means of keeping him from his rightful mistress 
 
 
 
 voice had risen to a scream harry could think of nothing to say except kreacher shut up 
 
 it looked for a moment as though kreacher was going to choke he grabbed his throat his mouth still working furiously his eyes bulging after a few seconds of frantic gulping he threw himself face forward onto the carpet aunt petunia whimpered and beat the floor with his hands and feet giving himself over to a violent but entirely silent tantrum 
 
 well that simplifies matters said dumbledore cheerfully it means that sirius knew what he was doing you are the rightful owner of number twelve grimmauld place and of kreacher 
 
 do ido i have to keep him with me harry asked aghast as kreacher thrashed around at his feet 
 
 not if you want to said dumbledore if i might make a suggestion you could send him to hogwarts to work in the kitchen there in that way the other could keep an eye on him 
 
 yeah said harry in relief yeah do that erkreacheri want you to go to hogwarts and work in the kitchens there with the other 
 
 kreacher who was now lying flat on his back with his arms and legs in the air gave harry one look of deepest loathing and with another loud crack vanished 
 
 good said dumbledore there is also the matter of the hippogriff buckbeak hagrid has been looking after him since sirius died but buckbeak is yours now so if you would prefer to make different arrangements 
 
 no said harry at once he can stay with hagrid i think buckbeak would prefer that 
 
 hagrid will be delighted said dumbledore smiling he was thrilled to see buckbeak again incidentally we have decided in the interests of safety to rechristen him witherwings for the time being though i doubt that the ministry would ever guess he is the hippogriff they once sentenced to death now harry is your trunk packed 
 
 erm 
 
 doubtful that i would turn up dumbledore suggested shrewdly 
 
 just go anderfinish off said harry hastily hurrying to pick up his fallen telescope and trainers 
 
 it took him a little over ten minutes to track down everything he needed at last he had managed to extract his invisibility cloak from under the bed screwed the top back on his jar of ink and forced the lid of his trunk shut on his cauldron then heaving his trunk in one hand and holding cage in the other he made his way back downstairs 
 
 he was disappointed to discover that dumbledore was not waiting in the hall which meant that he had to return to the living room 
 
 nobody was talking dumbledore was humming quietly apparently quite at his ease but the atmosphere was thicker than cold custard and harry did not dare look at the dursleys as he said ready now 
 
 good said dumbledore just one last thing then and he turned to speak to the dursleys once more 
 
 as you will no doubt be aware harry comes of age in a time 
 
 no said aunt petunia speaking for the first time since arrival 
 
 sorry said dumbledore politely 
 
 no he a month younger than dudley and dudders turn eighteen until the year after next 
 
 ah said dumbledore pleasantly but in the wizarding world we come of age at seventeen 
 
 uncle vernon muttered preposterous but dumbledore ignored him 
 
 now as you already know the wizard called lord voldemort has returned to this country the wizarding community is currently in a state of open warfare harry whom lord voldemort has already attempted to kill on a number of occasions is in even greater danger now than the day when i left him upon your doorstep fifteen years ago with a letter explaining about his parents murder and expressing the hope that you would care for him as though he were your own 
 
 dumbledore paused and although his voice remained light and calm and he gave no obvious sign of anger harry felt a kind of chill emanating from him and noticed that the dursleys drew very slightly closer together 
 
 you did not do as i asked you have never treated harry as a son he has known nothing but neglect and often cruelty at your hands the best that can be said is that he has at least escaped the appalling damage you have inflicted upon the unfortunate boy sitting between you 
 
 both aunt petunia and uncle vernon looked around instinctively as though expecting to see someone other than dudley squeezed between them 
 
 usmistreat dudders what began uncle vernon furiously but dumbledore raised his ringer for silence a silence which fell as though he had struck uncle vernon dumb 
 
 the magic i evoked fifteen years ago means that harry has powerful protection while he can still call this house home however miserable he has been here however unwelcome however badly treated you have at least grudgingly allowed him houseroom this magic will cease to operate the moment that harry turns seventeen in other words at the moment he becomes a man i ask only this that you allow harry to return once more to this house before his seventeenth birthday which will ensure that the protection continues until that time 
 
 none of the dursleys said anything dudley was frowning slightly as though he was still trying to work out when he had ever been mistreated uncle vernon looked as though he had something stuck in his throat aunt petunia however was oddly flushed 
 
 well harry time for us to be off said dumbledore at last standing up and straightening his long black cloak until we meet again he said to the dursleys who looked as though that moment could wait forever as far as they were concerned and after doffing his hat he swept from the room 
 
 bye said harry hastily to the dursleys and followed dumbledore who paused beside trunk upon which cage was perched 
 
 we do not want to be encumbered by these just now he said pulling out his wand again i shall send them to the burrow to await us there however i would like you to bring your invisibility cloak just in case 
 
 harry extracted his cloak from his trunk with some difficulty trying not to show dumbledore the mess within when he had stuffed it into an inside pocket of his jacket dumbiedore waved his wand and the trunk cage and hedwig vanished dumbledore then waved his wand again and the front door opened onto cool misty darkness 
 
 and now harry let us step out into the night and pursue that flighty temptress adventure

lionfish nov chapter three the dursleys departingcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 the sound of the front door slamming echoed up the stairs and a voice roared oh you 
 
 sixteen years of being addressed thus left harry in no doubt when his uncle was calling nevertheless he did not immediately respond he was still at the narrow fragment in which for a split second he had thought he saw dumbledores eye it was not until his uncle bellowed boy that harry got slowly out of bed and headed for the bedroom door pausing to add the piece of broken mirror to the rucksack filled with things he would be taking with him 
 
 you took you time roared vernon dursley when harry appeared at the top of the stairs get down here i want a word 
 
 harry strolled downstairs his hands deep in his pants pockets when he searched the living room he found all three dursleys they were dressed for packing uncle vernon in an old jacket and dudley harrys large blond muscular cousin in his leather jacket 
 
 yes asked harry 
 
 sit down said uncle vernon harry raised his eyebrows please added uncle vernon wincing slightly as though the word was sharp in his throat harry sat he thought he knew what was coming his uncle began to pace up and down aunt petunia and dudley following his movement with anxious expressions finally his large purple face crumpled with concentration uncle vernon stopped in front of harry and spoke 
 
 ive changed my mind he said 
 
 what a surprise said harry 
 
 dont you take that tone c began aunt petunia in a shrill voice but vernon dursley waved her down its all a lot of claptrap said uncle vernon glaring at harry with piggy little eyes ive decided i dont believe a word of it were staying put were not going anywhere 
 
 harry looked up at his uncle and felt a mixture of exasperation and amusement vernon dursley had been changing his mind every twenty four hours for the past four weeks packing and unpacking and repacking the car with every change of heart harrys favorite moment had been the one when uncle vernon unaware that dudley had added his dumbbells to his case since the last time it been repacked had attempted to hoist it back into the boot and collapsed with a yelp of pain and much swearing 
 
 according to you vernon dursley said now resuming his pacing up and down the living room we c petunia dudley and i c are in danger from c from c 
 
 some of my lot right said harry 
 
 well i dont believe it repeated uncle vernon coming to a halt in front of harry again i was awake half the night thinking it all over and i believe its a plot to get the house 
 
 the house repeated harry what house 
 
 this house shrieked uncle vernon the vein his forehead starting to pulse our house house prices are skyrocketing around here you want us out of the way and then youre going to do a bit of hocus pocus and before we know it the deeds will be in your name and c 
 
 are you out of your mind demanded harry a plot to get this house are you actually as stupid as you look 
 
 dont you dare c squealed aunt petunia but again vernon waved her down slights on his personal appearance were it seemed as nothing to the danger he had spotted 
 
 just in case youve forgotten said harry ive already got a house my godfather left me one so why would i want this one all the happy memories 
 
 there was silence harry thought he had rather impressed his uncle with this argument 
 
 you claim said uncle vernon starting to pace yet again that this lord thing c 
 
 c voldemort said harry impatiently and weve been through this about a hundred times already this isnt a claim its fact dumbledore told you last year and kingsley and mr weasley c 
 
 vernon dursley hunched his shoulders angrily and harry guessed that his uncle was attempting to ward off recollections of the unannounced visit a few days into harrys summer holidays of two fully grown wizards the arrival on the doorstep of kingsley shacklebolt and arthur weasley had come as a most unpleasant shock to the dursleys harry had to admit however that as mr weasley had once demolished half of the living room his reappearance could not have been expected to delight uncle vernon 
 
 c kingsley and mr weasley explained it all as well harry pressed on remorselessly once im seventeen the protective charm that keeps me safe will break and that exposes you as well as me the order is sure voldemort will target you whether to torture you to try and find out where i am or because he thinks by holding you hostage id come and try to rescue you 
 
 uncle vernons and harrys eyes met harry was sure that in that instant they were both wondering the same thing then uncle vernon walked on and harry resumed youve got to go into hiding and the order wants to help youre being offered serious protection the best there is 
 
 uncle vernon said nothing but continued to pace up and down outside the sun hung low over the privet hedges the next door neighbors lawn mower stalled again 
 
 i thought there was a ministry of magic asked vernon dursley abruptly 
 
 there is said harry surprised 
 
 well then why cant they protect us it seems to me that as innocent victims guilty of nothing more than harboring a marked man we ought to qualify for government protection 
 
 harry laughed he could not help himself it was so very typical of his uncle to put his hopes in the establishment even within this world that he despised and mistrusted you heard what mr weasley and kingsley said harry replied we think the ministry has been infiltrated 
 
 uncle vernon strode back to the fireplace and back breathing so strongly that his great black mustache rippled his face still purple with concentration 
 
 all right he said stopping in front of harry get again all right lets say for the sake of argument we accept this protection i still dont see why we cant have that kingsley bloke 
 
 harry managed not to roll his eyes but with difficulty this question had also been addressed half a dozen times 
 
 as ive told you he said through gritted teeth kingsley is protecting the mug c i mean your prime minister 
 
 exactly c hes the best said uncle vernon pointing at the blank television screen the dursleys had spotted kingsley on the news walking along the muggle prime minister as he visited a hospital this and the fact that kingsley had mastered the knack of dressing like a muggle not to mention a certain reassuring something in his slow deep voice had caused the dursleys to take to kingsley in a way that they had certainly not done with any other wizard although it was true that they had never seen him with earring in 
 
 well hes taken said harry but hestia jones and dedalus diggle are more than up to the job c 
 
 if wed even seen cvs began uncle vernon but harry lost patience getting to his feet he advanced on his uncle not pointing at the tv set himself 
 
 these accidents arent accidents c the crashed and explosions and derailments and whatever else has happened since we last watched the news people are disappearing and dying and hes behind it c voldemort ive told you this over and over again he kills muggles for fun even the fogs c theyre caused by dementors and if you cant remember what they are ask your son 
 
 dudleys hands jerked upward to tower his mouth with his parents and harrys eyes upon him he slowly lowered them again and asked there are more of them 
 
 more laughed harry more than the two that attacked us you mean of course there are hundreds maybe thousands by this time seeing as they feed off fear and despair c 
 
 all right all right blustered blustered vernon dursley youve made your point c 
 
 i hope so said harry because once im seventeen all of them c death eaters elementors maybe even inferi c which means dead bodies enchanted by a dark wizard c will be able to find you and will certainly attack you and if you remember the last time you tried to outrun wizards i think youll agree you need help 
 
 there was a brief silence in which the distant echo of hagrid smashing down a wooden front door seemed to reverberate through the intervening years aunt petunia was looking at uncle vernon dudley was staring at harry finally uncle vernon blurted out but what about my work what about dudleys school i dont suppose those things matter to a bunch of layabout wizards c 
 
 dont you understand shouted harry they will torture and kill you like they did my parents 
 
 dad said dudley in a loud voice dad c im going with these order people 
 
 dudley said harry for the first time in your life youre talking sense he knew the battle was won if dudley was frightened enough to accept the orders help his parents would accompany him there could be no question of being separated from their duddykins harry glanced at the carriage clock on the mantelpiece 
 
 theyll be here in about five minutes he said and when one of the dursleys replied he left the room the prospect of parting c probably forever c from his aunt uncle and cousin was one that he was able to contemplate quite cheerfully but there was nevertheless a certain awkwardness in the air what did you say to one another at the end of sixteen years solid dislike 
 
 back in his bedroom harry fiddled aimlessly with his rucksack then poked a couple of owl nuts through the bats of hedwigs cage they fell with dull thuds to the bottom where she ignored them 
 
 were leaving soon really soon harry told her and then youll be able to fly again 
 
 the doorbell rang harry hesitated then headed back out of his room and downstairs it was too much to expect hestia and dedalus to cope with the dursleys on their own 
 
 harry potter squeaked an excited voice the moment harry had opened the door a small man in a mauve top hat that was sweeping him a deep bow an honor as ever 
 
 thanks dedalus said harry bestowing a small and embarrassed smile upon the dark haired hestia its really good of you to do this theyre through here my aunt and uncle and cousin 
 
 good day to you harry potters relatives said dedalus happily striding into the living room the dursleys did not look at all happy to be addressed thus harry half expected another change of mind dudley shrank neared to his mother at the sight of the witch and wizard 
 
 i see you are packed and ready excellent the plan as harry has told you is a simple one said dedalus pulling an immense pocket watch out of his waistcoat and examining it we shall be leaving before harry does due to the danger of using magic in your house charry being still underage it could provide the ministry with an excuse to arrest him c we shall be driving say ten miles or so before disapparating to the safe location we have picked out for you you know how to drive i take it he asked uncle vernon politely 
 
 know how to c of course i ruddy well know how to drive spluttered uncle vernon 
 
 very clever of you sir very clever i personally would be utterly bamboozled by all those buttons and knobs said dedalus he was clearly under the impression that he was flattering vernon dursley who was visibly losing confidence in the plan with every word dedalus spoke 
 
 cant even drive he muttered under his breath his mustache rippling indignantly but fortunately neither dedalus nor hestia seemed to hear him 
 
 you harry dedalus continued will wait here for your guard there has been a little change in the arrangements c 
 
 what dyou mean said harry at once i thought was going to come and take me by side 
 
 cant do it said hestia tersely will explain 
 
 the dursleys who had listened to all of this with looks of utter incomprehension on their faces jumped as a loud voice screeched hurry up harry looked all around the room before realizing the voice had issued from dedaluss pocket watch 
 
 quite right were operating to a very tight schedule said dedalus nodding at his watch and tucking it back into his waist coat we are attempting to time your departure from the house with your familys disapparition harry thus the charm breaks the moment you all head for safety he turned to the dursleys well are we all packed and ready to go 
 
 none of them answered him uncle vernon was still staring appalled at the bulge in dedaluss waistcoat pocket 
 
 perhaps we should wait outside in the hall dedalus murmured hestia she clearly felt that it would be tactless for them to remain the room while harry and the dursleys exchanged loving possibly tearful farewells 
 
 theres no need harry muttered but uncle vernon made any further explanation unnecessary by saying loudly well this is then boy 
 
 he swung his right arm upward to shake harrys hand but at the last moment seemed unable to face it and merely closed his fist and began swinging it backward and forward like a metronome 
 
 ready duddy asked petunia fussily checking the clasp of her handbag so as to avoid looking at harry altogether 
 
 dudley did not answer but stood there with his mouth slightly ajar reminding harry a little of the giant grawp 
 
 come along then said uncle vernon 
 
 he had already reached the living room door when dudley mumbled i dont understand 
 
 what dont you understand popkin asked petunia looking up at her son 
 
 dudley raised a large hamlike hand to point at harry 
 
 why isnt he coming with us 
 
 uncle vernon and aunt petunia froze when they stood staring at dudley as though he had just expressed a desire to become a ballerina 
 
 what said uncle vernon loudly 
 
 why isnt he coming too asked dudley 
 
 well he c doesnt want to said uncle vernon turning to glare at harry and adding you dont want to do you 
 
 not in the slightest said harry 
 
 there you are uncle vernon told dudley now come on were off 
 
 he marched out of the room they heard the front door open but dudley did not move and after a few faltering steps aunt petunia stopped too 
 
 what now barked uncle vernon reappearing in the doorway 
 
 it seemed that dudley was struggling with concepts too difficult to put into words after several moments of apparently painful internal struggle he said but wheres he going to go 
 
 aunt petunia and uncle vernon looked at each other it was clear that dudley was frightening them hestia jones broke the silence 
 
 but surely you know where your nephew is going she asked looking bewildered 
 
 certainly we know said vernon dursley hes off with some of your lot isnt he right dudley lets get in the car you heard the man were in a hurry 
 
 again vernon dursley marched as far as the front door but dudley did not follow 
 
 off with some of our lot 
 
 hestia looked outraged harry had met this attitude before witches and wizards seemed stunned that his closed living relatives took so little interest in the famous harry potter 
 
 its fine harry assured her it doesnt matter honestly 
 
 doesnt matter repeated hestia her voice rising considerably 
 
 dont these people realize what youve been through what danger you are in the unique position you hold in the hearts of the anti voldemort movement 
 
 er c no they dont said harry they think im a waste of space actually but im used to c 
 
 i dont think youre a waste of space 
 
 if harry had not seen dudleys lips move he might not have believed it as it was he stared at dudley for several seconds before accepting that it must have been his cousin who had spoken for one thing dudley had turned red harry was embarrassed and astonished himself 
 
 well er thanks dudley 
 
 again dudley appeared to grapple with thoughts too unwieldy for expression before mumbling you saved my life 
 
 not really said harry it was your soul the dementor would have taken 
 
 he looked curiously at his cousin they had had virtually no contact during this summer or last as harry had come back to privet drive so briefly and kept to his room so much it now dawned on harry however that the cup of cold tea on which he had trodden that morning might not have been a booby trap at all although rather touched he was nevertheless quite relieved that dudley appeared to have exhausted his ability to express his feelings after opening his mouth once or twice more dudley subsided into silence 
 
 aunt petunia burst into tears hestia jones gave her an approving look that changed to outrage as aunt petunia ran forward and embraced dudley rather than harry sweet dudders she sobbed into his massive chest a lovely thank you 
 
 but he hasnt said thank you at all said hestia indignantly he only said he didnt think harry was a waste of space 
 
 yea but coming from dudley thats like i love you said harry torn between annoyance and a desire to laugh as aunt petunia continued to clutch at dudley as if he had just saved harry from a burning building 
 
 are we going or not roared uncle vernon reappearing yet again at the living room door i thought we were on a tight schedule 
 
 yes cyes we are said dedalus diggle who had been watching these exchanged with an air of bemusement and now seemed to pull himself together we really must be off harry c 
 
 he tripped forward and wrung harrys hand with both of his own 
 
 c good luck i hope we meet again the hopes of the wizarding world rest upon your shoulders 
 
 oh said harry right thanks 
 
 farwell harry said hestia also clasping his hand our thoughts go with you 
 
 i hope everythings okay said harry with a glance toward aunt petunia and dudley 
 
 oh im sure we shall end up the best of chums said diggle slightly waving his hat as he left the room hestia followed him 
 
 dudley gently released himself from his mothers clutches and walked toward harry who had to repress an urge to threaten him with magic then dudley held out his large pink hand 
 
 blimey dudley said harry over aunt petunias renewed sobs did the dementors blow a different personality into you 
 
 dunno muttered dudley see you harry 
 
 yea said harry raking dudleys hand and shaking it maybe take care big d 
 
 dudley nearly smiled they lumbered from the room harry heard his heavy footfalls on the graveled drive and then a car door slammed 
 
 aunt petunia whose face had been buried in her handkerchief looked around at the sound she did not seem to have expected to find herself alone with harry hastily stowing her wet handkerchief into her pocket she said well c and marched towards the door without looking at him 
 
 said harry 
 
 she stopped and looked back for a moment harry had the strangest feeling that she wanted to say something to him she gave him an odd tremulous look and seemed to teeter on the edge of speech but then with a little of her head she hustled out of the room after he husband and son
