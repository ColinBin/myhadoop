lionfish nov chapter the beetle at baycontents prev chapter next chapter 
 question was answered the very next morning when daily prophet arrived she smoothed it out gazed for a moment at the front page and gave a yelp that caused everyone in the vicinity to stare at her 
 
 what said harry and ron together 
 
 for answer she spread the newspaper on the table in front of them and pointed at ten photographs that filled the whole of the front page nine showing wizards faces and the tenth a some of the people in the photographs were silently jeering others were tapping their fingers on the frame of their pictures looking insolent each picture was captioned with a name and the crime for which the person had been sent to azkaban 
 
 antonin dolohov read the legend beneath a wizard with a long pale twisted face who was sneering up at harry convicted of the brutal murders of gideon and fabian prewett 
 
 algernon rookwood said the caption beneath a pockmarked man with greasy hair who was leaning against the edge of his picture looking bored convicted of leaking ministry of magic secrets to he who must not be named 
 
 but eyes were drawn to the picture of the witch her face had leapt out at him the moment he had seen the page she had long dark hair that looked unkempt and straggly in the picture though he had seen it sleek thick and shining she glared up at him through heavily lidded eyes an arrogant disdainful smile playing around her thin mouth like sirius she retained vestiges of great good looks but somethingperhaps azkabanhad taken most of her beauty 
 
 bellatrix lestrange convicted of the torture and permanent incapacitation of frank and alice longbottom 
 
 hermione nudged harry and pointed at the headline over the pictures which harry concentrating on bellatrix had not yet read 
 
 mass breakout from azkaban 
 
 ministry fears black is rallying point 
 
 for old death eaters 
 
 black said harry loudly not 
 
 shhh whispered hermione desperately not so loudjust read it 
 
 the ministry of magic announced late last night that there has been a mass breakout from azkaban 
 
 speaking to reporters in his private office cornelius fudge minister for magic confirmed that ten prisoners escaped in the early hours of yesterday evening and that he has already informed the muggle prime minister of the dangerous nature of these individuals 
 
 we find ourselves most unfortunately in the same position we were two and a half years ago when the murderer sirius black fudge last do we think the two breakouts are unrelated an escape of this magnitude suggests outside help and we must remember that black as the first person ever to break out of azkaban would be ideally placed to help others follow in his footsteps we think it likely that these individuals who include cousin bellatrix lestrange have rallied around black as their leader we are however doing all we can to round up the criminals and we beg the magical community to remain alert and cautious on no account should any of these individuals be approached 
 
 there you are harry said ron looking awestruck why he was happy last night 
 
 i believe this snarled harry fudge is blaming the breakout on sirius 
 
 what other options does he have said hermione bitterly he can hardly say sorry everyone dumbledore warned me this might happen the azkaban guards have joined lord now worst supporters have broken out too i mean spent a good six months telling everyone you and dumbledore are liars he 
 
 hermione ripped open the newspaper and began to read the report inside while harry looked around the great hall he could not understand why his fellow students were not looking scared or at least discussing the terrible piece of news on the front page but very few of them took the newspaper every day like hermione there they all were talking about homework and quidditch and who knew what other rubbish when outside these walls ten more death eaters had swollen ranks 
 
 he glanced up at the staff table it was a different story there dumbledore and professor mcgonagall were deep in conversation both looking extremely grave professor sprout had the prophet propped against a bottle of ketchup and was reading the front page with such concentration that she was not noticing the gentle drip of egg yolk falling into her lap from her stationary spoon meanwhile at the far end of the table professor umbridge was tucking into a bowl of porridge for once her pouchy eyes were not sweeping the great hall looking for misbehaving students she scowled as she gulped down her food and every now and then she shot a malevolent glance up the table to where dumbledore and mcgonagall were talking so intently 
 
 oh my said hermione wonderingly still staring at the newspaper 
 
 what now said harry quickly he was feeling jumpy 
 
 horrible said hermione looking shaken she folded back page ten of the newspaper and handed it to harry and ron 
 
 tragic demise of ministry of magic worker 
 st hospital promised a full inquiry last night after ministry of magic worker broderich bode was discovered dead in his bed strangled by a pot plant healers called to the scene were unable to revive mr bode who had been injured in a workplace accident some weeks prior to his death 
 
 healer miriam strout who was in charge of mr ward at the time of the incident has been suspended on full pay and was unavailable for comment yesterday but a spokeswizard for the hospital said in a statement 
 
 st deeply regrets the death of mr bode whose health was improving steadily prior to this tragic accident 
 
 we have strict guidelines on the decorations permitted on our wards but it appears that healer strout busy over the christmas period overlooked the dangers of the plant on mr bedside table as his speech and mobility improved healer strout encouraged mr bode to look after the plant himself unaware that it was not an innocent flitterbloom but a cutting of snare which when touched by the convalescent mr bode throttled him instantly 
 
 st is as yet unable to account for the presence of the plant on the ward and asks any witch or wizard with information to come forward 
 
 bode said ron rings a bell 
 
 we saw him hermione whispered in st remember he was in the bed opposite just lying there staring at the ceiling and we saw the snare arrive shethe healersaid it was a christmas present 
 
 harry looked back at the story a feeling of horror was rising like bile in his throat 
 
 how come we recognise snare seen it before we stopped this from happening 
 
 who expects snare to turn up in a hospital disguised as a pot plant said ron sharply not our fault whoever sent it to the bloke is to blame they must be a real prat why they check what they were buying 
 
 oh come on ron said hermione shakily i think anyone could put snare in a pot and not realise it tries to kill whoever touches it thisthis was murder a clever murder as well if the plant was sent anonymously anyone ever going to find out who did it 
 
 harry was not thinking about snare he was remembering taking the lift down to the ninth level of the ministry on the day of his hearing and the man who had got in on the atrium level 
 
 i met bode he said slowly i saw him at the ministry with your dad 
 
 mouth fell open 
 
 heard dad talk about him at home he was an unspeakablehe worked in the department of mysteries 
 
 they looked at each other for a moment then hermione pulled the newspaper back towards her closed it glared for a moment at the pictures of the ten escaped death eaters on the front then leapt to her feet 
 
 where are you going said ron startled 
 
 to send a letter said hermione swinging her bag on to her shoulder it well i know whether but worth trying and the only one who can 
 
 i hate it when she does that grumbled ron as he and harry got up from the table and made their own slower way out of the great hall would it kill her to tell us what up to for once take her about ten more secondshey hagrid 
 
 hagrid was standing beside the doors into the entrance hall waiting for a crowd of ravenclaws to pass he was still as heavily bruised as he had been on the day he had come back from his mission to the giants and there was a new cut right across the bridge of his nose 
 
 all righ you two he said trying to muster a smile but managing only a kind of pained grimace 
 
 are you ok hagrid asked harry following him as he lumbered after the ravenclaws 
 
 fine fine said hagrid with a feeble assumption of airiness he waved a hand and narrowly missed concussing a professor vector who was passing jus busy yeh know usual stufflessons ter prepare couple o salamanders got scale rotan on probation he mumbled 
 
 on probation said ron very loudly so that many of the passing students looked around curiously sorryi on probation he whispered 
 
 yeah said hagrid i expected ter tell yer the truth yeh migh picked up on it bu that inspection didn go too well yeh know anyway he sighed deeply bes go an rub a bit more chilli powder on them salamanders or their be hangin off em next see yeh harry ron 
 
 he trudged away out of the front doors and down the stone steps into the damp grounds harry watched him go wondering how much more bad news he could stand 
 
 the fact that hagrid was now on probation became common knowledge within the school over the next few days but to indignation hardly anybody appeared to be upset about it indeed some people draco malfoy prominent among them seemed positively gleeful as for the freakish death of an obscure department of mysteries employee in st harry ron and hermione seemed to be the only people who knew or cared there was only one topic of conversation in the corridors now the ten escaped death eaters whose story had finally filtered through the school from those few people who read the newspapers rumours were flying that some of the convicts had been spotted in hogsmeade that they were supposed to be hiding out in the shrieking shack and that they were going to break into hogwarts just as sirius black had once done 
 
 those who came from wizarding families had grown up hearing the names of these death eaters spoken with almost as much fear as voldemorts the crimes they had committed during the days of reign of terror were legendary there were relatives of their victims among the hogwarts students who now found themselves the unwilling objects of a gruesome sort of reflected fame as they walked the corridors susan bones whose uncle aunt and cousins had all died at the hands of one of the ten said miserably during herbology that she now had a good idea what it felt like to be harry 
 
 and i know how you stand horrible she said bluntly dumping far too much dragon manure on her tray of screechsnap seedlings causing them to wriggle and squeak in discomfort 
 
 it was true that harry was the subject of much renewed muttering and pointing in the corridors these days yet he thought he detected a slight difference in the tone of the whisperers voices they sounded curious rather than hostile now and once or twice he was sure he overheard snatches of conversation that suggested that the speakers were not satisfied with the version of how and why ten death eaters had managed to break out of the azkaban fortress in their confusion and fear these doubters now seemed to be turning to the only other explanation available to them the one that harry and dumbledore had been expounding since the previous year 
 
 it was not only the students mood that had changed it was now quite common to come across two or three teachers conversing in low urgent whispers in the corridors breaking off their conversations the moment they saw students approaching 
 
 they obviously talk freely in the staff room any more said hermione in a low voice as she harry and ron passed professors mcgonagall flitwick and sprout huddled together outside the charms classroom one day not with umbridge there 
 
 reckon they know anything new said ron gazing back over his shoulder at the three teachers 
 
 if they do not going to hear about it are we said harry angrily not after decree what number are we on now for new notices had appeared on the house noticeboards the morning after news of the azkaban breakout 
 
 by order of the high inquisitor of hogwarts 
 
 
 
 teachers are hereby banned from giving students any information 
 
 that is not strictly related to the subjects they are paid to teach 
 
 
 
 the above is in accordance with educational decree 
 
 number 
 
 
 
 signed dolores jane umbridge high inquisitor 
 
 this latest decree had been the subject of a great number of jokes among the students lee jordan had pointed out to umbridge that by the terms of the new rule she was not allowed to tell fred and george off for playing exploding snap in the back of the class 
 
 exploding got nothing to do with defence against the dark arts professor not information relating to your subject 
 
 when harry next saw lee the back of his hand was bleeding rather badly harry recommended essence of murtlap 
 
 harry had thought the breakout from azkaban might have humbled umbridge a little that she might have been abashed at the catastrophe that had occurred right under the nose of her beloved fudge it seemed however to have only intensified her furious desire to bring every aspect of life at hogwarts under her personal control she seemed determined at the very least to achieve a sacking before long and the only question was whether it would be professor trelawney or hagrid who went first 
 
 every single divination and care of magical creatures lesson was now conducted in the presence of umbridge and her clipboard she lurked by the fire in the heavily perfumed tower room interrupting professor increasingly hysterical talks with difficult questions about ornithomancy and heptomology insisting that she predicted students answers before they gave them and demanding that she demonstrate her skill at the crystal ball the tea leaves and the rune stones in turn harry thought professor trelawney might soon crack under the strain several times he passed her in the corridorsin itself a very unusual occurrence as she generally remained in her tower roommuttering wildly to herself wringing her hands and shooting terrified glances over her shoulder and all the while giving off a powerful smell of cooking sherry if he had not been so worried about hagrid he would have felt sorry for herbut if one of them was to be ousted from their job there could be only one choice for harry as to who should remain 
 
 unfortunately harry could not see that hagrid was putting up a better show than trelawney though he seemed to be following advice and had shown them nothing more frightening than a crupa creature indistinguishable from a jack russell terrier except for its forked tailsince before christmas he too seemed to have lost his nerve he was oddly distracted and jumpy during lessons losing the thread of what he was saying to the class answering questions wrongly and all the time glancing anxiously at umbridge he was also more distant with harry ron and hermione than he had ever been before and had expressly forbidden them to visit him after dark 
 
 if she catches yeh be all of our necks on the line he told them flatly and with no desire to do anything that might jeopardise his job further they abstained from walking down to his hut in the evenings 
 
 it seemed to harry that umbridge was steadily depriving him of everything that made his life at hogwarts worth living visits to house letters from sirius his firebolt and quidditch he took his revenge the only way he couldby redoubling his efforts for the da 
 
 harry was pleased to see that all of them even zacharias smith had been spurred on to work harder than ever by the news that ten more death eaters were now on the loose but in nobody was this improvement more pronounced than in neville the news of his parents attackers escape had wrought a strange and even slightly alarming change in him he had not once mentioned his meeting with harry ron and hermione on the closed ward in st and taking their lead from him they had kept quiet about it too nor had he said anything on the subject of bellatrix and her fellow torturers escape in fact neville barely spoke during the da meetings any more but worked relentlessly on every new jinx and harry taught them his plump face screwed up in concentration apparently indifferent to injuries or accidents and working harder than anyone else in the room he was improving so fast it was quite unnerving and when harry taught them the shield charma means of deflecting minor jinxes so that they rebounded upon the attackeronly hermione mastered the charm faster than neville 
 
 harry would have given a great deal to be making as much progress at occlumency as neville was making during the da meetings sessions with snape which had started badly enough were not improving on the contrary harry felt he was getting worse with every lesson 
 
 before he had started studying occlumency his scar had prickled occasionally usually during the night or else following one of those strange flashes of thoughts or mood that he experienced every now and then nowadays however his scar hardly ever stopped prickling and he often felt lurches of annoyance or cheerfulness that were unrelated to what was happening to him at the time which were always accompanied by a particularly painful twinge from his scar he had the horrible impression that he was slowly turning into a kind of aerial that was tuned in to tiny fluctuations in mood and he was sure he could date this increased sensitivity firmly from his first occlumency lesson with snape what was more he was now dreaming about walking down the corridor towards the entrance to the department of mysteries almost every night dreams which always culminated in him standing longingly in front of the plain black door 
 
 maybe a bit like an illness said hermione looking concerned when harry confided in her and ron a fever or something it has to get worse before it gets better 
 
 the lessons with snape are making it worse said harry flatly getting sick of my scar hurting and getting bored with walking down that corridor every night he rubbed his forehead angrily i just wish the door would open sick of standing staring at it 
 
 not funny said hermione sharply dumbledore want you to have dreams about that corridor at all or he have asked snape to teach you occlumency just going to have to work a bit harder in your lessons 
 
 i am working said harry nettled you try it some timesnape trying to get inside your not a bundle of laughs you know 
 
 maybe said ron slowly 
 
 maybe what said hermione rather snappishly 
 
 maybe not fault he close his mind said ron darkly 
 
 what do you mean said hermione 
 
 well maybe snape really trying to help harry 
 
 harry and hermione stared at him ron looked darkly and meaningfully from one to the other 
 
 maybe he said again in a lower voice actually trying to open mind a bit wider make it easier for 
 
 shut up ron said hermione angrily how many times have you suspected snape and when have you ever been right dumbledore trusts him he works for the order that ought to be enough 
 
 he used to be a death eater said ron stubbornly and never seen proof that he really swapped sides 
 
 dumbledore trusts him hermione repeated and if we trust dumbledore we trust anyone 
 
 with so much to worry about and so much to do startling amounts of homework that frequently kept the working until past midnight secret da sessions and regular classes with snape january seemed to be passing alarmingly fast before harry knew it february had arrived bringing with it wetter and warmer weather and the prospect of the second hogsmeade visit of the year harry had had very little time to spare for conversations with cho since they had agreed to visit the village together but suddenly found himself facing a day spent entirely in her company 
 
 on the morning of the fourteenth he dressed particularly carefully he and ron arrived at breakfast just in time for the arrival of the post owls hedwig was not there not that harry had expected herbut hermione was tugging a letter from the beak of an unfamiliar brown owl as they sat down 
 
 and about time if it come today she said eagerly tearing open the envelope and pulling out a small piece of parchment her eyes sped from left to right as she read through the message and a grimly pleased expression spread across her face 
 
 listen harry she said looking up at him this is really important do you think you could meet me in the three broomsticks around midday 
 
 well i dunno said harry uncertainly cho might be expecting me to spend the whole day with her we never said what we were going to do 
 
 well bring her along if you must said hermione urgently but will you come 
 
 well all right but why 
 
 i got time to tell you now got to answer this quickly 
 
 and she hurried out of the great hall the letter clutched in one hand and a piece of toast in the other 
 
 are you coming harry asked ron but he shook his head looking glum 
 
 i come into hogsmeade at all angelina wants a full training like going to help the worst team ever seen you should see sloper and kirke pathetic even worse than i am he heaved a great sigh i dunno why angelina just let me resign 
 
 because good when on form why said harry irritably 
 
 he found it very hard to be sympathetic to plight when he himself would have given almost anything to be playing in the forthcoming match against hufflepuff ron seemed to have noticed tone because he did not mention quidditch again during breakfast and there was a slight frostiness in the way they said goodbye to each other shortly afterwards ron departed for the quidditch pitch and harry after attempting to flatten his hair while staring at his reflection in the back of a teaspoon proceeded alone to the entrance hall to meet cho feeling very apprehensive and wondering what on earth they were going to talk about 
 
 she was waiting for him a little to the side of the oak front doors looking very pretty with her hair tied back in a long feet seemed to be too big for his body as he walked towards her and he was suddenly horribly aware of his arms and how stupid they must look swinging at his sides 
 
 hi said cho slightly breathlessly 
 
 hi said harry 
 
 they stared at each other for a moment then harry said wellershall we go then 
 
 ohyes 
 
 they joined the queue of people being signed out by filch occasionally catching each eye and grinning shiftily but not talking to each other harry was relieved when they reached the fresh air finding it easier to walk along in silence than just stand about looking awkward it was a fresh breezy sort of a day and as they passed the quidditch stadium harry glimpsed ron and ginny skimming along over the stands and felt a horrible pang that he was not up there with them 
 
 you really miss it you said cho 
 
 he looked round and saw her watching him 
 
 yeah sighed harry i do 
 
 remember the first time we played against each other in the third year she asked him 
 
 yeah said harry grinning you kept blocking me 
 
 and wood told you not to be a gentleman and knock me off my broom if you had to said cho smiling reminiscently i heard he got taken on by pride of portree is that right 
 
 nah it was puddlemere united i saw him at the world cup last year 
 
 oh i saw you there too remember we were on the same campsite it was really good it 
 
 the subject of the quidditch world cup carried them all the way down the drive and out through the gates harry could hardly believe how easy it was to talk to herno more difficult in fact than talking to ron and hermioneand he was just starting to feel confident and cheerful when a large gang of slytherin girls passed them including pansy parkinson 
 
 potter and chang screeched pansy to a chorus of snide giggles urgh chang i think much of your taste at least diggory was 
 
 the girls sped up talking and shrieking in a pointed fashion with many exaggerated glances back at harry and cho leaving an embarrassed silence in their wake harry could think of nothing else to say about quidditch and cho slightly flushed was watching her feet 
 
 so where want to go harry asked as they entered hogsmeade the high street was full of students ambling up and down peering into the shop windows and messing about together on the pavements 
 
 oh i mind said cho shrugging um shall we just have a look in the shops or something 
 
 they wandered towards dervish and banges a large poster had been stuck up in the window and a few hogsmeaders were looking at it they moved aside when harry and cho approached and harry found himself staring once more at the pictures of the ten escaped death eaters the poster by order of the ministry of magic offered a reward to any witch or wizard with information leading to the recapture of any of the convicts pictured 
 
 funny it said cho in a low voice gazing up at the pictures of the death eaters remember when that sirius black escaped and there were dementors all over hogsmeade looking for him and now ten death eaters are on the loose and there are no dementors anywhere 
 
 yeah said harry tearing his eyes away from bellatrix face to glance up and down the high street yeah that is weird 
 
 he sorry that there were no dementors nearby but now he came to think of it their absence was highly significant they had not only let the death eaters escape they bothering to look for them it looked as though they really were outside ministry control now 
 
 the ten escaped death eaters were staring out of every shop window he and cho passed it started to rain as they passed cold heavy drops of water kept hitting face and the back of his neck 
 
 um want to get a coffee said cho tentatively as the rain began to fall more heavily 
 
 yeah all right said harry looking around where 
 
 oh a really nice place just up here you ever been to madam she said brightly leading him up a side road and into a small teashop that harry had never noticed before it was a cramped steamy little place where everything seemed to have been decorated with frills or bows harry was reminded unpleasantly of office 
 
 cute it said cho happily 
 
 er yeah said harry untruthfully 
 
 look decorated it for day said cho indicating a number of golden cherubs that were hovering over each of the small circular tables occasionally throwing pink confetti over the occupants 
 
 aaah 
 
 they sat down at the last remaining table which was over by the steamy window roger davies the ravenclaw quidditch captain was sitting about a foot and a half away with a pretty blonde girl they were holding hands the sight made harry feel uncomfortable particularly when looking around the teashop he saw that it was full of nothing but couples all of them holding hands perhaps cho would expect him to hold her hand 
 
 what can i get you said madam puddifoot a very stout woman with a shiny black bun squeezing between their table and roger with great difficulty 
 
 two coffees please said cho 
 
 in the time it took for their coffees to arrive roger davies and his girlfriend had started kissing over their sugar bowl harry wished they he felt that davies was setting a standard with which cho would soon expect him to compete he felt his face growing hot and tried staring out of the window but it was so steamed up he see the street outside to postpone the moment when he would have to look at cho he stared up at the ceiling as though examining the paintwork and received a handful of confetti in the face from their hovering cherub 
 
 after a few more painful minutes cho mentioned umbridge harry seized on the subject with relief and they passed a few happy moments abusing her but the subject had already been so thoroughly canvassed during da meetings it did not last very long silence fell again harry was very conscious of the slurping noises coming from the table next door and cast wildly around for something else to say 
 
 er listen want to come with me to the three broomsticks at lunchtime meeting hermione granger there 
 
 cho raised her eyebrows 
 
 meeting hermione granger today 
 
 yeah well she asked me to so i thought i would want to come with me she said it matter if you did 
 
 oh well that was nice of her 
 
 but cho did not sound as though she thought it was nice at all on the contrary her tone was cold and all of a sudden she looked rather forbidding 
 
 a few more minutes passed in total silence harry drinking his coffee so fast that he would soon need a fresh cup beside them roger davies and his girlfriend seemed glued together at the tips 
 
 hand was lying on the table beside her coffee and harry was feeling a mounting pressure to take hold of it just do it he told himself as a fount of mingled panic and excitement surged up inside his chest just reach out and grab it amazing how much more difficult it was to extend his arm twelve inches and touch her hand than it was to snatch a speeding snitch from midair 
 
 but just as he moved his hand forwards cho took hers off the table she was now watching roger davies kissing his girlfriend with a mildly interested expression 
 
 he asked me out you know she said in a quiet voice a couple of weeks ago roger i turned him down though 
 
 harry who had grabbed the sugar bowl to excuse his sudden lunging movement across the table could not think why she was telling him this if she wished she were sitting at the next table being heartily kissed by roger davies why had she agreed to come out with him 
 
 he said nothing their cherub threw another handful of confetti over them some of it landed in the last cold dregs of coffee harry had been about to drink 
 
 i came in here with cedric last year said cho 
 
 in the second or so it took for him to take in what she had said insides had become glacial he could not believe she wanted to talk about cedric now while kissing couples surrounded them and a cherub floated over their heads 
 
 voice was rather higher when she spoke again 
 
 been meaning to ask you for ages did cedricdid hemmmention me at all before he died 
 
 this was the very last subject on earth harry wanted to discuss and least of all with cho 
 
 wellno he said quietly therethere time for him to say anything erm so get to see a lot of quidditch in the holidays you support the tornados right 
 
 his voice sounded falsely bright and cheery to his horror he saw that her eyes were swimming with tears again just as they had been after the last da meeting before christmas 
 
 look he said desperately leaning in so that nobody else could overhear not talk about cedric right now talk about something else 
 
 but this apparently was quite the wrong thing to say 
 
 i thought she said tears spattering down on to the table i thought u uunderstand i need to talk about it surely you nneed to talk about it ttoo i mean you saw it happen you 
 
 everything was going nightmarishly wrong roger girlfriend had even unglued herself to look round at cho crying 
 
 welli have talked about it harry said in a whisper to ron and hermione but 
 
 oh talk to hermione granger she said shrilly her face now shining with tears several more kissing couples broke apart to stare but you talk to me p perhaps it would be best if we just just ppaid and you went and met up with hermione ggranger like you obviously want to 
 
 harry stared at her utterly bewildered as she seized a frilly napkin and dabbed at her shining face with it 
 
 cho he said weakly wishing roger would seize his girlfriend and start kissing her again to stop her goggling at him and cho 
 
 go on leave she said now crying into the napkin i know why you asked me out in the first place if going to make arrangements to meet other girls right after me how many are you meeting after hermione 
 
 not like that said harry and he was so relieved at finally understanding what she was annoyed about that he laughed which he realised a split second too late was also a mistake 
 
 cho sprang to her feet the whole tearoom was quiet and everybody was watching them now 
 
 see you around harry she said dramatically and hiccoughing slightly she dashed to the door wrenched it open and hurried off into the pouring rain 
 
 cho harry called after her but the door had already swung shut behind her with a tuneful tinkle 
 
 there was total silence within the teashop every eye was on harry he threw a galleon down on to the table shook pink confetti out of his hair and followed cho out of the door 
 
 it was raining hard now and she was nowhere to be seen he simply did not understand what had happened half an hour ago they had been getting along fine 
 
 women he muttered angrily sloshing down the street with his hands in his pockets what did she want to talk about cedric for anyway why does she always want to drag up a subject that makes her act like a human hosepipe 
 
 he turned right and broke into a splashy run and within minutes he was turning into the doorway of the three broomsticks he knew he was too early to meet hermione but he thought it likely there would be someone in here with whom he could spend the intervening time he shook his wet hair out of his eyes and looked around hagrid was sitting alone in a corner looking morose 
 
 hi hagrid he said when he had squeezed through the crammed tables and pulled up a chair beside him 
 
 hagrid jumped and looked down at harry as though he barely recognised him harry saw that he had two fresh cuts on his face and several new bruises 
 
 oh yeh harry said hagrid yeh all righ 
 
 yeah fine lied harry but next to this battered and hagrid he felt he really have much to complain about erare you ok 
 
 me said hagrid oh yeah grand harry grand 
 
 he gazed into the depths of his pewter tankard which was the size of a large bucket and sighed harry know what to say to him they sat side by side in silence for a moment then hagrid said abruptly in the same boat yeh an me aren we arry 
 
 er said harry 
 
 yeah said it before both outsiders like said hagrid nodding wisely an both orphans yeah both orphans 
 
 he took a great swig from his tankard 
 
 makes a havin a decent family he said me dad was decent an your mum an dad were decent if lived life woulda bin eh 
 
 yeah i said harry cautiously hagrid seemed to be in a very strange mood 
 
 family said hagrid gloomily whatever yeh say important 
 
 and he wiped a trickle of it out of his eye 
 
 hagrid said harry unable to stop himself where are you getting all these injuries 
 
 eh said hagrid looking startled wha injuries 
 
 all those said harry pointing at face 
 
 oh jus normal bumps an bruises harry said hagrid dismissively i got a rough job 
 
 he drained his tankard set it back on the table and got to his feet 
 
 be seein yeh harry take care now 
 
 and he lumbered out of the pub looking wretched and disappeared into the torrential rain harry watched him go feeling miserable hagrid was unhappy and he was hiding something but he seemed determined not to accept help what was going on but before harry could think about it any further he heard a voice calling his name 
 
 harry harry over here 
 
 hermione was waving at him from the other side of the room he got up and made his way towards her through the crowded pub he was still a few tables away when he realised that hermione was not alone she was sitting at a table with the unlikeliest pair of drinking mates he could ever have imagined luna lovegood and none other than rita skeeter on the daily prophet and one of least favourite people in the world 
 
 early said hermione moving along to give him room to sit down i thought you were with cho i expecting you for another hour at least 
 
 cho said rita at once twisting round in her seat to stare avidly at harry a girl 
 
 she snatched up her handbag and groped within it 
 
 its none of your business if been with a hundred girls hermione told rita coolly so you can put that away right now 
 
 rita had been on the point of withdrawing an quill from her bag looking as though she had been forced to swallow stinksap she snapped her bag shut again 
 
 what are you up to harry asked sitting down and staring from rita to luna to hermione 
 
 little miss perfect was just about to tell me when you arrived said rita taking a large slurp of her drink i suppose allowed to talk to him am i she shot at hermione 
 
 yes i suppose you are said hermione coldly 
 
 unemployment did not suit rita the hair that had once been set in elaborate curls now hung lank and unkempt around her face the scarlet paint on her talons was chipped and there were a couple of false jewels missing from her winged glasses she took another great gulp of her drink and said out of the corner of her mouth pretty girl is she harry 
 
 one more word about love life and the off and a promise said hermione irritably 
 
 what deal said rita wiping her mouth on the back of her hand you mentioned a deal yet miss prissy you just told me to turn up oh one of these days she took a deep shuddering breath 
 
 yes yes one of these days write more horrible stories about harry and me said hermione indifferently find someone who cares why you 
 
 run plenty of horrible stories about harry this year without my help said rita shooting a sideways look at him over the top of her glass and adding in a rough whisper how has that made you feel harry betrayed distraught misunderstood 
 
 he feels angry of course said hermione in a hard clear voice because told the minister for magic the truth and the too much of an idiot to believe him 
 
 so you actually stick to it do you that he who must not be named is back said rita lowering her glass and subjecting harry to a piercing stare while her finger strayed longingly to the clasp of the crocodile bag you stand by all this garbage been telling everybody about returning and you being the sole witness 
 
 i the sole witness snarled harry there were a death eaters there as well want their names 
 
 love them breathed rita now fumbling in her bag once more and gazing at him as though he was the most beautiful thing she had ever seen a great bold headline potter accuses a harry potter names death eaters still among us and then beneath a nice big photograph of you disturbed teenage survivor of attack harry potter caused outrage yesterday by accusing respectable and prominent members of the wizarding community of being death eaters 
 
 the quill was actually in her hand and halfway to her mouth when the rapturous expression on her face died 
 
 but of course she said lowering the quill and looking daggers at hermione little miss perfect want that story out there would she 
 
 as a matter of fact said hermione sweetly exactly what little miss perfect does want 
 
 rita stared at her so did harry luna on the other hand sang weasley is our king dreamily under her breath and stirred her drink with a cocktail onion on a stick 
 
 you want me to report what he says about he who must not be named rita asked hermione in a hushed voice 
 
 yes i do said hermione the true story all the facts exactly as harry reports them give you all the details tell you the names of the undiscovered death eaters he saw there tell you what voldemort looks like nowoh get a grip on yourself she added contemptuously throwing a napkin across the table for at the sound of name rita had jumped so badly she had slopped half her glass of firewhisky down herself 
 
 rita blotted the front of her grubby raincoat still staring at hermione then she said baldly the prophet print it in case you noticed nobody believes his story everyone thinks delusional now if you let me write the story from that angle 
 
 we need another story about how lost his marbles said hermione angrily had plenty of those already thank you i want him given the opportunity to tell the truth 
 
 no market for a story like that said rita coldly 
 
 you mean the prophet print it because fudge let them said hermione irritably 
 
 rita gave hermione a long hard look then leaning forwards across the table towards her she said in a businesslike tone all right fudge is leaning on the prophet but it comes to the same thing they print a story that shows harry in a good light nobody wants to read it against the public mood this last azkaban breakout has got people quite worried enough people just want to believe back 
 
 so the daily prophet exists to tell people what they want to hear does it said hermione scathingly 
 
 rita sat up straight again her eyebrows raised and drained her glass of firewhisky 
 
 the prophet exists to sell itself you silly girl she said coldly 
 
 my dad thinks an awful paper said luna chipping into the conversation unexpectedly sucking on her cocktail onion she gazed at rita with her enormous protuberant slightly mad eye he publishes important stories he thinks the public needs to know he care about making money 
 
 rita looked disparagingly at luna 
 
 guessing your father runs some stupid little village newsletter she said probably ways to mingle with muggles and the dates of the next bring and fly sale 
 
 no said luna dipping her onion back into her gillywater the editor of the quibbler 
 
 rita snorted so loudly that people at a nearby table looked round in alarm 
 
 important stories he thinks the public needs to know eh she said witheringly i could manure my garden with the contends of that rag 
 
 well this is your chance to raise the tone of it a bit it said hermione pleasantly luna says her quite happy to take interview be publishing it 
 
 rita stared at them both for a moment then let out a great whoop of laughter 
 
 the quibbler she said cackling you think people will take him seriously if published in the quibbler 
 
 some people said hermione in a level voice but the daily version of the azkaban breakout had some gaping holes in it i think a lot of people will be wondering whether there a better explanation of what happened and if an alternative story available even if it is published in a she glanced sideways at luna in awell an unusual magazinei think they might be rather keen to read it 
 
 rita say anything for a while but eyed hermione shrewdly her head a little to one side 
 
 all right say for a moment do it she said abruptly what kind of fee am i going to get 
 
 i think daddy exactly pays people to write for the magazine said luna dreamily they do it because an honour and of course to see their names in print 
 
 rita skeeter looked as though the taste of stinksap was strong in her mouth again as she rounded on hermione 
 
 supposed to do this for free 
 
 well yes said hermione calmly taking a sip of her drink otherwise as you very well know i will inform the authorities that you are an unregistered animagus of course the prophet might give you rather a lot for an account of life in azkaban 
 
 rita looked as though she would have liked nothing better than to seize the paper umbrella sticking out of drink and thrust it up her nose 
 
 i suppose got any choice have i said rita her voice shaking slightly she opened her crocodile bag once more withdrew a piece of parchment and raised her quill 
 
 daddy will be pleased said luna brightly a muscle twitched in jaw 
 
 ok harry said hermione turning to him ready to tell the public the truth 
 
 i suppose said harry watching rita balancing the quill at the ready on the parchment between them 
 
 fire away then rita said hermione serenely fishing a cherry out from the bottom of her glass 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix
