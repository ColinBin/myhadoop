 dumbledore reckons getting stronger again as well ron whispered 
 
 everything harry had seen in the pensieve nearly everything dumbledore had told and shown him afterward he had now shared with ron and hermione and of course with sirius to whom harry had sent an owl the moment he had left office harry ron and hermione sat up late in the common room once again that night talking it all over until mind was reeling until he understood what dumbledore had meant about a head becoming so full of thoughts that it would have been a relief to siphon them off 
 
 ron stared into the common room fire harry thought he saw ron shiver slightly even though the evening was warm 
 
 and he trusts snape ron said he really trusts snape even though he knows he was a death eater 
 
 yes said harry 
 
 hermione had not spoken for ten minutes she was sitting with her forehead in her hands staring at her knees harry thought she too looked as though she could have done with a pensieve 
 
 rita skeeter she muttered finally 
 
 how can you be worrying about her now said ron in utter disbelief 
 
 not worrying about her hermione said to her knees just thinkingremember what she said to me in the three broomsticks i know things about ludo bagman that would make your hair curl this is what she meant it she reported his trial she knew passed information to the death eaters and winky too a bad wizard mr crouch would have been furious he got off he would have talked about it at home 
 
 yeah but bagman pass information on purpose did he 
 
 hermione shrugged 
 
 and fudge reckons madame maxime attacked crouch ron said turning back to harry 
 
 yeah said harry but only saying that because crouch disappeared near the beauxbatons carriage 
 
 we never thought of her did we said ron slowly mind you definitely got giant blood and she want to admit it 
 
 of course she said hermione sharply looking up look what happened to hagrid when rita found out about his mother look at fudge jumping to conclusions about her just because part giant who needs that sort of prejudice probably say i had big bones if i knew what get for telling the truth 
 
 hermione looked at her watch we done any practicing she said looking shocked we were going to do the impediment curse have to really get down to it tomorrow come on harry you need to get some sleep 
 
 harry and ron went slowly upstairs to their dormitory as harry pulled on his pajamas he looked over at bed true to his word to dumbledore he had not told ron and hermione about parents as harry took off his glasses and climbed into his he imagined how it must feel to have parents still living but unable to recognize you he often got sympathy from strangers for being an orphan but as he listened to snores he thought that neville deserved it more than he did lying in the darkness harry felt a rush of anger and hate toward the people who had tortured mr and mrs remembered the jeers of the crowd as son and his companions had been dragged from the court by the understood how they had he remembered the face of the screaming boy and realized with a jolt that he had died a year later 
 
 it was voldemort harry thought staring up at the canopy of his bed in the darkness it all came back to was the one who had torn these families apart who had ruined all these lives 
 
 ron and hermione were supposed to be studying for their exams which would finish on the day of the third task but they were putting most of their efforts into helping harry prepare 
 
 worry about it hermione said shortly when harry pointed this out to them and said he mind practicing on his own for a while at least get top marks in defense against the dark arts never have found out about all these hexes in class 
 
 good training for when all aurors said ron excitedly attempting the impediment curse on a wasp that had buzzed into the room and making it stop dead in midair 
 
 the mood in the castle as they entered june became excited and tense again everyone was looking forward to the third task which would take place a week before the end of term harry was practicing hexes at every available moment he felt more confident about this task than either of the others difficult and dangerous though it would undoubtedly be moody was right harry had managed to find his way past monstrous creatures and enchanted barriers before now and this time he had some notice some chance to prepare himself for what lay ahead 
 
 tired of walking in on harry hermione and ron all over the school professor mcgonagall had given them permission to use the empty transfiguration classroom at lunchtimes harry had soon mastered the impediment curse a spell to slow down and obstruct attackers the reductor curse which would enable him to blast solid objects out of his way and the spell a useful discovery of that would make his wand point due north therefore enabling him to check whether he was going in the right direction within the maze he was still having trouble with the shield charm though this was supposed to cast a temporary invisible wall around himself that deflected minor curses hermione managed to shatter it with a jinx and harry wobbled around the room for ten minutes afterward before she had looked up the 
 
 still doing really well though hermione said encouragingly looking down her list and crossing off those spells they had already learned some of these are bound to come in handy 
 
 come and look at this said ron who was standing by the window he was staring down onto the grounds malfoy doing 
 
 harry and hermione went to see malfoy crabbe and goyle were standing in the shadow of a tree below crabbe and goyle seemed to be keeping a lookout both were smirking malfoy was holding his hand up to his mouth and speaking into it 
 
 he looks like using a said harry curiously 
 
 he be said hermione told you those sorts of things work around hogwarts come on harry she added briskly turning away from the window and moving back into the middle of the room try that shield charm again 
 
 sirius was sending daily owls now like hermione he seemed to want to concentrate on getting harry through the last task before they concerned themselves with anything else he reminded harry in every letter that whatever might be going on outside the walls of hogwarts was not responsibility nor was it within his power to influence it 
 
 if voldemort is really getting stronger again he wrote my priority is to ensure your safety he cannot hope to lay hands on you while you are under protection but all the same take no risks concentrate on getting through that maze safely and then we can turn our attention to other matters 
 nerves mounted as june the drew closer but they were not as bad as those he had felt before the first and second tasks for one thing he was confident that this time he had done everything in his power to prepare for the task for another this was the final hurdle and however well or badly he did the tournament would at last be over which would be an enormous relief 
 
 
 
 breakfast was a very noisy affair at the gryffindor table on the morning of the third task the post owls appeared bringing harry a card from sirius it was only a piece of parchment folded over and bearing a muddy paw print on its front but harry appreciated it all the same a screech owl arrived for hermione carrying her morning copy of the daily prophet as usual she unfolded the paper glanced at the front page and spat out a mouthful of pumpkin juice all over it 
 
 what said harry and ron together staring at her nothing said hermione quickly trying to shove the paper out of sight but ron grabbed it he stared at the headline and said no way not today that old cow 
 
 what said harry rita skeeter again 
 
 no said ron and just like hermione he attempted to push the paper out of sight 
 
 about me it said harry 
 
 no said ron in an entirely unconvincing tone but before harry could demand to see the paper draco malfoy shouted across the great hall from the slytherin table 
 
 hey potter potter your head you feeling all right sure not going to go berserk on us 
 
 malfoy was holding a copy of the daily prophet too slytherins up and down the table were sniggering twisting in their seats to see reaction 
 
 let me see it harry said to ron give it here 
 
 very reluctantly ron handed over the newspaper harry turned it over and found himself staring at his own picture beneath the banner headline 
 
 harry potter 
 disturbed and dangerous 
 the boy who defeated is unstable and possibly dangerous writes rita skeeter special correspondent alarming evidence has recently come to light about harry strange behavior which casts doubts upon his suitability to compete in a demanding competition like the triwizard tournament or even to attend hogwarts school 
 potter the daily prophet can exclusively reveal regularly collapses at school and is often heard to complain of pain in the scar on his forehead relic of the curse with which attempted to kill him on monday last midway through a divination lesson your daily prophet reporter witnessed potter storming from the class claiming that his scar was hurting too badly to continue studying 
 it is possible say top experts at st hospital for magical maladies and injuries that potters brain was affected by the attack inflicted upon him by and that his insistence that the scar is still hurting is an expression of his confusion 
 he might even be pretending said one specialist this could be a plea for attention 
 the daily prophet however has unearthed worrying facts about harry potter that albus dumbledore headmaster of hogwarts has carefully concealed from the wizarding public 
 potter can speak parseltongue reveals draco malfoy a hogwarts fourth year there were a lot of attacks on students a couple of years ago and most people thought potter was behind them after they saw him lose his temper at a dueling club and set a snake on another boy it was all hushed up though but made friends with werewolves and giants too we think do anything for a bit of power 
 parseltongue the ability to converse with snakes has long been considered a dark art indeed the most famous parselmouth of our times is none other than himself a member of the dark force defense league who wished to remain unnamed stated that he would regard any wizard who could speak parseltongue as worthy of investigation personally i would be highly suspicious of anybody who could converse with snakes as serpents are often used in the worst kinds of dark magic and are historically associated with evildoers similarly anyone who seeks out the company of such vicious creatures as werewolves and giants would appear to have a fondness for violence 
 albus dumbledore should surely consider whether a boy such as this should be allowed to compete in the triwizard tournament some fear that potter might resort to the dark arts in his desperation to win the tournament the third task of which takes place this evening 
 gone off me a bit she said harry lightly folding up the paper 
 
 over at the slytherin table malfoy crabbe and goyle were laughing at him tapping their heads with their fingers pulling grotesquely mad faces and waggling their tongues like snakes 
 
 how did she know your scar hurt in divination ron said no way she was there no way she heard 
 
 the window was open said harry i opened it to breathe 
 
 you were at the top of north tower hermione said your voice have carried all the way down to the grounds 
 
 well the one supposed to be researching magical methods of bugging said harry you tell me how she did it 
 
 been trying said hermione but ibut 
 
 an odd dreamy expression suddenly came over face she slowly raised a hand and ran her fingers through her hair 
 
 are you all right said ron frowning at her 
 
 yes said hermione breathlessly she ran her fingers through her hair again and then held her hand up to her mouth as though speaking into an invisible harry and ron stared at each other 
 
 had an idea hermione said gazing into space i think i knowbecause then no one would be able to seeeven moodyand have been able to get onto the window ledgebut not definitely not allowedi think got her just give me two seconds in the library just to make sure 
 
 with that hermione seized her school bag and dashed out of the great hall 
 
 oi ron called after her got our history of magic exam in ten minutes blimey he said turning back to harry she must really hate that skeeter woman to risk missing the start of an exam you going to do in class read again 
 
 exempt from the tests as a triwizard champion harry had been sitting in the back of every exam class so far looking up fresh hexes for the third task 
 
 so harry said to ron but just then professor mcgonagall came walking alongside the gryffindor table toward him 
 
 potter the champions are congregating in the chamber off the hall after breakfast she said 
 
 but the not till tonight said harry accidentally spilling scrambled eggs down his front afraid he had mistaken the time 
 
 aware of that potter she said the champions families are invited to watch the final task you know this is simply a chance for you to greet them 
 
 she moved away harry gaped after her 
 
 she expect the dursleys to turn up does she he asked ron blankly 
 
 dunno said ron harry better hurry going to be late for binns see you later 
 
 harry finished his breakfast in the emptying great hall he saw fleur delacour get up from the ravenclaw table and join cedric as he crossed to the side chamber and entered krum slouched off to join them shortly afterward harry stayed where he was he really want to go into the chamber he had no family no family who would turn up to see him risk his life anyway but just as he was getting up thinking that he might as well go up to the library and do a spot more hex research the door of the side chamber opened and cedric stuck his head out 
 
 harry come on waiting for you 
 
 utterly perplexed harry got up the dursleys possibly be here could they he walked across the hall and opened the door into the chamber 
 
 cedric and his parents were just inside the door viktor krum was over in a corner conversing with his mother and father in rapid bulgarian he had inherited his fathers hooked nose on the other side of the room fleur was jabbering away in french to her mother little sister gabrielle was holding her hand she waved at harry who waved back grinning then he saw mrs weasley and bill standing in front of the fireplace beaming at him 
 
 surprise mrs weasley said excitedly as he smiled broadly and walked over to them thought come and watch you harry she bent down and kissed him on the cheek 
 
 you all right said bill grinning at harry and shaking his hand charlie wanted to come but he get time off he said you were incredible against the horntail 
 
 fleur delacour harry noticed was eyeing bill with great interest over her shoulder harry could tell she had no objection whatsoever to long hair or earrings with fangs on them 
 
 this is really nice of you harry muttered to mrs weasley i thought for a moment the dursleys 
 
 hmm said mrs weasley pursing her lips she had always refrained from criticizing the dursleys in front of harry but her eyes flashed every time they were mentioned 
 
 great being back here said bill looking around the chamber violet the fat friend winked at him from her frame seen this place for five years is that picture of the mad knight still around sir cadogan 
 
 oh yeah said harry who had met sir cadogan the previous year 
 
 and the fat lady said bill 
 
 she was here in my time said mrs weasley she gave me such a telling off one night when i got back to the dormitory at four in the morning 
 
 what were you doing out of your dormitory at four in the morning said bill surveying his mother with amazement 
 
 mrs weasley grinned her eyes twinkling 
 
 your father and i had been for a nighttime stroll she said he got caught by apollyon pringle he was the caretaker in those days your still got the marks 
 
 fancy giving us a tour harry said bill 
 
 yeah okay said harry and they made their way back toward the door into the great hall as they passed amos diggory he looked around 
 
 there you are are you he said looking harry up and down 
 
 bet not feeling quite as full of yourself now caught you up on points are you 
 
 what said harry 
 
 ignore him said cedric in a low voice to harry frowning after his father been angry ever since rita article about the triwizard tournament you know when she made out you were the only hogwarts champion 
 
 bother to correct her though did he said amos diggory loudly enough for harry to hear as he started to walk out of the door with mrs weasley and bill show him ced beaten him once before you 
 
 rita skeeter goes out of her way to cause trouble amos mrs weasley said angrily i would have thought know that working at the ministry 
 
 mr diggory looked as though he was going to say something angry but his wife laid a hand on his arm and he merely shrugged and turned away 
 
 harry had a very enjoyable morning walking over the sunny grounds with bill and mrs weasley showing them the beauxbatons carriage and the durmstrang ship mrs weasley was intrigued by the whomping willow which had been planted after she had left school and reminisced at length about the gamekeeper before hagrid a man called ogg 
 
 percy harry asked as they walked around the greenhouses 
 
 not good said bill 
 
 very upset said mrs weasley lowering her voice and glancing around the ministry wants to keep mr disappearance quiet but been hauled in for questioning about the instructions mr crouch has been sending in they seem to think a chance they genuinely written by him been under a lot of strain not letting him fill in for mr crouch as the fifth judge tonight cornelius fudge is going to be doing it 
 
 they returned to the castle for lunch 
 
 mum bill said ron looking stunned as he joined the gryffindor table you doing here 
 
 come to watch harry in the last task said mrs weasley brightly i must say it makes a lovely change not having to cook how was your exam 
 
 ohokay said ron remember all the goblin rebels names so i invented a few all right he said helping himself to a cornish pasty while mrs weasley looked stern all called stuff like bodrod the bearded and urg the unclean it hard 
 
 fred george and ginny came to sit next to them too and harry was having such a good time he felt almost as though he were back at the burrow he had forgotten to worry about that task and not until hermione turned up halfway through lunch did he remember that she had had a brainwave about rita skeeter 
 
 are you going to tell us 
 
 hermione shook her head warningly and glanced at mrs weasley 
 
 hello hermione said mrs weasley much more stiffly than usual 
 
 hello said hermione her smile faltering at the cold expression on mrs face 
 
 harry looked between them then said mrs weasley you believe that rubbish rita skeeter wrote in witch weekly did you because not my girlfriend 
 
 oh said mrs weasley no of course i 
 
 but she became considerably warmer toward hermione after that 
 
 harry bill and mrs weasley whiled away the afternoon with a long walk around the castle and then returned to the great hall for the evening feast ludo bagman and cornelius fudge had joined the staff table now bagman looked quite cheerful but cornelius fudge who was sitting next to madame maxime looked stern and was not talking madame maxime was concentrating on her plate and harry thought her eyes looked red hagrid kept glancing along the table at her 
 
 there were more courses than usual but harry who was starting to feel really nervous now eat much as the enchanted ceiling overhead began to fade from blue to a dusky purple dumbledore rose to his feet at the staff table and silence fell 
 
 ladies and gentlemen in five minutes time i will be asking you to make your way down to the quidditch field for the third and final task of the triwizard tournament will the champions please follow mr bagman down to the stadium now 
 
 harry got up the gryffindors all along the table were applauding him the weasleys and hermione all wished him good luck and he headed off out of the great hall with cedric fleur and viktor 
 
 feeling all right harry bagman asked as they went down the stone steps onto the grounds confident 
 
 okay said harry it was sort of true he was nervous but he kept running over all the hexes and spells he had been practicing in his mind as they walked and the knowledge that he could remember them all made him feel better 
 
 they walked onto the quidditch field which was now completely unrecognizable a hedge ran all the way around the edge of it there was a gap right in front of them the entrance to the vast maze the passage beyond it looked dark and creepy 
 
 five minutes later the stands had begun to fill the air was full of excited voices and the rumbling of feet as the hundreds of students filed into their seats the sky was a deep clear blue now and the first stars were starting to appear hagrid professor moody professor mcgonagall and professor flitwick came walking into the stadium and approached bagman and the champions they were wearing large red luminous stars on their hats all except hagrid who had his on the back of his moleskin vest 
 
 we are going to be patrolling the outside of the maze said professor mcgonagall to the champions if you get into difficulty and wish to be rescued send red sparks into the air and one of us will come and get you do you understand 
 
 the champions nodded 
 
 off you go then said bagman brightly to the four patrollers 
 
 good luck harry hagrid whispered and the four of them walked away in different directions to station themselves around the maze bagman now pointed his wand at his throat muttered sonorus and his magically magnified voice echoed into the stands 
 
 ladies and gentlemen the third and final task of the triwizard tournament is about to begin let me remind you how the points currently stand tied in first place with points each mr cedric diggory and mr harry potter both of hogwarts school the cheers and applause sent birds from the forbidden forest fluttering into the darkening sky in second place with eighty points mr viktor krum of durmstrang institute more applause and in third place miss fleur delacour of beauxbatons academy 
 
 harry could just make out mrs weasley bill ron and hermione applauding fleur politely halfway up the stands he waved up at them and they waved back beaming at him 
 
 soon my whistle harry and cedric said bagman three two one 
 
 he gave a short blast on his whistle and harry and cedric hurried forward into the maze 
 
 the towering hedges cast black shadows across the path and whether because they were so tall and thick or because they had been enchanted the sound of the surrounding crowd was silenced the moment they entered the maze harry felt almost as though he were underwater again he pulled out his wand muttered lumos and heard cedric do the same just behind him 
 
 after about fifty yards they reached a fork they looked at each other 
 
 see you harry said and he took the left one while cedric took the right 
 
 harry heard whistle for the second time krum had entered the maze harry sped up his chosen path seemed completely deserted he turned right and hurried on holding his wand high over his head trying to see as far ahead as possible still there was nothing in sight 
 
 whistle blew in the distance for the third time all of the champions were now inside 
 
 harry kept looking behind him the old feeling that he was being watched was upon him the maze was growing darker with every passing minute as the sky overhead deepened to navy he reached a second fork 
 
 point me he whispered to his wand holding it flat in his palm 
 
 the wand spun around once and pointed toward his right into solid hedge that way was north and he knew that he needed to go northwest for the center of the maze the best he could do was to take the left fork and go right again as soon as possible 
 
 the path ahead was empty too and when harry reached a right turn and took it he again found his way unblocked harry know why but the lack of obstacles was unnerving him surely he should have met something by now it felt as though the maze were luring him into a false sense of security then he heard movement right behind him he held out his wand ready to attack but its beam fell only upon cedric who had just hurried out of a path on the side cedric looked severely shaken the sleeve of his robe was smoking 
 
 skrewts he hissed enormous i only just got away 
 
 he shook his head and dived out of sight along another path keen to put plenty of distance between himself and the skrewts harry hurried off again then as he turned a corner he sawa dementor gliding toward him twelve feet tall its face hidden by its hood its rotting scabbed hands outstretched it advanced sensing its way blindly toward him harry could hear its rattling breath he felt clammy coldness stealing over him but knew what he had to do 
 
 he summoned the happiest thought he could concentrated with all his might on the thought of getting out of the maze and celebrating with ron and hermione raised his wand and cried expecto patronum 
 
 a silver stag erupted from the end of wand and galloped toward the dementor which fell back and tripped over the hem of its had never seen a dementor stumble 
 
 hang on he shouted advancing in the wake of his silver patronus a boggart riddikulus 
 
 there was a loud crack and the exploded in a wisp of smoke the silver stag faded from sight harry wished it could have stayed he could have used some companybut he moved on quickly and quietly as possible listening hard his wand held high once more 
 
 leftrightleft againtwice he found himself facing dead ends he did the spell again and found that he was going too far east he turned back took a right turn and saw an odd golden mist floating ahead of him 
 
 harry approached it cautiously pointing the beam at it this looked like some kind of enchantment he wondered whether he might be able to blast it out of the way 
 
 reducio he said 
 
 the spell shot straight through the mist leaving it intact he supposed he should have known better the reductor curse was for solid objects what would happen if he walked through the mist was it worth chancing it or should he double back 
 
 he was still hesitating when a scream shattered the silence 
 
 fleur harry yelled 
 
 there was silence he stared all around him what had happened to her her scream seemed to have come from somewhere ahead he took a deep breath and ran through the enchanted mist 
 
 the world turned upside down harry was hanging from the ground with his hair on end his glasses dangling off his nose threatening to fall into the bottomless sky he clutched them to the end of his nose and hung there terrified it felt as though his feet were glued to the grass which had now become the ceiling below him the dark heavens stretched endlessly he felt as though if he tried to move one of his feet he would fall away from the earth completely 
 
 think he told himself as all the blood rushed to his head think 
 
 but not one of the spells he had practiced had been designed to combat a sudden reversal of ground and sky did he dare move his foot he could hear the blood pounding in his ears he had two choices try and move or send up red sparks and get rescued and disqualified from the task 
 
 he shut his eyes so he be able to see the view of endless space below him and pulled his right foot as hard as he could away from the grassy ceiling 
 
 immediately the world righted itself harry fell forward onto his knees onto the wonderfully solid ground he felt temporarily limp with shock he took a deep steadying breath then got up again and hurried forward looking back over his shoulder as he ran away from the golden mist which twinkled innocently at him in the moonlight 
 
 he paused at a junction of two paths and looked around for some sign of fleur he was sure it had been she who had screamed what had she met was she all right there was no sign of red sparks did that mean she had got herself out of trouble or was she in such trouble that she reach her wand harry took the right fork with a feeling of increasing uneasebut at the same time he help thinking one champion down 
 
 the cup was somewhere close by and it sounded as though fleur was no longer in the running got this far he what if he actually managed to win fleetingly and for the first time since found himself champion he saw again that image of himself raising the triwizard cup in front of the rest of the school 
 
 he met nothing for ten minutes but kept running into dead ends twice he took the same wrong turning finally he found a new route and started to jog along it his wandlight waving making his shadow flicker and distort on the hedge walls then he rounded another corner and found himself facing a skrewt 
 
 cedric was right it was enormous ten feet long it looked more like a giant scorpion than anything its long sting was curled over its back its thick armor glinted in the light from wand which he pointed at it 
 
 stupefy 
 
 the spell hit the armor and rebounded harry ducked just in time but could smell burning hair it had singed the top of his head the skrewt issued a blast of fire from its end and flew forward toward him 
 
 impedimenta harry yelled the spell hit the armor again and ricocheted off harry staggered back a few paces and fell over impedimenta 
 
 the skrewt was inches from him when it froze he had managed to hit it on its fleshy underside panting harry pushed himself away from it and ran hard in the opposite direction the impediment curse was not permanent the skrewt would be regaining the use of its legs at any moment 
 
 he took a left path and hit a dead end a right and hit another forcing himself to stop heart hammering he performed the spell again backtracked and chose a path that would take him northwest 
 
 he had been hurrying along the new path for a few minutes when he heard something in the path running parallel to his own that made him stop dead 
 
 what are you doing yelled voice what the hell think doing 
 
 and then harry heard voice 
 
 crucio 
 
 the air was suddenly full of yells horrified harry began sprinting up his path trying to find a way into when none appeared he tried the reductor curse again it very effective but it burned a small hole in the hedge through which harry forced his leg kicking at the thick brambles and branches until they broke and made an opening he struggled through it tearing his robes and looking to his right saw cedric jerking and twitching on the ground krum standing over him 
 
 harry pulled himself up and pointed his wand at krum just as krum looked up krum turned and began to run 
 
 stupefy harry yelled 
 
 the spell hit krum in the back he stopped dead in his tracks fell forward and lay motionless facedown in the grass over to cedric who had stopped twitching and was lying there panting his hands over his face 
 
 are you all right harry said roughly grabbing arm 
 
 yeah panted cedric yeahi believe ithe crept up behind heard him i turned around and he had his wand on me 
 
 cedric got up he was still shaking he and harry looked down at krum 
 
 i believe thisi thought he was all right harry said staring at krum 
 
 so did i said cedric 
 
 did you hear fleur scream earlier said harry 
 
 yeah said cedric you think krum got her too 
 
 i know said harry slowly 
 
 should we leave him here cedric muttered 
 
 no said harry i reckon we should send up red sparks come and collect himotherwise probably be eaten by a skrewt 
 
 deserve it cedric muttered but all the same he raised his wand and shot a shower of red sparks into the air which hovered high above krum marking the spot where he lay 
 
 harry and cedric stood there in the darkness for a moment looking around them then cedric said welli better go on 
 
 what said harry ohyeahright 
 
 it was an odd moment he and cedric had been briefly united against krum now the fact that they were opponents came back to harry the two of them proceeded up the dark path without speaking then harry turned left and cedric right footsteps soon died away 
 
 harry moved on continuing to use the spell making sure he was moving in the right direction it was between him and cedric now his desire to reach the cup first was now burning stronger than ever but he could hardly believe what just seen krum do the use of an unforgivable curse on a fellow human being meant a life term in azkaban that was what moody had told them krum surely have wanted the triwizard cup that sped up 
 
 every so often he hit more dead ends but the increasing darkness made him feel sure he was getting near the heart of the maze then as he strode down a long straight path he saw movement once again and his beam of wandlight hit an extraordinary creature one which he had only seen in picture form in his monster book of monsters 
 
 it was a sphinx it had the body of an lion great clawed paws and a long yellowish tail ending in a brown tuft its head however was that of a woman she turned her long eyes upon harry as he approached he raised his wand hesitating she was not crouching as if to spring but pacing from side to side of the path blocking his progress then she spoke in a deep hoarse voice 
 
 you are very near your goal the quickest way is past me 
 
 soso will you move please said harry knowing what the answer was going to be 
 
 no she said continuing to pace not unless you can answer my riddle answer on your first guess i let you pass answer wrongly i attack remain silent i will let you walk away from me unscathed 
 
 stomach slipped several notches it was hermione who was good at this sort of thing not him he weighed his chances if the riddle was too hard he could keep silent get away from the sphinx unharmed and try and find an alternative route to the center 
 
 okay he said can i hear the riddle 
 
 the sphinx sat down upon her hind legs in the very middle of the path and recited 
 
 first think of the person who lives in disguise 
 who deals in secrets and tells naught but lies 
 next tell me always the last thing to mend 
 the middle of middle and end of the end 
 and finally give me the sound often heard 
 during the search for a word 
 now string them together and answer me this 
 which creature would you be unwilling to kiss 
 
 harry gaped at her 
 
 could i have it againmore slowly he asked tentatively she blinked at him smiled and repeated the poem all the clues add up to a creature i want to kiss harry asked 
 
 she merely smiled her mysterious smile harry took that for a yes harry cast his mind around there were plenty of animals he want to kiss his immediate thought was a skrewt but something told him that the answer have to try and work out the clues 
 
 a person in disguise harry muttered staring at her who be a an impostor no not my guess a a spy come back to thatcould you give me the next clue again please 
 
 she repeated the next lines of the poem 
 
 the last thing to mend harry repeated erno of i have the last bit again 
 
 she gave him the last four lines 
 
 the sound often heard during the search for a word said harry beerhang on er a sound 
 
 the sphinx smiled at him 
 
 spyerspyer said harry pacing up and down a creature i want to kissa spider 
 
 the sphinx smiled more broadly she got up stretched her front legs and then moved aside for him to pass 
 
 thanks said harry and amazed at his own brilliance he dashed forward 
 
 he had to be close now he had to wand was telling him he was bang on course as long as he meet anything too horrible he might have a chance 
 
 harry broke into a run he had a choice of paths up ahead point me he whispered again to his wand and it spun around and pointed him to the one he dashed up this one and saw light ahead 
 
 the triwizard cup was gleaming on a plinth a hundred yards away suddenly a dark figure hurtled out onto the path in front of him 
 
 cedric was going to get there first cedric was sprinting as fast as he could toward the cup and harry knew he would never catch up cedric was much taller had much longer legs 
 
 then harry saw something immense over a hedge to his left moving quickly along a path that intersected with his own it was moving so fast cedric was about to run into it and cedric his eyes on the cup had not seen it 
 
 cedric harry bellowed on your left 
 
 cedric looked around just in time to hurl himself past the thing and avoid colliding with it but in his haste he tripped harry saw wand fly out of his hand as a gigantic spider stepped into the path and began to bear down upon cedric 
 
 stupefy harry yelled the spell hit the gigantic hairy black body but for all the good it did he might as well have thrown a stone at it the spider jerked scuttled around and ran at harry instead 
 
 stupefy impedimenta stupefy 
 
 but it was no use the spider was either so large or so magical that the spells were doing no more than aggravating it harry had one horrifying glimpse of eight shining black eyes and pincers before it was upon him 
 
 he was lifted into the air in its front legs struggling madly he tried to kick it his leg connected with the pincers and next moment he was in excruciating pain he could hear cedric yelling stupefy too but his spell had no more effect than harry raised his wand as the spider opened its pincers once more and shouted expelliarmus 
 
 it worked the disarming spell made the spider drop him but that meant that harry fell twelve feet onto his already injured leg which crumpled beneath him without pausing to think he aimed high at the underbelly as he had done with the skrewt and shouted as cedric yelled the same thing 
 
 the two spells combined did what one alone had not the spider keeled over sideways flattening a nearby hedge and strewing the path with a tangle of hairy legs 
 
 harry he heard cedric shouting you all right did it fall on you 
 
 no harry called back panting he looked down at his leg it was bleeding freely he could see some sort of thick gluey secretion from the pincers on his torn robes he tried to get up but his leg was shaking badly and did not want to support his weight he leaned against the hedge gasping for breath and looked around 
 
 cedric was standing feet from the triwizard cup which was gleaming behind him 
 
 take it then harry panted to cedric go on take it there 
 
 but cedric move he merely stood there looking at harry then he turned to stare at the cup harry saw the longing expression on his face in its golden light cedric looked around at harry again who was now holding onto the hedge to support himself cedric took a deep breath 
 
 you take it you should win twice saved my neck in here 
 
 not how supposed to work harry said he felt angry his leg was very painful he was aching all over from trying to throw off the spider and after all his efforts cedric had beaten him to it just as beaten harry to ask cho to the ball the one who reaches the cup first gets the points you telling you not going to win any races on this leg 
 
 cedric took a few paces nearer to the stunned spider away from the cup shaking his head 
 
 no he said 
 
 stop being noble said harry irritably just take it then we can get out of here 
 
 cedric watched harry steadying himself holding tight to the hedge 
 
 you told me about the dragons cedric said i gone down in the first task if you told me what was coming 
 
 i had help on that too harry snapped trying to mop up his bloody leg with his robes you helped me with the egg square 
 
 i had help on the egg in the first place said cedric 
 
 still square said harry testing his leg gingerly it shook violently as he put weight on it he had sprained his ankle when the spider had dropped him 
 
 you got more points on the second task said cedric mulishly you stayed behind to get all the hostages i done that 
 
 i was the only one who was thick enough to take that song seriously said harry bitterly just take the cup 
 
 no said cedric 
 
 he stepped over the tangled legs to join harry who stared at him cedric was serious he was walking away from the sort of glory hufflepuff house had in centuries 
 
 go on cedric said he looked as though this was costing him every ounce of resolution he had but his face was set his arms were folded he seemed decided 
 
 harry looked from cedric to the cup for one shining moment he saw himself emerging from the maze holding it he saw himself holding the triwizard cup aloft heard the roar of the crowd saw face shining with admiration more clearly than he had ever seen it beforeand then the picture faded and he found himself staring at shadowy stubborn face 
 
 both of us harry said 
 
 what 
 
 take it at the same time still a hogwarts victory tie for it 
 
 cedric stared at harry he unfolded his arms 
 
 you you sure 
 
 yeah said harry helped each other out we we both got here just take it together 
 
 for a moment cedric looked as though he believe his ears then his face split in a grin 
 
 on he said come here 
 
 he grabbed arm below the shoulder and helped harry limp toward the plinth where the cup stood when they had reached it they both held a hand out over one of the gleaming handles 
 
 on three right said harry one two three 
 
 he and cedric both grasped a handle 
 
 instantly harry felt a jerk somewhere behind his navel his feet had left the ground he could not unclench the hand holding the triwizard cup it was pulling him onward in a howl of wind and swirling color cedric at his side 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire
