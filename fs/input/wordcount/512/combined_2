 and now having spoken of assaults let us sum up all acts ofviolence under a single law which shall be as one shalltake or carry away any of his goods neither shall heuse anything which is his without the consent of theowner for these are the offences which are and have been and willever be the source of all the aforesaid evils the greatest of themare excesses and insolences of youth and are offences against thegreatest when they are done against religion and especially greatwhen in violation of public and holy rites or of the in which tribes and phratries share and in the second degreegreat when they are committed against private rites and in the third degree not to repeat the acts formerly insults are offered to parents the fourth kind of violence iswhen any one regardless of the authority of the rulers takes orcarries away or makes use of anything which belongs to them nothaving their consent and the fifth kind is when the violation ofthe civil rights of an individual demands reparation there shouldbe a common law embracing all these cases for we have already said ingeneral terms what shall be the punishment of sacrilege whetherfraudulent or violent and now we have to determine what is to bethe punishment of those who speak or act insolently toward the first we must give them an admonition which may be in thefollowing one who in obedience to the laws believed thatthere were gods ever intentionally did any unholy act or uttered anyunlawful word but he who did must have supposed one of that they did not is the first secondly that if they did they took no care of man orthirdly that they were easily appeased and turned aside from theirpurpose by sacrifices and prayers 
 cleinias what shall we say or do to these persons 
 athenian stranger my good friend let us first hear the jests whichi suspect that they in their superiority will utter against us 
 cle what jests 
 ath they will make some irreverent speech of this of athens and sparta and cnosus they will reply inthat you speak truly for some of us deny the very existence of thegods while others as you say are of opinion that they do not careabout us and others that they are turned from their course bygifts now we have a right to claim as you yourself allowed in thematter of laws that before you are hard upon us and threaten should argue with us and convince should first attempt toteach and persuade us that there are gods by reasonable evidences andalso that they are too good to be unrighteous or to be turned from their course by gifts for when we hear such thingssaid of them by those who are esteemed to be the best of poets andorators and prophets and priests and by innumerable others thethoughts of most of us are not set upon abstaining from unrighteousacts but upon doing them and atoning for them when lawgivers professthat they are gentle and not stern we think that they should first ofall use persuasion to us and show us the existence of gods if not ina better manner than other men at any rate in a truer and whoknows but that we shall hearken to you if then our request is afair one please to accept our challenge 
 cle but is there any difficulty in proving the existence of thegods 
 ath how would you prove it 
 cle how in the first place the earth and the sun and the starsand the universe and the fair order of the seasons and thedivision of them into years and months furnish proofs of theirexistence and also there is the fact that all hellenes and barbariansbelieve in them 
 ath i fear my sweet friend though i will not say that i muchregard the contempt with which the profane will be likely to assailus for you do not understand the nature of their complaint and youfancy that they rush into impiety only from a love of sensualpleasure 
 cle why stranger what other reason is there 
 ath one which you who live in a different atmosphere would neverguess 
 cle what is it 
 ath a very grievous sort of ignorance which is imagined to be thegreatest wisdom 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath at athens there are tales preserved in writing which the virtueof your state as i am informed refuses to admit they speak of thegods in prose as well as verse and the oldest of them tell of theorigin of the heavens and of the world and not far from the beginningof their story they proceed to narrate the birth of the gods andhow after they were born they behaved to one another whether thesestories have in other ways a good or a bad influence i should notlike to be severe upon them because they are ancient but looking atthem with reference to the duties of children to their parents icannot praise them or think that they are useful or at all the words of the ancients i have nothing more to say and ishould wish to say of them only what is pleasing to the gods but asto our younger generation and their wisdom i cannot let them off whenthey do mischief for do but mark the effect of their words whenyou and i argue for the existence of the gods and produce the stars and earth claiming for them a divine being if wewould listen to the aforesaid philosophers we should say that they areearth and stones only which can have no care at all of human that all religion is a cooking up of words and a 
 cle one such teacher o stranger would be bad enough and youimply that there are many of them which is worse 
 ath well then what shall we say or we assume thatsome one is accusing us among unholy men who are trying to escapefrom the effect of our legislation and that they say of that you should legislate on the supposition that there aregods shall we make a defence of ourselves or shall we leave them andreturn to our laws lest the prelude should become longer than thelaw for the discourse will certainly extend to great length if weare to treat the impiously disposed as they desire partlydemonstrating to them at some length the things of which they demandan explanation partly making them afraid or dissatisfied and thenproceed to the requisite enactments 
 cle yes stranger but then how often have we repeated already thaton the present occasion there is no reason why brevity should bepreferred to length who is at our the saying goes and itwould be paltry and ridiculous to prefer the shorter to the better itis a matter of no small consequence in some way or other to provethat there are gods and that they are good and regard justice morethan men do the demonstration of this would be the best and noblestprelude of all our laws and therefore without impatience andwithout hurry let us unreservedly consider the whole up all the power of persuasion which we possess 
 ath seeing you thus in earnest i would fain offer up a prayer thati may i must proceed at once who can be calm when heis called upon to prove the existence of the gods who can avoidhating and abhorring the men who are and have been the cause of thisargument i speak of those who will not believe the tales which theyhave heard as babes and sucklings from their mothers and by them both in jest and earnest like charms who havealso heard them in the sacrificial prayers and seen sightsaccompanying and sounds delightful to theirparents during the sacrifices showing an intense earnestness on behalfof their children and of themselves and with eager interest talkingto the gods and beseeching them as though they were firmly convincedof their existence who likewise see and hear the prostrations andinvocations which are made by hellenes and barbarians at the risingand setting of the sun and moon in all the vicissitudes of as if they thought that there were no gods but as if therecould be no doubt of their existence and no suspicion of when men knowing all these things despise them onno real grounds as would be admitted by all who have any particleof intelligence and when they force us to say what we are now can any one in gentle terms remonstrate with the like of he has to begin by proving to them the very existence of thegods yet the attempt must be made for it would be unseemly thatone half of mankind should go mad in their lust of pleasure and theother half in their indignation at such persons our address tothese lost and perverted natures should not be spoken in us suppose ourselves to select some one of them and gently reasonwith him smothering our my son we will say to him youare young and the advance of time will make you reverse may of theopinions which you now hold wait awhile and do not attempt tojudge at present of the highest things and that is the highest ofwhich you now think know the gods rightly and to liveaccordingly and in the first place let me indicate to you one pointwhich is of great importance and about which i cannot and your friends are not the first who have held thisopinion about the gods there have always been persons more or lessnumerous who have had the same disorder i have known many of can tell you that no one who had taken up in youth thisopinion that the gods do not exist ever continued in the sameuntil he was old the two other notions certainly do continue insome cases but not in many the notion i mean that the godsexist but take no heed of human things and the other notion thatthey do take heed of them but are easily propitiated withsacrifices and prayers as to the opinion about the gods which maysome day become clear to you i advise you go wait and consider ifit be true or not ask of others and above all of the the meantime take care that you do not offend against the gods forthe duty of the legislator is and always will be to teach you thetruth of these matters 
 cle our address stranger thus far is excellent 
 ath quite true megillus and cleinias but i am afraid that we haveunconsciously lighted on a strange doctrine 
 cle what doctrine do you mean 
 ath the wisest of all doctrines in the opinion of many 
 cle i wish that you would speak plainer 
 ath the doctrine that all things do become have become and willbecome some by nature some by art and some by chance 
 cle is not that true 
 ath well philosophers are probably right at any rate we may aswell follow in their track and examine what is the meaning of themand their disciples 
 cle by all means 
 ath they say that the greatest and fairest things are the work ofnature and of chance the lesser of art which receiving fromnature the greater and primeval creations moulds and fashions allthose lesser works which are generally termed artificial 
 cle how is that 
 ath i will explain my meaning still more clearly they say thatfire and water and earth and air all exist by nature and chance andnone of them by art and that as to the bodies which come next and sun and moon and have been created bymeans of these absolutely inanimate existences the elements areseverally moved by chance and some inherent force according to certainaffinities among hot with cold or of dry with moist or ofsoft with hard and according to all the other accidental admixturesof opposites which have been formed by necessity after this fashionand in this manner the whole heaven has been created and all thatis in the heaven as well as animals and all plants and all theseasons come from these elements not by the action of mind as theysay or of any god or from art but as i was saying by nature andchance only art sprang up afterwards and out of these mortal andof mortal birth and produced in play certain images and verypartial imitations of the truth having an affinity to one as music and painting create and their companion arts andthere are other arts which have a serious purpose and with nature such for example as medicine and gymnastic and they say that politics cooperate with nature butin a less degree and have more of art also that legislation isentirely a work of art and is based on assumptions which are nottrue 
 cle how do you mean 
 ath in the first place my dear friend these people would say thatthe gods exist not by nature but by art and by the laws of are different in different places according to the agreement ofthose who make them and that the honourable is one thing by natureand another thing by law and that the principles of justice have noexistence at all in nature but that mankind are always disputingabout them and altering them and that the alterations which aremade by art and by law have no basis in nature but are of authorityfor the moment and at the time at which they are myfriends are the sayings of wise men poets and prose writers whichfind a way into the minds of youth they are told by them that thehighest right is might and in this way the young fall into the idea that the gods are not such as the law bids themimagine and hence arise factions these philosophers inviting them tolead a true life according to nature that is to live in realdominion over others and not in legal subjection to them 
 cle what a dreadful picture stranger have you given and howgreat is the injury which is thus inflicted on young men to the ruinboth of states and families 
 ath true cleinias but then what should the lawgiver do whenthis evil is of long standing should he only rise up in the state andthreaten all mankind proclaiming that if they will not say andthink that the gods are such as the law ordains and this may beextended generally to the honourable the just and to all the highestthings and to all that relates to virtue and vice and if theywill not make their actions conform to the copy which the law givesthem then he who refuses to obey the law shall die or suffer stripesand bonds or privation of citizenship or in some cases be punishedby loss of property and exile should he not rather when he is makinglaws for men at the same time infuse the spirit of persuasion intohis words and mitigate the severity of them as far as he can 
 cle why stranger if such persuasion be at all possible then alegislator who has anything in him ought never to weary ofpersuading men he ought to leave nothing unsaid in support of theancient opinion that there are gods and of all those other truthswhich you were just now mentioning he ought to support the law andalso art and acknowledge that both alike exist by nature and no lessthan nature if they are the creations of mind in accordance withright reason you appear to me to maintain and i am disposed to agreewith you in thinking 
 ath yes my enthusiastic cleinias but are not these things whenspoken to a multitude hard to be understood not to mention thatthey take up a dismal length of time 
 cle why stranger shall we whose patience failed not whendrinking or music were the themes of discourse weary now ofdiscoursing about the gods and about divine things and thegreatest help to rational legislation is that the laws when oncewritten down are always at rest they can be put to the test at anyfuture time and therefore if on first hearing they seem is no reason for apprehension about them because any manhowever dull can go over them and consider them again and again norif they are tedious but useful is there any reason or religion as itseems to me in any man refusing to maintain the principles of them tothe utmost of his power 
 megillus stranger i like what cleinias is saying 
 ath yes megillus and we should do as he proposes for ifimpious discourses were not scattered as i may say throughout theworld there would have been no need for any vindication of theexistence of the seeing that they are spread far and arguments are needed and who should come to the rescue of thegreatest laws when they are being undermined by bad men but thelegislator himself 
 meg there is no more proper champion of them 
 ath well then tell me i must ask you to be not he who talks in this way conceive fire and waterand earth and air to be the first elements of all things these hecalls nature and out of these he supposes the soul to be formedafterwards and this is not a mere conjecture of ours about hismeaning but is what he really means 
 cle very true 
 ath then by heaven we have discovered the source of this vainopinion of all those physical investigators and i would have youexamine their arguments with the utmost care for their impiety is avery serious matter they not only make a bad and mistaken use ofargument but they lead away the minds of others that is my opinionof them 
 cle you are right but i should like to know how this happens 
 ath i fear that the argument may seem singular 
 cle do not hesitate stranger i see that you are afraid of sucha discussion carrying you beyond the limits of legislation but ifthere be no other way of showing our agreement in the belief thatthere are gods of whom the law is said now to approve let us takethis way my good sir 
 ath then i suppose that i must repeat the singular argument ofthose who manufacture the soul according to their own impious affirm that which is the first cause of the generation anddestruction of all things to be not first but last and that whichis last to be first and hence they have fallen into error about thetrue nature of the gods 
 cle still i do not understand you 
 ath nearly all of them my friends seem to be ignorant of thenature and power of the soul especially in what relates to herorigin they do not know that she is among the first of things andbefore all bodies and is the chief author of their changes andtranspositions and if this is true and if the soul is older than thebody must not the things which are of the kindred be ofnecessity prior to those which appertain to the body 
 cle certainly 
 ath then thought and attention and mind and art and law will beprior to that which is hard and soft and heavy and light and thegreat and primitive works and actions will be works of art theywill be the first and after them will come nature and works ofnature which however is a wrong term for men to apply to will follow and will be under the government of art and mind 
 cle but why is the word nature wrong 
 ath because those who use the term mean to say that nature is thefirst creative power but if the soul turn out to be the primevalelement and not fire or air then in the truest sense and beyondother things the soul may be said to exist by nature and this wouldbe true if you proved that the soul is older than the body but nototherwise 
 cle you are quite right 
 ath shall we then take this as the next point to which ourattention should be directed 
 cle by all means 
 ath let us be on our guard lest this most deceptive argument withits youthful looks beguiling us old men give us the slip and makea of us who knows but we may be aiming at the fail of attaining the lesser suppose that we three have to pass arapid river and i being the youngest of the three and experienced inrivers take upon me the duty of making the attempt first by you in safety on the bank i am to examine whether the riveris passable by older men like yourselves and if such appears to bethe case then i shall invite you to follow and my experience willhelp to convey you across but if the river is impassable by you thenthere will have been no danger to anybody but not thatseem to be a very fair proposal i mean to say that the argument inprospect is likely to be too much for you out of your depth andbeyond your strength and i should be afraid that the stream of myquestions might create in you who are not in the habit of and confusion of mind and hence a feeling of unpleasantnessand unsuitableness might arise i think therefore that i had betterfirst ask the questions and then answer them myself while you listenin safety in that way i can carry on the argument until i havecompleted the proof that the soul is prior to the body 
 cle excellent stranger and i hope that you will do as youpropose 
 ath come then and if ever we are to call upon the gods let uscall upon them now in all seriousness to come to the demonstrationof their own existence and so holding fast to the rope we willventure upon the depths of the argument when questions of this sortare asked of me my safest answer would appear to be one says to me o stranger are all things at restand nothing in motion or is the exact opposite of this true or aresome things in motion and others at this i shall reply thatsome things are in motion and others at rest and do not things whichmove a place and are not the things which are at rest at rest in aplace certainly and some move or rest in one place and some inmore places than one you mean to say we shall rejoin that thosethings which rest at the centre move in one place just as thecircumference goes round of globes which are said to be at and we observe that in the revolution the motion whichcarries round the larger and the lesser circle at the same time isproportionally distributed to greater and smaller and is greaterand smaller in a certain proportion here is a wonder which might bethought an impossibility that the same motion should impart swiftnessand slowness in due proportion to larger and lesser circles verytrue and when you speak of bodies moving in many places you seem tome to mean those which move from one place to another and sometimeshave one centre of motion and sometimes more than one because theyturn upon their axis and whenever they meet anything if it bestationary they are divided by it but if they get in the midstbetween bodies which are approaching and moving towards the samespot from opposite directions they unite with them i admit thetruth of what you are saying also when they unite they grow andwhen they are divided they waste is supposing theconstitution of each to remain or if that fails then there is asecond reason of their dissolution and when are all things createdand how clearly they are created when the first principlereceives increase and attains to the second dimension and from thisarrives at the one which is neighbour to this and after reachingthe third becomes perceptible to sense everything which is thuschanging and moving is in process of generation only when at rest hasit real existence but when passing into another state it is destroyedutterly have we not mentioned all motions that there are andcomprehended them under their kinds and numbered them with theexception my friends of two 
 cle which are they 
 ath just the two with which our present enquiry is concerned 
 cle speak plainer 
 ath i suppose that our enquiry has reference to the soul 
 cle very true 
 ath let us assume that there is a motion able to move other not to move is one kind and there is another kindwhich can move itself as well as other things working incomposition and decomposition by increase and diminution andgeneration and is also one of the many kinds ofmotion 
 cle granted 
 ath and we will assume that which moves other and is changed byother to be the ninth and that which changes itself and is with every action and every passion and is thetrue principle of change and motion in all that we shall beinclined to call the tenth 
 cle certainly 
 ath and which of these ten motions ought we to prefer as beingthe mightiest and most efficient 
 cle i must say that the motion which is able to move itself isten thousand times superior to all the others 
 ath very good but may i make one or two corrections in what i havebeen saying 
 cle what are they 
 ath when i spoke of the tenth sort of motion that was not quitecorrect 
 cle what was the error 
 ath according to the true order the tenth was really the firstin generation and power then follows the second which wasstrangely enough termed the ninth by us 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath i mean this when one thing changes another and thatanother of such will there be any primary changing element how can athing which is moved by another ever be the beginning of but when the changes other and that againother and thus thousands upon tens of thousands of bodies are setin motion must not the beginning of all this motion be the changeof the principle 
 cle very true and i quite agree 
 ath or to put the question in another way making answer as most of these philosophers have the audacity toaffirm all things were at rest in one mass which of principles of motion would first spring up among them 
 cle clearly the for there could be no change in themarising out of any external cause the change must first take place inthemselves 
 ath then we must say that being the origin of allmotions and the first which arises among things at rest as well asamong things in motion is the eldest and mightiest principle ofchange and that which is changed by another and yet moves other issecond 
 cle quite true 
 ath at this stage of the argument let us put a question 
 cle what question 
 ath if we were to see this power existing in any earthy watery orfiery substance simple or should we describe it 
 cle you mean to ask whether we should call such a powerlife 
 ath i do 
 cle certainly we should 
 ath and when we see soul in anything must we not do we not admit that this is life 
 cle we must 
 ath and now i beseech you would admit that we have athreefold knowledge of things 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath i mean that we know the essence and that we know thedefinition of the essence and the are the three andthere are two questions which may be raised about anything 
 cle how two 
 ath sometimes a person may give the name and ask the definition orhe may give the definition and ask the name i may illustrate what imean in this way 
 cle how 
 ath number like some other things is capable of being dividedinto equal parts when thus divided number is named even and thedefinition of the name even is number divisible into two equalparts 
 cle true 
 ath i mean that when we are asked about the definition and givethe name or when we are asked about the name and give either case whether we give name or definition wespeak of the same thing calling even the number which is dividedinto two equal parts 
 cle quite true 
 ath and what is the definition of that which is named soul canwe conceive of any other than that which has been already which can move itself 
 cle you mean to say that the essence which is defined as is the same with that which has the name soul 
 ath yes and if this is true do we still maintain that there isanything wanting in the proof that the soul is the first origin andmoving power of all that is or has become or will be and theircontraries when she has been clearly shown to be the source of changeand motion in all things 
 cle certainly not the soul as being the source of motion has beenmost satisfactorily shown to be the oldest of all things 
 ath and is not that motion which is produced in another byreason of another but never has any power at all beingin truth the change of an inanimate body to be reckoned second or byany lower number which you may prefer 
 cle exactly 
 ath then we are right and speak the most perfect and absolutetruth when we say that the soul is prior to the body and that thebody is second and comes afterwards and is born to obey the is the ruler 
 cle nothing can be more true 
 ath do you remember our old admission that if the soul was priorto the body the things of the soul were also prior to those of thebody 
 cle certainly 
 ath then characters and manners and wishes and reasonings andtrue opinions and reflections and recollections are prior tolength and breadth and depth and strength of bodies if the soul isprior to the body 
 cle to be sure 
 ath in the next place must we not of necessity admit that the soulis the cause of good and evil base and honourable just and of all other opposites if we suppose her to be the cause of allthings 
 cle we must 
 ath and as the soul orders and inhabits all things that moving must we not say that she orders also the heavens 
 cle of course 
 ath one soul or more more than will answer for you at anyrate we must not suppose that there are less than theauthor of good and the other of evil 
 cle very true 
 ath yes very true the soul then directs all things in heaven andearth and sea by her movements and these are described by consideration attention deliberation opinion true andfalse joy and sorrow confidence fear hatred love and otherprimary motions akin to these which again receive the secondarymotions of corporeal substances and guide all things to growth anddecay to composition and decomposition and to the qualities whichaccompany them such as heat and cold heaviness and and softness blackness and whiteness bitterness andsweetness and all those other qualities which the soul a goddess when truly receiving the divine mind shedisciplines all things rightly to their happiness but when she is thecompanion of folly she does the very contrary of all this shall weassume so much or do we still entertain doubts 
 cle there is no room at all for doubt 
 ath shall we say then that it is the soul which controls heaven andearth and the whole it is a principle of wisdom andvirtue or a principle which has neither wisdom nor virtue supposethat we make answer as follows 
 cle how would you answer 
 ath if my friend we say that the whole path and movement ofheaven and of all that is therein is by nature akin to themovement and revolution and calculation of mind and proceeds bykindred laws then as is plain we must say that the best soultakes care of the world and guides it along the good path 
 cle true 
 ath but if the world moves wildly and irregularly then the evilsoul guides it 
 cle true again 
 ath of what nature is the movement of this question itis not easy to give an intelligent answer and therefore i ought toassist you in framing one 
 cle very good 
 ath then let us not answer as if we would look straight at the ourselves darkness at mean as if we were under theimpression that we could see with mortal eyes or know adequatelythe nature of will be safer to look at the image only 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath let us select of the ten motions the one which mind chieflyresembles this i will bring to your recollection and will thenmake the answer on behalf of us all 
 cle that will be excellent 
 ath you will surely remember our saying that all things were eitherat rest or in motion 
 cle i do 
 ath and that of things in motion some were moving in one place andothers in more than one 
 cle yes 
 ath of these two kinds of motion that which moves in one placemust move about a centre like globes made in a lathe and is mostentirely akin and similar to the circular movement of mind 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath in saying that both mind and the motion which is in one placemove in the same and like manner in and about the same and inrelation to the same and according to one proportion and order andare like the motion of a globe we invented a fair image which doesno discredit to our ingenuity 
 cle it does us great credit 
 ath and the motion of the other sort which is not after the samemanner nor in the same nor about the same nor in relation to thesame nor in one place nor in order nor according to any rule orproportion may be said to be akin to senselessness and folly 
 cle that is most true 
 ath then after what has been said there is no difficulty indistinctly stating that since soul carries all things round eitherthe best soul or the contrary must of necessity carry round andorder and arrange the revolution of the heaven 
 cle and judging from what has been said stranger there would beimpiety in asserting that any but the most perfect soul or soulscarries round the heavens 
 ath you have understood my meaning right well cleinias and nowlet me ask you another question 
 cle what are you going to ask 
 ath if the soul carries round the sun and moon and the otherstars does she not carry round each individual of them 
 cle certainly 
 ath then of one of them let us speak and the same argument willapply to all 
 cle which will you take 
 ath every one sees the body of the sun but no one sees his the soul of any other body living or dead and yet there isgreat reason to believe that this nature unperceived by any of oursenses is circumfused around them all but is perceived by therefore by mind and reflection only let us apprehend thefollowing point 
 cle what is that 
 ath if the soul carries round the sun we shall not be far wrong insupposing one of three alternatives 
 cle what are they 
 ath either the soul which moves the sun this way and within the circular and visible body like the soul whichcarries us about every way or the soul provides herself with anexternal body of fire or air as some affirm and violently propelsbody by body or thirdly she is without such abody but guides thesun by some extraordinary and wonderful power 
 cle yes certainly the soul can only order all things in one ofthese three ways 
 ath and this soul of the sun which is therefore better than thesun whether taking the sun about in a chariot to give light to acting from without or in whatever way ought by every man to bedeemed a god 
 cle yes by every man who has the least particle of sense 
 ath and of the stars too and of the moon and of the years andmonths and seasons must we not say in like manner that since asoul or souls having every sort of excellence are the causes of all ofthem those souls are gods whether they are living beings andreside in bodies and in this way order the whole heaven orwhatever be the place and mode of their will any onewho admits all this venture to deny that all things full of gods 
 cle no one stranger would be such a madman 
 ath and now megillus and cleinias let us offer terms to him whohas hitherto denied the existence of the gods and leave him 
 cle what terms 
 ath either he shall teach us that we were wrong in saying thatthe soul is the original of all things and arguing accordingly he be not able to say anything better then he must yield to us andlive for the remainder of his life in the belief that there us see then whether we have said enough or not enough tothose who deny that there are gods 
 cle enough stranger 
 ath then to them we will say no more and now we are to address himwho believing that there are gods believes also that they take noheed of human affairs to him we thou best of men inbelieving that there are gods you are led by some affinity to attracts you towards your kindred and makes you honour andbelieve in them but the fortunes of evil and unrighteous men inprivate as well as public life which though not really happy arewrongly counted happy in the judgment of men and are celebratedboth by poets and prose draw you aside from your naturalpiety perhaps you have seen impious men growing old and leaving children in high offices and their prosperity shakesyour have known or heard or been yourself an eyewitness ofmany monstrous impieties and have beheld men by such criminalmeans from small beginnings attaining to sovereignty and thepinnacle of greatness and considering all these things you do notlike to accuse the gods of them because they are your so from some want of reasoning power and also from anunwillingness to find fault with them you have come to believe thatthey exist indeed but have no thought or care of human things your present evil opinion may not grow to still greaterimpiety and that we may if possible use arguments which may conjureaway the evil before it arrives we will add another argument tothat originally addressed to him who utterly denied the existence ofthe gods and do you megillus and cleinias answer for the youngman as you did before and if any impediment comes in our way iwill take the word out of your mouths and carry you over the river asi did just now 
 cle very good do as you say and we will help you as well as wecan 
 ath there will probably be no difficulty in proving to him that thegods care about the small as well as about the great for he waspresent and heard what was said that they are perfectly good andthat the care of all things is most entirely natural to them 
 cle no doubt he heard that 
 ath let us consider together in the next place what we mean by thisvirtue which we ascribe to them surely we should say that to betemperate and to possess mind belongs to virtue and the contrary tovice 
 cle certainly 
 ath yes and courage is a part of virtue and cowardice of vice 
 cle true 
 ath and the one is honourable and the other dishonourable 
 cle to be sure 
 ath and the one like other meaner things is a human the gods have no part in anything of the sort 
 cle that again is what everybody will admit 
 ath but do we imagine carelessness and idleness and luxury to bevirtues what do you think 
 cle decidedly not 
 ath they rank under the opposite class 
 cle yes 
 ath and their opposites therefore would fall under the oppositeclass 
 cle yes 
 ath but are we to suppose that one who possesses all these goodqualities will be luxurious and heedless and idle like those whom thepoet compares to stingless drones 
 cle and the comparison is a most just one 
 ath surely god must not be supposed to have a nature which hehimself who dares to say this sort of thing must not betolerated for a moment 
 cle of course not how could he have 
 ath should we not on any principle be entirely mistaken in praisingany one who has some special business entrusted to him if he have amind which takes care of great matters and no care of small he who acts in this way whether he be god or man must actfrom one of two principles 
 cle what are they 
 ath either he must think that the neglect of the small matters isof no consequence to the whole or if he knows that they are ofconsequence and he neglects them his neglect must be attributed tocarelessness and indolence is there any other way in which hisneglect can be explained for surely when it is impossible for him totake care of all he is not negligent if he fails to attend to thesethings great or small which a god or some inferior being might bewanting in strength or capacity to manage 
 cle certainly not 
 ath now then let us examine the offenders who both alike confessthat there are gods but with a one saying that theymay be appeased and the other that they have no care of smallmatters there are three of us and two of them and we will say the first place you both acknowledge that the gods hear andsee and know all things and that nothing can escape them which ismatter of sense and you admit this 
 cle yes 
 ath and do you admit also that they have all power which mortalsand immortals can have 
 cle they will of course admit this also 
 ath and surely we three and they in that they are good and perfect 
 cle assuredly 
 ath but if they are such as we conceive them to be can wepossibly suppose that they ever act in the spirit of carelessnessand indolence for in us inactivity is the child of cowardice andcarelessness of inactivity and indolence 
 cle most true 
 ath then not from inactivity and carelessness is any god evernegligent for there is no cowardice in them 
 cle that is very true 
 ath then the alternative which remains is that if the gods neglectthe lighter and lesser concerns of the universe they neglect thembecause they know that they ought not to care about other alternative is there but the opposite of theirknowing 
 cle there is none 
 ath and o most excellent and best of men do i understand you tomean that they are careless because they are ignorant and do not knowthat they ought to take care or that they know and yet like themeanest sort of men knowing the better choose the worse because theyare overcome by pleasures and pains 
 cle impossible 
 ath do not all human things partake of the nature of soul and isnot man the most religious of all animals 
 cle that is not to be denied 
 ath and we acknowledge that all mortal creatures are the propertyof the gods to whom also the whole of heaven belongs 
 cle certainly 
 ath and therefore whether a person says that these things areto the gods great or either case it would not be naturalfor the gods who own us and who are the most careful and the bestof owners to neglect is also a further consideration 
 cle what is it 
 ath sensation and power are in an inverse ratio to each other inrespect to their case and difficulty 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath i mean that there is greater difficulty in seeing and hearingthe small than the great but more facility in moving andcontrolling and taking care of and unimportant things than of theiropposites 
 cle far more 
 ath suppose the case of a physician who is willing and able to curesome living thing as a will the whole fare at his hands ifhe takes care only of the greater and neglects the parts which arelesser 
 cle decidedly not well 
 ath no better would be the result with pilots or generals orhouseholders or statesmen or any other such class if theyneglected the small and regarded only the the builderssay the larger stones do not lie well without the lesser 
 cle of course not 
 ath let us not then deem god inferior to human workmen who inproportion to their skill finish and perfect their works small aswell as great by one and the same art or that god the wisest ofbeings who is both willing and able to take care is like a or a coward who turns his back upon labour andgives no thought to smaller and easier matters but to the greateronly 
 cle never stranger let us admit a supposition about the godswhich is both impious and false 
 ath i think that we have now argued enough with him who delights toaccuse the gods of neglect 
 cle yes 
 ath he has been forced to acknowledge that he is in error but hestill seems to me to need some words of consolation 
 cle what consolation will you offer him 
 ath let us say to the ruler of the universe hasordered all things with a view to the excellence and preservation ofthe whole and each part as far as may be has an action andpassion appropriate to it over these down to the least fraction ofthem ministers have been appointed to preside who have wrought outtheir perfection with infinitesimal exactness and one of theseportions of the universe is thine own unhappy man which howeverlittle contributes to the whole and you do not seem to be aware thatthis and every other creation is for the sake of the whole and inorder that the life of the whole may be blessed and that you arecreated for the sake of the whole and not the whole for the sake ofyou for every physician and every skilled artist does all thingsfor the sake of the whole directing his effort towards the commongood executing the part for the sake of the whole and not thewhole for the sake of the part and you are annoyed because you areignorant how what is best for you happens to you and to theuniverse as far as the laws of the common creation admit now as thesoul combining first with one body and then with another undergoes allsorts of changes either of herself or through the influence ofanother soul all that remains to the player of the game is that heshould shift the pieces sending the better nature to the betterplace and the worse to the worse and so assigning to them theirproper portion 
 cle in what way do you mean 
 ath in a way which may be supposed to make the care of all thingseasy to the gods if any one were to form or fashion all thingswithout any regard to the for example he formed a livingelement of water out of fire instead of forming many things out ofone or one out of many in regular order attaining to a first or secondor third birth the transmutation would have been infinite but nowthe ruler of the world has a wonderfully easy task 
 cle how so 
 ath i will the king saw that our actions had that there was much virtue in them and much vice and that thesoul and body although not like the gods of popular yet having once come into existence were indestructible forif either of them had been destroyed there would have been nogeneration of living beings and when he observed that the good ofthe soul was ever by nature designed to profit men and the evil toharm seeing all this contrived so to place each of the partsthat their position might in the easiest and best manner procure thevictory of good and the defeat of evil in the whole and hecontrived a general plan by which a thing of a certain nature founda certain seat and room but the formation of qualities he left to thewills of individuals for every one of us is made pretty much whathe is by the bent of his desires and the nature of his soul 
 cle yes that is probably true 
 ath then all things which have a soul change and possess inthemselves a principle of change and in changing move according tolaw and to the order of destiny natures which have undergone a lesserchange move less and on the surface but those which havesuffered more change and have become more criminal sink into theabyss that is to say into hades and other places in the world which the very names terrify men and which they picture tothemselves as in a dream both while alive and when released fromthe body and whenever the soul receives more of good or evil from herown energy and the strong influence of she has communionwith divine virtue and becomes divine she is carried into another andbetter place which is perfect in holiness but when she has communionwith evil then she also changes the place of her life 
 this is the justice of the gods who inhabit youth or young man who fancy that you are neglected by the that if you become worse you shall go to the worse souls or ifbetter to the better and in every succession of life and death youwill do and suffer what like may fitly suffer at the hands of is the justice of heaven which neither you nor any otherunfortunate will ever glory in escaping and which the ordainingpowers have specially ordained take good heed thereof for it will besure to take heed of you if you am small and will creep intothe depths of the earth or i am high and will fly up to heaven youare not so small or so high but that you shall pay the fittingpenalty either here or in the world below or in some still moresavage place whither you shall be conveyed this is also theexplanation of the fate of those whom you saw who had done unholy andevil deeds and from small beginnings had grown great and you fanciedthat from being miserable they had become happy and in their in a mirror you seemed to see the universal neglect of the knowing how they make all things work together and contribute tothe great whole and thinkest thou bold man that thou needest not toknow who knows it not can never form any true idea of thehappiness or unhappiness of life or hold any rational discourserespecting either if cleinias and this our reverend company succeedin bringing to you that you know not what you say of the gods thenwill god help you but should you desire to hear more listen towhat we say to the third opponent if you have any understandingwhatsoever for i think that we have sufficiently proved the existenceof the gods and that they care for other notion that theyare appeased by the wicked and take gifts is what we must notconcede to any one and what every man should disprove to the utmostof his power 
 cle very good let us do as you say 
 ath well then by the gods themselves i conjure you to they are to be propitiated how are they to be are they and what is their nature must they not be at leastrulers who have to order unceasingly the whole heaven 
 cle true 
 ath and to what earthly rulers can they be compared or who tothem how in the less can we find an image of the greater are theycharioteers of contending pairs of steeds or pilots of they might be compared to the generals of armies or theymight be likened to physicians providing against the diseases whichmake war upon the body or to husbandmen observing anxiously theeffects of the seasons on the growth of plants or i perhaps toshepherds of flocks for as we acknowledge the world to be full ofmany goods and also of evils and of more evils than goods thereis as we affirm an immortal conflict going on among us whichrequires marvellous watchfulness and in that conflict the gods anddemigods are our allies and we are their property injustice andinsolence and folly are the destruction of us and justice andtemperance and wisdom are our salvation and the place of these latteris in the life of the gods although some vestige of them mayoccasionally be discerned among mankind but upon this earth we knowthat there dwell souls possessing an unjust spirit who may becompared to brute animals which fawn upon their keepers whether dogsor shepherds or the best and most perfect masters for they in likemanner as the voices of the wicked declare prevail by flattery andprayers and incantations and are allowed to make their gains withimpunity and this sin which is termed dishonesty is an evil ofthe same kind as what is termed disease in living bodies or pestilencein years or seasons of the year and in cities and governments hasanother name which is injustice 
 cle quite true 
 ath what else can he say who declares that the gods are alwayslenient to the doers of unjust acts if they divide the spoil withthem as if wolves were to toss a portion of their prey to the they mollified by the gift suffered them to tear the not he who maintains that the gods can be propitiated argue thus 
 cle precisely so 
 ath and to which of the classes of guardianswould any man compare the gods without absurdity will he say thatthey are like pilots who are themselves turned away from their dutyby libations of wine and the savour of fat and at last overturnboth ship and sailors 
 cle assuredly not 
 ath and surely they are not like charioteers who are bribed to giveup the victory to other chariots 
 cle that would be a fearful image of the gods 
 ath nor are they like generals or physicians or husbandmen orshepherds and no one would compare them to dogs who have silencedby wolves 
 cle a thing not to be spoken of 
 ath and are not all the gods the chiefest of all guardians anddo they not guard our highest interests 
 cle yes the chiefest 
 ath and shall we say that those who guard our noblest are the best of guardians are inferior in virtue to dogs andto men even of moderate excellence who would never betray justice forthe sake of gifts which unjust men impiously offer them 
 cle certainly not nor is such a notion to be endured and he whoholds this opinion may be fairly singled out and characterized as ofall impious men the wickedest and most impious 
 ath then are the three the gods exist and thatthey take care of men and that they can never be persuaded to doinjustice now sufficiently demonstrated may we say that they are 
 cle you have our entire assent to your words 
 ath i have spoken with vehemence because i am zealous againstevil men and i will tell dear cleinias why i am so i would not havethe wicked think that having the superiority in argument they may doas they please and act according to their various imaginations aboutthe gods and this zeal has led me to speak too vehemently but ifwe have at all succeeded in persuading the men to hate themselvesand love their opposites the prelude of our laws about impiety willnot have been spoken in vain 
 cle so let us hope and even if we have failed the style of ourargument will not discredit the lawgiver 
 ath after the prelude shall follow a discourse which will be theinterpreter of the law this shall proclaim to all they must depart from their ways and go over to thepious and to those who disobey let the law about impiety be a man is guilty of any impiety in word or deed any onewho happens to present shall give information to the magistrates inaid of the law and let the magistrates who first receive theinformation bring him before the appointed court according to the if a magistrate after receiving information refuses to act heshall be tried for impiety at the instance of any one who is willingto vindicate the laws and if any one be cast the court shallestimate the punishment of each act of impiety and let all suchcriminals be imprisoned there shall be three prisons in the first of them is to be the common prison in the neighbourhood ofthe agora for the of the generality of offenders anotheris to be in the neighbourhood of the nocturnal council and is to becalled the house of reformation another to be situated in somewild and desolate region in the centre of the country shall be calledby some name expressive of retribution now men fall into impietyfrom three causes which have been already mentioned and from each ofthese causes arise two sorts of impiety in all six which are worthdistinguishing and should not all have the same punishment for hewho does not believe in gods and yet has a righteous nature hatesthe wicked and dislikes and refuses to do injustice and avoidsunrighteous men and loves the righteous but they who besidesbelieving that the world is devoid of gods are intemperate and haveat the same time good memories and quick wits are worse althoughboth of them are unbelievers much less injury is done by the one thanby the other the one may talk loosely about the gods and aboutsacrifices and oaths and perhaps by laughing at other men he may makethem like himself if he be not punished but the other who holdsthe same opinions and is called a clever man is full of stratagem of this class deal in prophecy and jugglery of all out of their ranks sometimes come tyrants and demagogues andgenerals and hierophants of private mysteries and the sophists asthey are termed with their ingenious devices there are many kinds ofunbelievers but two only for whom legislation is required one thehypocritical sort whose crime is deserving of death many timesover while the other needs only bonds and admonition in likemanner also the notion that the gods take no thought of men producestwo other sorts of crimes and the notion that they may be propitiatedproduces two more assuming these divisions let those who have beenmade what they are only from want of understanding and not frommalice or an evil nature be placed by the judge in the house ofreformation and ordered to suffer imprisonment during a period of notless than five years and in the meantime let them have no intercoursewith the other citizens except with members of the nocturnal with them let them converse with a view to the improvement oftheir health and when the time of their imprisonment hasexpired if any of them be of sound mind let him be restored to sanecompany but if not and if he be condemned a second time let himbe punished with death as to that class of monstrous natures whonot only believe that there are no gods or that they are to be propitiated but in contempt of mankind conjure the soulsof the living and say that they can conjure the dead and promise tocharm the gods with sacrifices and prayers and will utterly overthrowindividuals and whole houses and states for the sake of who is guilty of any of these things be condemned by the courtto be bound according to law in the prison which is in the centre ofthe land and let no freeman ever approach him but let him receivethe rations of food appointed by the guardians of the law from thehands of the public slaves and when he is dead let him be cast beyondthe borders unburied and if any freeman assist in burying him lethim pay the penalty of impiety to any one who is willing to bring asuit against him but if he leaves behind him children who are fitto be citizens let the guardians of orphans take care of them justas they would of any other orphans from the day on which their fatheris convicted 
 in all these cases there should be one law which will make men ingeneral less liable to transgress in word or deed and less they will not be allowed to practise religious ritescontrary to law and let this be the simple form of the manshall have sacred rites in a private house when he would him go to the temples and hand over his offerings to the priestsand priestesses who see to the sanctity of such things and let himpray himself and let any one who pleases join with him in prayer thereason of this is as and temples are not easilyinstituted and to establish them rightly is the work of a mightyintellect and women especially and men too when they are sick or indanger or in any sort of difficulty or again on their receivingany good fortune have a way of consecrating the occasion vowingsacrifices and promising shrines to gods demigods and sons of when they are awakened by terrible apparitions and dreams orremember visions they find in altars and temples the remedies ofthem and will fill every house and village with them placing them inthe open air or wherever they may have had such visions and with aview to all these cases we should obey the law the law has alsoregard to the impious and would not have them fancy that by thesecret performance of these raising temples and by buildingaltars in private houses they can propitiate the god secretly withsacrifices and prayers while they are really multiplying their crimesinfinitely bringing guilt from heaven upon themselves and alsoupon those who permit them and who are better men than they the consequence is that the whole state reaps the fruit of theirimpiety which in a certain sense is deserved assuredly god willnot blame the legislator who will enact the following oneshall possess shrines of the gods in private houses and he who isfound to possess them and perform any sacred rites not the offender to be some man or woman who is notguilty of any other great and impious be informedagainst by him who is acquainted with the fact which shall beannounced by him to the guardians of the law and let them issueorders that he or she shall carry away their private rites to thepublic temples and if they do not persuade them let them inflict apenalty on them until they comply and if a person be proven guilty ofimpiety not merely from childish levity but such as men maybe guilty of whether he have sacrificed publicly or privately toany gods let him be punished with death for his sacrifice is the deed has been done in earnest or only from childishlevity let the guardians of the law determine before they bringthe matter into court and prosecute the offender for impiety

 after the practices of adulteration naturally follow the practicesof retail trade concerning these we will first of all give a word ofcounsel and reason and the law shall come afterwards retail trade ina city is not by nature intended to do any harm but quite thecontrary for is not he a benefactor who reduces the inequalitiesand incommensurabilities of goods to equality and common this is what the power of money accomplishes and the merchant maybe said to be appointed for this purpose the hireling and and many other occupations some of them more andothers less have this seek to satisfy ourneeds and equalize our possessions let us then endeavour to seewhat has brought retail trade into and wherein lies thedishonour and unseemliness of it in order that if not entirely wemay yet partially cure the evil by legislation to effect this isno easy matter and requires a great deal of virtue 
 cleinias what do you mean 
 athenian stranger dear cleinias the class of men is have been rarely gifted by nature and trained when assailed by wants and desires are able to holdout and observe moderation and when they might make a great deal ofmoney are sober in their wishes and prefer a moderate to a largegain but the mass of mankind are the very opposite their desires areunbounded and when they might gain in moderation they prefer gainswithout limit wherefore all that relates to retail trade andmerchandise and the keeping of taverns is denounced and numberedamong dishonourable things for if what i trust may never be andwill not be we were to compel if i may venture to say a ridiculousthing the best men everywhere to keep taverns for a time or carry onretail trade or do anything of that sort or if in consequence ofsome fate or necessity the best women were compelled to followsimilar callings then we should know how agreeable and pleasant allthese things are and if all such occupations were managed onincorrupt principles they would be honoured as we honour a motheror a nurse but now that a man goes to desert places and builds bouseswhich can only be reached be long journeys for the sake of retailtrade and receives strangers who are in need at the and gives them peace and calm when they are tossed bythe storm or cool shade in the heat and then instead of behavingto them as friends and showing the duties of hospitality to hisguests treats them as enemies and captives who are at his will not release them until they have paid the most and extortionate are the sort of foul evils they are which cast a reproach upon the succour ofadversity and the legislator ought always to be devising a remedy forevils of this nature there is an ancient saying which is also a fight against two opponents is a difficult thing as isseen in diseases and in many other cases and in this case also thewar is against two and poverty one of whom corruptsthe soul of man with luxury while the other drives him by pain intoutter shamelessness what remedy can a city of sense find against thisdisease in the first place they must have as few retail traders aspossible and in the second place they must assign the occupationto that class of men whose corruption will be the least injury tothe state and in the third place they must devise some way wherebythe followers of these occupations themselves will not readily fallinto habits of unbridled shamelessness and meanness 
 after this preface let our law run as follows and may fortunefavour landowner among the magnetes whose city the god isrestoring and one that is of the become a retail trader either voluntarily or shall he be a merchant or do any service for privatepersons unless they equally serve him except for his father or hismother and their fathers and mothers and in general for his elderswho are freemen and whom he serves as a freeman now it isdifficult to determine accurately the things which are worthy orunworthy of a freeman but let those who have obtained the prize ofvirtue give judgment about them in accordance with their feelings ofright and wrong he who in any way shares in the illiberality ofretail trades may be indicted for dishonouring his race by any one wholikes before those who have been judged to be the first in if he appear to throw dirt upon his house by anunworthy occupation let him be imprisoned for a year and abstain fromthat sort of thing and if he repeat the offence for two years andevery time that he is convicted let the length of his imprisonmentbe doubled this shall be the second who engages in retailtrade must be either a metic or a stranger and a third law order that the retail trader who dwells in our city may be asgood or as little bad as possible the guardians of the law shallremember that they are not only guardians of those who may be easilywatched and prevented from becoming lawless or bad because they arewellborn and bred but still more should they have a watch overthose who are of another sort and follow pursuits which have a verystrong tendency to make men bad and therefore in respect of themultifarious occupations of retail trade that is to say in respectof such of them as are allowed to remain because they seem to bequite necessary in a these the guardians of the law shouldmeet and take counsel with those who have experience of the severalkinds of retail trade as we before commanded concerning is a matter akin to this and when they meet they shallconsider what amount of receipts after deducting expenses willproduce a moderate gain to the retail trades and they shall fix inwriting and strictly maintain what they find to be the rightpercentage of profit this shall be seen to by the wardens of theagora and by the wardens of the city and by the wardens of thecountry and so retail trade will benefit every one and do theleast possible injury to those in the state who practise it 
 when a man makes an agreement which he does not fulfil unless theagreement be of a nature which the law or a vote of the assemblydoes not allow or which he has made under the influence of someunjust compulsion or which he is prevented from fulfilling againsthis will by some unexpected chance the other party may go to law withhim in the courts of the tribes for not having completed hisagreement if the parties are not able previously to come to termsbefore arbiters or before their neighbours the class of craftsmen whohave furnished human life with the arts is dedicated to hephaestus andathene and there is a class of craftsmen who preserve the works ofall craftsmen by arts of defence the votaries of ares and which divinities they too are rightly dedicated all these continuethrough life serving the country and the people some of them areleaders in battle others make for hire implements and works and theyought not to deceive in such matters out of respect to the gods whoare their ancestors if any craftsman through indolence omit toexecute his work in a given time not reverencing the god who giveshim the means of life but considering foolish fellow that he is hisown god and will let him off easily in the first place he shallsuffer at the hands of the god and in the second place the law shallfollow in a similar spirit he shall owe to him who contracted withhim the price of the works which he has failed in performing and heshall begin again and execute them gratis in the given time when aman undertakes a work the law gives him the same advice which wasgiven to the seller that he should not attempt to raise the simply ask the value this the law enjoins also on the the craftsman assuredly knows the value of his work wherefore infree states the man of art ought not to attempt to impose upon privateindividuals by the help of his art which is by nature a true he who is wronged in a matter of this sort shall have a rightof action against the party who has wronged him and if any one letsout work to a craftsman and does not pay him duly according to thelawful agreement disregarding zeus the guardian of the city andathene who are the partners of the state and overthrows thefoundations of society for the sake of a little gain in his caselet the law and the gods maintain the common bonds of the state andlet him who having already received the work in exchange does notpay the price in the time agreed pay double the price and if ayear has elapsed although interest is not to be taken on loans yetfor every drachma which he owes to the contractor let him pay amonthly interest of an obol suits about these matters are to bedecided by the courts of the tribes and by the way since we havementioned craftsmen at all we must not forget the other craft of which generals and tacticians are the craftsmen who undertakevoluntarily the work of our safety as other craftsmen undertake otherpublic they execute their work well the law will nevertire of praising him who gives them those honours which are the justrewards of the soldier but if any one having already received thebenefit of any noble service in war does not make the due return ofhonour the law will blame him let this then be the law having aningredient of praise not compelling but advising the great body ofthe citizens to honour the brave men who are the saviours of the wholestate whether by their courage or by their military honour them i say in the second place for the first andhighest tribute of respect is to be given to those who are ableabove other men to honour the words of good legislators 
 the greater part of the dealings between man and man have been nowregulated by us with the exception of those that relate to orphans andthe supervision of orphans by their guardians these follow next inorder and must be regulated in some way but to arrive at them wemust begin with the testamentary wishes of the dying and the case ofthose who may have happened to die intestate when i said we must regulate them i had in my mind the difficulty andperplexity in which all such matters are involved you cannot leavethem unregulated for individuals would make regulations at variancewith one another and repugnant to the laws and habits of the livingand to their own previous habits if a person were simply allowed tomake any will which he pleased and this were to take effect inwhatever state he may have been at the end of his life for most of uslose our senses in a manner and feel crushed when we think that weare about to die 
 cle what do you mean stranger 
 ath o cleinias a man when he is about to die is an intractablecreature and is apt to use language which causes a great deal ofanxiety and trouble to the legislator 
 cle in what way 
 ath he wants to have the entire control of all his property andwill use angry words 
 cle such as what 
 ath o ye gods he will say how monstrous that i am not allowedto give or not to give my own to whom i to him who has beenbad to me and more to him who has been good to me and whosebadness and goodness have been tested by me in time of sickness orin old age and in every other sort of fortune 
 cle well stranger and may he not very fairly say so 
 ath in my opinion cleinias the ancient legislators were and made laws without sufficient observation orconsideration of human things 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath i mean my friend that they were afraid of the and so they passed a law to the effect that a man shouldbe allowed to dispose of his property in all respects as he liked butyou and i if i am not mistaken will have something better to sayto our departing citizens 
 cle what 
 ath o my friends we will say to them hard is it for you whoare creatures of a day to know what is too as the delphicoracle says to know yourselves at this hour now i as thelegislator regard you and your possessions not as belonging toyourselves but as belonging to your whole family both past andfuture and yet more do regard both family and possessions asbelonging to the state wherefore if some one steals upon you withflattery when you are tossed on the sea of disease or old age andpersuades you to dispose of your property in a way that is not for thebest i will not if i can help allow this but i will legislate witha view to the whole considering what is best both for the state andfor the family esteeming as i ought the feelings of an individualat a lower rate and i hope that you will depart in peace and kindnesstowards us as you are going the way of all mankind and we willimpartially take care of all your concerns not neglecting any ofthem if we can possibly help let this be our prelude and consolationto the living and dying cleinias and let the law be as follows 
 he who makes a disposition in a testament if he be the father ofa family shall first of all inscribe as his heir any one of hissons whom he may think fit and if he gives any of his children tobe adopted by another citizen let the adoption be inscribed and ifhe has a son remaining over and above who has not been adopted uponany lot and who may be expected to be sent out to a colonyaccording to law to him his father may give as much as he pleasesof the rest of his property with the exception of the paternal lotand the fixtures on the lot and if there are other sons let himdistribute among them what there is more than the lot in such portionsas he pleases and if one of the sons has already a house of hisown he shall not give him of the money nor shall he give money toa daughter who has been betrothed but if she is not betrothed hemay give her money and if any of the sons or daughters shall be foundto have another lot of land in the country which has accrued afterthe testament has been made they shall leave the lot which theyhave inherited to the heir of the man who has made the will if thetestator has no sons but only daughters let him choose the husbandof any one of his daughters whom he pleases and leave and inscribehim as his son and heir and if a man have lost his son when he was achild and before he could be reckoned among men whether hisown or an adopted son let the testator make mention of thecircumstance and inscribe whom he will to be his second son in hope ofbetter fortune if the testator has no children at all he mayselect and give to any one whom he pleases the tenth part of theproperty which he has acquired but let him not be blamed if hegives all the rest to his adopted son and makes a friend of himaccording to the law if the sons of a man require guardians and thefather when he dies leaves a will appointing guardians those havebeen named by him whoever they are and whatever their number be ifthey are able and willing to take charge of the children shall berecognized according to the provisions of the will but if he dies andhas made no will or a will in which he has appointed no the next of kin two on the and two on the and one of the friends of the deceased shall have the authorityof guardians whom the guardians of the law shall appoint when theorphans require guardians and the fifteen eldest guardians of the lawshall have the whole care and charge of the orphans divided intothrees according to body of three for one year and thenanother body of three for the next year until the cycle of the fiveperiods is complete and this as far as possible is to continuealways if a man dies having made no will at all and leaves sons whorequire the care of guardians they shall share in the protectionwhich is afforded by these laws 
 and if a man dying by some unexpected fate leaves daughters behindhim let him pardon the legislator if he gives them in marriage hehave a regard only to two out of three of kinand the preservation of the lot and omits the third a father would naturally consider for he would choose out ofall the citizens a son for himself and a husband for his a view to his character and father say shallforgive the legislator if he disregards this which to him is animpossible consideration let the law about these matters wherepracticable be as a man dies without making a will andleaves behind him daughters let his brother being the son of thesame father or of the same mother having no lot marry the daughterand have the lot of the dead man and if he have no brother butonly a son in like manner let them marry if they be of asuitable age and if there be not even a son but only theson of a sister let them do likewise and so in the fourth degree ifthere be only the brother or in the fifth son or in the sixth degree the child of sister let kindred be always reckoned in this way if aperson leaves daughters the relationship shall proceed upwards throughbrothers and sisters and brothers and sisters children and firstthe males shall come and after them the females in the same judge shall consider and determine the suitableness orunsuitableness of age in marriage he shall make an inspection ofthe males naked and of the women naked down to the navel and ifthere be a lack of kinsmen in a family extending to grandchildren of abrother or to the grandchildren of a children themaiden may choose with the consent of her guardians any one of thecitizens who is willing and whom she wills and he shall be the heirof the dead man and the husband of his daughter circumstancesvary and there may sometimes be a still greater lack of relationswithin the limits of the state and if any maiden has no kindredliving in the city and there is some one who has been sent out to acolony and she is disposed to make him the heir of her if he be indeed of her kindred let him proceed to takethe lot according to the regulation of the law but if he be not ofher kindred she having no kinsmen within the city and he be chosenby the daughter of the dead man and empowered to marry by theguardians let him return home and take the lot of him who diedintestate and if a man has no children either male or female anddies without making a will let the previous law in general let a man and a woman go forth from the family and share thedeserted house and let the lot belong absolutely to them and let theheiress in the first degree be a sister and in a second degree adaughter of a brother and in the third a daughter of a sister inthe fourth degree the sister of a father and in the fifth degreethe daughter of a brother and in a sixth degree of sister and these shall dwell with their male to the degree of relationship and right as we enactedbefore now we must not conceal from ourselves that such laws areapt to be oppressive and that there may sometimes be a hardship in thelawgiver commanding the kinsman of the dead man to marry his may be thought not to have considered the innumerable hindranceswhich may arise among men in the execution of such ordinances forthere may be cases in which the parties refuse to obey and areready to do anything rather than marry when there is some bodily ormental malady or defect among those who are bidden to marry or bemarried persons may fancy that the legislator never thought ofthis but they are mistaken wherefore let us make a common prelude onbehalf of the lawgiver and of his subjects the law begging the latterto forgive the legislator in that he having to take care of thecommon weal cannot order at the same time the various circumstancesof individuals and begging him to pardon them if naturally they aresometimes unable to fulfil the act which he in his ignorance imposesupon them 
 cle and how stranger can we act most fairly under thecircumstances 
 ath there must be arbiters chosen to deal with such laws and thesubjects of them 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath i mean to say that a case may occur in which the a rich father will be unwilling to marry the daughter of hisuncle he will have a feeling of pride and he will wish to lookhigher and there are cases in which the legislator will be imposingupon him the greatest calamity and he will be compelled to disobeythe law if he is required for example to take a wife who is mad orhas some other terrible malady of soul or body such as makes lifeintolerable to the sufferer then let what we are saying concerningthese cases be embodied in a any one finds fault with theestablished laws respecting testaments both as to other matters andespecially in what relates to marriage and asserts that thelegislator if he were alive and present would not compel him is to say would not compel those who are by our lawrequired to marry or be given in marriage to do somekinsman or guardian dispute this the reply is that the legislatorleft fifteen of the guardians of the law to be arbiters and fathers oforphans male or female and to them let the disputants have by their aid determine any matters of the kind admitting theirdecision to be final but if any one thinks that too great power isthus given to the guardians of the law let him bring hisadversaries into the court of the select judges and there have thepoints in dispute determined and he who loses the cause shall havecensure and blame from the legislator which by a man of sense isfelt to be a penalty far heavier than a great loss of money 
 thus will orphan children have a second birth after their firstbirth we spoke of their nurture and education and after theirsecond birth when they have lost their parents we ought to takemeasures that the misfortune of orphanhood may be as little sad tothem as possible in the first place we say that the guardians of thelaw are lawgivers and fathers to them not inferior to their naturalfathers moreover they shall take charge of them year by year as oftheir own kindred and we have given both to them and to own guardians a suitable admonition concerning thenurture of orphans and we seem to have spoken opportunely in ourformer discourse when we said that the souls of the dead have thepower after death of taking an interest in human affairs aboutwhich there are many tales and traditions long indeed but seeing that they are so many and so ancient we must believe we must also believe the lawgivers who tell us that thesethings are true if they are not to be regarded as utter fools but ifthese things are really so in the first place men should have afear of the gods above who regard the loneliness of the in the second place of the souls of the departed who by natureincline to take an especial care of their own children and arefriendly to those who honour and unfriendly to those who dishonourthem men should also fear the souls of the living who are aged andhigh in honour wherever a city is well ordered and descendants cherish them and so live happily old persons arequick to see and hear all that relates to them and are propitiousto those who are just in the fulfilment of such duties and theypunish those who wrong the orphan and the desolate considering thatthey are the greatest and most sacred of trusts to all whichmatters the guardian and magistrate ought to apply his mind if he hasany and take heed of the nurture and education of the in every possible way to do them good for he is making acontribution to his own good and that of his children he who obeysthe tale which precedes the law and does no wrong to an never experience the wrath of the legislator but he who isdisobedient and wrongs any one who is bereft of father or pay twice the penalty which he would have paid if he had wrongedone whose parents had been alive as touching other legislationconcerning guardians in their relation to orphans or concerningmagistrates and their superintendence of the guardians if they didnot possess examples of the manner in which children of freemen shouldbe brought up in the bringing up of their own children and of thecare of their property in the care of their own or if they had notjust laws fairly stated about these very would havebeen reason in making laws for them under the idea that they were and we might distinguish and make separate rules forthe life of those who are orphans and of those who are not as the case stands the condition of orphans with us not differentfrom the case of those who have father though in regard to honour anddishonour and the attention given to them the two are not usuallyplaced upon a level wherefore touching the legislation aboutorphans the law speaks in serious accents both of persuasion andthreatening and such a threat as the following will be by no meansout of who is the guardian of an orphan of either sex andhe among the guardians of the law to whom the superintendence ofthis guardian has been assigned shall love the unfortunate orphanas though he were his own child and he shall be as careful anddiligent in the management of his possessions as he would be if theywere his own or even more careful and dilligent let every one whohas the care of an orphan observe this law but any one who actscontrary to the law on these matters if he be a guardian of thechild may be fined by a magistrate or if he be himself amagistrate the guardian may bring him before the court of selectjudges and punish him if convicted by exacting a fine of double theamount of that inflicted by the court and if a guardian appears tothe relations of the orphan or to any other citizen to actnegligently or dishonestly let them bring him before the samecourt and whatever damages are given against him let him payfourfold and let half belong to the orphan and half to him whoprocured the conviction if any orphan arrives at years of thinks that he has been by his guardians let himwithin five years of the expiration of the guardianship be allowedto bring them to trial and if any of them be convicted the courtshall determine what he shall pay or suffer and if magistrate shallappear to have wronged the orphan by neglect and he be convicted letthe court determine what he shall suffer or pay to the orphan andif there be dishonesty in addition to neglect besides paying thefine let him be deposed from his office of guardian of the law andlet the state appoint another guardian of the law for the city and forthe country in his room 
 greater differences than there ought to be sometimes arise betweenfathers and sons on the part either of fathers who will be of opinionthat the legislator should enact that they may if they wish lawfullyrenounce their son by the proclamation of a herald in the face ofthe world or of sons who think that they should be allowed toindict their fathers on the charge of imbecility when they aredisabled by disease or old age these things only happen as amatter of fact where the natures of men are utterly bad for whereonly half is bad as for example if the father be not bad but theson be bad or conversely no great calamity is the result of suchan amount of hatred as this in another state a son disowned by hisfather would not of necessity cease to be a citizen but in our which these are to be the laws the disinherited must necessarilyemigrate into another country for no addition can be made even of asingle family to the households and therefore he whodeserves to suffer these things must be renounced not only by hisfather who is a single person but by the whole family and what isdone in these cases must be regulated by some such law as who in the sad disorder of his soul has a mind justlyor unjustly to expel from his family a son whom he has begotten andbrought up shall not lightly or at once execute his purpose butfirst of all he shall collect together his own kinsmen extending tocousins and in like manner his kinsmen by the in their presence he shall accuse his son setting forth that hedeserves at the hands of them all to be dismissed from the family andthe son shall be allowed to address them in a similar manner and showthat he does not deserve to suffer any of these things and if thefather persuades them and obtains the suffrages of more than halfof his kindred exclusive of the father and mother and the say if he obtains more than half the suffrages of all theother members of the family of both sexes the fathershall be permitted to put away his son but not otherwise and ifany other citizen is willing to adopt the son who is put away nolaw shall hinder him for the characters of young men are subject tomany changes in the course of their lives and if he has been putaway and in a period of ten years no one is willing to adopt him letthose who have the care of the superabundant population which issent out into colonies see to him in order that he may be suitablyprovided for in the colony and if disease or age or harshness oftemper or all these together makes a man to be more out of hismind than the rest of the world this is not observable exceptto those who live with he being master of his property isthe ruin of the house and his son doubts and hesitates aboutindicting his father for insanity let the law in that case or thathe shall first of all go to the eldest guardians of the law and tellthem of his misfortune and they shall duly look into thematter and take counsel as to whether he shall indict him or not andif they advise him to proceed they shall be both his witnesses andhis advocates and if the father is cast he shall henceforth beincapable of ordering the least particular of his life let him beas a child dwelling in the house for the remainder of his days and ifa man and his wife have an unfortunate incompatibility of of the guardians of the law who are impartial and ten of thewomen who regulate marriages shall look to the matter and if theyare able to reconcile them they shall be formally reconciled but iftheir souls are too much tossed with passion they shall endeavourto find other partners now they are not likely to have very gentletempers and therefore we must endeavour to associate with themdeeper and softer natures those who have no children or only afew at the time of their separation should choose their new partnerswith a view to the procreation of children but those who have asufficient number of children should separate and marry again in orderthat they may have some one to grow old with and that the pair maytake care of one another in age if a woman dies leaving or female the law will advise rather than compel the husbandto bring up the children without introducing into the house astepmother but if he have no children then he shall be compelledto marry until he has begotten a sufficient number of sons to hisfamily and to the state and if a man dies leaving a sufficient numberof children the mother of his children shall remain with them andbring them up but if she appears to be too young to livevirtuously without a husband let her relations communicate with thewomen who superintend marriage and let both together do what theythink best in these matters if there is a lack of children let thechoice be made with a view to having them two children one of eithersex shall be deemed sufficient in the eye of the law when a child isadmitted to be the offspring of certain parents and is acknowledged bythem but there is need of a decision as to which parent the childis to case a female slave have intercourse with a maleslave or with a freeman or freedman the offspring shall alwaysbelong to the master of the female slave again if a free womanhave intercourse with a male slave the offspring shall belong tothe master of the slave but if a child be born either of a slave byher master or of his mistress by a this be provenceoffspring of the woman and its father shall be sent away by thewomen who superintend marriage into another country and the guardiansof the law shall send away the offspring of the man and its mother 
 neither god nor a man who has understanding will ever advise anyone to neglect his parents to a discourse concerning the honour anddishonour of parents a prelude such as the following about theservice of the gods will be a suitable areancient customs about the gods which are universal and they are oftwo kinds some of the gods we see with our eyes and we honour others we honour the images raising statues of them which weadore and though they are lifeless yet we imagine that the livinggods have a good will and gratitude to us on this account now if aman has a father or mother or their fathers or mothers treasured upin his house stricken in years let him consider that no statue can bemore potent to grant his requests than they are who are sitting athis hearth if only he knows how to show true service to them

 ath oedipus as tradition says when dishonoured by his on them curses which every one declares to have been heard andratified by the gods and amyntor in his wrath invoked curses on hisson phoenix and theseus upon hippolytus and innumerable othershave also called down wrath upon their children whence it is clearthat the gods listen to the imprecations of parents for the curses ofparents are as they ought to be mighty against their children asno others are and shall we suppose that the prayers of a father ormother who is specially dishonoured by his or her children areheard by the gods in accordance with nature and that if a parent ishonoured by them and in the gladness of his heart earnestlyentreats the gods in his prayers to do them good he is not equallyheard and that they do not minister to his request if not theywould be very unjust ministers of good and that we affirm to becontrary to their nature 
 cle certainly 
 ath may we not think as i was saying just now that we can possessno image which is more honoured by the gods than that of a fatheror grandfather or of a mother stricken in years whom when a manhonours the heart of the god rejoices and he is ready to answertheir prayers and truly the figure of an ancestor is a wonderfulthing far higher than that of a lifeless image for the they are honoured by us join in our prayers and when they aredishonoured they utter imprecations against us but lifelessobjects do neither and therefore if a man makes a right use of hisfather and grandfather and other aged relations he will have imageswhich above all others will win him the favour of the gods

 ath every man of any understanding fears and respects the prayersof parents knowing well that many times and to many persons they havebeen accomplished now these things being thus ordered by nature goodmen think it a blessing from heaven if their parents live to old ageand reach the utmost limit of human life or if taken away beforetheir time they are deeply regretted by them but to bad men parentsare always a cause of terror wherefore let every man honour withevery sort of lawful honour his own parents agreeably to what has nowbeen said but if this prelude be an unmeaning sound in the cars ofany one let the law follow which may be rightly imposed in any one in this city be not sufficiently careful of hisparents and do not regard and gratify in every respect their wishesmore than those of his sons and of his other offspring or him who experiences this sort of treatment either comehimself or send some one to inform the three eldest guardians ofthe law and three of the women who have the care of marriages andlet them look to the matter and punish youthful withstripes and bonds if they are under thirty years of age that is tosay if they be men or if they be women let them undergo the samepunishment up to forty years of age but if when they are stillmore advanced in years they continue the same neglect of theirparents and do any hurt to any of them let them be brought beforea court in which every single one of the eldest citizens shall bethe judges and if the offender be convicted let the courtdetermine what he ought to pay or suffer and any penalty may beimposed on him which a man can pay or suffer if the person who hasbeen wronged be unable to inform the magistrates let any freemanwho hears of his case inform and if he do not he shall be deemedbase and shall be liable to have a suit for damage brought againsthim by any one who likes and if a slave inform he shall receivefreedom and if he be the slave of the injurer or injured party heshall be set free by the magistrates or if he belong to any othercitizen the public shall pay a price on his behalf to the let the magistrates take heed that no one wrongs him out ofrevenge because he has given information 
 cases in which one man injures another by poisons and which provefatal have been already discussed but about other cases in which aperson intentionally and of malice harms another with meats ordrinks or ointments nothing has as yet been determined for thereare two kinds of poisons used among men which cannot clearly bedistinguished there is the kind just now explicitly injures bodies by the use of other bodies according to a naturallaw there is also another kind which persuades the more daringclass that they can do injury by sorceries and incantations andmagic knots as they are termed and makes others believe that theyabove all persons are injured by the powers of the magician now it isnot easy to know the nature of all these things nor if a man doknow can he readily persuade others to believe him and when men aredisturbed in their minds at the sight of waxen images fixed eitherat their doors or in a place where three ways meet or on thesepulchres of parents there is no use in trying to persuade them thatthey should despise all such things because they have no certainknowledge about them but we must have a law in two poisoning in whichever of the two ways the attempt ismade and we must entreat and exhort and advise men not to haverecourse to such practices by which they scare the multitude out oftheir wits as if they were children compelling the legislator andthe judge to heal the fears which the sorcerer arouses and to tellthem in the first place that he who attempts to poison or enchantothers knows not what he is doing either as regards the he has a knowledge of medicine or as regards hisenchantments unless he happens to be a prophet or diviner let thelaw then run as follows about poisoning or whoemploys poison to do any injury not fatal to a man himself or tohis servants or any injury whether fatal or not to his cattle orhis bees if he be a physician and be convicted of poisoning shallbe punished with death or if he be a private person the courtshall determine what he is to pay or suffer but he who seems to bethe sort of man injures others by magic knots or enchantments orincantations or any of the like practices if he be a prophet ordiviner let him die and if not being a prophet he be convictedof witchcraft as in the previous case let the court fix what heought to pay or suffer 
 when a man does another any injury by theft or violence for thegreater injury let him pay greater damages to the injured man andless for the smaller injury but in all cases whatever the injury mayhave been as much as will compensate the loss and besides thecompensation of the wrong let a man pay a further penalty for thechastisement of his offence he who has done the wrong instigated bythe folly of another through the lightheartedness of youth or thelike shall pay a lighter penalty but he who has injured anotherthrough his own folly when overcome by pleasure or pain incowardly fear or lust or envy or implacable anger shall endure aheavier punishment not that he is punished because he did that which is done can never be undone but in order that infuture times he and those who see him corrected may utterly hateinjustice or at any rate abate much of their having aneye to all these things the law like a good archer should aim atthe right measure of punishment and in all cases at the deservedpunishment in the attainment of this the judge shall be with the legislator whenever the law leaves to him todetermine what the offender shall suffer or pay and the a painter shall give a rough sketch of the cases in which thelaw is to be applied this is what we must do megillus andcleinias in the best and fairest manner that we can saying whatthe punishments are to be of all actions of theft and violence andgiving laws of such a kind as the gods and sons of gods would haveus give 
 if a man is mad he shall not be at large in the city but hisrelations shall keep him at home in any way which they can or if them pay a who is of the highest class shall pay apenalty of one hundred drachmae whether he be a slave or a freemanwhom he neglects and he of the second class shall pay a mina and he of the third class and he of thefourth class now there are many sorts of madness somearising out of disease which we have already mentioned and there areother kinds which originate in an evil and passionate are increased by bad education out of a slight quarrel this classof madmen will often raise a storm of abuse against one another andnothing of that sort ought to be allowed to occur in a let this then be the law about abuse which shall relate toall one shall speak evil of another and when a man disputeswith another he shall teach and learn of the disputant and thecompany but he shall abstain from evilspeaking for out of theimprecations which men utter against one another and the femininehabit of casting aspersions on one another and using foul of words light as air in very deed the greatest enmities andhatreds spring up for the speaker gratifies his anger which is anungracious element of his nature and nursing up his wrath by theentertainment of evil thoughts and exacerbating that part of his soulwhich was formerly civilized by education he lives in a state ofsavageness and moroseness and pays a bitter penalty for his in such cases almost all men take to saying something ridiculousabout their opponent and there is no man who is in the habit oflaughing at another who does not miss virtue and earnestnessaltogether or lose the better half of greatness wherefore let no oneutter any taunting word at a temple or at the public sacrifices orat games or in the agora or in a court of justice or in anypublic assembly and let the magistrate who presides on theseoccasions chastise an offender and he shall be blameless but if hefails in doing so he shall not claim the prize of virtue for he isone who heeds not the laws and does not do what the legislatorcommands and if in any other place any one indulges in these sortof revilings whether he has begun the quarrel or is only any elder who is present support the law and control with blowsthose who indulge in passion which is another great evil and if hedo not let him be liable to pay the appointed penalty and we saynow that he who deals in reproaches against others cannot reproachthem without attempting to ridicule them and this when done in amoment of anger is what we make matter of reproach against him butthen do we admit into our state the comic writers who are so fondof making mankind ridiculous if they attempt in a mannerto turn the laugh against our citizens or do we draw thedistinction of jest and earnest and allow a man to make use ofridicule in jest and without anger about any thing or person thoughas we were saying not if he be angry have a set purpose we is unalterably fixed but we have still to say who are tobe sanctioned or not to be sanctioned by the law in the employmentof innocent humour a comic poet or maker of iambic or satiricallyric verse shall not be permitted to ridicule any of the by word or likeness either in anger or without anger and ifany one is disobedient the judges shall either at once expel him fromthe country or he shall pay a fine of three minae which shall bededicated to the god who presides over the contests those only whohave received permission shall be allowed to write verses at oneanother but they shall be without anger and in jest in anger andin serious earnest they shall not be allowed the decision of thismatter shall be left to the superintendent of the general education ofthe young and whatever he may license the writer shall be allowed toproduce and whatever he rejects let not the poet himself ever teach anybody else slave or freeman under the penalty ofbeing dishonoured and held disobedient to the laws 
 now he is not to be pitied who is hungry or who suffers anybodily pain but he who is temperate or has some other virtue orpart of a virtue and at the same time suffers from misfortune itwould be an extraordinary thing if such an one whether slave orfreeman were utterly forsaken and fell into the extremes of povertyin any tolerably city or government wherefore thelegislator may safely make a law applicable to such cases in thefollowing there be no beggars in our state and ifanybody begs seeking to pick up a livelihood by unavailing the wardens of the agora turn him out of the agora and thewardens of the city out of the city and the wardens of the countrysend him out of any other parts of the land across the border inorder that the land may be cleared of this sort of animal 
 if a slave of either sex injure anything which is not his or herown through inexperience or some improper practice and the personwho suffers damage be not himself in part to blame the master ofthe slave who has done the harm shall either make full give up the the slave who has done has done the injury but ifmaster argue that the charge has arisen by collusion between theinjured party and the injurer with the view of obtaining the him sue the person who says that he has been injured formalpractices and if he gain a conviction let him receive doublethe value which the court fixes as the price of the slave and if helose his suit let him make amends for the injury and give up theslave and if a beast of burden or horse or dog or any otheranimal injure the property of a neighbour the owner shall in likemanner pay for the injury 
 if any man refuses to be a witness he who wants him shall summonhim and he who is summoned shall come to the trial and if he knowsand is willing to bear witness let him bear witness but if he sayshe does not know let him swear by the three divinities zeus andapollo and themis that he does not and have no more to do withthe cause and he who is summoned to give witness and does notanswer to his summoner shall be liable for the harm which ensuesaccording to law and if a person calls up as a witness any one who isacting as a judge let him give his witness but he shall notafterwards vote in the cause a free woman may give her witness andplead if she be more than forty years of age and may bring an actionif she have no husband but if her husband be alive she shall onlybe allowed to bear witness a slave of either sex and a child shall beallowed to give evidence and to plead but only in cases of they must produce sufficient sureties that they will certainlyremain until the trial in case they should be charged with falsewitness and either of the parties in a cause may bring anaccusation of perjury against witnesses touching their evidence inwhole or in part if he asserts that such evidence has been given butthe accusation must be brought previous to the final decision of thecause the magistrates shall preserve the accusations of falsewitness and have them kept under the seal of both parties andproduce them on the day when the trial for false witness takesplace if a man be twice convicted of false witness he shall not berequired and if thrice he shall not be allowed to bear if he dare to witness after he has been convicted three times letany one who pleases inform against him to the magistrates and let themagistrates hand him over to the court and if he be convicted heshall be punished with death and in any case in which the evidence isrightly found to be false and yet to have given the victory to himwho wins the suit and more than half the witnesses are condemned thedecision which was gained by these means shall be a discussion and adecision as to whether the suit was determined by that falseevidence or and in whichever way the decision may be given theprevious suit shall be determined accordingly 
 there are many noble things in human life but to most of themattach evils which are fated to corrupt and spoil them is not justicenoble which has been the civilizer of humanity how then can theadvocate of justice be other than noble and yet upon thisprofession which is presented to us under the fair name of art hascome an evil reputation in the first place we are told that byingenious pleas and the help of an advocate the law enables a man towin a particular cause whether just or unjust and the power ofspeech which is thereby imparted are at the service of him sho iswilling to pay for them now in our state this really an art or only an experience and practice destituteof any art ought if possible never to come into existence or ifexisting among us should litten to the request of the legislator andgo away into another land and not speak contrary to justice if theoffenders obey we say no more but those who disobey the voice of thelaw is as anyone thinks that he will pervert the powerof justice in the minds of the judges and unseasonably litigate oradvocate let any one who likes indict him for malpractices of law anddishonest advocacy and let him be judged in the court of selectjudges and if he be convicted let the court determine whether he maybe supposed to act from a love of money or from contentiousness andif he is supposed to act from contentiousness the court shall fix atime during which he shall not be allowed to institute or plead acause and if he is supposed to act as be does from love of case he be a stranger he shall leave the country and never returnunder penalty of death but if he be a citizen he shall he is a lover of money in whatever manner gained andequally if he be judged to have acted more than once fromcontentiousness he shall die

 if man exchanges either money for money or anything whatever foranything else either with or without life let him give and receivethem genuine and unadulterated in accordance with the law and let ushave a prelude about all this sort of roguery like the preludes ofour other laws every man should regard adulteration as of one and thesame class with falsehood and deceit concerning which the many aretoo fond of saying that at proper times and places the practice mayoften be right but they leave the occasion and the when and thewhere undefined and unsettled and from this want of definitenessin their language they do a great deal of harm to themselves and toothers now a legislator ought not to leave the matter ought to prescribe some limit either greater or less let thisbe the rule one shall call the gods to witness when hesays or does anything false or deceitful or dishonest unless he wouldbe the most hateful of mankind to them and he is most hateful to themtakes a false oath and pays no heed to the gods and in the nextdegree he who tells a falsehood in the presence of his superiors nowbetter men are the superiors of worse men and in general elders arethe superiors of the young wherefore also parents are the superiorsof their off spring and men of women and children and rulers oftheir subjects for all men ought to reverence any one who is in anyposition of authority and especially those who are in stateoffices and this is the reason why i have spoken of these every one who is guilty of adulteration in the agora tells afalsehood and deceives and when he invokes the gods according tothe customs and cautions of the wardens of the agora he does butswear without any respect for god or man certainly it is anexcellent rule not lightly to defile the names of the gods afterthe fashion of men in general who care little about piety andpurity in their religious actions but if a man will not conform tothis rule let the law be as who sells anything in theagora shall not ask two prices for that which he sells but he shallask one price and if he do not obtain this he shall take away hisgoods and on that day he shall not value them either at more or there shall be no praising of any goods or oath taken about a person disobeys this command any citizen who is present notbeing less than thirty years of age may with impunity chastise andbeat the swearer but if instead of obeying the laws he takes no shall be liable to the charge of having betrayed them if a mansells any adulterated goods and will not obey these regulations hewho knows and can prove the fact and does prove it in the presence ofthe magistrates if he be a slave or a metic shall have theadulterated goods but if he be a citizen and do not pursue thecharge he shall be called a rogue and deemed to have robbed the godsof the agora or if he proves the charge he shall dedicate thegoods to the gods of the agora he who is proved to have sold anyadulterated goods in addition to losing the goods themselves shallbe beaten with stripe for a drachma according to theprice of the goods and the herald shall proclaim in the agora theoffence for which he is going to be beaten the warden of the agoraand the guardians of the law shall obtain information from experiencedpersons about the rogueries and adulterations of the sellers andshall write up what the seller ought and ought not to do in each let them inscribe their laws on a column in front of the courtof the wardens of the agora that they may be clear instructors ofthose who have business in the agora enough has been said in what haspreceded about the wardens of the city and if anything seems to bewanting let them communicate with the guardians of the law and writedown the omission and place on a column in the court of the wardensof the city the primary and secondary regulations which are laiddown for them about their office 
 after the practices of adulteration naturally follow the practicesof retail trade concerning these we will first of all give a word ofcounsel and reason and the law shall come afterwards retail trade ina city is not by nature intended to do any harm but quite thecontrary for is not he a benefactor who reduces the inequalitiesand incommensurabilities of goods to equality and common this is what the power of money accomplishes and the merchant maybe said to be appointed for this purpose the hireling and and many other occupations some of them more andothers less have this seek to satisfy ourneeds and equalize our possessions let us then endeavour to seewhat has brought retail trade into and wherein lies thedishonour and unseemliness of it in order that if not entirely wemay yet partially cure the evil by legislation to effect this isno easy matter and requires a great deal of virtue 
 cleinias what do you mean 
 athenian stranger dear cleinias the class of men is have been rarely gifted by nature and trained when assailed by wants and desires are able to holdout and observe moderation and when they might make a great deal ofmoney are sober in their wishes and prefer a moderate to a largegain but the mass of mankind are the very opposite their desires areunbounded and when they might gain in moderation they prefer gainswithout limit wherefore all that relates to retail trade andmerchandise and the keeping of taverns is denounced and numberedamong dishonourable things for if what i trust may never be andwill not be we were to compel if i may venture to say a ridiculousthing the best men everywhere to keep taverns for a time or carry onretail trade or do anything of that sort or if in consequence ofsome fate or necessity the best women were compelled to followsimilar callings then we should know how agreeable and pleasant allthese things are and if all such occupations were managed onincorrupt principles they would be honoured as we honour a motheror a nurse but now that a man goes to desert places and builds bouseswhich can only be reached be long journeys for the sake of retailtrade and receives strangers who are in need at the and gives them peace and calm when they are tossed bythe storm or cool shade in the heat and then instead of behavingto them as friends and showing the duties of hospitality to hisguests treats them as enemies and captives who are at his will not release them until they have paid the most and extortionate are the sort of foul evils they are which cast a reproach upon the succour ofadversity and the legislator ought always to be devising a remedy forevils of this nature there is an ancient saying which is also a fight against two opponents is a difficult thing as isseen in diseases and in many other cases and in this case also thewar is against two and poverty one of whom corruptsthe soul of man with luxury while the other drives him by pain intoutter shamelessness what remedy can a city of sense find against thisdisease in the first place they must have as few retail traders aspossible and in the second place they must assign the occupationto that class of men whose corruption will be the least injury tothe state and in the third place they must devise some way wherebythe followers of these occupations themselves will not readily fallinto habits of unbridled shamelessness and meanness 
 after this preface let our law run as follows and may fortunefavour landowner among the magnetes whose city the god isrestoring and one that is of the become a retail trader either voluntarily or shall he be a merchant or do any service for privatepersons unless they equally serve him except for his father or hismother and their fathers and mothers and in general for his elderswho are freemen and whom he serves as a freeman now it isdifficult to determine accurately the things which are worthy orunworthy of a freeman but let those who have obtained the prize ofvirtue give judgment about them in accordance with their feelings ofright and wrong he who in any way shares in the illiberality ofretail trades may be indicted for dishonouring his race by any one wholikes before those who have been judged to be the first in if he appear to throw dirt upon his house by anunworthy occupation let him be imprisoned for a year and abstain fromthat sort of thing and if he repeat the offence for two years andevery time that he is convicted let the length of his imprisonmentbe doubled this shall be the second who engages in retailtrade must be either a metic or a stranger and a third law order that the retail trader who dwells in our city may be asgood or as little bad as possible the guardians of the law shallremember that they are not only guardians of those who may be easilywatched and prevented from becoming lawless or bad because they arewellborn and bred but still more should they have a watch overthose who are of another sort and follow pursuits which have a verystrong tendency to make men bad and therefore in respect of themultifarious occupations of retail trade that is to say in respectof such of them as are allowed to remain because they seem to bequite necessary in a these the guardians of the law shouldmeet and take counsel with those who have experience of the severalkinds of retail trade as we before commanded concerning is a matter akin to this and when they meet they shallconsider what amount of receipts after deducting expenses willproduce a moderate gain to the retail trades and they shall fix inwriting and strictly maintain what they find to be the rightpercentage of profit this shall be seen to by the wardens of theagora and by the wardens of the city and by the wardens of thecountry and so retail trade will benefit every one and do theleast possible injury to those in the state who practise it 
 when a man makes an agreement which he does not fulfil unless theagreement be of a nature which the law or a vote of the assemblydoes not allow or which he has made under the influence of someunjust compulsion or which he is prevented from fulfilling againsthis will by some unexpected chance the other party may go to law withhim in the courts of the tribes for not having completed hisagreement if the parties are not able previously to come to termsbefore arbiters or before their neighbours the class of craftsmen whohave furnished human life with the arts is dedicated to hephaestus andathene and there is a class of craftsmen who preserve the works ofall craftsmen by arts of defence the votaries of ares and which divinities they too are rightly dedicated all these continuethrough life serving the country and the people some of them areleaders in battle others make for hire implements and works and theyought not to deceive in such matters out of respect to the gods whoare their ancestors if any craftsman through indolence omit toexecute his work in a given time not reverencing the god who giveshim the means of life but considering foolish fellow that he is hisown god and will let him off easily in the first place he shallsuffer at the hands of the god and in the second place the law shallfollow in a similar spirit he shall owe to him who contracted withhim the price of the works which he has failed in performing and heshall begin again and execute them gratis in the given time when aman undertakes a work the law gives him the same advice which wasgiven to the seller that he should not attempt to raise the simply ask the value this the law enjoins also on the the craftsman assuredly knows the value of his work wherefore infree states the man of art ought not to attempt to impose upon privateindividuals by the help of his art which is by nature a true he who is wronged in a matter of this sort shall have a rightof action against the party who has wronged him and if any one letsout work to a craftsman and does not pay him duly according to thelawful agreement disregarding zeus the guardian of the city andathene who are the partners of the state and overthrows thefoundations of society for the sake of a little gain in his caselet the law and the gods maintain the common bonds of the state andlet him who having already received the work in exchange does notpay the price in the time agreed pay double the price and if ayear has elapsed although interest is not to be taken on loans yetfor every drachma which he owes to the contractor let him pay amonthly interest of an obol suits about these matters are to bedecided by the courts of the tribes and by the way since we havementioned craftsmen at all we must not forget the other craft of which generals and tacticians are the craftsmen who undertakevoluntarily the work of our safety as other craftsmen undertake otherpublic they execute their work well the law will nevertire of praising him who gives them those honours which are the justrewards of the soldier but if any one having already received thebenefit of any noble service in war does not make the due return ofhonour the law will blame him let this then be the law having aningredient of praise not compelling but advising the great body ofthe citizens to honour the brave men who are the saviours of the wholestate whether by their courage or by their military honour them i say in the second place for the first andhighest tribute of respect is to be given to those who are ableabove other men to honour the words of good legislators 
 the greater part of the dealings between man and man have been nowregulated by us with the exception of those that relate to orphans andthe supervision of orphans by their guardians these follow next inorder and must be regulated in some way but to arrive at them wemust begin with the testamentary wishes of the dying and the case ofthose who may have happened to die intestate when i said we must regulate them i had in my mind the difficulty andperplexity in which all such matters are involved you cannot leavethem unregulated for individuals would make regulations at variancewith one another and repugnant to the laws and habits of the livingand to their own previous habits if a person were simply allowed tomake any will which he pleased and this were to take effect inwhatever state he may have been at the end of his life for most of uslose our senses in a manner and feel crushed when we think that weare about to die 
 cle what do you mean stranger 
 ath o cleinias a man when he is about to die is an intractablecreature and is apt to use language which causes a great deal ofanxiety and trouble to the legislator 
 cle in what way 
 ath he wants to have the entire control of all his property andwill use angry words 
 cle such as what 
 ath o ye gods he will say how monstrous that i am not allowedto give or not to give my own to whom i to him who has beenbad to me and more to him who has been good to me and whosebadness and goodness have been tested by me in time of sickness orin old age and in every other sort of fortune 
 cle well stranger and may he not very fairly say so 
 ath in my opinion cleinias the ancient legislators were and made laws without sufficient observation orconsideration of human things 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath i mean my friend that they were afraid of the and so they passed a law to the effect that a man shouldbe allowed to dispose of his property in all respects as he liked butyou and i if i am not mistaken will have something better to sayto our departing citizens 
 cle what 
 ath o my friends we will say to them hard is it for you whoare creatures of a day to know what is too as the delphicoracle says to know yourselves at this hour now i as thelegislator regard you and your possessions not as belonging toyourselves but as belonging to your whole family both past andfuture and yet more do regard both family and possessions asbelonging to the state wherefore if some one steals upon you withflattery when you are tossed on the sea of disease or old age andpersuades you to dispose of your property in a way that is not for thebest i will not if i can help allow this but i will legislate witha view to the whole considering what is best both for the state andfor the family esteeming as i ought the feelings of an individualat a lower rate and i hope that you will depart in peace and kindnesstowards us as you are going the way of all mankind and we willimpartially take care of all your concerns not neglecting any ofthem if we can possibly help let this be our prelude and consolationto the living and dying cleinias and let the law be as follows 
 he who makes a disposition in a testament if he be the father ofa family shall first of all inscribe as his heir any one of hissons whom he may think fit and if he gives any of his children tobe adopted by another citizen let the adoption be inscribed and ifhe has a son remaining over and above who has not been adopted uponany lot and who may be expected to be sent out to a colonyaccording to law to him his father may give as much as he pleasesof the rest of his property with the exception of the paternal lotand the fixtures on the lot and if there are other sons let himdistribute among them what there is more than the lot in such portionsas he pleases and if one of the sons has already a house of hisown he shall not give him of the money nor shall he give money toa daughter who has been betrothed but if she is not betrothed hemay give her money and if any of the sons or daughters shall be foundto have another lot of land in the country which has accrued afterthe testament has been made they shall leave the lot which theyhave inherited to the heir of the man who has made the will if thetestator has no sons but only daughters let him choose the husbandof any one of his daughters whom he pleases and leave and inscribehim as his son and heir and if a man have lost his son when he was achild and before he could be reckoned among men whether hisown or an adopted son let the testator make mention of thecircumstance and inscribe whom he will to be his second son in hope ofbetter fortune if the testator has no children at all he mayselect and give to any one whom he pleases the tenth part of theproperty which he has acquired but let him not be blamed if hegives all the rest to his adopted son and makes a friend of himaccording to the law if the sons of a man require guardians and thefather when he dies leaves a will appointing guardians those havebeen named by him whoever they are and whatever their number be ifthey are able and willing to take charge of the children shall berecognized according to the provisions of the will but if he dies andhas made no will or a will in which he has appointed no the next of kin two on the and two on the and one of the friends of the deceased shall have the authorityof guardians whom the guardians of the law shall appoint when theorphans require guardians and the fifteen eldest guardians of the lawshall have the whole care and charge of the orphans divided intothrees according to body of three for one year and thenanother body of three for the next year until the cycle of the fiveperiods is complete and this as far as possible is to continuealways if a man dies having made no will at all and leaves sons whorequire the care of guardians they shall share in the protectionwhich is afforded by these laws 
 and if a man dying by some unexpected fate leaves daughters behindhim let him pardon the legislator if he gives them in marriage hehave a regard only to two out of three of kinand the preservation of the lot and omits the third a father would naturally consider for he would choose out ofall the citizens a son for himself and a husband for his a view to his character and father say shallforgive the legislator if he disregards this which to him is animpossible consideration let the law about these matters wherepracticable be as a man dies without making a will andleaves behind him daughters let his brother being the son of thesame father or of the same mother having no lot marry the daughterand have the lot of the dead man and if he have no brother butonly a son in like manner let them marry if they be of asuitable age and if there be not even a son but only theson of a sister let them do likewise and so in the fourth degree ifthere be only the brother or in the fifth son or in the sixth degree the child of sister let kindred be always reckoned in this way if aperson leaves daughters the relationship shall proceed upwards throughbrothers and sisters and brothers and sisters children and firstthe males shall come and after them the females in the same judge shall consider and determine the suitableness orunsuitableness of age in marriage he shall make an inspection ofthe males naked and of the women naked down to the navel and ifthere be a lack of kinsmen in a family extending to grandchildren of abrother or to the grandchildren of a children themaiden may choose with the consent of her guardians any one of thecitizens who is willing and whom she wills and he shall be the heirof the dead man and the husband of his daughter circumstancesvary and there may sometimes be a still greater lack of relationswithin the limits of the state and if any maiden has no kindredliving in the city and there is some one who has been sent out to acolony and she is disposed to make him the heir of her if he be indeed of her kindred let him proceed to takethe lot according to the regulation of the law but if he be not ofher kindred she having no kinsmen within the city and he be chosenby the daughter of the dead man and empowered to marry by theguardians let him return home and take the lot of him who diedintestate and if a man has no children either male or female anddies without making a will let the previous law in general let a man and a woman go forth from the family and share thedeserted house and let the lot belong absolutely to them and let theheiress in the first degree be a sister and in a second degree adaughter of a brother and in the third a daughter of a sister inthe fourth degree the sister of a father and in the fifth degreethe daughter of a brother and in a sixth degree of sister and these shall dwell with their male to the degree of relationship and right as we enactedbefore now we must not conceal from ourselves that such laws areapt to be oppressive and that there may sometimes be a hardship in thelawgiver commanding the kinsman of the dead man to marry his may be thought not to have considered the innumerable hindranceswhich may arise among men in the execution of such ordinances forthere may be cases in which the parties refuse to obey and areready to do anything rather than marry when there is some bodily ormental malady or defect among those who are bidden to marry or bemarried persons may fancy that the legislator never thought ofthis but they are mistaken wherefore let us make a common prelude onbehalf of the lawgiver and of his subjects the law begging the latterto forgive the legislator in that he having to take care of thecommon weal cannot order at the same time the various circumstancesof individuals and begging him to pardon them if naturally they aresometimes unable to fulfil the act which he in his ignorance imposesupon them 
 cle and how stranger can we act most fairly under thecircumstances 
 ath there must be arbiters chosen to deal with such laws and thesubjects of them 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath i mean to say that a case may occur in which the a rich father will be unwilling to marry the daughter of hisuncle he will have a feeling of pride and he will wish to lookhigher and there are cases in which the legislator will be imposingupon him the greatest calamity and he will be compelled to disobeythe law if he is required for example to take a wife who is mad orhas some other terrible malady of soul or body such as makes lifeintolerable to the sufferer then let what we are saying concerningthese cases be embodied in a any one finds fault with theestablished laws respecting testaments both as to other matters andespecially in what relates to marriage and asserts that thelegislator if he were alive and present would not compel him is to say would not compel those who are by our lawrequired to marry or be given in marriage to do somekinsman or guardian dispute this the reply is that the legislatorleft fifteen of the guardians of the law to be arbiters and fathers oforphans male or female and to them let the disputants have by their aid determine any matters of the kind admitting theirdecision to be final but if any one thinks that too great power isthus given to the guardians of the law let him bring hisadversaries into the court of the select judges and there have thepoints in dispute determined and he who loses the cause shall havecensure and blame from the legislator which by a man of sense isfelt to be a penalty far heavier than a great loss of money 
 thus will orphan children have a second birth after their firstbirth we spoke of their nurture and education and after theirsecond birth when they have lost their parents we ought to takemeasures that the misfortune of orphanhood may be as little sad tothem as possible in the first place we say that the guardians of thelaw are lawgivers and fathers to them not inferior to their naturalfathers moreover they shall take charge of them year by year as oftheir own kindred and we have given both to them and to own guardians a suitable admonition concerning thenurture of orphans and we seem to have spoken opportunely in ourformer discourse when we said that the souls of the dead have thepower after death of taking an interest in human affairs aboutwhich there are many tales and traditions long indeed but seeing that they are so many and so ancient we must believe we must also believe the lawgivers who tell us that thesethings are true if they are not to be regarded as utter fools but ifthese things are really so in the first place men should have afear of the gods above who regard the loneliness of the in the second place of the souls of the departed who by natureincline to take an especial care of their own children and arefriendly to those who honour and unfriendly to those who dishonourthem men should also fear the souls of the living who are aged andhigh in honour wherever a city is well ordered and descendants cherish them and so live happily old persons arequick to see and hear all that relates to them and are propitiousto those who are just in the fulfilment of such duties and theypunish those who wrong the orphan and the desolate considering thatthey are the greatest and most sacred of trusts to all whichmatters the guardian and magistrate ought to apply his mind if he hasany and take heed of the nurture and education of the in every possible way to do them good for he is making acontribution to his own good and that of his children he who obeysthe tale which precedes the law and does no wrong to an never experience the wrath of the legislator but he who isdisobedient and wrongs any one who is bereft of father or pay twice the penalty which he would have paid if he had wrongedone whose parents had been alive as touching other legislationconcerning guardians in their relation to orphans or concerningmagistrates and their superintendence of the guardians if they didnot possess examples of the manner in which children of freemen shouldbe brought up in the bringing up of their own children and of thecare of their property in the care of their own or if they had notjust laws fairly stated about these very would havebeen reason in making laws for them under the idea that they were and we might distinguish and make separate rules forthe life of those who are orphans and of those who are not as the case stands the condition of orphans with us not differentfrom the case of those who have father though in regard to honour anddishonour and the attention given to them the two are not usuallyplaced upon a level wherefore touching the legislation aboutorphans the law speaks in serious accents both of persuasion andthreatening and such a threat as the following will be by no meansout of who is the guardian of an orphan of either sex andhe among the guardians of the law to whom the superintendence ofthis guardian has been assigned shall love the unfortunate orphanas though he were his own child and he shall be as careful anddiligent in the management of his possessions as he would be if theywere his own or even more careful and dilligent let every one whohas the care of an orphan observe this law but any one who actscontrary to the law on these matters if he be a guardian of thechild may be fined by a magistrate or if he be himself amagistrate the guardian may bring him before the court of selectjudges and punish him if convicted by exacting a fine of double theamount of that inflicted by the court and if a guardian appears tothe relations of the orphan or to any other citizen to actnegligently or dishonestly let them bring him before the samecourt and whatever damages are given against him let him payfourfold and let half belong to the orphan and half to him whoprocured the conviction if any orphan arrives at years of thinks that he has been by his guardians let himwithin five years of the expiration of the guardianship be allowedto bring them to trial and if any of them be convicted the courtshall determine what he shall pay or suffer and if magistrate shallappear to have wronged the orphan by neglect and he be convicted letthe court determine what he shall suffer or pay to the orphan andif there be dishonesty in addition to neglect besides paying thefine let him be deposed from his office of guardian of the law andlet the state appoint another guardian of the law for the city and forthe country in his room 
 greater differences than there ought to be sometimes arise betweenfathers and sons on the part either of fathers who will be of opinionthat the legislator should enact that they may if they wish lawfullyrenounce their son by the proclamation of a herald in the face ofthe world or of sons who think that they should be allowed toindict their fathers on the charge of imbecility when they aredisabled by disease or old age these things only happen as amatter of fact where the natures of men are utterly bad for whereonly half is bad as for example if the father be not bad but theson be bad or conversely no great calamity is the result of suchan amount of hatred as this in another state a son disowned by hisfather would not of necessity cease to be a citizen but in our which these are to be the laws the disinherited must necessarilyemigrate into another country for no addition can be made even of asingle family to the households and therefore he whodeserves to suffer these things must be renounced not only by hisfather who is a single person but by the whole family and what isdone in these cases must be regulated by some such law as who in the sad disorder of his soul has a mind justlyor unjustly to expel from his family a son whom he has begotten andbrought up shall not lightly or at once execute his purpose butfirst of all he shall collect together his own kinsmen extending tocousins and in like manner his kinsmen by the in their presence he shall accuse his son setting forth that hedeserves at the hands of them all to be dismissed from the family andthe son shall be allowed to address them in a similar manner and showthat he does not deserve to suffer any of these things and if thefather persuades them and obtains the suffrages of more than halfof his kindred exclusive of the father and mother and the say if he obtains more than half the suffrages of all theother members of the family of both sexes the fathershall be permitted to put away his son but not otherwise and ifany other citizen is willing to adopt the son who is put away nolaw shall hinder him for the characters of young men are subject tomany changes in the course of their lives and if he has been putaway and in a period of ten years no one is willing to adopt him letthose who have the care of the superabundant population which issent out into colonies see to him in order that he may be suitablyprovided for in the colony and if disease or age or harshness oftemper or all these together makes a man to be more out of hismind than the rest of the world this is not observable exceptto those who live with he being master of his property isthe ruin of the house and his son doubts and hesitates aboutindicting his father for insanity let the law in that case or thathe shall first of all go to the eldest guardians of the law and tellthem of his misfortune and they shall duly look into thematter and take counsel as to whether he shall indict him or not andif they advise him to proceed they shall be both his witnesses andhis advocates and if the father is cast he shall henceforth beincapable of ordering the least particular of his life let him beas a child dwelling in the house for the remainder of his days and ifa man and his wife have an unfortunate incompatibility of of the guardians of the law who are impartial and ten of thewomen who regulate marriages shall look to the matter and if theyare able to reconcile them they shall be formally reconciled but iftheir souls are too much tossed with passion they shall endeavourto find other partners now they are not likely to have very gentletempers and therefore we must endeavour to associate with themdeeper and softer natures those who have no children or only afew at the time of their separation should choose their new partnerswith a view to the procreation of children but those who have asufficient number of children should separate and marry again in orderthat they may have some one to grow old with and that the pair maytake care of one another in age if a woman dies leaving or female the law will advise rather than compel the husbandto bring up the children without introducing into the house astepmother but if he have no children then he shall be compelledto marry until he has begotten a sufficient number of sons to hisfamily and to the state and if a man dies leaving a sufficient numberof children the mother of his children shall remain with them andbring them up but if she appears to be too young to livevirtuously without a husband let her relations communicate with thewomen who superintend marriage and let both together do what theythink best in these matters if there is a lack of children let thechoice be made with a view to having them two children one of eithersex shall be deemed sufficient in the eye of the law when a child isadmitted to be the offspring of certain parents and is acknowledged bythem but there is need of a decision as to which parent the childis to case a female slave have intercourse with a maleslave or with a freeman or freedman the offspring shall alwaysbelong to the master of the female slave again if a free womanhave intercourse with a male slave the offspring shall belong tothe master of the slave but if a child be born either of a slave byher master or of his mistress by a this be provenceoffspring of the woman and its father shall be sent away by thewomen who superintend marriage into another country and the guardiansof the law shall send away the offspring of the man and its mother 
 neither god nor a man who has understanding will ever advise anyone to neglect his parents to a discourse concerning the honour anddishonour of parents a prelude such as the following about theservice of the gods will be a suitable areancient customs about the gods which are universal and they are oftwo kinds some of the gods we see with our eyes and we honour others we honour the images raising statues of them which weadore and though they are lifeless yet we imagine that the livinggods have a good will and gratitude to us on this account now if aman has a father or mother or their fathers or mothers treasured upin his house stricken in years let him consider that no statue can bemore potent to grant his requests than they are who are sitting athis hearth if only he knows how to show true service to them 
 cle and what do you call the true mode of service 
 ath i will tell you o my friend for such things are worthlistening to 
 cle proceed 
 ath oedipus as tradition says when dishonoured by his on them curses which every one declares to have been heard andratified by the gods and amyntor in his wrath invoked curses on hisson phoenix and theseus upon hippolytus and innumerable othershave also called down wrath upon their children whence it is clearthat the gods listen to the imprecations of parents for the curses ofparents are as they ought to be mighty against their children asno others are and shall we suppose that the prayers of a father ormother who is specially dishonoured by his or her children areheard by the gods in accordance with nature and that if a parent ishonoured by them and in the gladness of his heart earnestlyentreats the gods in his prayers to do them good he is not equallyheard and that they do not minister to his request if not theywould be very unjust ministers of good and that we affirm to becontrary to their nature 
 cle certainly 
 ath may we not think as i was saying just now that we can possessno image which is more honoured by the gods than that of a fatheror grandfather or of a mother stricken in years whom when a manhonours the heart of the god rejoices and he is ready to answertheir prayers and truly the figure of an ancestor is a wonderfulthing far higher than that of a lifeless image for the they are honoured by us join in our prayers and when they aredishonoured they utter imprecations against us but lifelessobjects do neither and therefore if a man makes a right use of hisfather and grandfather and other aged relations he will have imageswhich above all others will win him the favour of the gods 
 cle excellent 
 ath every man of any understanding fears and respects the prayersof parents knowing well that many times and to many persons they havebeen accomplished now these things being thus ordered by nature goodmen think it a blessing from heaven if their parents live to old ageand reach the utmost limit of human life or if taken away beforetheir time they are deeply regretted by them but to bad men parentsare always a cause of terror wherefore let every man honour withevery sort of lawful honour his own parents agreeably to what has nowbeen said but if this prelude be an unmeaning sound in the cars ofany one let the law follow which may be rightly imposed in any one in this city be not sufficiently careful of hisparents and do not regard and gratify in every respect their wishesmore than those of his sons and of his other offspring or him who experiences this sort of treatment either comehimself or send some one to inform the three eldest guardians ofthe law and three of the women who have the care of marriages andlet them look to the matter and punish youthful withstripes and bonds if they are under thirty years of age that is tosay if they be men or if they be women let them undergo the samepunishment up to forty years of age but if when they are stillmore advanced in years they continue the same neglect of theirparents and do any hurt to any of them let them be brought beforea court in which every single one of the eldest citizens shall bethe judges and if the offender be convicted let the courtdetermine what he ought to pay or suffer and any penalty may beimposed on him which a man can pay or suffer if the person who hasbeen wronged be unable to inform the magistrates let any freemanwho hears of his case inform and if he do not he shall be deemedbase and shall be liable to have a suit for damage brought againsthim by any one who likes and if a slave inform he shall receivefreedom and if he be the slave of the injurer or injured party heshall be set free by the magistrates or if he belong to any othercitizen the public shall pay a price on his behalf to the let the magistrates take heed that no one wrongs him out ofrevenge because he has given information 
 cases in which one man injures another by poisons and which provefatal have been already discussed but about other cases in which aperson intentionally and of malice harms another with meats ordrinks or ointments nothing has as yet been determined for thereare two kinds of poisons used among men which cannot clearly bedistinguished there is the kind just now explicitly injures bodies by the use of other bodies according to a naturallaw there is also another kind which persuades the more daringclass that they can do injury by sorceries and incantations andmagic knots as they are termed and makes others believe that theyabove all persons are injured by the powers of the magician now it isnot easy to know the nature of all these things nor if a man doknow can he readily persuade others to believe him and when men aredisturbed in their minds at the sight of waxen images fixed eitherat their doors or in a place where three ways meet or on thesepulchres of parents there is no use in trying to persuade them thatthey should despise all such things because they have no certainknowledge about them but we must have a law in two poisoning in whichever of the two ways the attempt ismade and we must entreat and exhort and advise men not to haverecourse to such practices by which they scare the multitude out oftheir wits as if they were children compelling the legislator andthe judge to heal the fears which the sorcerer arouses and to tellthem in the first place that he who attempts to poison or enchantothers knows not what he is doing either as regards the he has a knowledge of medicine or as regards hisenchantments unless he happens to be a prophet or diviner let thelaw then run as follows about poisoning or whoemploys poison to do any injury not fatal to a man himself or tohis servants or any injury whether fatal or not to his cattle orhis bees if he be a physician and be convicted of poisoning shallbe punished with death or if he be a private person the courtshall determine what he is to pay or suffer but he who seems to bethe sort of man injures others by magic knots or enchantments orincantations or any of the like practices if he be a prophet ordiviner let him die and if not being a prophet he be convictedof witchcraft as in the previous case let the court fix what heought to pay or suffer 
 when a man does another any injury by theft or violence for thegreater injury let him pay greater damages to the injured man andless for the smaller injury but in all cases whatever the injury mayhave been as much as will compensate the loss and besides thecompensation of the wrong let a man pay a further penalty for thechastisement of his offence he who has done the wrong instigated bythe folly of another through the lightheartedness of youth or thelike shall pay a lighter penalty but he who has injured anotherthrough his own folly when overcome by pleasure or pain incowardly fear or lust or envy or implacable anger shall endure aheavier punishment not that he is punished because he did that which is done can never be undone but in order that infuture times he and those who see him corrected may utterly hateinjustice or at any rate abate much of their having aneye to all these things the law like a good archer should aim atthe right measure of punishment and in all cases at the deservedpunishment in the attainment of this the judge shall be with the legislator whenever the law leaves to him todetermine what the offender shall suffer or pay and the a painter shall give a rough sketch of the cases in which thelaw is to be applied this is what we must do megillus andcleinias in the best and fairest manner that we can saying whatthe punishments are to be of all actions of theft and violence andgiving laws of such a kind as the gods and sons of gods would haveus give 
 if a man is mad he shall not be at large in the city but hisrelations shall keep him at home in any way which they can or if them pay a who is of the highest class shall pay apenalty of one hundred drachmae whether he be a slave or a freemanwhom he neglects and he of the second class shall pay a mina and he of the third class and he of thefourth class now there are many sorts of madness somearising out of disease which we have already mentioned and there areother kinds which originate in an evil and passionate are increased by bad education out of a slight quarrel this classof madmen will often raise a storm of abuse against one another andnothing of that sort ought to be allowed to occur in a let this then be the law about abuse which shall relate toall one shall speak evil of another and when a man disputeswith another he shall teach and learn of the disputant and thecompany but he shall abstain from evilspeaking for out of theimprecations which men utter against one another and the femininehabit of casting aspersions on one another and using foul of words light as air in very deed the greatest enmities andhatreds spring up for the speaker gratifies his anger which is anungracious element of his nature and nursing up his wrath by theentertainment of evil thoughts and exacerbating that part of his soulwhich was formerly civilized by education he lives in a state ofsavageness and moroseness and pays a bitter penalty for his in such cases almost all men take to saying something ridiculousabout their opponent and there is no man who is in the habit oflaughing at another who does not miss virtue and earnestnessaltogether or lose the better half of greatness wherefore let no oneutter any taunting word at a temple or at the public sacrifices orat games or in the agora or in a court of justice or in anypublic assembly and let the magistrate who presides on theseoccasions chastise an offender and he shall be blameless but if hefails in doing so he shall not claim the prize of virtue for he isone who heeds not the laws and does not do what the legislatorcommands and if in any other place any one indulges in these sortof revilings whether he has begun the quarrel or is only any elder who is present support the law and control with blowsthose who indulge in passion which is another great evil and if hedo not let him be liable to pay the appointed penalty and we saynow that he who deals in reproaches against others cannot reproachthem without attempting to ridicule them and this when done in amoment of anger is what we make matter of reproach against him butthen do we admit into our state the comic writers who are so fondof making mankind ridiculous if they attempt in a mannerto turn the laugh against our citizens or do we draw thedistinction of jest and earnest and allow a man to make use ofridicule in jest and without anger about any thing or person thoughas we were saying not if he be angry have a set purpose we is unalterably fixed but we have still to say who are tobe sanctioned or not to be sanctioned by the law in the employmentof innocent humour a comic poet or maker of iambic or satiricallyric verse shall not be permitted to ridicule any of the by word or likeness either in anger or without anger and ifany one is disobedient the judges shall either at once expel him fromthe country or he shall pay a fine of three minae which shall bededicated to the god who presides over the contests those only whohave received permission shall be allowed to write verses at oneanother but they shall be without anger and in jest in anger andin serious earnest they shall not be allowed the decision of thismatter shall be left to the superintendent of the general education ofthe young and whatever he may license the writer shall be allowed toproduce and whatever he rejects let not the poet himself ever teach anybody else slave or freeman under the penalty ofbeing dishonoured and held disobedient to the laws 
 now he is not to be pitied who is hungry or who suffers anybodily pain but he who is temperate or has some other virtue orpart of a virtue and at the same time suffers from misfortune itwould be an extraordinary thing if such an one whether slave orfreeman were utterly forsaken and fell into the extremes of povertyin any tolerably city or government wherefore thelegislator may safely make a law applicable to such cases in thefollowing there be no beggars in our state and ifanybody begs seeking to pick up a livelihood by unavailing the wardens of the agora turn him out of the agora and thewardens of the city out of the city and the wardens of the countrysend him out of any other parts of the land across the border inorder that the land may be cleared of this sort of animal 
 if a slave of either sex injure anything which is not his or herown through inexperience or some improper practice and the personwho suffers damage be not himself in part to blame the master ofthe slave who has done the harm shall either make full give up the the slave who has done has done the injury but ifmaster argue that the charge has arisen by collusion between theinjured party and the injurer with the view of obtaining the him sue the person who says that he has been injured formalpractices and if he gain a conviction let him receive doublethe value which the court fixes as the price of the slave and if helose his suit let him make amends for the injury and give up theslave and if a beast of burden or horse or dog or any otheranimal injure the property of a neighbour the owner shall in likemanner pay for the injury 
 if any man refuses to be a witness he who wants him shall summonhim and he who is summoned shall come to the trial and if he knowsand is willing to bear witness let him bear witness but if he sayshe does not know let him swear by the three divinities zeus andapollo and themis that he does not and have no more to do withthe cause and he who is summoned to give witness and does notanswer to his summoner shall be liable for the harm which ensuesaccording to law and if a person calls up as a witness any one who isacting as a judge let him give his witness but he shall notafterwards vote in the cause a free woman may give her witness andplead if she be more than forty years of age and may bring an actionif she have no husband but if her husband be alive she shall onlybe allowed to bear witness a slave of either sex and a child shall beallowed to give evidence and to plead but only in cases of they must produce sufficient sureties that they will certainlyremain until the trial in case they should be charged with falsewitness and either of the parties in a cause may bring anaccusation of perjury against witnesses touching their evidence inwhole or in part if he asserts that such evidence has been given butthe accusation must be brought previous to the final decision of thecause the magistrates shall preserve the accusations of falsewitness and have them kept under the seal of both parties andproduce them on the day when the trial for false witness takesplace if a man be twice convicted of false witness he shall not berequired and if thrice he shall not be allowed to bear if he dare to witness after he has been convicted three times letany one who pleases inform against him to the magistrates and let themagistrates hand him over to the court and if he be convicted heshall be punished with death and in any case in which the evidence isrightly found to be false and yet to have given the victory to himwho wins the suit and more than half the witnesses are condemned thedecision which was gained by these means shall be a discussion and adecision as to whether the suit was determined by that falseevidence or and in whichever way the decision may be given theprevious suit shall be determined accordingly 
 there are many noble things in human life but to most of themattach evils which are fated to corrupt and spoil them is not justicenoble which has been the civilizer of humanity how then can theadvocate of justice be other than noble and yet upon thisprofession which is presented to us under the fair name of art hascome an evil reputation in the first place we are told that byingenious pleas and the help of an advocate the law enables a man towin a particular cause whether just or unjust and the power ofspeech which is thereby imparted are at the service of him sho iswilling to pay for them now in our state this really an art or only an experience and practice destituteof any art ought if possible never to come into existence or ifexisting among us should litten to the request of the legislator andgo away into another land and not speak contrary to justice if theoffenders obey we say no more but those who disobey the voice of thelaw is as anyone thinks that he will pervert the powerof justice in the minds of the judges and unseasonably litigate oradvocate let any one who likes indict him for malpractices of law anddishonest advocacy and let him be judged in the court of selectjudges and if he be convicted let the court determine whether he maybe supposed to act from a love of money or from contentiousness andif he is supposed to act from contentiousness the court shall fix atime during which he shall not be allowed to institute or plead acause and if he is supposed to act as be does from love of case he be a stranger he shall leave the country and never returnunder penalty of death but if he be a citizen he shall he is a lover of money in whatever manner gained andequally if he be judged to have acted more than once fromcontentiousness he shall die

 theft is a mean and robbery a shameless thing and none of the sonsof zeus delight in fraud and violence or ever practised let no one be deluded by poets or mythologers into amistaken belief of such such things nor let him suppose when hethieves or is guilty of violence that he is doing nothing base butonly what the gods themselves do for such tales are untrue andimprobable and he who steals or robs contrary to the law is nevereither a god or the son of a god of this the legislator ought to bebetter informed than all the poets put together happy is he andmay he be forever happy who is persuaded and listens to our he who disobeys shall have to contend against the a man steal anything belonging to the public whether thatwhich he steals be much or little he shall have the samepunishment for he who steals a little steals with the same wish as hewho steals much but with less power and he who takes up a greateramount not having deposited it is wholly unjust wherefore the lawis not disposed to inflict a less penalty on the one than on the otherbecause his theft is less but on the ground that the thief maypossibly be in one case still curable and may in another case beincurable if any one convict in a court of law a stranger or aslave of a theft of public property let the court determine whatpunishment he shall suffer or what penalty he shall pay bearing inmind that he is probably not incurable but the citizen who has beenbrought up as our citizens will have been if he be found guilty ofrobbing his country by fraud or violence whether he be caught inthe act or not shall be punished with death for he is incurable 
 now for expeditions of war much consideration and many laws arerequired the great principle of all is that no one of either sexshould be without a commander nor should the mind of any one beaccustomed to do anything either in jest or earnest of his ownmotion but in war and in peace he should look to and follow hisleader even in the least things being under his guidance forexample he should stand or move or exercise or wash or take hismeals or get up in the night to keep guard and deliver messageswhen he is bidden and in the hour of danger he should not pursueand not retreat except by order of his superior and in a word notteach the soul or accustom her to know or understand how to doanything apart from others of all soldiers the life should bealways and in all things as far as possible in common and neither is nor ever will be a higher or better or morescientific principle than this for the attainment of salvation andvictory in war and we ought in time of peace from youth upwards topractise this habit of commanding others and of being commanded byothers anarchy should have no place in the life of man or of thebeasts who are subject to man i may add that all dances ought to beperformed with view to military excellence and agility and easeshould be cultivated for the same object and also endurance of thewant of meats and drinks and of winter cold and summer heat and ofhard couches and above all care should be taken not to destroythe peculiar qualities of the head and the feet by surrounding themwith extraneous coverings and so hindering their natural growth ofhair and soles for these are the extremities and of all the parts ofthe body whether they are preserved or not is of the greatestconsequence the one is the servant of the whole body and the otherthe master in whom all the ruling senses are by nature set let theyoung man imagine that he hears in what has preceded the praises ofthe military life the law shall be as shall serve inwar who is on the roll or appointed to some special service and ifany one is absent from cowardice and without the leave of thegenerals he shall be indicted before the military commanders forfailure of service when the army comes home and the soldiers shall behis judges the heavy armed and the cavalry and the other arms ofthe service shall form separate courts and they shall bring before the and the horsemen before thehorsemen and the others in like manner before their peers and he whois found guilty shall never be allowed to compete for any prize ofvalour or indict another for not serving on an expedition or be anaccuser at all in any military matters moreover the court shallfurther determine what punishment he shall suffer or what penaltyhe shall pay when the suits for failure of service are completed theleaders of the several kinds of troops shall again hold an they shall adjudge the prizes of valour and he who likes shallgive judgment in his own branch of the service saying nothing aboutany former expedition nor producing any proof or witnesses to confirmhis statement but speaking only of the present occasion the crown ofvictory shall be an olive wreath which the victor shall offer up thetemple of any whom he likes adding an inscription for atestimony to last during life that such an one has received thefirst the second or prize if any one goes on an expedition andreturns home before the appointed time when the generals have notwithdrawn the army be shall be indicted for desertion before the samepersons who took cognisance of failure of service and if he befound guilty the same punishment shall be inflicted on him 
 now every man who is engaged in any suit ought to be very careful ofbringing false witness against any one either intentionally orunintentionally if he can help for justice is truly said to be anhonourable maiden and falsehood is naturally repugnant to honourand justice a witness ought to be very careful not to sift againstjustice as for example in what relates to the throwing away must distinguish the throwing them away when necessary andnot make that a reproach or bring in action against some innocentperson on that account to make the distinction maybe difficult butstill the law must attempt to define the different kinds in someway let me endeavour to explain my meaning by an ancient had been brought to the tent still alive but without hisarms and this has happened to innumerable persons the originalarms which the poet says were presented to peleus by the gods as anuptial gift when he married thetis remaining in the hands ofhector then the base spirits of that day might have reproached theson of menoetius with having cast away his arms again there is thecase of those who have been thrown down precipices and lost theirarms and of those who at sea and in stormy places have beensuddenly overwhelmed by floods of water and there are numberlessthings of this kind which one might adduce by way of with the view of justifying a misfortune which is easilymisrepresented we must therefore endeavour to divide to the best ofour power the greater and more serious evil from the lesser and adistinction may be drawn in the use of terms of reproach a man doesnot always deserve to be called the thrower away of his shield he maybe only the loser of his arms for there is a great or rather absolutedifference between him who is deprived of his arms by a sufficientforce and him who voluntarily lets his shield go let the law then beas a person having arms is overtaken by the enemy and doesnot turn round and defend himself but lets them go voluntarily orthrows them away choosing a base life and a swift escape ratherthan a courageous and noble and blessed such a case of thethrowing away of arms let justice be done but the judge need takeno note of the case just now mentioned for the bad man ought alwaysto be punished in the hope that he may be improved but not theunfortunate for there is no advantage in that and what shall bethe punishment suited to him who has thrown away his weapons ofdefence tradition says that caeneus the thessalian was changed by agod from a woman into a man but the converse miracle cannot now bewrought or no punishment would be more proper than that the man whothrows away his shield should be changed into a woman this however isimpossible and therefore let us make a law as nearly like this aswe he who loves his life too well shall be in no danger forthe remainder of his days but shall live for ever under the stigma ofcowardice and let the law be in the following a man isfound guilty of disgracefully throwing away his arms in war nogeneral or military officer shall allow him to serve as a give him any place at all in the ranks of soldiers and the officerwho gives the coward any place shall suffer a penalty which thepublic examiner shall exact of him and if he be of the highestdass he shall pay a thousand drachmae or if he be of the secondclass five minae or if he be of the third three minae or if hebe of the fourth class one mina and he who is found guilty ofcowardice shall not only be dismissed from manly dangers which isa disgrace appropriate to his nature but he shall pay a thousanddrachmae if he be of the highest class and five minae if he be ofthe second class and three if he be of the third class and a the preceding if he be of the fourth class 
 what regulations will be proper about examiners seeing that some ofour magistrates are elected by lot and for a year and some for alonger time and from selected persons of such magistrates who willbe a sufficient censor or examiner if any of them weighed down bythe pressure of office or his own inability to support the dignityof his office be guilty of any crooked practice it is by no meanseasy to find a magistrate who excels other magistrates in still we must endeavour to discover some censor or examiner who ismore than man for the truth is that there are many elements ofdissolution in a state as there are also in a ship or in ananimal they all have their cords and girders and diffused in many places and called by many names and theoffice of examiner is a most important element in the preservation anddissolution of states for if the examiners are better than themagistrates and their duty is fulfilled justly and without the whole state and country flourishes and is happy but if theexamination of the magistrates is carried on in a wrong way the relaxation of that justice which is the uniting principle ofall constitutions every power in the state is rent asunder from everyother they no longer incline in the same direction but fill the citywith faction and make many cities out of one and soon bring all todestruction wherefore the examiners ought to be admirable in everysort of virtue let us invent a mode of creating them which shallbe as year after the summer solstice the whole cityshall meet in the common precincts of helios and apollo and shallpresent to the god three men out of their own number in the citizen shall select not himself but some othercitizen whom he deems in every way the best and who is not lessthan fifty years of age and out of the selected persons who havethe greatest number of votes they shall make a further selectionuntil they reduce them to if they are an even number but ifthey are not an even number they shall subtract the one who has thesmallest number of votes and make them an even number and then leavethe half which have the great number of votes and if two persons havean equal number of votes and thus increase the number they shall withdraw the younger of the two and do awaywith the excess and then including all the rest they shall againvote until there are left three having an unequal number of if all the three or two out of the three have equal votes letthem commit the election to good fate and fortune and separate off bylot the first and the second and the third these they shall crownwith an olive wreath and give them the prize of excellence at thesame time proclaiming to all the world that the city of themagnetes by providence of the gods is again preserved andpresents to the sun and to apollo her three best men to be a common offering to them according to theancient law as long as their lives answer to the judgment formed ofthem and these shall appoint in their first year twelve examiners tocontinue until each has completed years to whom threeshall afterwards be added yearly and let these divide all themagistracies into twelve parts and prove the holders of them by everysort of test to which a freeman may be subjected and let them livewhile they hold office in the precinct of helios and apollo inwhich they were chosen and let each one form a judgment of somethings individually and of others in company with his colleagues andlet him place a writing in the agora about each magistracy and whatthe magistrate ought to suffer or pay according to the decision ofthe examiners and if a magistrate does not admit that he has beenjustly judged let him bring the examiners before the select if he be acquitted by their decision let him if he the examiners themselves if however he be convicted andhave been condemned to death by the examiners let him die and ofcourse he can only die any other penalties which admit ofbeing doubled let him suffer twice over 
 and now let us pass under review the examiners themselves what willtheir examination be and how conducted during the life of these the whole state counts worthy of the rewards of virtue theyshall have the first seat at all public assemblies and at allhellenic sacrifices and sacred missions and other public and holyceremonies in which they share the chiefs of each sacred missionshall be selected from them and they only of all the citizens shallbe adorned with a crown of laurel they shall all be priests of apolloand helios and one of them who is judged first of the priestscreated in that year shall be high priest and they shall write uphis name in each year to be a measure of time as long as the citylasts and after their death they shall be laid out and carried to thegrave and entombed in a manner different from the other citizens theyshall be decked in a robe all of white and there shall be no cryingor lamentation over them but a chorus of fifteen maidens and anotherof boys shall stand around the bier on either side hymning thepraises of the departed priests in alternate responses declaringtheir blessedness in song all day long and at dawn a hundred of theyouths who practise gymnastic and whom the relations of the departedshall choose shall carry the bier to the sepulchre the young menmarching first dressed in the garb of cavalry with theirhorses the with their arms and the others in likemanner and boys neat the bier and in front of it shall sing theirnational hymn and maidens shall follow behind and with them thewomen who have passed the age of childbearing next although they areinterdicted from other burials let priests and priestesses the pythian oracle forbid them for this burial is free frompollution the place of burial shall be an oblong vaulted chamberunderground constructed of tufa which will last for ever havingstone couches placed side by side and here they will lay theblessed person and cover the sepulchre with a circular mound of earthand plant a grove of trees around on every side but one and on thatside the sepulchre shall be allowed to extend for ever and a newmound will not be required every year they shall have contests inmusic and gymnastics and in horsemanship in honour of the are the honours which shall be given to those who at theexamination are found blameless but if any of them trusting to thescrutiny being over should after the judgment has been the wickedness of human nature let the law ordain that hewho pleases shall indict him and let the cause be tried in thefollowing manner in the first place the court shall be composed ofthe guardians of the law and to them the surviving examiners shall beadded as well as the court of select judges and let the pursuerlay his indictment in this shall say that isunworthy of the prize of virtue and of his office and if thedefendant be convicted let him be deprived of his office and of theburial and of the other honours given him but if the prosecutor donot obtain the fifth part of the votes let him if he be of the firstdass pay twelve minae and eight if he be of the second class andsix if he be of the third dass and two minae if he be of the fourthclass 
 the decision of rhadamanthus is worthy of alladmiration he knew that the men of his own time believed and had nodoubt that there were gods which was a reasonable belief in thosedays because most men were the sons of gods and according totradition he was one himself he appears to have thought that he oughtto commit judgment to no man but to the gods only and in this waysuits were simply and speedily decided by him for he made the twoparties take an oath respecting the points in dispute and so gotrid of the matter speedily and safely but now that a certainportion of mankind do not believe at all in the existence of the others imagine that they have no care of us and the opinion ofmost men and of the men is that in return for small sacrifice anda few flattering words they will be their accomplices in purloininglarge sums and save them from many terrible punishments the way ofrhadamanthus is no longer suited to the needs of justice for as theneeds of men about the gods are changed the laws should also the granting of suits a rational legislation ought to doaway with the oaths of the parties on either who obtains leaveto bring an action should write down the charges but should notadd an oath and the defendant in like manner should give his denialto the magistrates in writing and not swear for it is a dreadfulthing to know when many lawsuits are going on in a state thatalmost half the people who meet one another quite unconcernedly at thepublic meals and in other companies and relations of private lifeare perjured let the law then be as judge who is aboutto give judgment shall take an oath and he who is choosingmagistrates for the state shall either vote on oath or with a votingtablet which he brings from a temple so too the judge of dances andof all music and the superintendents and umpires of gymnastic andequestrian contests and any matters in which as far as men canjudge there is nothing to be gained by a false oath but all cases inwhich a denial confirmed by an oath clearly results in a greatadvantage to the taker of the oath shall be decided without theoath of the parties to the suit and the presiding judges shall notpermit either of them to use an oath for the sake of to call down curses on himself and his race nor to use unseemlysupplications or womanish laments but they shall ever be teaching andlearning what is just in auspicious words and he who does otherwiseshall be supposed to speak beside the point and the judges shallagain bring him back to the question at issue on the other in their dealings with strangers shall as at present havepower to give and receive oaths for they will not often grow old inthe city or leave a fry of young ones like themselves to be the sonsand heirs of the land 
 as to the initiation of private suits let the manner of decidingcauses between all citizens be the same as in cases in which anyfreeman is disobedient to the state in minor matters of which thepenalty is not stripes imprisonment or death but as regardsattendance at choruses or processions or other shows and as regardspublic services whether the celebration of sacrifice in peace or thepayment of contributions in all these cases first comes thenecessity of providing remedy for the loss and by those who willnot obey there shall be security given to the officers whom thecity and the law empower to exact the sum due and if they forfeittheir security let the goods which they have pledged be and themoney given to the city but if they ought to pay a larger sum theseveral magistrates shall impose upon the disobedient a suitablepenalty and bring them before the court until they are willing to dowhat they are ordered 
 now a state which makes money from the cultivation of the soil has no foreign trade must consider what it will do about theemigration of its own people to other countries and the receptionof strangers from elsewhere about these matters the legislator has toconsider and he will begin by trying to persuade men as far as hecan the intercourse of cities with one another is apt to create aconfusion of manners strangers are always suggesting novelties tostrangers when states are well governed by good laws the mixturecauses the greatest possible injury but seeing that most cities arethe reverse of the confusion which arises in them fromthe reception of strangers and from the citizens themselves rushingoff into other cities when any one either young or old desires totravel anywhere abroad at whatever time is of no consequence onthe other hand the refusal of states to receive others and for theirown citizens never to go to other places is an utter to the rest of the world is likely to appear ruthless anduncivilized it is a practise adopted by people who use harsh as xenelasia or banishment of strangers and who have harsh andmorose ways as men think and to be thought or not to be thought wellof by the rest of the world is no light matter for the many are notso far wrong in their judgment of who are bad and who are good asthey are removed from the nature of virtue in themselves even bad menhave a divine instinct which guesses rightly and very many who areutterly depraved form correct notions and judgments of the differencesbetween the good and bad and the generality of cities are quite rightin exhorting us to value a good reputation in the world for thereis no truth greater and more important than he who is reallygood i am speaking of the man who would be perfect seeks forreputation with but not without the reality of goodness and ourcretan colony ought also to acquire the fairest and noblest reputationfor virtue from other men and there is every reason to expect the reality answers to the idea she will before of the cities which the sun and the other gods in the matter of journeys to other countries and thereception of strangers we enact as the first place letno one be allowed to go anywhere at all into a foreign country whois less than forty years of age and no one shall go in a privatecapacity but only in some public one as a herald or on anembassy or on a sacred mission going abroad on an expedition or inwar not to be included among travels of the class authorized by thestate to apollo at delphi and to zeus at olympia and to nemea andto the should be sent to take part in the sacrificesand games there dedicated to the gods and they should send as many aspossible and the best and fairest that can be found and they willmake the city renowned at holy meetings in time of peace procuringa glory which shall be the converse of that which is gained in when they come home they shall teach the young that theinstitutions of other states are inferior to their own and they shallsend spectators of another sort if they have the consent of theguardians being such citizens as desire to look a little more atleisure at the doings of other men and these no law shall hinder fora city which has no experience of good and bad men or intercourse withthem can never be thoroughly and perfectly civilized nor the citizens of a city properly observe the laws by habit without an intelligent understanding of them and there always arein the world a few inspired men whose acquaintance is beyond who spring up quite as much in as in these are they whom the citizens of a well ordered city shouldbe ever seeking out going forth over sea and over land to find himwho is he may establish more firmly institutions inhis own state which are good already and amend what is deficient forwithout this examination and enquiry a city will never continueperfect any more than if the examination is 
 cleinias how can we have an examination and also a good one 
 athenian stranger in this way in the first place our spectatorshall be of not less than fifty years of age he must be a man ofreputation especially in war if he is to exhibit to other cities amodel of the guardians of the law but when he is more than sixtyyears of age he shall no longer continue in his office of when he has carried on his inspection during as many out of theten years of his office as he pleases on his return home let him goto the assembly of those who review the laws this shall be a mixedbody of young and old men who shall be required to meet daily betweenthe hour of dawn and the rising of the sun they shall consist in thefirst place of the priests who have obtained the rewards of in the second place of guardians of the law the ten eldest beingchosen the general superintendent of education shall also bemember as well the last appointed as those who have been releasedfrom the office and each of them shall take with him as his companionyoung man whomsoever he chooses between the ages of thirty andforty these shall be always holding conversation and discourseabout the laws of their own city or about any specially good oneswhich they may hear to be existing elsewhere also about kinds ofknowledge which may appear to be of use and will throw light uponthe examination or of which the want will make the subject of lawsdark and uncertain to them any knowledge of this sort which theelders approve the younger men shall learn with all diligence and ifany one of those who have been invited appear to be unworthy thewhole assembly shall blame him who invited him the rest of the cityshall watch over those among the young men who distinguish an eye upon them and especially honouring them if theysucceed but dishonouring them above the rest if they turn out to beinferior this is the assembly to which he who has visited theinstitutions of other men on his return home shall straightway if he have discovered any one who has anything to say about theenactment of laws or education or nurture or if he have himselfmade any observations let him communicate his discoveries to thewhole assembly and if he be seen to have come home neither better norworse let him be praised at any rate for his enthusiasm and if he bemuch better let him be praised so much the more and not only whilehe lives but after his death let the assembly honour him withfitting honours but if on his return home he appear to have beencorrupted pretending to be wise when he is not let him hold nocommunication with any one whether young or old and if he willhearken to the rulers then he shall be permitted to live as a privateindividual but if he will not let him die if he be convicted in acourt of law of interfering about education and the laws and if hedeserve to be indicted and none of the magistrates indict him letthat be counted as a disgrace to them when the rewards of virtue aredecided 
 let such be the character of the person who goes abroad and let himgo abroad under these conditions in the next place the strangerwho comes from abroad should be received in a friendly spirit nowthere are four kinds of strangers of whom we must make first is he who comes and stays throughout the class are like birds of passage taking wing in pursuit ofcommerce and flying over the sea to other cities while the seasonlasts he shall be received in and harbours and publicbuildings near the city but outside by those magistrates who areappointed to superintend these matters and they shall take carethat a stranger whoever he be duly receives justice but he shallnot be allowed to make any innovation they shall hold the intercoursewith him which is necessary and this shall be as little aspossible the second kind is just a spectator who comes to see withhis eyes and hear with his ears the festivals of the muses such oughtto have entertainment provided them at the temples by hospitablepersons and the priests and ministers of the temples should see andattend to them but they should not remain more than a reasonabletime let them see and hear that for the sake of which they then go away neither having suffered nor done any harm thepriests shall be their judges if any of them receive or do anywrong up to the sum of fifty drachmae but if any greater charge bebrought in such cases the suit shall come before the wardens of theagora the third kind of stranger is he who comes on some publicbusiness from another land and is to be received with public is to be received only by the generals and commanders of horseand foot and the host by whom he is entertained in conjunctionwith the prytanes shall have the sole charge of what concerns is a fourth dass of persons answering to our spectators whocome from another land to look at ours in the first place suchvisits will be rare and the visitor should be at least fifty years ofage he may possibly be wanting to see something that is rich and rarein other states or himself to show something in like manner toanother city let such an one then go unbidden to the doors of thewise and rich being one of them himself let him go for the house of the superintendent of education confident that heis a fitting guest of such a host or let him go to the house ofsome of those who have gained the prize of virtue and hold discoursewith them both learning from them and also teaching them and whenhe has seen and heard all he shall depart as a friend taking leaveof friends and be honoured by them with gifts and suitable tributesof respect these are the customs according to which our cityshould receive all strangers of either sex who come from othercountries and should send forth her own citizens showing respectto zeus the god of hospitality not forbidding strangers at meals andsacrifices as is the manner which prevails among the children ofthe nile nor driving them away by savage proclamations 
 when a man becomes surety let him give the security in a distinctform acknowledging the whole transaction in a written document andin the presence of not less than three witnesses if the sum be under athousand drachmae and of not less than five witnesses if the sum beabove a thousand drachmae the agent of a dishonest or untrustworthyseller shall himself be responsible both the agent and theprincipal shall be equally liable if a person wishes to find anythingin the house of another he shall enter naked or wearing only a shorttunic and without a girdle having first taken an oath by thecustomary gods that he expects to find it there he shall then makehis search and the other shall throw open his house and allow himto search things both sealed and unsealed and if a person will notallow the searcher to make his search he who is prevented shall go tolaw with him estimating the value of the goods after which he issearching and if the other be convicted he shall pay twice thevalue of the article if the master be absent from home thedwellers in the house shall let him search the unsealed on the sealed property the searcher shall set another seal andshall appoint any one whom he likes to guard them during five if the master of the house be absent during a longer time heshall take with him the wardens of the city and so make his the sealed property as well as the unsealed and with the members of the family and the wardens of the shall seal them up again as they were before there shall be alimit of time in the case of disputed things and he who has hadpossession of them during a certain time shall no longer be liableto be disturbed as to houses and lands there can be no dispute inthis state of ours but if a man has any other possessions which hehas used and openly shown in the city and in the agora and in thetemples and no one has put in a claim to them and some one says thathe was looking for them during this time and the possessor isproved to have made no concealment if they have continued for a one having the goods and the other looking for them the claimof the seeker shall not be allowed after the expiration of the if he does not use or show the lost property in the market or inthe city but only in the country and no one offers himself as theowner during five years at the expiration of the five years the claimshall be barred for ever after or if he uses them in the city butwithin the house then the appointed time of claiming the goodsshall be three years or ten years if he has them in the country inprivate and if he has them in another land there shall be no limitof time or prescription but whenever the owner finds them he mayclaim them 
 if any one prevents another by force from being present at atrial whether a principal party or his witnesses if the personprevented be a slave whether his own or belonging to another thesuit shall be incomplete and invalid but if he who is prevented bea freeman besides the suit being incomplete the other who hasprevented him shall be imprisoned for a year and shall beprosecuted for kidnapping by any one who pleases and if any onehinders by force a rival competitor in gymnastic or music or anyother sort of contest from being present at the contest let himwho has a mind inform the presiding judges and they shall liberatehim who is desirous of competing and if they are not able and he whohinders the other from competing wins the prize then they shallgive the prize of victory to him who is prevented and inscribe him asthe conqueror in any temples which he pleases and he who hindersthe other shall not be permitted to make any offering or inscriptionhaving reference to that contest and in any case he shall be liablefor damages whether he be defeated or whether he conquer 
 if any one knowingly receives anything which has been stolen heshall undergo the same punishment as the thief and if a manreceives an exile he shall be punished with death every man shouldregard the friend and enemy of the state as his own friend andenemy and if any one makes peace or war with another on his ownaccount and without the authority of the state he like the receiverof the exile shall undergo the penalty of death and if anyfraction of the city declare war or peace against any the generalsshall indict the authors of this proceeding and if they are convicteddeath shall be the penalty those who serve their country ought toserve without receiving gifts and there ought to be no excusing orapproving the saying men should receive gifts as the reward of not of evil deeds for to know which we are doing and to standfast by our knowledge is no easy matter the safest course is to obeythe law which says do no service for a bribe and let him whodisobeys if he be convicted simply die with a view to taxation forvarious reasons every man ought to have had his property the tribesmen should likewise bring a register of the yearlyproduce to the wardens of the country that in this way there may betwo valuations and the public officers may use annuary whichever onconsideration they deem the best whether they prefer to take acertain portion of the whole value or of the annual revenue aftersubtracting what is paid to the common tables 
 touching offerings to the gods a moderate man should observemoderation in what he offers now the land and the hearth of the houseof all men is sacred to all gods wherefore let no man dedicate them asecond time to the gods gold and silver whether possessed by privatepersons or in temples are in other cities provocative of envy andivory the product of a dead body is not a proper offering brass andiron again are instruments of war but of wood let a man bringwhat offerings he likes provided it be a single block and in likemanner of stone to the public temples of woven work let him notoffer more than one woman can execute in a month white is a coloursuitable to the gods especially in woven works but dyes shouldonly be used for the adornments of war the most divine of gifts arebirds and images and they should be such as one painter can executein a single day and let all other offerings follow a similar rule 
 now that the whole city has been divided into parts of which thenature and number have been described and laws have been givenabout all the most important contracts as far as this was next thing will be to have justice done the first of the courtsshall consist of elected judges who shall be chosen by theplaintiff and the defendant in common these shall be calledarbiters rather than judges and in the second court there shall bejudges of the villages and tribes corresponding to the twelvefolddivision of the land and before these the litigants shall go tocontend for greater damages if the suit be not decided before thefirst judges the defendant if he be defeated the second pay a fifth more than the damages mentioned in the if he find fault with his judges and would try a third time lethim carry the suit before the select judges and if he be againdefeated let him pay the whole of the damages and half as much the plaintiff if when defeated before the first judges he persistin going on to the second shall if he wins receive in addition to thedamages a fifth part more and if defeated he shall pay a like if he is not satisfied with the previous decision and will insiston proceeding to a third court then if he win he shall receive fromthe defendant the amount of the damages and as i said before half asmuch again and the plaintiff if he lose shall pay half of thedamages claimed now the assignment by lot of judges to courts and thecompletion of the number of them and the appointment of servants tothe different magistrates and the times at which the several causesshould be heard and the votings and delays and all the things thatnecessarily concern suits and the order of causes and the time inwhich answers have to be put in and parties are to these andother things akin to these we have indeed already spoken but there isno harm in repeating what is right twice or lesser andeasier matters which the elder legislator has omitted may besupplied by the younger one private courts will be sufficientlyregulated in this way and the public and state courts and thosewhich the magistrates must use in the administration of theirseveral offices exist in many other states many very respectableinstitutions of this sort have been framed by good men and fromthem the guardians of the law may by reflection derive what isnecessary for the order of our new state considering andcorrecting them and bringing them to the test of experience untilevery detail appears to be satisfactorily determined and then puttingthe final seal upon them and making them irreversible they shall usethem for ever afterwards as to what relates to the silence ofjudges and the abstinence from words of evil omen and the reverse andthe different notions of the just and good and honourable whichexist in our own as compared with other states they have been partlymentioned already and another part of them will be mentionedhereafter as we draw near the end to all these matters he who wouldbe an equal judge shall justly look and he shall possess writingsabout them that he may learn them for of all kinds of knowledge theknowledge of good laws has the greatest power of improving thelearner otherwise there would be no meaning the divine andadmirable law possessing a name akin to mind nous nomos and of allother words such as the praises and censures of individuals whichoccur in poetry and also in prose whether written down or utteredin daily conversation whether men dispute about them in the spirit ofcontention or weakly assent to them as is often the all thesethe one sure test is the writings of the legislator which therighteous judge ought to have in his mind as the antidote of all otherwords and thus make himself and the city stand upright procuring forthe good the continuance and increase of justice and for the the other hand a conversion from ignorance and intemperance andin general from all unrighteousness as far as their evil minds can behealed but to those whose web of life is in reality death which is the only remedy for souls in their i may say truly again and again and such judges and chiefs ofjudges will be worthy of receiving praise from the whole city 
 when the suits of the year are completed the following laws shallregulate their the first place the judge shall assignto the party who wins the suit the whole property of him who the exception of mere necessaries and the assignment shall bemade through the herald immediately after each decision in the hearingof the judges and when the month arrives following the month in whichthe courts are sitting unless the gainer of the suit has beenpreviously satisfied the court shall follow up the case and handover to the winner the goods of the loser but if they find that hehas not the means of paying and the sum deficient is not less thana drachma the insolvent person shall not have any right of going tolaw with any other man until he have satisfied the debt of the winningparty but other persons shall still have the right of bringingsuits against him and if any one after he is condemned refuses toacknowledge the authority which condemned him let the magistrates whoare thus deprived of their authority bring him before the court of theguardians of the law and if he be cast let him be punished withdeath as a subverter of the whole state and of the laws 
 thus a man is born and brought up and after this manner he begetsand brings up his own children and has his share of dealings withother men and suffers if he has done wrong to any one and receivessatisfaction if he has been wronged and so at length in due time hegrows old under the protection of the laws and his end comes in theorder of nature concerning the dead of either sex the religiousceremonies which may fittingly be performed whether appertaining tothe gods of the underworld or of this shall be decided by theinterpreters with absolute authority their sepulchres are not to bein places which are fit for cultivation and there shall be nomonuments in such spots either large or small but they shalloccupy that part of the country which is naturally adapted forreceiving and concealing the bodies of the dead with as little hurt aspossible to the living no man living or dead shall deprive theliving of the sustenance which the earth their isnaturally inclined to provide for them and let not the mound be piledhigher than would be the work of five men completed in five shall the stone which is placed over the spot be larger than wouldbe sufficient to receive the praises of the dead included in fourheroic lines nor shall the laying out of the dead in the housecontinue for a longer time than is sufficient to distinguish betweenhim who is in a trance only and him who is really dead and speakinggenerally the third day after death will be a fair time forcarrying out the body to the sepulchre now we must believe thelegislator when he tells us that the soul is in all respectssuperior to the body and that even in life what makes each one usto be what we are is only the soul and that the body follows us aboutin the likeness of each of us and therefore when we are dead thebodies of the dead are quite rightly said to be our shades orimages for the true and immortal being of each one of us which iscalled the soul goes on her way to other gods before them to givean is an inspiring hope to the good but very terribleto the bad as the laws of our fathers tell us and they also saythat not much can be done in the way of helping a man after he isdead but the should be helped by all his kindred thatwhile in life he may be the holiest and justest of men and afterdeath may have no great sins to be punished in the world below ifthis be true a man ought not to waste his substance under the ideathat all this lifeless mass of flesh which is in process of burialis connected with him he should consider that the son or brother orthe beloved one whoever he may be whom he thinks he is laying in theearth has gone away to complete and fulfil his own destiny andthat his duty is rightly to order the present and to spend moderatelyon the lifeless altar of the gods below but the legislator does notintend moderation to be take in the sense of meanness let the be as expenditure on the entire funeral of himwho is of the highest class shall not exceed five minae and for himwho is of the second class three minae and for him who is of thethird class two minae and for him who is of the fourth class onemina will be a fair limit of expense the guardians of the lawought to take especial care of the different ages of life whetherchildhood or manhood or any other age and at the end of all letthere be some one guardian of the law presiding who shall be chosenby the friends of the deceased to superintend and let it be gloryto him to manage with fairness and moderation what relates to thedead and a discredit to him if they are not well managed let thelaying out and other ceremonies be in accordance with custom but tothe statesman who adopts custom as his law we must give way in certainparticulars it would be monstrous for example that he shouldcommand any man to weep or abstain from weeping over the dead buthe may forbid cries of lamentation and not allow the voice of themourner to be heard outside the house also he may forbid thebringing of the dead body into the open streets or the processions ofmourners in the streets and may require that before daybreak theyshould be outside the city let these then be our laws relating tosuch matters and let him who obeys be free from penalty but he whodisobeys even a single guardian of the law shall be punished by themall with a fitting penalty other modes of burial or again the denialof burial which is to be refused in the case of robbers of templesand parricides and the like have been devised and are embodied in thepreceding laws so that now our work of legislation is pretty nearlyat an end but in all cases the end does not consist in doingsomething or acquiring something or establishing endwill be attained and finally accomplished when we have provided forthe perfect and lasting continuance of our institutions until then ourcreation is incomplete 
 cle that is very good stranger but i wish you would tell me moreclearly what you mean 
 ath o cleinias many things of old time were well said and the saying about the fates was one of them 
 cle what is it 
 ath the saying that lachesis or the giver of the lots is thefirst of them and that clotho or the spinster is the second ofthem and that atropos or the unchanging one is the third of them andthat she is the preserver of the things which we have spoken andwhich have been compared in a figure to things woven by fire theyboth atropos and the fire producing the quality ofunchangeableness i am speaking of the things which in a state andgovernment give not only health and salvation to the body but law orrather preservation of the law in the soul and if i am notmistaken this seems to be still wanting in our laws we have still tosee how we can implant in them this irreversible nature 
 cle it will be no small matter if we can only discover how such anature can be implanted in anything 
 ath but it certainly can be so much i clearly see 
 cle then let us not think of desisting until we have impartedthis quality to our laws for it is ridiculous after a great dealof labour has been spent to place a thing at last on an insecurefoundation 
 megillus i approve of your suggestion and am quite of the samemind with you 
 cle very good and now what according to you is to be thesalvation of our government and of our laws and how is it to beeffected 
 ath were we not saying that there must be in our city a councilwhich was to be of this ten oldest guardians of the law andall those who have obtained prizes of virtue were to meet in the sameassembly and the council was also to include those who had visitedforeign countries in the hope of hearing something that might be ofuse in the preservation of the laws and who having come safely having been tested in these same matters had proved themselves tobe worthy to take part in the of the members was toselect some young man of not less than thirty years of age he himselfjudging in the first instance whether the young man was worthy bynature and education and then suggesting him to the others and if heseemed to them also to be worthy they were to adopt him but if decision at which they arrived was to be kept a secret from thecitizens at large and more especially from the rejectedcandidate the meeting of the council was to be held early in themorning when everybody was most at leisure from all other public or not something of this sort said by usbefore 
 cle true 
 ath then returning to the council i would say further that if welet it down to be the anchor of the state our city having everythingwhich is suitable to her will preserve all that we wish to preserve 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath now is the time for me to speak the truth in all earnestness 
 cle well said and i hope that you will fulfil your intention 
 ath know cleinias that everything in all that it does has anatural saviour as of an animal the soul and the head are the chiefsaviours 
 cle once more what do you mean 
 ath the of those two is obviously the preservation ofevery living thing 
 cle how is that 
 ath the soul besides other things contains mind and the other things contains sight and hearing and the with the noblest of the senses and becoming one with be truly called the salvation of all 
 cle yes quite so 
 ath yes indeed but with what is that intellect concerned with the senses is the salvation of ships in storms aswell as in fair weather in a ship when the pilot and the sailorsunite their perceptions with the piloting mind do they not saveboth themselves and their craft 
 cle very true 
 ath we do not want many illustrations about such would the general of an army or what aim would a physicianpropose to himself if he were seeking to attain salvation 
 cle very good 
 ath does not the general aim at victory and superiority in war anddo not the physician and his assistants aim at producing health in thebody 
 cle certainly 
 ath and a physician who is ignorant about the body that is to knows not that which we just now called health or a general whoknows not victory or any others who are ignorant of the particularsof the arts which we mentioned cannot be said to have understandingabout any of these matters 
 cle they cannot 
 ath and what would you say of the state if a person proves to beignorant of the aim to which the statesman should look ought he inthe first place to be called a ruler at all further will he ever beable to preserve that of which he does not even know the aim 
 cle impossible 
 ath and therefore if our settlement of the country is to beperfect we ought to have some institution which as i was tell what is the aim of the state and will inform us how weare to attain this and what law or what man will advise us to thatend any state which has no such institution is likely to be devoid ofmind and sense and in all her actions will proceed by mere chance 
 cle very true 
 ath in which then of the parts or institutions of the state isany such guardian power to be found can we say 
 cle i am not quite certain stranger but i have a suspicion thatyou are referring to the assembly which you just now said was tomeet at night 
 ath you understand me perfectly cleinias and we must assume asthe argument iniplies that this council possesses all virtue and thebeginning of virtue is not to make mistakes by guessing many to look steadily at one thing and on this to fix all our aims 
 cle quite true 
 ath then now we shall see why there is nothing wonderful instates going reason is that their legislators have suchdifferent aims nor is there anything wonderful in some laying down astheir rule of justice that certain individuals should bear rule inthe state whether they be good or bad and others that the citizensshould be rich not caring whether they are the slaves of other men ornot the tendency of others again is towards freedom and somelegislate with a view to two things at want to be at thesame time free and the lords of other states but the wisest men asthey deem themselves to be look to all these and similar aims andthere is no one of them which they exclusively honour and to whichthey would have all things look 
 cle then stranger our former assertion will hold for we weresaying that laws generally should look to one thing only and this aswe admitted was rightly said to be virtue 
 ath yes 
 cle and we said that virtue was of four kinds 
 ath quite true 
 cle and that mind was the leader of the four and that to her thethree other virtues and all other things ought to have regard 
 ath you follow me capitally cleinias and i would ask you tofollow me to the end for we have already said that the mind of thepilot the mind of the physician and of the general look to that onething to which they ought to look and now we may turn to mindpolitical of which as of a human creature we will ask a being and to what are you looking the physician is able totell his single aim in life but you the superior as you declareyourself to be of all intelligent beings when you are asked arenot able to tell can you megillus and you cleinias say distinctlywhat is the aim of mind political in return for the many explanationsof things which i have given you 
 cle we cannot stranger 
 ath well but ought we not to desire to see it and to see whereit is to be found 
 cle for example where 
 ath for example we were saying that there are four kinds ofvirtue and as there are four of them each of them must be one 
 cle certainly 
 ath and further all four of them we call one for we say thatcourage is virtue and that prudence is virtue and the same of thetwo others as if they were in reality not many but one that 
 cle quite so 
 ath there is no difficulty in seeing in what way the two differfrom one another and have received two names and so of the rest butthere is more difficulty in explaining why we call these two and therest of them by the single name of virtue 
 cle how do you mean 
 ath i have no difficulty in explaining what i mean let usdistribute the subject questions and answers 
 cle once more what do you mean 
 ath ask me what is that one thing which call virtue and then againspeak of as two one part being courage and the other wisdom i willtell you how that of them has to do with fear in this thebeasts also participate and quite young mean a courageous temper is a gift of nature and not of reason butwithout reason there never has been or is or will be a wise andunderstanding soul it is of a different nature 
 cle that is true 
 ath i have now told you in what way the two are different and doyou in return tell me in what way they are one and the same supposethat i ask you in what way the four are one and when you haveanswered me you will have a right to ask of me in return in whatway they are four and then let us proceed to enquire whether in thecase of things which have a name and also a definition to them trueknowledge consists in knowing the name only and not the he who is good for anything be ignorant of all this withoutdiscredit where great and glorious truths are concerned 
 cle i suppose not 
 ath and is there anything greater to the legislator and theguardian of the law and to him who thinks that he excels all othermen in virtue and has won the palm of excellence that these veryqualities of which we are now temperance 
 cle how can there be anything greater 
 ath and ought not the interpreters the teachers the lawgivers theguardians of the other citizens to excel the rest of mankind andperfectly to show him who desires to learn and know or whose evilactions require to be punished and reproved what is the nature ofvirtue and vice or shall some poet who has found his way into thecity or some chance person who pretends to be an instructor of himself to be better than him who has won the prize for everyvirtue and can we wonder that when the guardians are not adequatein speech or action and have no adequate knowledge of virtue thecity being unguarded should experience the common fate of cities inour day 
 cle wonder no 
 ath well then must we do as we said or can we give our guardiansa more precise knowledge of virtue in speech and action than themany have or is there any way in which our city can be made toresemble the head and senses of rational beings because possessingsuch a guardian power 
 cle what stranger is the drift of your comparison 
 ath do we not see that the city is the trunk and are not theyounger guardians who are chosen for their natural gifts placed inthe head of the state having their souls all full of eyes with whichthey look about the whole city they keep watch and hand over theirperceptions to the memory and inform the elders of all that happensin the city and those whom we compared to the mind because they havemany wise is to say the old counsel and makinguse of the younger men as their ministers and advising with way both together truly preserve the whole this orsome other be the order of our state are all our citizens to be equalin acquirements or shall there be special persons among them who havereceived a more careful training and education 
 cle that they should be equal my good sir is impossible 
 ath then we ought to proceed to some more exact training than anywhich has preceded 
 cle certainly 
 ath and must not that of which we are in need be the one to whichwe were just now alluding 
 cle very true 
 ath did we not say that the workman or guardian if he be perfectin every respect ought not only to be able to see the many he should press onward to the one this he should know andknowing order all things with a view to it 
 cle true 
 ath and can any one have a more exact way of considering orcontemplating anything than the being able to look at one ideagathered from many different things 
 cle perhaps not 
 ath not perhaps not but certainly not my good sir is theright answer there never has been a truer method than this discoveredby any man 
 cle i bow to your authority stranger let us proceed in the waywhich you propose 
 ath then as would appear we must compel the guardians of ourdivine state to perceive in the first place what that principle iswhich is the same in all the same as we affirm in courageand in temperance and in justice and in prudence and which beingone we call as we ought by the single name of virtue to this myfriends we will if you please hold fast and not let go until wehave sufficiently explained what that is to which we are to to be regarded as one or as a whole or as both or inwhatever way are we likely ever to be in a virtuous condition ifwe cannot tell whether virtue is many or four or one we take counsel among ourselves we shall in some way contrive thatthis principle has a place amongst us but if you have made up yourmind that we should let the matter alone we will 
 cle we must not stranger by the god of strangers i swear thatwe must not for in our opinion you speak most truly but we shouldlike to know how you will accomplish your purpose 
 ath wait a little before you ask and let us first of all bequite agreed with one another that the purpose has to be accomplished 
 cle certainly it ought to be if it can be 
 ast well and about the good and the honourable are we to take thesame view are our guardians only to know that each of them is also how and in what way they are one 
 cle they must consider also in what sense they are one 
 ath and are they to consider only and to be unable to set forthwhat they think 
 cle certainly not that would be the state of a slave 
 ath and may not the same be said of all good the trueguardians of the laws ought to know the truth about them and to beable to interpret them in words and carry them out in action judgingof what is and what is not well according to nature 
 cle certainly 
 ath is not the knowledge of the gods which we have set forth withso much zeal one of the noblest sorts of know thatthey are and know how great is their power as far as in man lies doindeed excuse the mass of the citizens who only follow the voice ofthe laws but we refuse to admit as guardians any who do not labour toobtain every possible evidence that there is respecting the city is forbidden and not allowed to choose as a guardian of thelaw or to place in the select order of virtue him who is not aninspired man and has not laboured at these things 
 cle it is certainly just as you say that he who is indolent aboutsuch matters or incapable should be rejected and that thingshonourable should be put away from him 
 ath are we assured that there are two things which lead men tobelieve in the gods as we have already stated 
 cle what are they 
 ath one is the argument about the soul which has been it is the eldest and most divine of all things towhich motion attaining generation gives perpetual existence the otherwas an argument from the order of the motion of the stars and ofall things under the dominion of the mind which ordered theuniverse if a man look upon the world not lightly or was never any one so godless who did not experience an effectopposite to that which the many imagine for they think that those whohandle these matters by the help of astronomy and the accompanyingarts of demonstration may become godless because they see as far asthey can see things happening by necessity and not by an intelligentwill accomplishing good 
 cle but what is the fact 
 ath just the opposite as i said of the opinion which onceprevailed among men that the sun and stars are without soul evenin those days men wondered about them and that which is nowascertained was then conjectured by some who had a more exactknowledge of if they had been things without soul and hadno mind they could never have moved with numerical exactness sowonderful and even at that time some ventured to hazard theconjecture that mind was the orderer of the universe but these samepersons again mistaking the nature of the soul which they conceivedto be younger and not older than the body once more overturned theworld or rather i should say themselves for the bodies whichthey saw moving in heaven all appeared to be full of stones andearth and many other lifeless substances and to these theyassigned the causes of all things such studies gave rise to muchatheism and perplexity and the poets took occasion to the philosophers to uttering vain talking other nonsense of the same sort but now as i said thecase is reversed 
 cle how so 
 ath no man can be a true worshipper of the gods who does not knowthese two the soul is the eldest of all things whichare born and is immortal and rules over all bodies moreover as ihave now said several times he who has not contemplated the mind ofnature which is said to exist in the stars and gone through theprevious training and seen the connection of music with these harmonized them all with laws and institutions is not able togive a reason of such things as have a reason and he who is unable toacquire this in addition to the ordinary virtues of a citizen canhardly be a good ruler of a whole state but he should be thesubordinate of other rulers wherefore cleinias and megillus letus consider whether we may not add to all the other laws which we havediscussed this further the nocturnal assembly of themagistrates which has also shared in the whole scheme of educationproposed by us shall be a guard set according to law for thesalvation of the state shall we propose this 
 cle certainly my good friend we will if the thing is in anydegree possible 
 ath let us make a common effort to gain such an object for i toowill gladly share in the attempt of these matters i have had muchexperience and have often considered them and i dare say that ishall be able to find others who will also help 
 cle i agree stranger that we should proceed along the road inwhich god is guiding us and how we can proceed rightly has now tobe investigated and explained 
 ath o megillus and cleinias about these matters we cannotlegislate further until the council is constituted when that is we will determine what authority they shall have of their the explanation of how this is all to be ordered would only begiven rightly in a long discourse 
 cle what do you mean and what new thing is this 
 ath in the first place a list would have to be made out of thosewho by their ages and studies and dispositions and habits are wellfitted for the duty of a guardian in the next place it will not beeasy for them to discover themselves what they ought to learn orbecome the disciple of one who has already made the to write down the times at which and during ought to receive the several kinds of instruction would be avain thing for the learners themselves do not know what is learned toadvantage until the knowledge which is the result of learning hasfound a place in the soul of each and so these details although theycould not be truly said to be secret might be said to be incapable ofbeing stated beforehand because when stated they would have nomeaning 
 cle what then are we to do stranger under these circumstances 
 ath as the proverb says the answer is no secret but open to allof must risk the whole on the chance of throwing as theysay thrice six or thrice ace and i am willing to share with youthe danger by stating and explaining to you my views about educationand nurture which is the question coming to the surface again thedanger is not a slight or ordinary one and i would advise in particular to see to the matter for if you orderrightly the city of the magnetes or whatever name god may give will obtain the greatest glory or at any rate you will be thoughtthe most courageous of men in the estimation of posterity dearcompanions if this our divine assembly can only be established tothem we will hand over the city none of the present company oflegislators as i may call them would hesitate about that and thestate will be perfected and become a waking reality which a littlewhile ago we attempted to create as a dream and in idea only minglingtogether reason and mind in one image in the hope that our citizensmight be duly mingled and rightly educated and being educated anddwelling in the citadel of the land might become perfect as we have never seen in all our previous life by reason ofthe saving virtue which is in them 
 meg dear cleinias after all that has been said either we mustdetain the stranger and by supplications and in all manner of waysmake him share in the foundation of the city or we must give up theundertaking 
 cle very true megillus and you must join with me in detaininghim 
 meg i will

 now every man who is engaged in any suit ought to be very careful ofbringing false witness against any one either intentionally orunintentionally if he can help for justice is truly said to be anhonourable maiden and falsehood is naturally repugnant to honourand justice a witness ought to be very careful not to sift againstjustice as for example in what relates to the throwing away must distinguish the throwing them away when necessary andnot make that a reproach or bring in action against some innocentperson on that account to make the distinction maybe difficult butstill the law must attempt to define the different kinds in someway let me endeavour to explain my meaning by an ancient had been brought to the tent still alive but without hisarms and this has happened to innumerable persons the originalarms which the poet says were presented to peleus by the gods as anuptial gift when he married thetis remaining in the hands ofhector then the base spirits of that day might have reproached theson of menoetius with having cast away his arms again there is thecase of those who have been thrown down precipices and lost theirarms and of those who at sea and in stormy places have beensuddenly overwhelmed by floods of water and there are numberlessthings of this kind which one might adduce by way of with the view of justifying a misfortune which is easilymisrepresented we must therefore endeavour to divide to the best ofour power the greater and more serious evil from the lesser and adistinction may be drawn in the use of terms of reproach a man doesnot always deserve to be called the thrower away of his shield he maybe only the loser of his arms for there is a great or rather absolutedifference between him who is deprived of his arms by a sufficientforce and him who voluntarily lets his shield go let the law then beas a person having arms is overtaken by the enemy and doesnot turn round and defend himself but lets them go voluntarily orthrows them away choosing a base life and a swift escape ratherthan a courageous and noble and blessed such a case of thethrowing away of arms let justice be done but the judge need takeno note of the case just now mentioned for the bad man ought alwaysto be punished in the hope that he may be improved but not theunfortunate for there is no advantage in that and what shall bethe punishment suited to him who has thrown away his weapons ofdefence tradition says that caeneus the thessalian was changed by agod from a woman into a man but the converse miracle cannot now bewrought or no punishment would be more proper than that the man whothrows away his shield should be changed into a woman this however isimpossible and therefore let us make a law as nearly like this aswe he who loves his life too well shall be in no danger forthe remainder of his days but shall live for ever under the stigma ofcowardice and let the law be in the following a man isfound guilty of disgracefully throwing away his arms in war nogeneral or military officer shall allow him to serve as a give him any place at all in the ranks of soldiers and the officerwho gives the coward any place shall suffer a penalty which thepublic examiner shall exact of him and if he be of the highestdass he shall pay a thousand drachmae or if he be of the secondclass five minae or if he be of the third three minae or if hebe of the fourth class one mina and he who is found guilty ofcowardice shall not only be dismissed from manly dangers which isa disgrace appropriate to his nature but he shall pay a thousanddrachmae if he be of the highest class and five minae if he be ofthe second class and three if he be of the third class and a the preceding if he be of the fourth class 
 what regulations will be proper about examiners seeing that some ofour magistrates are elected by lot and for a year and some for alonger time and from selected persons of such magistrates who willbe a sufficient censor or examiner if any of them weighed down bythe pressure of office or his own inability to support the dignityof his office be guilty of any crooked practice it is by no meanseasy to find a magistrate who excels other magistrates in still we must endeavour to discover some censor or examiner who ismore than man for the truth is that there are many elements ofdissolution in a state as there are also in a ship or in ananimal they all have their cords and girders and diffused in many places and called by many names and theoffice of examiner is a most important element in the preservation anddissolution of states for if the examiners are better than themagistrates and their duty is fulfilled justly and without the whole state and country flourishes and is happy but if theexamination of the magistrates is carried on in a wrong way the relaxation of that justice which is the uniting principle ofall constitutions every power in the state is rent asunder from everyother they no longer incline in the same direction but fill the citywith faction and make many cities out of one and soon bring all todestruction wherefore the examiners ought to be admirable in everysort of virtue let us invent a mode of creating them which shallbe as year after the summer solstice the whole cityshall meet in the common precincts of helios and apollo and shallpresent to the god three men out of their own number in the citizen shall select not himself but some othercitizen whom he deems in every way the best and who is not lessthan fifty years of age and out of the selected persons who havethe greatest number of votes they shall make a further selectionuntil they reduce them to if they are an even number but ifthey are not an even number they shall subtract the one who has thesmallest number of votes and make them an even number and then leavethe half which have the great number of votes and if two persons havean equal number of votes and thus increase the number they shall withdraw the younger of the two and do awaywith the excess and then including all the rest they shall againvote until there are left three having an unequal number of if all the three or two out of the three have equal votes letthem commit the election to good fate and fortune and separate off bylot the first and the second and the third these they shall crownwith an olive wreath and give them the prize of excellence at thesame time proclaiming to all the world that the city of themagnetes by providence of the gods is again preserved andpresents to the sun and to apollo her three best men to be a common offering to them according to theancient law as long as their lives answer to the judgment formed ofthem and these shall appoint in their first year twelve examiners tocontinue until each has completed years to whom threeshall afterwards be added yearly and let these divide all themagistracies into twelve parts and prove the holders of them by everysort of test to which a freeman may be subjected and let them livewhile they hold office in the precinct of helios and apollo inwhich they were chosen and let each one form a judgment of somethings individually and of others in company with his colleagues andlet him place a writing in the agora about each magistracy and whatthe magistrate ought to suffer or pay according to the decision ofthe examiners and if a magistrate does not admit that he has beenjustly judged let him bring the examiners before the select if he be acquitted by their decision let him if he the examiners themselves if however he be convicted andhave been condemned to death by the examiners let him die and ofcourse he can only die any other penalties which admit ofbeing doubled let him suffer twice over 
 and now let us pass under review the examiners themselves what willtheir examination be and how conducted during the life of these the whole state counts worthy of the rewards of virtue theyshall have the first seat at all public assemblies and at allhellenic sacrifices and sacred missions and other public and holyceremonies in which they share the chiefs of each sacred missionshall be selected from them and they only of all the citizens shallbe adorned with a crown of laurel they shall all be priests of apolloand helios and one of them who is judged first of the priestscreated in that year shall be high priest and they shall write uphis name in each year to be a measure of time as long as the citylasts and after their death they shall be laid out and carried to thegrave and entombed in a manner different from the other citizens theyshall be decked in a robe all of white and there shall be no cryingor lamentation over them but a chorus of fifteen maidens and anotherof boys shall stand around the bier on either side hymning thepraises of the departed priests in alternate responses declaringtheir blessedness in song all day long and at dawn a hundred of theyouths who practise gymnastic and whom the relations of the departedshall choose shall carry the bier to the sepulchre the young menmarching first dressed in the garb of cavalry with theirhorses the with their arms and the others in likemanner and boys neat the bier and in front of it shall sing theirnational hymn and maidens shall follow behind and with them thewomen who have passed the age of childbearing next although they areinterdicted from other burials let priests and priestesses the pythian oracle forbid them for this burial is free frompollution the place of burial shall be an oblong vaulted chamberunderground constructed of tufa which will last for ever havingstone couches placed side by side and here they will lay theblessed person and cover the sepulchre with a circular mound of earthand plant a grove of trees around on every side but one and on thatside the sepulchre shall be allowed to extend for ever and a newmound will not be required every year they shall have contests inmusic and gymnastics and in horsemanship in honour of the are the honours which shall be given to those who at theexamination are found blameless but if any of them trusting to thescrutiny being over should after the judgment has been the wickedness of human nature let the law ordain that hewho pleases shall indict him and let the cause be tried in thefollowing manner in the first place the court shall be composed ofthe guardians of the law and to them the surviving examiners shall beadded as well as the court of select judges and let the pursuerlay his indictment in this shall say that isunworthy of the prize of virtue and of his office and if thedefendant be convicted let him be deprived of his office and of theburial and of the other honours given him but if the prosecutor donot obtain the fifth part of the votes let him if he be of the firstdass pay twelve minae and eight if he be of the second class andsix if he be of the third dass and two minae if he be of the fourthclass 
 the decision of rhadamanthus is worthy of alladmiration he knew that the men of his own time believed and had nodoubt that there were gods which was a reasonable belief in thosedays because most men were the sons of gods and according totradition he was one himself he appears to have thought that he oughtto commit judgment to no man but to the gods only and in this waysuits were simply and speedily decided by him for he made the twoparties take an oath respecting the points in dispute and so gotrid of the matter speedily and safely but now that a certainportion of mankind do not believe at all in the existence of the others imagine that they have no care of us and the opinion ofmost men and of the men is that in return for small sacrifice anda few flattering words they will be their accomplices in purloininglarge sums and save them from many terrible punishments the way ofrhadamanthus is no longer suited to the needs of justice for as theneeds of men about the gods are changed the laws should also the granting of suits a rational legislation ought to doaway with the oaths of the parties on either who obtains leaveto bring an action should write down the charges but should notadd an oath and the defendant in like manner should give his denialto the magistrates in writing and not swear for it is a dreadfulthing to know when many lawsuits are going on in a state thatalmost half the people who meet one another quite unconcernedly at thepublic meals and in other companies and relations of private lifeare perjured let the law then be as judge who is aboutto give judgment shall take an oath and he who is choosingmagistrates for the state shall either vote on oath or with a votingtablet which he brings from a temple so too the judge of dances andof all music and the superintendents and umpires of gymnastic andequestrian contests and any matters in which as far as men canjudge there is nothing to be gained by a false oath but all cases inwhich a denial confirmed by an oath clearly results in a greatadvantage to the taker of the oath shall be decided without theoath of the parties to the suit and the presiding judges shall notpermit either of them to use an oath for the sake of to call down curses on himself and his race nor to use unseemlysupplications or womanish laments but they shall ever be teaching andlearning what is just in auspicious words and he who does otherwiseshall be supposed to speak beside the point and the judges shallagain bring him back to the question at issue on the other in their dealings with strangers shall as at present havepower to give and receive oaths for they will not often grow old inthe city or leave a fry of young ones like themselves to be the sonsand heirs of the land 
 as to the initiation of private suits let the manner of decidingcauses between all citizens be the same as in cases in which anyfreeman is disobedient to the state in minor matters of which thepenalty is not stripes imprisonment or death but as regardsattendance at choruses or processions or other shows and as regardspublic services whether the celebration of sacrifice in peace or thepayment of contributions in all these cases first comes thenecessity of providing remedy for the loss and by those who willnot obey there shall be security given to the officers whom thecity and the law empower to exact the sum due and if they forfeittheir security let the goods which they have pledged be and themoney given to the city but if they ought to pay a larger sum theseveral magistrates shall impose upon the disobedient a suitablepenalty and bring them before the court until they are willing to dowhat they are ordered 
 now a state which makes money from the cultivation of the soil has no foreign trade must consider what it will do about theemigration of its own people to other countries and the receptionof strangers from elsewhere about these matters the legislator has toconsider and he will begin by trying to persuade men as far as hecan the intercourse of cities with one another is apt to create aconfusion of manners strangers are always suggesting novelties tostrangers when states are well governed by good laws the mixturecauses the greatest possible injury but seeing that most cities arethe reverse of the confusion which arises in them fromthe reception of strangers and from the citizens themselves rushingoff into other cities when any one either young or old desires totravel anywhere abroad at whatever time is of no consequence onthe other hand the refusal of states to receive others and for theirown citizens never to go to other places is an utter to the rest of the world is likely to appear ruthless anduncivilized it is a practise adopted by people who use harsh as xenelasia or banishment of strangers and who have harsh andmorose ways as men think and to be thought or not to be thought wellof by the rest of the world is no light matter for the many are notso far wrong in their judgment of who are bad and who are good asthey are removed from the nature of virtue in themselves even bad menhave a divine instinct which guesses rightly and very many who areutterly depraved form correct notions and judgments of the differencesbetween the good and bad and the generality of cities are quite rightin exhorting us to value a good reputation in the world for thereis no truth greater and more important than he who is reallygood i am speaking of the man who would be perfect seeks forreputation with but not without the reality of goodness and ourcretan colony ought also to acquire the fairest and noblest reputationfor virtue from other men and there is every reason to expect the reality answers to the idea she will before of the cities which the sun and the other gods in the matter of journeys to other countries and thereception of strangers we enact as the first place letno one be allowed to go anywhere at all into a foreign country whois less than forty years of age and no one shall go in a privatecapacity but only in some public one as a herald or on anembassy or on a sacred mission going abroad on an expedition or inwar not to be included among travels of the class authorized by thestate to apollo at delphi and to zeus at olympia and to nemea andto the should be sent to take part in the sacrificesand games there dedicated to the gods and they should send as many aspossible and the best and fairest that can be found and they willmake the city renowned at holy meetings in time of peace procuringa glory which shall be the converse of that which is gained in when they come home they shall teach the young that theinstitutions of other states are inferior to their own and they shallsend spectators of another sort if they have the consent of theguardians being such citizens as desire to look a little more atleisure at the doings of other men and these no law shall hinder fora city which has no experience of good and bad men or intercourse withthem can never be thoroughly and perfectly civilized nor the citizens of a city properly observe the laws by habit without an intelligent understanding of them and there always arein the world a few inspired men whose acquaintance is beyond who spring up quite as much in as in these are they whom the citizens of a well ordered city shouldbe ever seeking out going forth over sea and over land to find himwho is he may establish more firmly institutions inhis own state which are good already and amend what is deficient forwithout this examination and enquiry a city will never continueperfect any more than if the examination is 
 cleinias how can we have an examination and also a good one 
 athenian stranger in this way in the first place our spectatorshall be of not less than fifty years of age he must be a man ofreputation especially in war if he is to exhibit to other cities amodel of the guardians of the law but when he is more than sixtyyears of age he shall no longer continue in his office of when he has carried on his inspection during as many out of theten years of his office as he pleases on his return home let him goto the assembly of those who review the laws this shall be a mixedbody of young and old men who shall be required to meet daily betweenthe hour of dawn and the rising of the sun they shall consist in thefirst place of the priests who have obtained the rewards of in the second place of guardians of the law the ten eldest beingchosen the general superintendent of education shall also bemember as well the last appointed as those who have been releasedfrom the office and each of them shall take with him as his companionyoung man whomsoever he chooses between the ages of thirty andforty these shall be always holding conversation and discourseabout the laws of their own city or about any specially good oneswhich they may hear to be existing elsewhere also about kinds ofknowledge which may appear to be of use and will throw light uponthe examination or of which the want will make the subject of lawsdark and uncertain to them any knowledge of this sort which theelders approve the younger men shall learn with all diligence and ifany one of those who have been invited appear to be unworthy thewhole assembly shall blame him who invited him the rest of the cityshall watch over those among the young men who distinguish an eye upon them and especially honouring them if theysucceed but dishonouring them above the rest if they turn out to beinferior this is the assembly to which he who has visited theinstitutions of other men on his return home shall straightway if he have discovered any one who has anything to say about theenactment of laws or education or nurture or if he have himselfmade any observations let him communicate his discoveries to thewhole assembly and if he be seen to have come home neither better norworse let him be praised at any rate for his enthusiasm and if he bemuch better let him be praised so much the more and not only whilehe lives but after his death let the assembly honour him withfitting honours but if on his return home he appear to have beencorrupted pretending to be wise when he is not let him hold nocommunication with any one whether young or old and if he willhearken to the rulers then he shall be permitted to live as a privateindividual but if he will not let him die if he be convicted in acourt of law of interfering about education and the laws and if hedeserve to be indicted and none of the magistrates indict him letthat be counted as a disgrace to them when the rewards of virtue aredecided 
 let such be the character of the person who goes abroad and let himgo abroad under these conditions in the next place the strangerwho comes from abroad should be received in a friendly spirit nowthere are four kinds of strangers of whom we must make first is he who comes and stays throughout the class are like birds of passage taking wing in pursuit ofcommerce and flying over the sea to other cities while the seasonlasts he shall be received in and harbours and publicbuildings near the city but outside by those magistrates who areappointed to superintend these matters and they shall take carethat a stranger whoever he be duly receives justice but he shallnot be allowed to make any innovation they shall hold the intercoursewith him which is necessary and this shall be as little aspossible the second kind is just a spectator who comes to see withhis eyes and hear with his ears the festivals of the muses such oughtto have entertainment provided them at the temples by hospitablepersons and the priests and ministers of the temples should see andattend to them but they should not remain more than a reasonabletime let them see and hear that for the sake of which they then go away neither having suffered nor done any harm thepriests shall be their judges if any of them receive or do anywrong up to the sum of fifty drachmae but if any greater charge bebrought in such cases the suit shall come before the wardens of theagora the third kind of stranger is he who comes on some publicbusiness from another land and is to be received with public is to be received only by the generals and commanders of horseand foot and the host by whom he is entertained in conjunctionwith the prytanes shall have the sole charge of what concerns is a fourth dass of persons answering to our spectators whocome from another land to look at ours in the first place suchvisits will be rare and the visitor should be at least fifty years ofage he may possibly be wanting to see something that is rich and rarein other states or himself to show something in like manner toanother city let such an one then go unbidden to the doors of thewise and rich being one of them himself let him go for the house of the superintendent of education confident that heis a fitting guest of such a host or let him go to the house ofsome of those who have gained the prize of virtue and hold discoursewith them both learning from them and also teaching them and whenhe has seen and heard all he shall depart as a friend taking leaveof friends and be honoured by them with gifts and suitable tributesof respect these are the customs according to which our cityshould receive all strangers of either sex who come from othercountries and should send forth her own citizens showing respectto zeus the god of hospitality not forbidding strangers at meals andsacrifices as is the manner which prevails among the children ofthe nile nor driving them away by savage proclamations

 touching offerings to the gods a moderate man should observemoderation in what he offers now the land and the hearth of the houseof all men is sacred to all gods wherefore let no man dedicate them asecond time to the gods gold and silver whether possessed by privatepersons or in temples are in other cities provocative of envy andivory the product of a dead body is not a proper offering brass andiron again are instruments of war but of wood let a man bringwhat offerings he likes provided it be a single block and in likemanner of stone to the public temples of woven work let him notoffer more than one woman can execute in a month white is a coloursuitable to the gods especially in woven works but dyes shouldonly be used for the adornments of war the most divine of gifts arebirds and images and they should be such as one painter can executein a single day and let all other offerings follow a similar rule 
 now that the whole city has been divided into parts of which thenature and number have been described and laws have been givenabout all the most important contracts as far as this was next thing will be to have justice done the first of the courtsshall consist of elected judges who shall be chosen by theplaintiff and the defendant in common these shall be calledarbiters rather than judges and in the second court there shall bejudges of the villages and tribes corresponding to the twelvefolddivision of the land and before these the litigants shall go tocontend for greater damages if the suit be not decided before thefirst judges the defendant if he be defeated the second pay a fifth more than the damages mentioned in the if he find fault with his judges and would try a third time lethim carry the suit before the select judges and if he be againdefeated let him pay the whole of the damages and half as much the plaintiff if when defeated before the first judges he persistin going on to the second shall if he wins receive in addition to thedamages a fifth part more and if defeated he shall pay a like if he is not satisfied with the previous decision and will insiston proceeding to a third court then if he win he shall receive fromthe defendant the amount of the damages and as i said before half asmuch again and the plaintiff if he lose shall pay half of thedamages claimed now the assignment by lot of judges to courts and thecompletion of the number of them and the appointment of servants tothe different magistrates and the times at which the several causesshould be heard and the votings and delays and all the things thatnecessarily concern suits and the order of causes and the time inwhich answers have to be put in and parties are to these andother things akin to these we have indeed already spoken but there isno harm in repeating what is right twice or lesser andeasier matters which the elder legislator has omitted may besupplied by the younger one private courts will be sufficientlyregulated in this way and the public and state courts and thosewhich the magistrates must use in the administration of theirseveral offices exist in many other states many very respectableinstitutions of this sort have been framed by good men and fromthem the guardians of the law may by reflection derive what isnecessary for the order of our new state considering andcorrecting them and bringing them to the test of experience untilevery detail appears to be satisfactorily determined and then puttingthe final seal upon them and making them irreversible they shall usethem for ever afterwards as to what relates to the silence ofjudges and the abstinence from words of evil omen and the reverse andthe different notions of the just and good and honourable whichexist in our own as compared with other states they have been partlymentioned already and another part of them will be mentionedhereafter as we draw near the end to all these matters he who wouldbe an equal judge shall justly look and he shall possess writingsabout them that he may learn them for of all kinds of knowledge theknowledge of good laws has the greatest power of improving thelearner otherwise there would be no meaning the divine andadmirable law possessing a name akin to mind nous nomos and of allother words such as the praises and censures of individuals whichoccur in poetry and also in prose whether written down or utteredin daily conversation whether men dispute about them in the spirit ofcontention or weakly assent to them as is often the all thesethe one sure test is the writings of the legislator which therighteous judge ought to have in his mind as the antidote of all otherwords and thus make himself and the city stand upright procuring forthe good the continuance and increase of justice and for the the other hand a conversion from ignorance and intemperance andin general from all unrighteousness as far as their evil minds can behealed but to those whose web of life is in reality death which is the only remedy for souls in their i may say truly again and again and such judges and chiefs ofjudges will be worthy of receiving praise from the whole city 
 when the suits of the year are completed the following laws shallregulate their the first place the judge shall assignto the party who wins the suit the whole property of him who the exception of mere necessaries and the assignment shall bemade through the herald immediately after each decision in the hearingof the judges and when the month arrives following the month in whichthe courts are sitting unless the gainer of the suit has beenpreviously satisfied the court shall follow up the case and handover to the winner the goods of the loser but if they find that hehas not the means of paying and the sum deficient is not less thana drachma the insolvent person shall not have any right of going tolaw with any other man until he have satisfied the debt of the winningparty but other persons shall still have the right of bringingsuits against him and if any one after he is condemned refuses toacknowledge the authority which condemned him let the magistrates whoare thus deprived of their authority bring him before the court of theguardians of the law and if he be cast let him be punished withdeath as a subverter of the whole state and of the laws 
 thus a man is born and brought up and after this manner he begetsand brings up his own children and has his share of dealings withother men and suffers if he has done wrong to any one and receivessatisfaction if he has been wronged and so at length in due time hegrows old under the protection of the laws and his end comes in theorder of nature concerning the dead of either sex the religiousceremonies which may fittingly be performed whether appertaining tothe gods of the underworld or of this shall be decided by theinterpreters with absolute authority their sepulchres are not to bein places which are fit for cultivation and there shall be nomonuments in such spots either large or small but they shalloccupy that part of the country which is naturally adapted forreceiving and concealing the bodies of the dead with as little hurt aspossible to the living no man living or dead shall deprive theliving of the sustenance which the earth their isnaturally inclined to provide for them and let not the mound be piledhigher than would be the work of five men completed in five shall the stone which is placed over the spot be larger than wouldbe sufficient to receive the praises of the dead included in fourheroic lines nor shall the laying out of the dead in the housecontinue for a longer time than is sufficient to distinguish betweenhim who is in a trance only and him who is really dead and speakinggenerally the third day after death will be a fair time forcarrying out the body to the sepulchre now we must believe thelegislator when he tells us that the soul is in all respectssuperior to the body and that even in life what makes each one usto be what we are is only the soul and that the body follows us aboutin the likeness of each of us and therefore when we are dead thebodies of the dead are quite rightly said to be our shades orimages for the true and immortal being of each one of us which iscalled the soul goes on her way to other gods before them to givean is an inspiring hope to the good but very terribleto the bad as the laws of our fathers tell us and they also saythat not much can be done in the way of helping a man after he isdead but the should be helped by all his kindred thatwhile in life he may be the holiest and justest of men and afterdeath may have no great sins to be punished in the world below ifthis be true a man ought not to waste his substance under the ideathat all this lifeless mass of flesh which is in process of burialis connected with him he should consider that the son or brother orthe beloved one whoever he may be whom he thinks he is laying in theearth has gone away to complete and fulfil his own destiny andthat his duty is rightly to order the present and to spend moderatelyon the lifeless altar of the gods below but the legislator does notintend moderation to be take in the sense of meanness let the be as expenditure on the entire funeral of himwho is of the highest class shall not exceed five minae and for himwho is of the second class three minae and for him who is of thethird class two minae and for him who is of the fourth class onemina will be a fair limit of expense the guardians of the lawought to take especial care of the different ages of life whetherchildhood or manhood or any other age and at the end of all letthere be some one guardian of the law presiding who shall be chosenby the friends of the deceased to superintend and let it be gloryto him to manage with fairness and moderation what relates to thedead and a discredit to him if they are not well managed let thelaying out and other ceremonies be in accordance with custom but tothe statesman who adopts custom as his law we must give way in certainparticulars it would be monstrous for example that he shouldcommand any man to weep or abstain from weeping over the dead buthe may forbid cries of lamentation and not allow the voice of themourner to be heard outside the house also he may forbid thebringing of the dead body into the open streets or the processions ofmourners in the streets and may require that before daybreak theyshould be outside the city let these then be our laws relating tosuch matters and let him who obeys be free from penalty but he whodisobeys even a single guardian of the law shall be punished by themall with a fitting penalty other modes of burial or again the denialof burial which is to be refused in the case of robbers of templesand parricides and the like have been devised and are embodied in thepreceding laws so that now our work of legislation is pretty nearlyat an end but in all cases the end does not consist in doingsomething or acquiring something or establishing endwill be attained and finally accomplished when we have provided forthe perfect and lasting continuance of our institutions until then ourcreation is incomplete 
 cle that is very good stranger but i wish you would tell me moreclearly what you mean 
 ath o cleinias many things of old time were well said and the saying about the fates was one of them 
 cle what is it 
 ath the saying that lachesis or the giver of the lots is thefirst of them and that clotho or the spinster is the second ofthem and that atropos or the unchanging one is the third of them andthat she is the preserver of the things which we have spoken andwhich have been compared in a figure to things woven by fire theyboth atropos and the fire producing the quality ofunchangeableness i am speaking of the things which in a state andgovernment give not only health and salvation to the body but law orrather preservation of the law in the soul and if i am notmistaken this seems to be still wanting in our laws we have still tosee how we can implant in them this irreversible nature 
 cle it will be no small matter if we can only discover how such anature can be implanted in anything 
 ath but it certainly can be so much i clearly see 
 cle then let us not think of desisting until we have impartedthis quality to our laws for it is ridiculous after a great dealof labour has been spent to place a thing at last on an insecurefoundation 
 megillus i approve of your suggestion and am quite of the samemind with you 
 cle very good and now what according to you is to be thesalvation of our government and of our laws and how is it to beeffected 
 ath were we not saying that there must be in our city a councilwhich was to be of this ten oldest guardians of the law andall those who have obtained prizes of virtue were to meet in the sameassembly and the council was also to include those who had visitedforeign countries in the hope of hearing something that might be ofuse in the preservation of the laws and who having come safely having been tested in these same matters had proved themselves tobe worthy to take part in the of the members was toselect some young man of not less than thirty years of age he himselfjudging in the first instance whether the young man was worthy bynature and education and then suggesting him to the others and if heseemed to them also to be worthy they were to adopt him but if decision at which they arrived was to be kept a secret from thecitizens at large and more especially from the rejectedcandidate the meeting of the council was to be held early in themorning when everybody was most at leisure from all other public or not something of this sort said by usbefore 
 cle true 
 ath then returning to the council i would say further that if welet it down to be the anchor of the state our city having everythingwhich is suitable to her will preserve all that we wish to preserve 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath now is the time for me to speak the truth in all earnestness 
 cle well said and i hope that you will fulfil your intention 
 ath know cleinias that everything in all that it does has anatural saviour as of an animal the soul and the head are the chiefsaviours 
 cle once more what do you mean 
 ath the of those two is obviously the preservation ofevery living thing 
 cle how is that 
 ath the soul besides other things contains mind and the other things contains sight and hearing and the with the noblest of the senses and becoming one with be truly called the salvation of all 
 cle yes quite so 
 ath yes indeed but with what is that intellect concerned with the senses is the salvation of ships in storms aswell as in fair weather in a ship when the pilot and the sailorsunite their perceptions with the piloting mind do they not saveboth themselves and their craft 
 cle very true 
 ath we do not want many illustrations about such would the general of an army or what aim would a physicianpropose to himself if he were seeking to attain salvation 
 cle very good 
 ath does not the general aim at victory and superiority in war anddo not the physician and his assistants aim at producing health in thebody 
 cle certainly 
 ath and a physician who is ignorant about the body that is to knows not that which we just now called health or a general whoknows not victory or any others who are ignorant of the particularsof the arts which we mentioned cannot be said to have understandingabout any of these matters 
 cle they cannot 
 ath and what would you say of the state if a person proves to beignorant of the aim to which the statesman should look ought he inthe first place to be called a ruler at all further will he ever beable to preserve that of which he does not even know the aim 
 cle impossible 
 ath and therefore if our settlement of the country is to beperfect we ought to have some institution which as i was tell what is the aim of the state and will inform us how weare to attain this and what law or what man will advise us to thatend any state which has no such institution is likely to be devoid ofmind and sense and in all her actions will proceed by mere chance 
 cle very true 
 ath in which then of the parts or institutions of the state isany such guardian power to be found can we say 
 cle i am not quite certain stranger but i have a suspicion thatyou are referring to the assembly which you just now said was tomeet at night 
 ath you understand me perfectly cleinias and we must assume asthe argument iniplies that this council possesses all virtue and thebeginning of virtue is not to make mistakes by guessing many to look steadily at one thing and on this to fix all our aims 
 cle quite true 
 ath then now we shall see why there is nothing wonderful instates going reason is that their legislators have suchdifferent aims nor is there anything wonderful in some laying down astheir rule of justice that certain individuals should bear rule inthe state whether they be good or bad and others that the citizensshould be rich not caring whether they are the slaves of other men ornot the tendency of others again is towards freedom and somelegislate with a view to two things at want to be at thesame time free and the lords of other states but the wisest men asthey deem themselves to be look to all these and similar aims andthere is no one of them which they exclusively honour and to whichthey would have all things look 
 cle then stranger our former assertion will hold for we weresaying that laws generally should look to one thing only and this aswe admitted was rightly said to be virtue 
 ath yes 
 cle and we said that virtue was of four kinds 
 ath quite true 
 cle and that mind was the leader of the four and that to her thethree other virtues and all other things ought to have regard 
 ath you follow me capitally cleinias and i would ask you tofollow me to the end for we have already said that the mind of thepilot the mind of the physician and of the general look to that onething to which they ought to look and now we may turn to mindpolitical of which as of a human creature we will ask a being and to what are you looking the physician is able totell his single aim in life but you the superior as you declareyourself to be of all intelligent beings when you are asked arenot able to tell can you megillus and you cleinias say distinctlywhat is the aim of mind political in return for the many explanationsof things which i have given you 
 cle we cannot stranger 
 ath well but ought we not to desire to see it and to see whereit is to be found 
 cle for example where 
 ath for example we were saying that there are four kinds ofvirtue and as there are four of them each of them must be one 
 cle certainly 
 ath and further all four of them we call one for we say thatcourage is virtue and that prudence is virtue and the same of thetwo others as if they were in reality not many but one that 
 cle quite so 
 ath there is no difficulty in seeing in what way the two differfrom one another and have received two names and so of the rest butthere is more difficulty in explaining why we call these two and therest of them by the single name of virtue 
 cle how do you mean 
 ath i have no difficulty in explaining what i mean let usdistribute the subject questions and answers 
 cle once more what do you mean 
 ath ask me what is that one thing which call virtue and then againspeak of as two one part being courage and the other wisdom i willtell you how that of them has to do with fear in this thebeasts also participate and quite young mean a courageous temper is a gift of nature and not of reason butwithout reason there never has been or is or will be a wise andunderstanding soul it is of a different nature 
 cle that is true 
 ath i have now told you in what way the two are different and doyou in return tell me in what way they are one and the same supposethat i ask you in what way the four are one and when you haveanswered me you will have a right to ask of me in return in whatway they are four and then let us proceed to enquire whether in thecase of things which have a name and also a definition to them trueknowledge consists in knowing the name only and not the he who is good for anything be ignorant of all this withoutdiscredit where great and glorious truths are concerned 
 cle i suppose not 
 ath and is there anything greater to the legislator and theguardian of the law and to him who thinks that he excels all othermen in virtue and has won the palm of excellence that these veryqualities of which we are now temperance 
 cle how can there be anything greater 
 ath and ought not the interpreters the teachers the lawgivers theguardians of the other citizens to excel the rest of mankind andperfectly to show him who desires to learn and know or whose evilactions require to be punished and reproved what is the nature ofvirtue and vice or shall some poet who has found his way into thecity or some chance person who pretends to be an instructor of himself to be better than him who has won the prize for everyvirtue and can we wonder that when the guardians are not adequatein speech or action and have no adequate knowledge of virtue thecity being unguarded should experience the common fate of cities inour day 
 cle wonder no 
 ath well then must we do as we said or can we give our guardiansa more precise knowledge of virtue in speech and action than themany have or is there any way in which our city can be made toresemble the head and senses of rational beings because possessingsuch a guardian power 
 cle what stranger is the drift of your comparison 
 ath do we not see that the city is the trunk and are not theyounger guardians who are chosen for their natural gifts placed inthe head of the state having their souls all full of eyes with whichthey look about the whole city they keep watch and hand over theirperceptions to the memory and inform the elders of all that happensin the city and those whom we compared to the mind because they havemany wise is to say the old counsel and makinguse of the younger men as their ministers and advising with way both together truly preserve the whole this orsome other be the order of our state are all our citizens to be equalin acquirements or shall there be special persons among them who havereceived a more careful training and education 
 cle that they should be equal my good sir is impossible 
 ath then we ought to proceed to some more exact training than anywhich has preceded 
 cle certainly 
 ath and must not that of which we are in need be the one to whichwe were just now alluding 
 cle very true 
 ath did we not say that the workman or guardian if he be perfectin every respect ought not only to be able to see the many he should press onward to the one this he should know andknowing order all things with a view to it 
 cle true 
 ath and can any one have a more exact way of considering orcontemplating anything than the being able to look at one ideagathered from many different things 
 cle perhaps not 
 ath not perhaps not but certainly not my good sir is theright answer there never has been a truer method than this discoveredby any man 
 cle i bow to your authority stranger let us proceed in the waywhich you propose 
 ath then as would appear we must compel the guardians of ourdivine state to perceive in the first place what that principle iswhich is the same in all the same as we affirm in courageand in temperance and in justice and in prudence and which beingone we call as we ought by the single name of virtue to this myfriends we will if you please hold fast and not let go until wehave sufficiently explained what that is to which we are to to be regarded as one or as a whole or as both or inwhatever way are we likely ever to be in a virtuous condition ifwe cannot tell whether virtue is many or four or one we take counsel among ourselves we shall in some way contrive thatthis principle has a place amongst us but if you have made up yourmind that we should let the matter alone we will 
 cle we must not stranger by the god of strangers i swear thatwe must not for in our opinion you speak most truly but we shouldlike to know how you will accomplish your purpose 
 ath wait a little before you ask and let us first of all bequite agreed with one another that the purpose has to be accomplished 
 cle certainly it ought to be if it can be 
 ast well and about the good and the honourable are we to take thesame view are our guardians only to know that each of them is also how and in what way they are one 
 cle they must consider also in what sense they are one 
 ath and are they to consider only and to be unable to set forthwhat they think 
 cle certainly not that would be the state of a slave 
 ath and may not the same be said of all good the trueguardians of the laws ought to know the truth about them and to beable to interpret them in words and carry them out in action judgingof what is and what is not well according to nature 
 cle certainly 
 ath is not the knowledge of the gods which we have set forth withso much zeal one of the noblest sorts of know thatthey are and know how great is their power as far as in man lies doindeed excuse the mass of the citizens who only follow the voice ofthe laws but we refuse to admit as guardians any who do not labour toobtain every possible evidence that there is respecting the city is forbidden and not allowed to choose as a guardian of thelaw or to place in the select order of virtue him who is not aninspired man and has not laboured at these things 
 cle it is certainly just as you say that he who is indolent aboutsuch matters or incapable should be rejected and that thingshonourable should be put away from him 
 ath are we assured that there are two things which lead men tobelieve in the gods as we have already stated 
 cle what are they 
 ath one is the argument about the soul which has been it is the eldest and most divine of all things towhich motion attaining generation gives perpetual existence the otherwas an argument from the order of the motion of the stars and ofall things under the dominion of the mind which ordered theuniverse if a man look upon the world not lightly or was never any one so godless who did not experience an effectopposite to that which the many imagine for they think that those whohandle these matters by the help of astronomy and the accompanyingarts of demonstration may become godless because they see as far asthey can see things happening by necessity and not by an intelligentwill accomplishing good 
 cle but what is the fact 
 ath just the opposite as i said of the opinion which onceprevailed among men that the sun and stars are without soul evenin those days men wondered about them and that which is nowascertained was then conjectured by some who had a more exactknowledge of if they had been things without soul and hadno mind they could never have moved with numerical exactness sowonderful and even at that time some ventured to hazard theconjecture that mind was the orderer of the universe but these samepersons again mistaking the nature of the soul which they conceivedto be younger and not older than the body once more overturned theworld or rather i should say themselves for the bodies whichthey saw moving in heaven all appeared to be full of stones andearth and many other lifeless substances and to these theyassigned the causes of all things such studies gave rise to muchatheism and perplexity and the poets took occasion to the philosophers to uttering vain talking other nonsense of the same sort but now as i said thecase is reversed 
 cle how so 
 ath no man can be a true worshipper of the gods who does not knowthese two the soul is the eldest of all things whichare born and is immortal and rules over all bodies moreover as ihave now said several times he who has not contemplated the mind ofnature which is said to exist in the stars and gone through theprevious training and seen the connection of music with these harmonized them all with laws and institutions is not able togive a reason of such things as have a reason and he who is unable toacquire this in addition to the ordinary virtues of a citizen canhardly be a good ruler of a whole state but he should be thesubordinate of other rulers wherefore cleinias and megillus letus consider whether we may not add to all the other laws which we havediscussed this further the nocturnal assembly of themagistrates which has also shared in the whole scheme of educationproposed by us shall be a guard set according to law for thesalvation of the state shall we propose this 
 cle certainly my good friend we will if the thing is in anydegree possible 
 ath let us make a common effort to gain such an object for i toowill gladly share in the attempt of these matters i have had muchexperience and have often considered them and i dare say that ishall be able to find others who will also help 
 cle i agree stranger that we should proceed along the road inwhich god is guiding us and how we can proceed rightly has now tobe investigated and explained 
 ath o megillus and cleinias about these matters we cannotlegislate further until the council is constituted when that is we will determine what authority they shall have of their the explanation of how this is all to be ordered would only begiven rightly in a long discourse 
 cle what do you mean and what new thing is this 
 ath in the first place a list would have to be made out of thosewho by their ages and studies and dispositions and habits are wellfitted for the duty of a guardian in the next place it will not beeasy for them to discover themselves what they ought to learn orbecome the disciple of one who has already made the to write down the times at which and during ought to receive the several kinds of instruction would be avain thing for the learners themselves do not know what is learned toadvantage until the knowledge which is the result of learning hasfound a place in the soul of each and so these details although theycould not be truly said to be secret might be said to be incapable ofbeing stated beforehand because when stated they would have nomeaning 
 cle what then are we to do stranger under these circumstances 
 ath as the proverb says the answer is no secret but open to allof must risk the whole on the chance of throwing as theysay thrice six or thrice ace and i am willing to share with youthe danger by stating and explaining to you my views about educationand nurture which is the question coming to the surface again thedanger is not a slight or ordinary one and i would advise in particular to see to the matter for if you orderrightly the city of the magnetes or whatever name god may give will obtain the greatest glory or at any rate you will be thoughtthe most courageous of men in the estimation of posterity dearcompanions if this our divine assembly can only be established tothem we will hand over the city none of the present company oflegislators as i may call them would hesitate about that and thestate will be perfected and become a waking reality which a littlewhile ago we attempted to create as a dream and in idea only minglingtogether reason and mind in one image in the hope that our citizensmight be duly mingled and rightly educated and being educated anddwelling in the citadel of the land might become perfect as we have never seen in all our previous life by reason ofthe saving virtue which is in them 
 meg dear cleinias after all that has been said either we mustdetain the stranger and by supplications and in all manner of waysmake him share in the foundation of the city or we must give up theundertaking 
 cle very true megillus and you must join with me in detaininghim 
 meg i will

 the first creature of god in the works of the days was the light of the sense 
 the last was the light of reason and his sabbath work ever since is the 
 illumination of his spirit first he breathed light upon the face of the matter or 
 chaos then he breathed light into the face of man and still he breatheth and 
 inspireth light into the face of his chosen the poet that beautified the sect 
 that was otherwise inferior to the rest saith yet excellently well it is a pleasure 
 to stand upon the shore and to see ships tossed upon the sea a pleasure to stand in the window of a castle and to see a battle and the adventures thereof below but no pleasure is comparable to the standing upon the vantage ground of truth a hill not to be commanded and where the air is always clear and serene and to see the errors and wanderings and mists and tempests in the vale below so always that this prospect be with pity and not with swelling or pride certainly it is heaven upon earth to have a mind move in charity rest in providence and turn upon the poles of truth to pass from theological and philosophical truth to the truth of civil business it will be acknowledged even by those mat practise it not that clear and round dealing is the honour of nature and that mixture of falsehood is like allay in coin of gold and silver which may make the metal work the better but it embaseth it for these winding and crooked courses are the goings of the serpent which goeth basely upon the belly and not upon the feet there is no vice that doth so cover a man with shame as to be found false and perfidious and therefore mountaigny saith prettily when he enquired the reason why the word of the lie should be such a disgrace and such an odious charge saith he if it be well weighed to 
 lay that a man lieth is as much to say as mat he is brave towards god and a coward towards men for a lie faces god and shrinks from man surely the wickedness of falsehoods and breach of faith cannot possibly be so highly expressed as in mat it shall be the last peal to call the judgements of god upon the generations of men it being foretold that when christ cometh he shall not find faith upon the earth

 book one 
 chapter i 
 
 well prince so genoa and lucca are now just family estates of the buonapartes but i warn you if you tell me that this means war if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that antichrist i really believe he is antichrist i will have nothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend no longer my faithful slave as you call yourself but how do you do i see i have frightened you sit down and tell me all the news 
 it was in july and the speaker was the anna pavlovna scherer maid of honor and favorite of the empress marya fedorovna with these words she greeted prince vasili kuragin a man of high rank and importance who was the first to arrive at her reception anna pavlovna had had a cough for some days she was as she said suffering from la grippe grippe being then a new word in st petersburg used only by the elite 
 all her invitations without exception written in french and delivered by a footman that morning ran as follows 
 if you have nothing better to do count or prince and if the prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible i shall be very charmed to see you tonight between and annette scherer 
 heavens what a virulent attack replied the prince not in the least disconcerted by this reception he had just entered wearing an embroidered court uniform knee breeches and shoes and had stars on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face he spoke in that refined french in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought and with the gentle patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance who had grown old in society and at court he went up to anna pavlovna kissed her hand presenting to her his bald scented and shining head and complacently seated himself on the sofa 
 first of all dear friend tell me how you are set your mind at rest said he without altering his tone beneath the politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be discerned 
 can one be well while suffering morally can one be calm in times like these if one has any feeling said anna pavlovna you are staying the whole evening i hope 
 and the fete at the english today is wednesday i must put in an appearance there said the prince my daughter is coming for me to take me there 
 i thought fete had been canceled i confess all these festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome 
 if they had known that you wished it the entertainment would have been put off said the prince who like a clock by force of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed 
 tease well and what has been decided about dispatch you know everything 
 what can one say about it replied the prince in a cold listless tone what has been decided they have decided that buonaparte has burnt his boats and i believe that we are ready to burn ours 
 prince vasili always spoke languidly like an actor repeating a stale part anna pavlovna scherer on the contrary despite her forty years overflowed with animation and impulsiveness to be an enthusiast had become her social vocation and sometimes even when she did not feel like it she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the expectations of those who knew her the subdued smile which though it did not suit her faded features always played round her lips expressed as in a spoiled child a continual consciousness of her charming defect which she neither wished nor could nor considered it necessary to correct 
 in the midst of a conversation on political matters anna pavlovna burst out 
 oh speak to me of austria perhaps i understand things but austria never has wished and does not wish for war she is betraying us russia alone must save europe our gracious sovereign recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it that is the one thing i have faith in our good and wonderful sovereign has to perform the noblest role on earth and he is so virtuous and noble that god will not forsake him he will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra of revolution which has become more terrible than ever in the person of this murderer and villain we alone must avenge the blood of the just one whom i ask you can we rely on england with her commercial spirit will not and cannot understand the emperor loftiness of soul she has refused to evacuate malta she wanted to find and still seeks some secret motive in our actions what answer did novosiltsev get none the english have not understood and cannot understand the of our emperor who wants nothing for himself but only desires the good of mankind and what have they promised nothing and what little they have promised they will not perform prussia has always declared that buonaparte is invincible and that all europe is powerless before him and i believe a word that hardenburg says or haugwitz either this famous prussian neutrality is just a trap i have faith only in god and the lofty destiny of our adored monarch he will save europe 
 she suddenly paused smiling at her own impetuosity 
 i think said the prince with a smile that if you had been sent instead of our dear wintzingerode you would have captured the king of consent by assault you are so eloquent will you give me a cup of tea 
 in a moment a propos she added becoming calm again i am expecting two very interesting men tonight le vicomte de mortemart who is connected with the montmorencys through the rohans one of the best french families he is one of the genuine emigres the good ones and also the abbe morio do you know that profound thinker he has been received by the emperor had you heard 
 i shall be delighted to meet them said the prince but tell me he added with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurred to him though the question he was about to ask was the chief motive of his visit is it true that the dowager empress wants baron funke to be appointed first secretary at vienna the baron by all accounts is a poor creature 
 prince vasili wished to obtain this post for his son but others were trying through the dowager empress marya fedorovna to secure it for the baron 
 anna pavlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor anyone else had a right to criticize what the empress desired or was pleased with 
 baron funke has been recommended to the dowager empress by her sister was all she said in a dry and mournful tone 
 as she named the empress anna face suddenly assumed an expression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with sadness and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious patroness she added that her majesty had deigned to show baron funke beaucoup and again her face clouded over with sadness 
 the prince was silent and looked indifferent but with the womanly and courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her anna pavlovna wished both to rebuke him for daring to speak he had done of a man recommended to the empress and at the same time to console him so she said 
 now about your family do you know that since your daughter came out everyone has been enraptured by her they say she is amazingly beautiful 
 the prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude 
 i often think she continued after a short pause drawing nearer to the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political and social topics were ended and the time had come for intimate conversation i often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life are distributed why has fate given you two such splendid children i speak of anatole your youngest i like him she added in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows two such charming children and really you appreciate them less than anyone and so you deserve to have them 
 and she smiled her ecstatic smile 
 i help it said the prince lavater would have said i lack the bump of paternity 
 joke i mean to have a serious talk with you do you know i am dissatisfied with your younger son between ourselves and her face assumed its melancholy expression he was mentioned at her and you were pitied 
 the prince answered nothing but she looked at him significantly awaiting a reply he frowned 
 what would you have me do he said at last you know i did all a father could for their education and they have both turned out fools hippolyte is at least a quiet fool but anatole is an active one that is the only difference between them he said this smiling in a way more natural and animated than usual so that the wrinkles round his mouth very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse and unpleasant 
 and why are children born to such men as you if you were not a father there would be nothing i could reproach you with said anna pavlovna looking up pensively 
 i am your faithful slave and to you alone i can confess that my children are the bane of my life it is the cross i have to bear that is how i explain it to myself it be helped 
 he said no more but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a gesture anna pavlovna meditated 
 have you never thought of marrying your prodigal son anatole she asked they say old maids have a mania for matchmaking and though i feel that weakness in myself as know a little person who is very unhappy with her father she is a relation of yours princess mary bolkonskaya 
 prince vasili did not reply though with the quickness of memory and perception befitting a man of the world he indicated by a movement of the head that he was considering this information 
 do you know he said at last evidently unable to check the sad current of his thoughts that anatole is costing me forty thousand rubles a year and he went on after a pause what will it be in five years if he goes on like this presently he added what we fathers have to put up with is this princess of yours rich 
 her father is very rich and stingy he lives in the country he is the prince bolkonski who had to retire from the army under the late emperor and was nicknamed the king of prussia he is very clever but eccentric and a bore the poor girl is very unhappy she has a brother i think you know him he married lise meinen lately he is an of and will be here tonight 
 listen dear annette said the prince suddenly taking anna hand and for some reason drawing it downwards arrange that affair for me and i shall always be your most devoted slave slafe wigh an f as a village elder of mine writes in his reports she is rich and of good family and all i want 
 and with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him he raised the maid of hand to his lips kissed it and swung it to and fro as he lay back in his armchair looking in another direction 
 attendez said anna pavlovna reflecting speak to lise young wife this very evening and perhaps the thing can be arranged it shall be on your behalf that start my apprenticeship as old maid

 the prince was silent and looked indifferent but with the womanly and courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her anna pavlovna wished both to rebuke him for daring to speak he had done of a man recommended to the empress and at the same time to console him so she said 
 now about your family do you know that since your daughter came out everyone has been enraptured by her they say she is amazingly beautiful 
 the prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude 
 i often think she continued after a short pause drawing nearer to the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political and social topics were ended and the time had come for intimate conversation i often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life are distributed why has fate given you two such splendid children i speak of anatole your youngest i like him she added in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows two such charming children and really you appreciate them less than anyone and so you deserve to have them 
 and she smiled her ecstatic smile 
 i help it said the prince lavater would have said i lack the bump of paternity 
 joke i mean to have a serious talk with you do you know i am dissatisfied with your younger son between ourselves and her face assumed its melancholy expression he was mentioned at her and you were pitied 
 the prince answered nothing but she looked at him significantly awaiting a reply he frowned 
 what would you have me do he said at last you know i did all a father could for their education and they have both turned out fools hippolyte is at least a quiet fool but anatole is an active one that is the only difference between them he said this smiling in a way more natural and animated than usual so that the wrinkles round his mouth very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse and unpleasant 
 and why are children born to such men as you if you were not a father there would be nothing i could reproach you with said anna pavlovna looking up pensively 
 i am your faithful slave and to you alone i can confess that my children are the bane of my life it is the cross i have to bear that is how i explain it to myself it be helped 
 he said no more but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a gesture anna pavlovna meditated 
 have you never thought of marrying your prodigal son anatole she asked they say old maids have a mania for matchmaking and though i feel that weakness in myself as know a little person who is very unhappy with her father she is a relation of yours princess mary bolkonskaya 
 prince vasili did not reply though with the quickness of memory and perception befitting a man of the world he indicated by a movement of the head that he was considering this information 
 do you know he said at last evidently unable to check the sad current of his thoughts that anatole is costing me forty thousand rubles a year and he went on after a pause what will it be in five years if he goes on like this presently he added what we fathers have to put up with is this princess of yours rich 
 her father is very rich and stingy he lives in the country he is the prince bolkonski who had to retire from the army under the late emperor and was nicknamed the king of prussia he is very clever but eccentric and a bore the poor girl is very unhappy she has a brother i think you know him he married lise meinen lately he is an of and will be here tonight 
 listen dear annette said the prince suddenly taking anna hand and for some reason drawing it downwards arrange that affair for me and i shall always be your most devoted slave slafe wigh an f as a village elder of mine writes in his reports she is rich and of good family and all i want 
 and with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him he raised the maid of hand to his lips kissed it and swung it to and fro as he lay back in his armchair looking in another direction 
 attendez said anna pavlovna reflecting speak to lise young wife this very evening and perhaps the thing can be arranged it shall be on your behalf that start my apprenticeship as old maid

 i have just returned from a visit to my solitary neighbour that i shall be troubled with this is certainly a beautiful country in all england i do not believe that i could have fixed on a situation so completely removed from the stir of society a perfect heaven and mr heathcliff and i are such a suitable pair to divide the desolation between us a capital fellow he little imagined how my heart warmed towards him when i beheld his black eyes withdraw so suspiciously under their brows as i rode up and when his fingers sheltered themselves with a jealous resolution still farther in his waistcoat as i announced my name 
 mr heathcliff i said 
 a nod was the answer 
 mr lockwood your new tenant sir i do myself the honour of calling as soon as possible after my arrival to express the hope that i have not inconvenienced you by my perseverance in soliciting the occupation of thrushcross grange i heard yesterday you had had some thoughts 
 thrushcross grange is my own sir he interrupted wincing i should not allow anyone to inconvenience me if i could hinder in 
 the walk in was uttered with closed teeth and expressed the sentiment go to the deuce even the gate over which he leant manifested no sympathizing movement to the words and i think that circumstance determined me to accept the invitation i felt interested in a man who seemed more exaggeratedly reserved than myself 
 when he saw my breast fairly pushing the barrier he did put out his hand to unchain it and then sullenly preceded me up the causeway calling as we entered the court joseph take mr horse and bring up some wine 
 here we have the whole establishment of domestics i suppose was the reflection suggested by this compound order 
 no wonder the grass grows up between the flags and cattle are the only 
 joseph was an elderly nay an old man very old perhaps though hale and sinewy the lord help us he soliloquized in an undertone of peevish displeasure while relieving me of my horse looking meantime in my face so sourly that i charitably conjectured he must have need of divine aid to digest his dinner and his pious ejaculation had no reference to my unexpected advent 
 wuthering heights is the name of mr dwelling wuthering being a significant provincial adjective descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather pure bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times indeed one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way as if craving alms of the sun happily the architect had foresight to build it strong the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall and the corners defended with large jutting stones 
 before passing the threshold i paused to admire a quantity of grotesque carving lavished over the front and especially about the principal door above which among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless little boys i detected the date and the name hareton earnshaw i would have made a few comments and requested a short history of the place from the surly owner but his attitude at the door appeared to demand my speedy entrance or complete departure and i had no desire to aggravate his impatience previous to inspecting the penetralium 
 one step brought us into the family without any introductory lobby or passage they call it here the house preeminently it includes kitchen and parlour generally but i believe at wuthering heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter at least i distinguished a chatter of tongues and a clatter of culinary utensils deep within and i observed no signs of roasting boiling or baking about the huge fireplace nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls one end indeed reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes interspersed with silver jugs and tankards towering row after row on a vast oak dresser to the very roof the latter had never been underdrawn its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef mutton and ham concealed it above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns and a couple of and by way of ornament three gaudily painted canisters disposed along its ledge the floor was of smooth white stone the chairs primitive structures painted green one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade in an arch under the dresser reposed a huge bitch pointer surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies and other dogs haunted other recesses 
 the apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as belonging to a homely northern farmer with a stubborn countenance and stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee breeches and gaiters such an individual seated in his armchair his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills if you go at the right time after dinner but mr heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living he is a gipsy in aspect in dress and manners a gentleman that is as much a gentleman as many a country squire rather slovenly perhaps yet not looking amiss with his negligence because he has an erect and handsome figure and rather morose possibly some people might suspect him of a degree of pride i have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort i know by instinct his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of manifestations of mutual kindliness love and hate equally under cover and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again no running on too fast i bestow my own attributes over liberally on him mr heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a acquaintance to those which actuate me let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar my dear mother used to say i should never have a comfortable home and only last summer i proved myself perfectly unworthy of one 
 while enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea coast i was thrown into the company of a most fascinating creature a real goddess in my eyes as long as she took no notice of me i never told my love vocally still if looks have language the merest idiot might have guessed i was over head and ears she understood me at last and looked a sweetest of all imaginable looks and what did i do i confess it with icily into myself like a snail at every glance retired colder and further till finally the poor innocent was led to doubt her own senses and overwhelmed with confusion at her supposed mistake persuaded her mamma to decamp by this curious turn of disposition i have gained the reputation of deliberate heartlessness how undeserved i alone can appreciate 
 i took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which my landlord advanced and filled up an interval of silence by attempting to caress the canine mother who had left her nursery and was sneaking wolfishly to the back of my legs her lip curled up and her white teeth watering for a snatch my caress provoked a long guttural gnarl 
 better let the dog alone growled mr heathcliff in unison checking fiercer demonstrations with a punch of his foot not accustomed to be kept for a pet then striding to a side door he shouted again joseph 
 joseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar but gave no intimation of ascending so his master dived down to him leaving me the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements not anxious to come in contact with their fangs i sat still but imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults i unfortunately indulged in winking and making faces at the trio and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees i flung her back and hastened to interpose the table between us this proceeding roused the whole hive half a dozen fiends of various sizes and ages issued from hidden dens to the common centre i felt my heels and peculiar subjects of assault and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as i could with the poker i was constrained to demand aloud assistance from some of the household in peace 
 mr heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious phlegm i think they moved one second faster than usual though the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping happily an inhabitant of the kitchen made more dispatch a lusty dame with gown bare arms and cheeks rushed into the midst of us flourishing a and used that weapon and her tongue to such purpose that the storm subsided magically and she only remained heaving like a sea after a high wind when her master entered on the scene

 christmas be christmas without any presents grumbled jo lying on the rug 
 so dreadful to be poor sighed meg looking down at her old dress 
 i think fair for some girls to have plenty of pretty things and other girls nothing at all added little amy with an injured got father and mother and each other said beth contentedly from her corner 
 the four young faces on which the firelight shone brightened at the cheerful words but darkened again as jo said sadly we got father and shall not have him for a long time she say perhaps never but each silently added it thinking of father far away where the fighting was 
 nobody spoke for a minute then meg said in an altered tone you know the reason mother proposed not having any presents this christmas was because it is going to be a hard winter for everyone and she thinks we ought not to spend money for pleasure when our men are suffering so in the army we do much but we can make our little sacrifices and ought to do it gladly but i am afraid i and meg shook her head as she thought regretfully of all the pretty things she wanted 
 but i think the little we should spend would do any good each got a dollar and the army be much helped by our giving that i agree not to expect anything from mother or you but i do want to buy undine and sintram for myself wanted it so long said jo who was a bookworm 
 i planned to spend mine in new music said beth with a little sigh which no one heard but the hearth brush and kettle holder 
 i shall get a nice box of drawing pencils i really need them said amy decidedly 
 mother say anything about our money and she wish us to give up everything each buy what we want and have a little fun sure we work hard enough to earn it cried jo examining the heels of her shoes in a gentlemanly manner 
 i know i those tiresome children nearly all day when longing to enjoy myself at home began meg in the complaining tone again 
 you have half such a hard time as i do said jo how would you like to be shut up for hours with a nervous fussy old lady who keeps you trotting is never satisfied and worries you till you ready to fly out the window or cry 
 naughty to fret but i do think washing dishes and keeping things tidy is the worst work in the world it makes me cross and my hands get so stiff i practice well at all and beth looked at her rough hands with a sigh that any one could hear that time 
 i believe any of you suffer as i do cried amy for you have to go to school with impertinent girls who plague you if you know your lessons and laugh at your dresses and label your father if he rich and insult you when your nose nice 
 if you mean libel say so and not talk about labels as if papa was a pickle bottle advised jo laughing 
 i know what i mean and you be statirical about it proper to use good words and improve your vocabilary returned amy with dignity 
 peck at one another children you wish we had the money papa lost when we were little jo dear me how happy and good be if we had no worries said meg who could remember better times 
 you said the other day you thought we were a deal happier than the king children for they were fighting and fretting all the time in spite of their money 
 so i did beth well i think we are for though we do have to work we make fun of ourselves and are a pretty jolly set as jo would say 
 jo does use such slang words observed amy with a reproving look at the long figure stretched on the rug 
 o immediately sat up put her hands in her pockets and began to whistle 
 jo so boyish 
 why i do it 
 i detest rude unladylike girls 
 i hate affected chits 
 birds in their little nests agree sang beth the peacemaker with such a funny face that both sharp voices softened to a laugh and the pecking ended for that time 
 really girls you are both to be blamed said meg beginning to lecture in her are old enough to leave off boyish tricks and to behave better josephine it matter so much when you were a little girl but now you are so tall and turn up your hair you should remember that you are a young lady 
 not and if turning up my hair makes me one wear it in two tails till twenty cried jo pulling off her net and shaking down a chestnut mane i hate to think got to grow up and be miss march and wear long gowns and look as prim as a china aster bad enough to be a girl anyway when i like games and work and manners i get over my disappointment in not being a boy and worse than ever now for dying to go and fight with papa and i can only stay home and knit like a poky old woman 
 and jo shook the blue army sock till the needles rattled like castanets and her ball bounded across the room 
 poor jo too bad but it be helped so you must try to be contented with making your name boyish and playing brother to us girls said beth stroking the rough head with a hand that all the dish washing and dusting in the world could not make ungentle in its touch 
 as for you amy continued meg you are altogether to particular and prim your airs are funny now but grow up an affected little goose if you take care i i like your nice manners and refined ways of speaking when you try to be elegant but your absurd words are as bad as slang 
 if jo is a tomboy and amy a goose what am i please asked beth ready to share the lecture 
 a dear and nothing else answered meg warmly and no one contradicted her for the mouse was the pet of the family 
 as young readers like to know how people look we will take this moment to give them a little sketch of the four sisters who sat knitting away in the twilight while the december snow fell quietly without and the fire crackled cheerfully within it was a comfortable room though the carpet was faded and the furniture very plain for a good picture or two hung on the walls books filled the recesses chrysanthemums and christmas roses bloomed in the windows and a pleasant atmosphere of home peace pervaded it 
 margaret the eldest of the four was sixteen and very pretty being plump and fair with large eyes plenty of soft brown hair a sweet mouth and white hands of which she was rather vain fifteen jo was very tall thin and brown and reminded one of a colt for she never seemed to know what to do with her long limbs which were very much in her way she had a decided mouth a comical nose and sharp gray eyes which appeared to see everything and were by turns fierce funny or thoughtful her long thick hair was her one beauty but it was usually bundled into a net to be out of her way round shoulders had jo big hands and feet a flyaway look to her clothes and the uncomfortable appearance of a girl who was rapidly shooting up into a woman and like it elizabeth or beth as everyone called her was a rosy smooth haired girl of thirteen with a shy manner a timid voice and a peaceful expression which was seldom disturbed her father called her little miss tranquility and the name suited her excellently for she seemed to live in a happy world of her own only venturing out to meet the few whom she trusted and loved amy though the youngest was a most important person in her own opinion at least a regular snow maiden with blue eyes and yellow hair curling on her shoulders pale and slender and always carrying herself like a young lady mindful of her manners what the characters of the four sisters were we will leave to be found out 
 the clock struck six and having swept up the hearth beth put a pair of slippers down to warm somehow the sight of the old shoes had a good effect upon the girls for mother was coming and everyone brightened to welcome her meg stopped lecturing and lighted the lamp amy got out of the easy chair without being asked and jo forgot how tired she was as she sat up to hold the slippers nearer to the blaze 
 they are quite worn out marmee must have a new pair 
 i thought get her some with my dollar said beth 
 no i shall cried amy 
 the oldest began meg but jo cut in with a decided the man of the family now papa is away and i shall provide the slippers for he told me to take special care of mother while he was gone 
 tell you what do said beth each get her something for christmas land not get anything for ourselves 
 like you dear what will we get exclaimed jo 
 everyone thought soberly for a minute then meg announced as if the idea was suggested by the sight of her own pretty hands i shall give her a nice pair of gloves 
 army shoes best to be had cried jo some handkerchiefs all hemmed said beth 
 get a little bottle of cologne she likes it and it cost much so have some left to buy my pencils added amy 
 how will we give the things asked meg 
 put them on the table and bring her in and see her open the bundles you remember how we used to do on our birthdays answered jo 
 i used to be so frightened when it was my turn to sit in the chair with the crown on and see you all come marching round to give the presents with a kiss i liked the things and the kisses but it was dreadful to have you sit looking at me while i opened the bundles said beth who was toasting her face and the bread for tea at the same time 
 let marmee think we are getting things for ourselves and then surprise her we must go shopping tomorrow afternoon meg there is so much to do about the play for christmas night said jo marching up and down with her hands behind her back and her nose in the air 
 i mean to act any more after this time getting too old for such things observed meg who was as much a child as ever about frolics 
 you stop i know as long as you can trail round in a white gown with your hair down and wear jewelryyou are the best actress got and be an end of everything if you quit the boards said jo we ought to rehearse tonight come here amy and do the fainting scene for you are as stiff as a poker in that 
 i help it i never saw anyone faint and i choose to make myself all black and blue tumbling flat as you do if i can go down easily drop if i i shall fall into a chair and be graceful i care if hugo does come at me with a pistol returned amy who was not gifted with dramatic power but was chosen because she was small enough to be borne out shrieking by the villain of the piece 
 do it this way clasp your hands so and stagger across the room crying frantically roderigo save me save me and away went jo with a melodramatic scream which was truly thrilling 
 amy followed but she poked her hands out stiffly before her and jerked herself along as if she went by machinery and her ow was more suggestive of pins being run into her than of fear and anguish jo gave a despairing groan and meg laughed outright while beth let her bread burn as she watched the fun with interest no use do the best you can when the time comes and if the audience laughs blame me come on meg 
 then things went smoothly for don pedro defied the world in a speech of two pages without a single break hagar the witch chanted an awful incantation over her kettleful of simmering toads with weird effect roderigo rent his chains asunder manfully and hugo died in agonies of remorse and arsenic with a wild ha ha 
 the best had yet said meg as the dead villain sat up and rubbed his elbows 
 i see how you can write and act such splendid things jo a regular shakespeare exclaimed beth who firmly believed that her sisters were gifted with wonderful genius in all things 
 not quite replied jo modestly i do think the witches curse an operatic tragedy is rather a nice thing but like to try mcbeth if we only had a trapdoor for banquo i always wanted to do the killing part is that a dagger that i see before me muttered jo rolling her eyes and clutching at the air as she had seen a famous tragedian do 
 no the toasting fork with shoe on it instead of the bread cried meg and the rehearsal ended in a general burst of laughter 
 glad to find you so merry my girls said a cheery voice at the door and actors and audience turned to welcome a tall motherly lady with a can i help you look about her which was truly delightful she was not elegantly dressed but a woman and the girls thought the gray cloak and unfashionable bonnet covered the most splendid mother in the world 
 well dearies how have you got on today there was so much to do getting the boxes ready to go tomorrow that i come home to dinner has anyone called beth how is your cold meg jo you look tired to death come and kiss me baby 
 while making these maternal inquiries mrs march got her wet things off her warm slippers on and sitting down in the easy chair drew amy to her lap preparing to enjoy the happiest hour of her busy day the girls flew about trying to make things comfortable each in her own way meg arranged the tea table jo brought wood and set chairs dropping and clattering everything she touched beth trotted to and fro between parlor kitchen quiet and busy while amy gave directions to everyone as she sat with her hands folded 
 as they gathered about the table mrs march said with a particularly happy face got a treat for you after supper 
 a quick bright smile went round like a streak of sunshine beth clapped her hands regardless of the biscuit she held and jo tossed up her napkin crying a letter a letter three cheers for father 
 yes a nice long letter he is well and thinks he shall get through the cold season better than we feared he sends all sorts of loving wishes for christmas and an especial message to you girls said mrs march patting her pocket as if she had got a treasure there 
 hurry and get done stop to quirk your little finger and simper over your plate amy cried jo choking on her tea and dropping her bread butter side down on the carpet in her haste to get at the treat 
 beth ate no more but crept away to sit in her shadowy corner and brood over the delight to come till the others were ready 
 i think it was so splendid in father to go as chaplain when he was too old to be drafted and not strong enough for a soldier said meg warmly 
 i wish i could go as a drummer a its name or a nurse so i could be near him and help him exclaimed jo with a groan 
 it must be very disagreeable to sleep in a tent and eat all sorts of things and drink out of a tin mug sighed amy 
 when will he come home marmee asked beth with a little quiver in her voice 
 not for many months dear unless he is sick he will stay and do his work faithfully as long as he can and we ask for him back a minute sooner than he can be spared now come and hear the letter 
 they all drew to the fire mother in the big chair with beth at her feet meg and amy perched on either arm of the chair and jo leaning on the back where no one would see any sign of emotion if the letter should happen to be touching very few letters were written in those hard times that were not touching especially those which fathers sent home in this one little was said of the hardships endured the dangers faced or the homesickness conquered it was a cheerful hopeful letter full of lively descriptions of camp life marches and military news and only at the end did the heart with fatherly love and longing for the little girls at home 
 give them all of my dear love and a kiss tell them i think of them by day pray for them by night and find my best comfort in their affection at all times a year seems very long to wait before i see them but remind them that while we wait we may all work so that these hard days need not be wasted i know they will remember all i said to them that they will be loving children to you will do their duty faithfully fight their bosom enemies bravely and conquer themselves so beautifully that when i come back to them i may be fonder and prouder than ever of my little women everybody sniffed when they came to that part jo ashamed of the great tear that dropped off the end of her nose and amy never minded the rumpling of her curls as she hid her face on her shoulder and sobbed out i am a selfish girl but truly try to be better so he be disappointed in me 
 we all will cried meg i think too much of my looks and hate to work but any more if i can help it 
 try and be what he loves to call me a little woman and not be rough and wild but do my duty here instead of wanting to be somewhere else said jo thinking that keeping her temper at home was a much harder task than facing a rebel or two down south 
 beth said nothing but wiped away her tears with the blue army sock and began to knit with all her might losing no time in doing the duty that lay nearest her while she resolved in her quiet little soul to be all that father hoped to find her when the year brought round the happy coming home 
 mrs march broke the silence that followed words by saying in her cheery voice do you remember how you used to play pilgrims progress when you were little things nothing delighted you more than to have me tie my piece bags on your backs for burdens give you hats and sticks and rolls of paper and let you travel through the house from the cellar which was the city of destruction up up to the housetop where you had all the lovely things you could collect to make a celestial city 
 what fun it was especially going by the lions fighting apollyon and passing through the valley where the were said jo 
 i liked the place where the bundles fell off and tumbled downstairs said meg 
 i remember much about it except that i was afraid of the cellar and the dark entry and always liked the cake and milk we had up at the top if i too old for such things rather like to play it over again said amy who began to talk of renouncing childish things at the mature age of twelve 
 we never are too old for this my dear because it is a play we are playing all the time in one way or another out burdens are here our road is before us and the longing for goodness and happiness is the guide that leads us through many troubles and mistakes to the peace which is a true celestial city now my little pilgrims suppose you begin again not in play but in earnest and see how far on you can get before father comes home 
 really mother where are our bundles asked amy who was a very literal young lady 
 each of you told what your burden was just now except beth i rather think she got any said her mother 
 yes i have mine is dishes and dusters and envying girls with nice pianos and being afraid of people 
 bundle was such a funny one that everybody wanted to laugh but nobody did for it would have hurt her feelings very much 
 let us do it said meg thoughtfully it is only another name for trying to be good and the story may help us for though we do want to be good hard work and we forget and do our best 
 we were in the slough of despond tonight and mother came and pulled us out as help did in the book we ought to have our roll of directions like christian what shall we do about that asked jo delighted with the fancy which lent a little romance to the very dull task of doing her duty 
 look under your pillows christmas morning and you will find your guidebook replied mrs march 
 they talked over the new plan while old hannah cleared the table then out came the four little work baskets and the needles flew as the girls made sheets for aunt march it was uninteresting sewing but tonight no one grumbled they adopted plan of dividing the long seams into four parts and calling the quarters europe asia africa and america and in that way got on capitally especially when they talked about the different countries as they stitched their way through them 
 at nine they stopped work and sang as usual before they went to bed no one but beth could get much music out of the old piano but she had a way of softly touching the yellow keys and making a pleasant accompaniment to the simple songs they sang meg had a voice like a flute and she and herr mother led the little choir amy chirped like a cricket and jo wandered through the airs at her own sweet will always coming out at the wrong place with a croak or a quaver that spoiled the most pensive tune they had always done this from the time they could lisp 
 crinkle crinkle ittle tar and it had become a household custom for the mother was a born singer the first sound in the morning was her voice as she went about the house singing like a lark and the last sound at night was the same cheery sound for the girls never grew too old for that familiar lullaby

 chapter one 
 
 christmas be christmas without any presents grumbled jo lying on the rug 
 so dreadful to be poor sighed meg looking down at her old dress 
 i think fair for some girls to have plenty of pretty things and other girls nothing at all added little amy with an injured got father and mother and each other said beth contentedly from her corner 
 the four young faces on which the firelight shone brightened at the cheerful words but darkened again as jo said sadly we got father and shall not have him for a long time she say perhaps never but each silently added it thinking of father far away where the fighting was 
 nobody spoke for a minute then meg said in an altered tone you know the reason mother proposed not having any presents this christmas was because it is going to be a hard winter for everyone and she thinks we ought not to spend money for pleasure when our men are suffering so in the army we do much but we can make our little sacrifices and ought to do it gladly but i am afraid i and meg shook her head as she thought regretfully of all the pretty things she wanted 
 but i think the little we should spend would do any good each got a dollar and the army be much helped by our giving that i agree not to expect anything from mother or you but i do want to buy undine and sintram for myself wanted it so long said jo who was a bookworm 
 i planned to spend mine in new music said beth with a little sigh which no one heard but the hearth brush and kettle holder 
 i shall get a nice box of drawing pencils i really need them said amy decidedly 
 mother say anything about our money and she wish us to give up everything each buy what we want and have a little fun sure we work hard enough to earn it cried jo examining the heels of her shoes in a gentlemanly manner 
 i know i those tiresome children nearly all day when longing to enjoy myself at home began meg in the complaining tone again 
 you have half such a hard time as i do said jo how would you like to be shut up for hours with a nervous fussy old lady who keeps you trotting is never satisfied and worries you till you ready to fly out the window or cry 
 naughty to fret but i do think washing dishes and keeping things tidy is the worst work in the world it makes me cross and my hands get so stiff i practice well at all and beth looked at her rough hands with a sigh that any one could hear that time 
 i believe any of you suffer as i do cried amy for you have to go to school with impertinent girls who plague you if you know your lessons and laugh at your dresses and label your father if he rich and insult you when your nose nice 
 if you mean libel say so and not talk about labels as if papa was a pickle bottle advised jo laughing 
 i know what i mean and you be statirical about it proper to use good words and improve your vocabilary returned amy with dignity 
 peck at one another children you wish we had the money papa lost when we were little jo dear me how happy and good be if we had no worries said meg who could remember better times 
 you said the other day you thought we were a deal happier than the king children for they were fighting and fretting all the time in spite of their money 
 so i did beth well i think we are for though we do have to work we make fun of ourselves and are a pretty jolly set as jo would say 
 jo does use such slang words observed amy with a reproving look at the long figure stretched on the rug 
 o immediately sat up put her hands in her pockets and began to whistle 
 jo so boyish 
 why i do it 
 i detest rude unladylike girls 
 i hate affected chits 
 birds in their little nests agree sang beth the peacemaker with such a funny face that both sharp voices softened to a laugh and the pecking ended for that time 
 really girls you are both to be blamed said meg beginning to lecture in her are old enough to leave off boyish tricks and to behave better josephine it matter so much when you were a little girl but now you are so tall and turn up your hair you should remember that you are a young lady 
 not and if turning up my hair makes me one wear it in two tails till twenty cried jo pulling off her net and shaking down a chestnut mane i hate to think got to grow up and be miss march and wear long gowns and look as prim as a china aster bad enough to be a girl anyway when i like games and work and manners i get over my disappointment in not being a boy and worse than ever now for dying to go and fight with papa and i can only stay home and knit like a poky old woman 
 and jo shook the blue army sock till the needles rattled like castanets and her ball bounded across the room 
 poor jo too bad but it be helped so you must try to be contented with making your name boyish and playing brother to us girls said beth stroking the rough head with a hand that all the dish washing and dusting in the world could not make ungentle in its touch 
 as for you amy continued meg you are altogether to particular and prim your airs are funny now but grow up an affected little goose if you take care i i like your nice manners and refined ways of speaking when you try to be elegant but your absurd words are as bad as slang 
 if jo is a tomboy and amy a goose what am i please asked beth ready to share the lecture 
 a dear and nothing else answered meg warmly and no one contradicted her for the mouse was the pet of the family 
 as young readers like to know how people look we will take this moment to give them a little sketch of the four sisters who sat knitting away in the twilight while the december snow fell quietly without and the fire crackled cheerfully within it was a comfortable room though the carpet was faded and the furniture very plain for a good picture or two hung on the walls books filled the recesses chrysanthemums and christmas roses bloomed in the windows and a pleasant atmosphere of home peace pervaded it 
 margaret the eldest of the four was sixteen and very pretty being plump and fair with large eyes plenty of soft brown hair a sweet mouth and white hands of which she was rather vain fifteen jo was very tall thin and brown and reminded one of a colt for she never seemed to know what to do with her long limbs which were very much in her way she had a decided mouth a comical nose and sharp gray eyes which appeared to see everything and were by turns fierce funny or thoughtful her long thick hair was her one beauty but it was usually bundled into a net to be out of her way round shoulders had jo big hands and feet a flyaway look to her clothes and the uncomfortable appearance of a girl who was rapidly shooting up into a woman and like it elizabeth or beth as everyone called her was a rosy smooth haired girl of thirteen with a shy manner a timid voice and a peaceful expression which was seldom disturbed her father called her little miss tranquility and the name suited her excellently for she seemed to live in a happy world of her own only venturing out to meet the few whom she trusted and loved amy though the youngest was a most important person in her own opinion at least a regular snow maiden with blue eyes and yellow hair curling on her shoulders pale and slender and always carrying herself like a young lady mindful of her manners what the characters of the four sisters were we will leave to be found out 
 the clock struck six and having swept up the hearth beth put a pair of slippers down to warm somehow the sight of the old shoes had a good effect upon the girls for mother was coming and everyone brightened to welcome her meg stopped lecturing and lighted the lamp amy got out of the easy chair without being asked and jo forgot how tired she was as she sat up to hold the slippers nearer to the blaze 
 they are quite worn out marmee must have a new pair 
 i thought get her some with my dollar said beth 
 no i shall cried amy 
 the oldest began meg but jo cut in with a decided the man of the family now papa is away and i shall provide the slippers for he told me to take special care of mother while he was gone 
 tell you what do said beth each get her something for christmas land not get anything for ourselves 
 like you dear what will we get exclaimed jo 
 everyone thought soberly for a minute then meg announced as if the idea was suggested by the sight of her own pretty hands i shall give her a nice pair of gloves 
 army shoes best to be had cried jo some handkerchiefs all hemmed said beth 
 get a little bottle of cologne she likes it and it cost much so have some left to buy my pencils added amy 
 how will we give the things asked meg 
 put them on the table and bring her in and see her open the bundles you remember how we used to do on our birthdays answered jo 
 i used to be so frightened when it was my turn to sit in the chair with the crown on and see you all come marching round to give the presents with a kiss i liked the things and the kisses but it was dreadful to have you sit looking at me while i opened the bundles said beth who was toasting her face and the bread for tea at the same time 
 let marmee think we are getting things for ourselves and then surprise her we must go shopping tomorrow afternoon meg there is so much to do about the play for christmas night said jo marching up and down with her hands behind her back and her nose in the air 
 i mean to act any more after this time getting too old for such things observed meg who was as much a child as ever about frolics 
 you stop i know as long as you can trail round in a white gown with your hair down and wear jewelryyou are the best actress got and be an end of everything if you quit the boards said jo we ought to rehearse tonight come here amy and do the fainting scene for you are as stiff as a poker in that 
 i help it i never saw anyone faint and i choose to make myself all black and blue tumbling flat as you do if i can go down easily drop if i i shall fall into a chair and be graceful i care if hugo does come at me with a pistol returned amy who was not gifted with dramatic power but was chosen because she was small enough to be borne out shrieking by the villain of the piece 
 do it this way clasp your hands so and stagger across the room crying frantically roderigo save me save me and away went jo with a melodramatic scream which was truly thrilling 
 amy followed but she poked her hands out stiffly before her and jerked herself along as if she went by machinery and her ow was more suggestive of pins being run into her than of fear and anguish jo gave a despairing groan and meg laughed outright while beth let her bread burn as she watched the fun with interest no use do the best you can when the time comes and if the audience laughs blame me come on meg 
 then things went smoothly for don pedro defied the world in a speech of two pages without a single break hagar the witch chanted an awful incantation over her kettleful of simmering toads with weird effect roderigo rent his chains asunder manfully and hugo died in agonies of remorse and arsenic with a wild ha ha 
 the best had yet said meg as the dead villain sat up and rubbed his elbows 
 i see how you can write and act such splendid things jo a regular shakespeare exclaimed beth who firmly believed that her sisters were gifted with wonderful genius in all things 
 not quite replied jo modestly i do think the witches curse an operatic tragedy is rather a nice thing but like to try mcbeth if we only had a trapdoor for banquo i always wanted to do the killing part is that a dagger that i see before me muttered jo rolling her eyes and clutching at the air as she had seen a famous tragedian do 
 no the toasting fork with shoe on it instead of the bread cried meg and the rehearsal ended in a general burst of laughter 
 glad to find you so merry my girls said a cheery voice at the door and actors and audience turned to welcome a tall motherly lady with a can i help you look about her which was truly delightful she was not elegantly dressed but a woman and the girls thought the gray cloak and unfashionable bonnet covered the most splendid mother in the world 
 well dearies how have you got on today there was so much to do getting the boxes ready to go tomorrow that i come home to dinner has anyone called beth how is your cold meg jo you look tired to death come and kiss me baby 
 while making these maternal inquiries mrs march got her wet things off her warm slippers on and sitting down in the easy chair drew amy to her lap preparing to enjoy the happiest hour of her busy day the girls flew about trying to make things comfortable each in her own way meg arranged the tea table jo brought wood and set chairs dropping and clattering everything she touched beth trotted to and fro between parlor kitchen quiet and busy while amy gave directions to everyone as she sat with her hands folded 
 as they gathered about the table mrs march said with a particularly happy face got a treat for you after supper 
 a quick bright smile went round like a streak of sunshine beth clapped her hands regardless of the biscuit she held and jo tossed up her napkin crying a letter a letter three cheers for father 
 yes a nice long letter he is well and thinks he shall get through the cold season better than we feared he sends all sorts of loving wishes for christmas and an especial message to you girls said mrs march patting her pocket as if she had got a treasure there 
 hurry and get done stop to quirk your little finger and simper over your plate amy cried jo choking on her tea and dropping her bread butter side down on the carpet in her haste to get at the treat 
 beth ate no more but crept away to sit in her shadowy corner and brood over the delight to come till the others were ready 
 i think it was so splendid in father to go as chaplain when he was too old to be drafted and not strong enough for a soldier said meg warmly 
 i wish i could go as a drummer a its name or a nurse so i could be near him and help him exclaimed jo with a groan 
 it must be very disagreeable to sleep in a tent and eat all sorts of things and drink out of a tin mug sighed amy 
 when will he come home marmee asked beth with a little quiver in her voice 
 not for many months dear unless he is sick he will stay and do his work faithfully as long as he can and we ask for him back a minute sooner than he can be spared now come and hear the letter 
 they all drew to the fire mother in the big chair with beth at her feet meg and amy perched on either arm of the chair and jo leaning on the back where no one would see any sign of emotion if the letter should happen to be touching very few letters were written in those hard times that were not touching especially those which fathers sent home in this one little was said of the hardships endured the dangers faced or the homesickness conquered it was a cheerful hopeful letter full of lively descriptions of camp life marches and military news and only at the end did the heart with fatherly love and longing for the little girls at home

 egyptian manner a stunning sight to behold this is 
 narrator 
 birthplace of 
 mistress no other man was allowed 
 to touch her 
 she makes her way through the ornate statuary the camera comes to a stop 
 on a cracked stone face a beat and then eyes suddenly pop open 
 really a strange looking tattooed man several more of these hideous bald 
 men stand nearby they are the priests of osiris guys their 
 eyes watch vanish through the bedroom curtains 
 embraces imhotep they kiss passionately feverishly hands roam 
 over her perfect body smearing the paint the voice fills with 
 lust 
 narrator 
 but for our love we were willing to 
 risk life itself 
 and we realize that the narrator is actually imhotep himself 
 on the of the curtains the bald priests rush over and close the 
 doors but just as they do the doors suddenly burst open pharaoh angrily 
 strides in looks at the priests the following dialogue is in ancient 
 egyptian subtitled

 face fills with despair the doors explode open men with 
 skin and strange over their bodies stride in 
 armed to the teeth these are the mumia the priests hustle imhotep out 
 onto the dark balcony just as the mumia rip through the curtains 
 points at pharaoh and hisses 
 
 my body is no longer his temple 
 she plunges the sword into her own heart out on the balcony 
 mouth opens into a horrible silent scream 
 
 for murdering pharaoh body 
 was to be cursed and it was i the high 
 priest whose duty it was to curse it 
 ext sand dunes night 
 imhotep procession across the dunes 
 mummy is carried by nubian slaves they pet her down in the sand along with 
 five jewel encrusted jars 
 imhotep 
 her body was mummified her vital 
 organs removed and placed in sacred canopic 
 jars 
 imhotep filled with dread reads from a obooko made out of pure gold this 
 is the book of the living 
 imhotep 
 the book of the living contained 
 sacred incantations that would send the evil 
 dead on a journey into the dark underworld 
 strange light suddenly flashes across body and across the 
 faces of the slaves and the egyptian soldiers suddenly 
 eyes all rise as if watching body rising then 
 one last huge flash accompanied by a blast of wind and over 
 body now lies twisted on the ground 
 priests place the body into a stone sarcophagus the nubian 
 slaves lower it into a hole and bury it with sand imhotep then signals to 
 the soldiers who throw their spears at the nubians killing them 
 inhotep 
 
 the slaves were killed 
 priests attack the now unarmed soldiers hacking 
 at them in the flickering darkness as imhotep and the mumia solemnly 
 watches 
 imhotep 
 and the soldiers who killed them 
 were also slain so that no unholy person 
 should ever know the exact location of the 
 burial site 
 the mumia walk off across the sand and then one by one 
 the priests stop their frenzied stabbing and stare off at the 
 vanishing mumia as the last mumia disappears over a distant 
 dune imhotep nods and the priests leap onto 
 grave and begin digging it back up with their hands 
 ext sahara desert night 
 chariots race out into the moonlit desert imhotep leads the way a 
 hearse carries mummy the map of ancient egypt fades up 
 the chariots race across the map 
 imhotep 
 but there was another book the book 
 of the dead which was never opened 
 never to be read for it contained the 
 incantations that could bring a dead body 
 back to life a most unholy thing 
 the chariots arrive at a place marked on the map in hieratic they race up 
 the stone ramp and in through the city gates superimposed across the 
 screen are the words 
 kanunaptm city of the dead 
 imhotep 
 it was hidden at hamunaptra city of 
 the dead inside the statue of anubis so 
 that no such sacrilege might ever disgrace 
 egypt 
 ext hamunaptra anubis site night 
 imhotep pulls an ornate chest out of a secret compartment inside the giant 
 statue of anubis he opens the chest and lifts out the book of the dead 
 made of black stone 
 imhotep 
 but for my love of i 
 was willing to defy the gods 
 int underground necropolis night 
 big hairy rats scurry through the mausoleums and over the headstones of 
 this very large scary underground cemetery a detritus moat surrounds the 
 cemetery muck made out of filthy water and human remains skulls bob in 
 the goop the priests have gathered in a circle their hooded lifeless 
 eyes seem dead to this world their bald heads rock back and forth as they 
 chant a quiet eerie hum heinous creatures in the middle of the circle is 
 a strange twisted altar imhotep has unwrapped gorgeous 
 lifeless body and placed her five sacred canopic jars around her 
 imhotep 
 vital organs were 
 still fresh so a human sacrifice would not 
 need be made 
 as imhotep begins to read from the book of the dead a large swirling hole 
 starts to open in the detritus bog several priests look over at it 
 frightened then quickly look back down and resume chanting a strange mist 
 wafts up out of the swirling hole and over to the jars it passes through 
 them and into body one of the jars shudders the heart 
 inside begins to beat the chanting priests swirling hole wafting mist 
 beating heart and readings are reaching a crescendo 
 eyes suddenly fly open 
 imhotep 
 soul had come back from 
 the dead now all that was needed was to 
 return her organs to their rightful place 
 within her body 
 imhotep lifts a sacrificial knife above breast about to 
 plunge it down the chanting swirling and beating heart climax and 
 when the mumia burst in and storm through the startled priests the head 
 mumia smashes the jar with the beating heart the mist instantly sucks back 
 out of body and implodes back into the swirling hole 
 eyes close dying once again imhotep screams in rage the 
 mumia grab him and his priests 
 imhotep 
 my priests were condemned to be 
 mummified alive 
 int chamber necropolis night 
 inside a chamber imhotep is held by embalmers he 
 cringes at the flickering impressionistic glimpses of his priests being 
 embalmed and mummified alive the embalmers using knives 
 needles and thread calmly perform their ghastly surgery on the screaming 
 priests who are going insane from the procedure 
 a red hot poker is pulled out of a pit of burning coals 
 a head is wedged between two strong boards his eyes widen in 
 terror as an embalmer moves to insert the red hot poker up his nose but 
 just before he does we quickly cut to face horrified as off 
 camera the priest screams 
 we go wide on the chamber all of priests squirm 
 inside their wrappings imhotep is forced to his knees his arms are held 
 back his mouth is pried open 
 imhotep 
 as for me i was condemned to endure 
 the the worst of all ancient curses 
 one so horrible it had never before been 
 bestowed 
 using a pair of tongs an embalmer slowly pulls tongue out of his 
 mouth then places a very sharp knife on top of it tight on 
 eyes as his tongue is apparently cut out the embalmer flings 
 tongue onto the floor the dogs attack and quickly eat 
 it 
 imhotep is wrapped al m only his mouth nostrils and eyes are 
 left free of the slimy bandages detritus muck boils inside a black 
 cauldron embalmers scoop out the fetid muck and apply it to 
 wrappings as he squirms then laid in a wooden coffin inside a stone 
 sarcophagus an embalmer with a bucket steps up and looks into the coffin 
 wild eyes stare back the embalmer empties the bucket over 
 chest dozens of scarabs disgusting dung beetles they scurry 
 across screaming face some vanish into his mouth 
 and up his nostrils 
 inhotep 
 by eating the sacred scarabs i would 
 be cursed to stay alive forever and by 
 eating me they were cursed just the same 
 the lid to the coffin is slammed shut then using a strange 
 ycey the head mumia locks the coffin lid tight the heavy sarcophagus lid 
 is shoved into place and with a loud whoosh seals itself airtight once 
 again the head mumia uses the strange key locking the sarcophagus lid 
 tight 
 imhotep 
 i was to remain sealed inside my 
 sarcophagus the undead for all of eternity 
 the strangely tattooed man carefully collapses the sides of 
 the key turning it into a little puzzle box 
 inhotep 
 they would never allow me to be 
 released for i would arise a walking 
 disease a plague upon mankind an unholy 
 with the strength of ages power 
 over the sands and the glory of 
 invincibility 
 sarcophagus is dropped into a detritus pit the disgusting muck 
 splashes up drools down sides and then is mysteriously sucked into 
 seams vanishing clean 
 inhotep 
 and if i could raise my beloved 
 from her place in hell 
 together we would be an unstoppable 
 infection upon this world the apocalypse 
 the end 
 horrifying screans can be heard coming from inside 
 his sarcophagus as grave diggers shovel dirt onto it the main title is 
 superimposed on the scream the mummy 
 the heavily armed mumia stand guard around grave looking down on 
 the burial site is the huge statue of anubis the god of 
 death it stares at us then begins to decay before bur very eyes aging 
 years in only seconds and then we find ourselves and the decrepit 
 statue of anubis out in the middle of the desert 
 ext sahara hamanaptra ruins day 
 horrifying screams become the screams of a tuareg horseman 
 racing across the desert with two thousand of his warrior brethren armed 
 to the teeth superimposed across the screen are the words tee sarkra 
 
 a mile across the scorching desert two hundred french foreign legionnaires 
 scurry through the ruins preparing for the onslaught our hero is up on 
 the wall his kepi sits at a jaunty angle dashing and handsome this is 
 rick he looks out at the massive screaming horde galloping at 
 him

 the wall this is beni

 they both skid to a stop at the front line as they see the horde of 
 sound of charging horses is deafening gives beni a 
 big cheesy smile 
 
 i was just looking for a good time 
 and when the cowardly legionnaire colonel suddenly panics cuts and 
 runs instantly stiffens 
 
 oh shit steady 
 gives the men around him courage but onward comes the horde hoofs pounding 
 the sand several more legionnaires take off

 and locks the cartridge in his mouth suddenly snaps he spits it into the 
 sand another beat and then

 the legionnaires on the ground fire the rifles report with a crash the 
 blast blows dozens of tuaregs clean off their mounts the prone 
 legionnaires quickly begin to reload 
 
 fire 
 the kneeling legionnaires fire more tuaregs bite the sand the remaining 
 warriors open fire thunder and smoke rip the hot air a third of the 
 legionnaires are killed instantly 
 
 fire 
 the remaining standing legionnaires fire tuaregs spin off their mounts 
 crash to the sand and then the entire tuareg force plows into the ruins 
 and through the legionnaires grabs the barrel of his rifle and 
 starts clubbing riders off their steeds fighting like a man possessed 
 beni on the other hand is bellycrawling across the sand whimpering in 
 full retreat as legionnaires fall dead all around him he crawls through 
 the front gate 
 throws his rifle down and goes for his guns he gun 
 in each hand starts blowing riders off their mounts 
 beni crawls faster and then he spots an open temple doorway amongst the 
 rocks he gets up and sprints for the door as the last of the legionnaires 
 are shot off their feet behind him guns go empty 
 
 
 he turns and runs like hell right through the front gate four tuareg 
 warriors on massive arabians after him hurdles a stone 
 column hits the ground running he spots beni inside the temple doorway 
 trying to close the heavy sandstone door 
 
 hey beni wait up 
 beni has no intention of waiting up he pushes harder

 column and charge after him hoofs pounding

 beni closes the door just as reaches it slams his body 
 into the door it budge

 he turns and bolts off around the rocks running for his life weaving 
 through the ruins the arabians getting closer and closer the pounding 
 hoofs getting louder and louder finally spins around and faces 
 his attackers the four massive horses crash to a stop in front of him 
 the vicious tuaregs raise their rifles to finish him off just 
 stands there exhausted and beaten then he slowly lifts his right hand and gives them the bird 
 and when the horses go all four of them rear up two of 
 the riders are thrown to the ground the horses screech and bellow and 
 snort in fear then buck like fury and away as if the devil 
 himself had scared them the thrown riders get up and race off after their 
 mounts 
 just stands there stunned then he lifts his right hand and 
 checks out his middle finger and then he feels the evil himself and turns 
 around the shattered decrepit statue of anubis stares back at him 
 suddenly the sand begins to shift under feet he starts to 
 back away keeping his eyes on the transforming sand it looks like huge 
 snakes are wiggling and writhing beneath it forming lines and shapes 
 drawing a picture quickly turns and runs off through the 
 ruins the sand stops moving and we can now see that drawn in the sand 
 is a picture of screaming face

 the mummy 
 part 
 
 the universal pictures globe spins then comes to a stop on the african 
 continent a golden papyrus map of ancient egypt rises up we push in on 
 it towards a city along the nile name written in hierarchic we keep 
 pushing in until the golden map turns to golden sand and we find ourselves 
 descending on this ancient egyptian city only not ancient 
 superimposed across the screen are the words 
 trebes 
 accompanied by a narrator with a very thick egyptian accent 
 narrator

 barreling right at us driven by pharaoh seti an aristocratic virile old 
 man the chariot wipes frame

 glaring out over the city at the setting sun is a handsome muscular man 
 with intense evil eyes this is imhotep 
 narrator 
 home of imhotep high priest of 
 osiris keeper of the dead 
 a gorgeous goddess enters the outer foyer it takes us a 
 moment to realize that the dress wearing a dress at 
 all but rather her entire naked body has been painted in the ancient 
 egyptian manner a stunning sight to behold this is 
 narrator 
 birthplace of 
 mistress no other man was allowed 
 to touch her 
 she makes her way through the ornate statuary the camera comes to a stop 
 on a cracked stone face a beat and then eyes suddenly pop open 
 really a strange looking tattooed man several more of these hideous bald 
 men stand nearby they are the priests of osiris guys their 
 eyes watch vanish through the bedroom curtains 
 embraces imhotep they kiss passionately feverishly hands roam 
 over her perfect body smearing the paint the voice fills with 
 lust 
 narrator 
 but for our love we were willing to 
 risk life itself 
 and we realize that the narrator is actually imhotep himself 
 on the of the curtains the bald priests rush over and close the 
 doors but just as they do the doors suddenly burst open pharaoh angrily 
 strides in looks at the priests the following dialogue is in ancient 
 egyptian subtitled 
 pharaoh 
 what are you doing here 
 the priests back away scared shitless obviously his arrival was 
 unexpected pharaoh strides for the curtains throws them back 
 stands alone gives him a sexy smile pharaoh sees the 
 smeared body paint points his finger 
 pharaoh 
 who has touched you 
 from behind him his sword is ripped out of its scabbard pharaoh spins 
 around imhotep pharaoh is shocked 
 pharaoh 
 imhotep my priest 
 behind him lifts a dagger and plunges it into his back 
 pharaoh screams imhotep raises sword the hideous bald priests 
 slam the doors and bolt them tight through the curtains they see the 
 shadows of and imhotep stab away at pharaoh suddenly the 
 doors are rammed from the other side wham imhotep and 
 turn and look wham the doors are rammed again the two lovers share 
 desperate looks wham the bald priests run up and grab imhotep and try 
 and pull him towards the balcony 
 priests 
 bodyguards 
 imhotep tries to break free but rips sword out of 
 his hand and pushes him towards the balcony 
 
 you must go save yourself 
 only you can resurrect me 
 face fills with despair the doors explode open men with 
 skin and strange over their bodies stride in 
 armed to the teeth these are the mumia the priests hustle imhotep out 
 onto the dark balcony just as the mumia rip through the curtains 
 points at pharaoh and hisses 
 
 my body is no longer his temple 
 she plunges the sword into her own heart out on the balcony 
 mouth opens into a horrible silent scream 
 
 for murdering pharaoh body 
 was to be cursed and it was i the high 
 priest whose duty it was to curse it 
 ext sand dunes night 
 imhotep procession across the dunes 
 mummy is carried by nubian slaves they pet her down in the sand along with 
 five jewel encrusted jars 
 imhotep 
 her body was mummified her vital 
 organs removed and placed in sacred canopic 
 jars 
 imhotep filled with dread reads from a obooko made out of pure gold this 
 is the book of the living 
 imhotep 
 the book of the living contained 
 sacred incantations that would send the evil 
 dead on a journey into the dark underworld 
 strange light suddenly flashes across body and across the 
 faces of the slaves and the egyptian soldiers suddenly 
 eyes all rise as if watching body rising then 
 one last huge flash accompanied by a blast of wind and over 
 body now lies twisted on the ground 
 priests place the body into a stone sarcophagus the nubian 
 slaves lower it into a hole and bury it with sand imhotep then signals to 
 the soldiers who throw their spears at the nubians killing them 
 inhotep 
 
 the slaves were killed 
 priests attack the now unarmed soldiers hacking 
 at them in the flickering darkness as imhotep and the mumia solemnly 
 watches 
 imhotep 
 and the soldiers who killed them 
 were also slain so that no unholy person 
 should ever know the exact location of the 
 burial site 
 the mumia walk off across the sand and then one by one 
 the priests stop their frenzied stabbing and stare off at the 
 vanishing mumia as the last mumia disappears over a distant 
 dune imhotep nods and the priests leap onto 
 grave and begin digging it back up with their hands 
 ext sahara desert night 
 chariots race out into the moonlit desert imhotep leads the way a 
 hearse carries mummy the map of ancient egypt fades up 
 the chariots race across the map 
 imhotep 
 but there was another book the book 
 of the dead which was never opened 
 never to be read for it contained the 
 incantations that could bring a dead body 
 back to life a most unholy thing 
 the chariots arrive at a place marked on the map in hieratic they race up 
 the stone ramp and in through the city gates superimposed across the 
 screen are the words 
 kanunaptm city of the dead 
 imhotep 
 it was hidden at hamunaptra city of 
 the dead inside the statue of anubis so 
 that no such sacrilege might ever disgrace 
 egypt 
 ext hamunaptra anubis site night 
 imhotep pulls an ornate chest out of a secret compartment inside the giant 
 statue of anubis he opens the chest and lifts out the book of the dead 
 made of black stone 
 imhotep 
 but for my love of i 
 was willing to defy the gods 
 int underground necropolis night 
 big hairy rats scurry through the mausoleums and over the headstones of 
 this very large scary underground cemetery a detritus moat surrounds the 
 cemetery muck made out of filthy water and human remains skulls bob in 
 the goop the priests have gathered in a circle their hooded lifeless 
 eyes seem dead to this world their bald heads rock back and forth as they 
 chant a quiet eerie hum heinous creatures in the middle of the circle is 
 a strange twisted altar imhotep has unwrapped gorgeous 
 lifeless body and placed her five sacred canopic jars around her 
 imhotep 
 vital organs were 
 still fresh so a human sacrifice would not 
 need be made 
 as imhotep begins to read from the book of the dead a large swirling hole 
 starts to open in the detritus bog several priests look over at it 
 frightened then quickly look back down and resume chanting a strange mist 
 wafts up out of the swirling hole and over to the jars it passes through 
 them and into body one of the jars shudders the heart 
 inside begins to beat the chanting priests swirling hole wafting mist 
 beating heart and readings are reaching a crescendo 
 eyes suddenly fly open 
 imhotep 
 soul had come back from 
 the dead now all that was needed was to 
 return her organs to their rightful place 
 within her body 
 imhotep lifts a sacrificial knife above breast about to 
 plunge it down the chanting swirling and beating heart climax and 
 when the mumia burst in and storm through the startled priests the head 
 mumia smashes the jar with the beating heart the mist instantly sucks back 
 out of body and implodes back into the swirling hole 
 eyes close dying once again imhotep screams in rage the 
 mumia grab him and his priests 
 imhotep 
 my priests were condemned to be 
 mummified alive 
 int chamber necropolis night 
 inside a chamber imhotep is held by embalmers he 
 cringes at the flickering impressionistic glimpses of his priests being 
 embalmed and mummified alive the embalmers using knives 
 needles and thread calmly perform their ghastly surgery on the screaming 
 priests who are going insane from the procedure 
 a red hot poker is pulled out of a pit of burning coals

 terror as an embalmer moves to insert the red hot poker up his nose but

 fade in 
 ext suburb early morning 
 flying high above an upper middle class suburb the wide streets are lined with stately elms and sycamores the homes are traditional and coming closer to the ground we pick out a couple of male jogger 
 a different angle on the joggers at level now moving alongside them both in their thirties athletic blandly handsome they pass a street sign that reads robin hood trail 
 suddenly a man comes into view flying aboutthree feet above their heads wearing pajamas and a plaid flannel robe as he passes overhead the joggers look up and wave excitedly like children he flashes them a grin and waves back then he speeds up leaving them behind 
 as the man flies down the street a barking dog runs alongbeneath him jumping into the air trying to catch him the man swoops and dips effortlessly teasing the dog then spots at the end of the street a young boy on a bicycle tossing newspapers onto porches or as close as he can get seeing the flying man the boy tosses a paper high into the air the dog tears off to catch the paper the flying man laughs and shoots upward like been blown out of a cannon grabs the paper and swoops down dropping it lightly on the front porch of a house with distinctive cedar shingle siding and a red front door 
 the boy on the bike watches in admiration the man slowlyfloats by above him and tousles his hair the dog barks the boy throws another newspaper into the air this time even higher than before and the man grins as he prepares to shoot up after it this is going to be fun and we smash cut to 
 int burnham house master bedroom day 
 we hear the harsh buzz of an alarm clock vic damone stillsings baby elsewhere in the house outside a dog is still barking 
 the man we just saw flying through the streets lies sleepingamidst expensive bed linens wearing the same pajamas his hand reaches over and shuts the alarm clock off his eyes remain clamped shut as he tries to hang onto his dream but gone he sighs and opens his eyes 
 this man is lester burnham husband and father with a wide boyish face just beginning to droop around the edges he sits up in bed and rubs his face 
 in a large comfortable bedroom tastefully decorated but not overdone it could be a spread from metropolitan home lester gets out of the bed crosses to a bay window covered with stylish wooden blinds lifts one of the slats with his finger and peers through it 
 his pov a dog the same dog from flying dream barks excitedly at us from behind a white picket fence surrounding the front yard of the house across the street 
 ext burnham house continuous 
 the pov lester looks down at us through the bay window of the house from his dream we recognize the distinctive cedar shingle siding the dog continues to bark 
 lester name is lester burnham forty old in less than a year be burnham house master bath moments later 
 in the shower with lester a waterproof radio plays country music he stands with his face directly in the hot spray eyes shut 
 lester a way dead already 
 angle from outside the shower we see naked body silhouetted through the glass door it becomes apparent he is masturbating 
 lester at me jerking off while i listen to country music i hated this shit when i was growing thing is this is the high point of my day all downhill from here 
 ext burnham house front yard moments later 
 close on a single dewy american beauty rose perfect inshape and color as we pull back a pair of gloved hands with clippers appear and snip the flower off 
 we continue pulling back to discover carolyn burnham in herrose garden in front of the house cutting flowers and placing them in a basket a determined humorless look on her face even now she is perfectly she wears gardening togs and has lots of useful and expensive tools 
 lester my wife carolyn see the way the handle on those pruning shears matches her gardening clogs not an accident 
 in the fenced front yard of the house across the street thefamiliar dog is still barking a athletic man in a conservative suit rolls a blue plastic city garbage container up the driveway to the curb 
 jim bitsy hush 
 lester our neighbor jim 
 a second athletic man in a conservative suitcomes out the front door

 as jim gets into a ford taurus jim crosses the street to greet carolyn 
 jim morning carolyn

 jim and i just love your roses how do you get them to flourish like that 
 carolynwell tell you egg shells and miracle grow 
 angle on the second floor bay window of the house where lester stands in a bathrobe drying his hair as he looks down at them 
 lester i get exhausted just watching her 
 his pov we hear what saying but facial expressions remain overly animated and cheerful like those of a tv talk show host 
 lester always like this she used to be happy we used to be happy 
 jim pulls the ford taurus into the street jim waves to carolyn jumps inside and they drive off carolyn immediately reverts to her previous resolute expression as she continues cutting flowers 
 lester she have much use for me anymore about the only thing that gets her excited now is money

 jane smiles pleased she stuffs the money into a knapsackhanging on her closet door then looks at herself in a mirror a beat she turns sideways and arches her back so her breasts protrude as much as possible she frowns then turns so facing the mirror and hugs her herself tightly to enhance the appearance of cleavage 
 lester is a pretty typical teenager angry insecure confused i wish i could tell her all going to i want to lie to her 
 we hear a car horn from outside jane grabs her knapsack anda flannel shirt from her closet and starts out

 ext suburb early morning 
 flying high above an upper middle class suburb the wide streets are lined with stately elms and sycamores the homes are traditional and coming closer to the ground we pick out a couple of male jogger 
 a different angle on the joggers at level now moving alongside them both in their thirties athletic blandly handsome they pass a street sign that reads robin hood trail 
 suddenly a man comes into view flying aboutthree feet above their heads wearing pajamas and a plaid flannel robe as he passes overhead the joggers look up and wave excitedly like children he flashes them a grin and waves back then he speeds up leaving them behind 
 as the man flies down the street a barking dog runs alongbeneath him jumping into the air trying to catch him the man swoops and dips effortlessly teasing the dog then spots at the end of the street a young boy on a bicycle tossing newspapers onto porches or as close as he can get seeing the flying man the boy tosses a paper high into the air the dog tears off to catch the paper the flying man laughs and shoots upward like been blown out of a cannon grabs the paper and swoops down dropping it lightly on the front porch of a house with distinctive cedar shingle siding and a red front door 
 the boy on the bike watches in admiration the man slowlyfloats by above him and tousles his hair the dog barks the boy throws another newspaper into the air this time even higher than before and the man grins as he prepares to shoot up after it this is going to be fun and we smash cut to
