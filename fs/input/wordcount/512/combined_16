 chapter ix 
 
 it was past one when pierre left his friend it was a cloudless northern summer night pierre took an open cab intending to drive straight home but the nearer he drew to the house the more he felt the impossibility of going to sleep on such a night it was light enough to see a long way in the deserted street and it seemed more like morning or evening than night on the way pierre remembered that anatole kuragin was expecting the usual set for cards that evening after which there was generally a drinking bout finishing with visits of a kind pierre was very fond of 
 i should like to go to thought he 
 but he immediately recalled his promise to prince andrew not to go there then as happens to people of weak character he desired so passionately once more to enjoy that dissipation he was so accustomed to that he decided to go the thought immediately occurred to him that his promise to prince andrew was of no account because before he gave it he had already promised prince anatole to come to his gathering besides thought he all such words of honor are conventional things with no definite meaning especially if one considers that by tomorrow one may be dead or something so extraordinary may happen to one that honor and dishonor will be all the same pierre often indulged in reflections of this sort nullifying all his decisions and intentions he went to 
 reaching the large house near the horse guards barracks in which anatole lived pierre entered the lighted porch ascended the stairs and went in at the open door there was no one in the anteroom empty bottles cloaks and overshoes were lying about there was a smell of alcohol and sounds of voices and shouting in the distance 
 cards and supper were over but the visitors had not yet dispersed pierre threw off his cloak and entered the first room in which were the remains of supper a footman thinking no one saw him was drinking on the sly what was left in the glasses from the third room came sounds of laughter the shouting of familiar voices the growling of a bear and general commotion some eight or nine young men were crowding anxiously round an open window three others were romping with a young bear one pulling him by the chain and trying to set him at the others 
 i bet a hundred on stevens shouted one 
 mind no holding on cried another 
 i bet on dolokhov cried a third kuragin you part our hands 
 there leave bruin alone a bet on 
 at one draught or he loses shouted a fourth 
 jacob bring a bottle shouted the host a tall handsome fellow who stood in the midst of the group without a coat and with his fine linen shirt unfastened in front wait a bit you fellows here is petya good man cried he addressing pierre 
 another voice from a man of medium height with clear blue eyes particularly striking among all these drunken voices by its sober ring cried from the window come here part the bets this was dolokhov an officer of the semenov regiment a notorious gambler and duelist who was living with anatole pierre smiled looking about him merrily 
 i understand it all about 
 wait a bit he is not drunk yet a bottle here said anatole taking a glass from the table he went up to pierre 
 first of all you must drink 
 pierre drank one glass after another looking from under his brows at the tipsy guests who were again crowding round the window and listening to their chatter anatole kept on refilling glass while explaining that dolokhov was betting with stevens an english naval officer that he would drink a bottle of rum sitting on the outer ledge of the third floor window with his legs hanging out 
 go on you must drink it all said anatole giving pierre the last glass or i let you go 
 no i said pierre pushing anatole aside and he went up to the window 
 dolokhov was holding the hand and clearly and distinctly repeating the terms of the bet addressing himself particularly to anatole and pierre 
 dolokhov was of medium height with curly hair and eyes he was about like all infantry officers he wore no mustache so that his mouth the most striking feature of his face was clearly seen the lines of that mouth were remarkably finely curved the middle of the upper lip formed a sharp wedge and closed firmly on the firm lower one and something like two distinct smiles played continually round the two corners of the mouth this together with the resolute insolent intelligence of his eyes produced an effect which made it impossible not to notice his face dolokhov was a man of small means and no connections yet though anatole spent tens of thousands of rubles dolokhov lived with him and had placed himself on such a footing that all who knew them including anatole himself respected him more than they did anatole dolokhov could play all games and nearly always won however much he drank he never lost his clearheadedness both kuragin and dolokhov were at that time notorious among the rakes and scapegraces of petersburg 
 the bottle of rum was brought the window frame which prevented anyone from sitting on the outer sill was being forced out by two footmen who were evidently flurried and intimidated by the directions and shouts of the gentlemen around 
 anatole with his swaggering air strode up to the window he wanted to smash something pushing away the footmen he tugged at the frame but could not move it he smashed a pane 
 you have a try hercules said he turning to pierre 
 pierre seized the crossbeam tugged and wrenched the oak frame out with a crash 
 take it right out or think holding on said dolokhov 
 is the englishman bragging eh is it all right said anatole 
 said pierre looking at dolokhov who with a bottle of rum in his hand was approaching the window from which the light of the sky the dawn merging with the afterglow of sunset was visible 
 dolokhov the bottle of rum still in his hand jumped onto the window sill listen cried he standing there and addressing those in the room all were silent 
 i bet fifty imperials he spoke french that the englishman might understand him but he did not speak it very well i bet fifty imperials or do you wish to make it a hundred added he addressing the englishman 
 no fifty replied the latter 
 all right fifty imperials that i will drink a whole bottle of rum without taking it from my mouth sitting outside the window on this spot he stooped and pointed to the sloping ledge outside the window and without holding on to anything is that right 
 quite right said the englishman 
 anatole turned to the englishman and taking him by one of the buttons of his coat and looking down at him the englishman was short began repeating the terms of the wager to him in english 
 wait cried dolokhov hammering with the bottle on the window sill to attract attention wait a bit kuragin listen if anyone else does the same i will pay him a hundred imperials do you understand 
 the englishman nodded but gave no indication whether he intended to accept this challenge or not anatole did not release him and though he kept nodding to show that he understood anatole went on translating words into english a thin young lad an hussar of the life guards who had been losing that evening climbed on the window sill leaned over and looked down 
 oh oh oh he muttered looking down from the window at the stones of the pavement 
 shut up cried dolokhov pushing him away from the window the lad jumped awkwardly back into the room tripping over his spurs 
 placing the bottle on the window sill where he could reach it easily dolokhov climbed carefully and slowly through the window and lowered his legs pressing against both sides of the window he adjusted himself on his seat lowered his hands moved a little to the right and then to the left and took up the bottle anatole brought two candles and placed them on the window sill though it was already quite light back in his white shirt and his curly head were lit up from both sides everyone crowded to the window the englishman in front pierre stood smiling but silent one man older than the others present suddenly pushed forward with a scared and angry look and wanted to seize hold of shirt 
 i say this is folly be killed said this more sensible man 
 anatole stopped him 
 touch him startle him and then be killed eh what then eh 
 dolokhov turned round and again holding on with both hands arranged himself on his seat 
 if anyone comes meddling again said he emitting the words separately through his thin compressed lips i will throw him down there now then 
 saying this he again turned round dropped his hands took the bottle and lifted it to his lips threw back his head and raised his free hand to balance himself one of the footmen who had stooped to pick up some broken glass remained in that position without taking his eyes from the window and from back anatole stood erect with staring eyes the englishman looked on sideways pursing up his lips the man who had wished to stop the affair ran to a corner of the room and threw himself on a sofa with his face to the wall pierre hid his face from which a faint smile forgot to fade though his features now expressed horror and fear all were still pierre took his hands from his eyes dolokhov still sat in the same position only his head was thrown further back till his curly hair touched his shirt collar and the hand holding the bottle was lifted higher and higher and trembled with the effort the bottle was emptying perceptibly and rising still higher and his head tilting yet further back why is it so long thought pierre it seemed to him that more than half an hour had elapsed suddenly dolokhov made a backward movement with his spine and his arm trembled nervously this was sufficient to cause his whole body to slip as he sat on the sloping ledge as he began slipping down his head and arm wavered still more with the strain one hand moved as if to clutch the window sill but refrained from touching it pierre again covered his eyes and thought he would never never them again suddenly he was aware of a stir all around he looked up dolokhov was standing on the window sill with a pale but radiant face 
 empty 
 he threw the bottle to the englishman who caught it neatly dolokhov jumped down he smelt strongly of rum 
 well done fine fellow a bet for you devil take you came from different sides 
 the englishman took out his purse and began counting out the money dolokhov stood frowning and did not speak pierre jumped upon the window sill 
 gentlemen who wishes to bet with me do the same thing he suddenly cried even without a bet there tell them to bring me a bottle do it bring a bottle 
 let him do it let him do it said dolokhov smiling 
 what next have you gone mad no one would let you why you go giddy even on a staircase exclaimed several voices 
 drink it have a bottle of rum shouted pierre banging the table with a determined and drunken gesture and preparing to climb out of the window 
 they seized him by his arms but he was so strong that everyone who touched him was sent flying 
 no never manage him that way said anatole wait a bit and get round him listen take your bet tomorrow but now we are all going to s 
 come on then cried pierre come on and take bruin with us 
 and he caught the bear took it in his arms lifted it from the ground and began dancing round the room with it

 chapter 
 
 on the morning of a fine june day my first bonny little nursling and the last of the ancient earnshaw stock was born we were busy with the hay in a far away field when the girl that usually brought our breakfasts came running an hour too soon across the meadow and up the lane calling me as she ran 
 oh such a grand bairn she panted out the finest lad that ever breathed but the doctor says missis must go he says been in a consumption these many months i heard him tell mr hindley and now she has nothing to keep her and be dead before winter you must come home directly to nurse it nelly to feed it with sugar and milk and take care of it day and night i wish i were you because it will be all yours when there is no missis 
 but is she very ill i asked flinging down my rake and tying my bonnet 
 i guess she is yet she looks bravely replied the girl and she talks as if she thought of living to see it grow a man out of her head for joy such a beauty if i were her certain i should not die i should get better at the bare sight of it in spite of kenneth i was fairly mad at him dame archer brought the cherub down to master in the house and his face just began to light up then the old croaker steps forward and says he earnshaw a blessing your wife has been spared to leave you this son when she came i felt convinced we keep her long and now i must tell you the winter will probably finish her take on and fret about it too much it be helped and besides you should have known better than to choose such a rush of a lass 
 and what did the master answer i inquired 
 i think he swore but i mind him i was straining to see the bairn and she began again to describe it rapturously i as zealous as herself hurried eagerly home to admire on my part though i was very sad for sake he had room in his heart only for two wife and himself he doted on both and adored one and i conceive how he would bear the loss 
 when we got to wuthering heights there he stood at the front door and as i passed in i asked how was the baby 
 nearly ready to run about nell he replied putting on a cheerful smile 
 and the mistress i ventured to inquire the doctor says 
 damn the doctor he interrupted reddening frances is quite right be perfectly well by this time next week are you going upstairs will you tell her that come if promise not to talk i left her because she would not hold her tongue and she her mr kenneth says she must be quiet 
 i delivered this message to mrs earnshaw she seemed in flighty spirits and replied merrily 
 i hardly spoke a word there he has gone out twice crying well say i promise i speak but that does not bind me not to laugh at him 
 poor soul till within a week of her death that gay heart never failed her and her husband persisted doggedly nay furiously in affirming her health improved every day when kenneth warned him that his medicines were useless at that stage of the malady and he put him to further expense by attending her he retorted 
 i know you need does not want any more attendance from you she never was in a consumption it was a fever and it is gone her pulse is as slow as mine now and her cheek as cool 
 he told his wife the same story and she seemed to believe him but one night while leaning on his shoulder in the act of saying she thought she should be able to get up tomorrow a fit of coughing took very slight raised her in his arms she put her two hands about his neck her face changed and she was dead 
 as the girl had anticipated the child hareton fell wholly into my hands mr earnshaw provided he saw him healthy and never heard him cry was contented as far as regarded him for himself he grew desperate his sorrow was of that kind that will not lament he neither wept nor prayed he cursed and defied execrated god and man and gave himself up to reckless dissipation the servants could not bear his tyrannical and evil conduct long joseph and i were the only two that would stay i had not the heart to leave my charge and besides you know i had been his and excused his behaviour more readily than a stranger would joseph remained to hector over tenants and labourers and because it was his vocation to be where he had plenty of wickedness to reprove 
 the bad ways and bad companions formed a pretty example for catherine and heathcliff his treatment of the latter was enough to make a fiend of a saint and truly it appeared as if the lad were possessed of something diabolical at that period he delighted to witness hindley degrading himself past redemption and became daily more notable for savage sullenness and ferocity i could not half tell what an infernal house we had the curate dropped calling and nobody decent came near us at last unless edgar visits to miss cathy might be an exception at fifteen she was the queen of the countryside she had no peer and she did turn out a haughty headstrong creature i own i did not like her after her infancy was past and i vexed her frequently by trying to bring down her arrogance she never took an aversion to me though she had a wondrous constancy to old attachments even heathcliff kept his hold on her affections unalterably and young linton with all his superiority found it difficult to make an equally deep impression he was my late master that is his portrait over the fireplace it used to hang on one side and his on the other but hers has been removed or else you might see something of what she was can you make that out 
 mrs dean raised the candle and i discerned a face exceedingly resembling the young lady at the heights but more pensive and amiable in expression it formed a sweet picture the long light hair curled slightly on the temples the eyes were large and serious the figure almost too graceful i did not marvel how catherine earnshaw could forget her first friend for such an individual i marvelled much how he with a mind to correspond with his person could fancy my idea of catherine earnshaw 
 a very agreeable portrait i observed to the housekeeper is it like 
 yes she answered but he looked better when he was animated that is his everyday countenance he wanted spirit in general 
 catherine had kept up her acquaintance with the lintons since her five weeks residence among them and as she had no temptation to show her rough side in their company and had the sense to be ashamed of being rude where she experienced such invariable courtesy she imposed unwittingly on the old lady and gentleman by her ingenious cordiality gained the admiration of isabella and the heart and soul of her brother acquisitions that flattered her from the first for she was full of ambition and led her to adopt a double character without exactly intending to deceive anyone in the place where she heard heathcliff termed a vulgar young ruffian and worse than a brute she took care not to act like him but at home she had small inclination to practise politeness that would only be laughed at and restrain an unruly nature when it would bring her neither credit nor praise mr edgar seldom mustered courage to visit wuthering heights openly he had a terror of reputation and shrunk from encountering him and yet he was always received with our best attempts at civility the master himself avoided offending him knowing why he came and if he could not be gracious kept out of the way i rather think his appearance there was distasteful to catherine she was not artful never played the coquette and had evidently an objection to her two friends meeting at all for when heathcliff expressed contempt of linton in his presence she could not half coincide as she did in his absence and when linton evinced disgust and antipathy to heathcliff she dared not treat his sentiments with indifference as if depreciation of her playmate were of scarcely any consequence to her had many a laugh at her perplexities and untold troubles which she vainly strove to hide from my mockery that sounds but she was so proud it became really impossible to pity her distresses till she should be chastened into more humility she did bring herself finally to confess and confide in me there was not a soul else that she might fashion into an adviser 
 mr hindley had gone from home one afternoon and heathcliff presumed to give himself a holiday on the strength of it he had reached the age of sixteen then i think and without having bad features or being deficient in intellect he contrived to convey an impression of inward and outward repulsiveness that his present aspect retains no traces of in the first place he had by that time lost the benefit of his early education continual hard work begun soon and concluded late had extinguished any curiosity he once possessed in pursuit of knowledge and any love for books or learning his sense of superiority instilled into him by the favours of old mr earnshaw was faded away he struggled long to keep up an equality with catherine in her studies and yielded with poignant though silent regret but he yielded completely and there was no prevailing on him to take a step in the way of moving upward when he found he must necessarily sink beneath his former level then personal appearance sympathized with mental deterioration he acquired a slouching gait and ignoble look his naturally reserved disposition was exaggerated into an almost idiotic excess of unsociable moroseness and he took a grim pleasure apparently in exciting the aversion rather than the esteem of his few acquaintance 
 catherine and he were constant companions still at his seasons of respite from labour but he had ceased to express his fondness for her in words and recoiled with angry suspicion from her girlish caresses as if conscious there could be no gratification in lavishing such marks of affection on him on the occasion he came into the house to announce his intention of doing nothing while i was assisting miss cathy to arrange her dress she had not reckoned on his taking it into his head to be idle and imagining she would have the whole place to herself she managed by some means to inform mr edgar of her absence and was then preparing to receive him 
 cathy are you busy this afternoon asked heathcliff are you going anywhere 
 no it is raining she answered 
 why have you that silk frock on then he said nobody coming here i hope 
 not that i know of stammered miss but you should be in the field now heathcliff it is an hour past dinner time i thought you were gone 
 hindley does not often free us from his accursed presence observed the boy not work any more today stay with you 
 oh but joseph will tell she suggested better go 
 joseph is loading lime on the farther side of pennistow crag it will take him till dark and never know 
 so saying he lounged to the fire and sat down catherine reflected an instant with knitted found it needful to smooth the way for an intrusion isabella and edgar linton talked of calling this afternoon she said at the conclusion of a silence as it rains i hardly expect them but they may come and if they do you run the risk of being scolded for no good 
 order ellen to say you are engaged cathy he persisted turn me out for those pitiful silly friends of yours on the point sometimes of complaining that not 
 that they what cried catherine gazing at him with a troubled countenance oh nelly she added petulantly jerking her head away from my hands combed my hair quite out of curl enough let me alone what are you on the point of complaining about heathcliff 
 look at the almanac on that wall he pointed to a framed sheet hanging near the window and crosses are for the evenings you have spent with the lintons the dots for those spent with me do you see marked every day 
 foolish as if i took notice replied catherine in a peevish tone and where is the sense of that 
 to show that i do take notice said heathcliff 
 and should i always be sitting with you she demanded growing more irritated what good do i get what do you talk about you might be dumb or a baby for anything you say to amuse me or for anything you do either 
 you never told me before that i talked too little or that you disliked my company cathy exclaimed heathcliff in much agitation 
 no company at all when people know nothing and say nothing she muttered 
 her companion rose up but he time to express his feelings further for a feet were heard on the flags and having knocked gently young linton entered his face brilliant with delight at the unexpected summons he had received doubtless catherine marked the difference between her friends as one came in and the other went out the contrast resembled what you see in exchanging a bleak hilly coal country for a beautiful fertile valley and his voice and greeting were as opposite as his aspect 
 he had a sweet low manner of speaking and pronounced his words as you do less gruff than we talk here and softer 
 not come too soon am i he said casting a look at me i had begun to wipe the plate and tidy some drawers at the far end in the dresser 
 no answered catherine what are you doing there nelly 
 my work miss i replied mr hindley had given me directions to make a third parry in any private visits linton chose to pay 
 she stepped behind me and whispered crossly take yourself and your dusters off when company are in the house servants commence scouring and cleaning in the room where they are 
 a good opportunity now that the master is away i answered aloud he hates me to be fidgeting over these things in his presence sure mr edgar will excuse me 
 i hate you to be fidgeting in my presence exclaimed the young lady imperiously not allowing her guest time to speak she had failed to recover her equanimity since the little dispute with heathcliff 
 sorry for it miss catherine was my response and i proceeded assiduously with my occupation 
 she supposing edgar could not see her snatched the cloth from my hand and pinched me with a prolonged wrench very spitefully on the arm said i did not love her and rather relished mortifying her vanity now and then besides she hurt me extremely so i started up from my knees and screamed out oh miss a nasty trick you have no right to nip me and not going to bear it 
 i touch you you lying creature cried she her fingers tingling to repeat the act and her ears red with rage she never had power to conceal her passion it always set her whole complexion in a blaze 
 that then i retorted showing a decided purple witness to refute her 
 she stamped her foot wavered a moment and then irresistibly impelled by the naughty spirit within her slapped me on the cheek a stinging blow that filled both eyes with water 
 catherine love catherine interposed linton greatly shocked at the double fault of falsehood and violence which his idol had committed 
 leave the room ellen she repeated trembling all over 
 little hareton who followed me everywhere and was sitting near me on the floor at seeing my tears commenced crying himself and sobbed out complaints against wicked aunt cathy which drew her fury on to his unlucky head she seized his shoulders and shook him till the poor child waxed livid and edgar thoughtlessly laid hold of her hands to deliver him in an instant one was wrung free and the astonished young man felt it applied over his own ear in a way that could not be mistaken for jest he drew back in consternation i lifted hareton in my arms and walked off to the kitchen with him leaving the door of communication open for i was curious to watch how they would settle their disagreement the insulted visitor moved to the spot where he had laid his hat pale and with a quivering lip 
 right i said to myself take warning and begone a kindness to let you have a glimpse of her genuine disposition 
 where are you going demanded catherine advancing to the door 
 he swerved aside and attempted to pass 
 you must not go she exclaimed energetically 
 i must and shall he replied in a subdued voice

 chapter 
 
 on the morning of a fine june day my first bonny little nursling and the last of the ancient earnshaw stock was born we were busy with the hay in a far away field when the girl that usually brought our breakfasts came running an hour too soon across the meadow and up the lane calling me as she ran 
 oh such a grand bairn she panted out the finest lad that ever breathed but the doctor says missis must go he says been in a consumption these many months i heard him tell mr hindley and now she has nothing to keep her and be dead before winter you must come home directly to nurse it nelly to feed it with sugar and milk and take care of it day and night i wish i were you because it will be all yours when there is no missis 
 but is she very ill i asked flinging down my rake and tying my bonnet 
 i guess she is yet she looks bravely replied the girl and she talks as if she thought of living to see it grow a man out of her head for joy such a beauty if i were her certain i should not die i should get better at the bare sight of it in spite of kenneth i was fairly mad at him dame archer brought the cherub down to master in the house and his face just began to light up then the old croaker steps forward and says he earnshaw a blessing your wife has been spared to leave you this son when she came i felt convinced we keep her long and now i must tell you the winter will probably finish her take on and fret about it too much it be helped and besides you should have known better than to choose such a rush of a lass 
 and what did the master answer i inquired 
 i think he swore but i mind him i was straining to see the bairn and she began again to describe it rapturously i as zealous as herself hurried eagerly home to admire on my part though i was very sad for sake he had room in his heart only for two wife and himself he doted on both and adored one and i conceive how he would bear the loss 
 when we got to wuthering heights there he stood at the front door and as i passed in i asked how was the baby 
 nearly ready to run about nell he replied putting on a cheerful smile 
 and the mistress i ventured to inquire the doctor says 
 damn the doctor he interrupted reddening frances is quite right be perfectly well by this time next week are you going upstairs will you tell her that come if promise not to talk i left her because she would not hold her tongue and she her mr kenneth says she must be quiet 
 i delivered this message to mrs earnshaw she seemed in flighty spirits and replied merrily 
 i hardly spoke a word there he has gone out twice crying well say i promise i speak but that does not bind me not to laugh at him 
 poor soul till within a week of her death that gay heart never failed her and her husband persisted doggedly nay furiously in affirming her health improved every day when kenneth warned him that his medicines were useless at that stage of the malady and he put him to further expense by attending her he retorted 
 i know you need does not want any more attendance from you she never was in a consumption it was a fever and it is gone her pulse is as slow as mine now and her cheek as cool 
 he told his wife the same story and she seemed to believe him but one night while leaning on his shoulder in the act of saying she thought she should be able to get up tomorrow a fit of coughing took very slight raised her in his arms she put her two hands about his neck her face changed and she was dead 
 as the girl had anticipated the child hareton fell wholly into my hands mr earnshaw provided he saw him healthy and never heard him cry was contented as far as regarded him for himself he grew desperate his sorrow was of that kind that will not lament he neither wept nor prayed he cursed and defied execrated god and man and gave himself up to reckless dissipation the servants could not bear his tyrannical and evil conduct long joseph and i were the only two that would stay i had not the heart to leave my charge and besides you know i had been his and excused his behaviour more readily than a stranger would joseph remained to hector over tenants and labourers and because it was his vocation to be where he had plenty of wickedness to reprove 
 the bad ways and bad companions formed a pretty example for catherine and heathcliff his treatment of the latter was enough to make a fiend of a saint and truly it appeared as if the lad were possessed of something diabolical at that period he delighted to witness hindley degrading himself past redemption and became daily more notable for savage sullenness and ferocity i could not half tell what an infernal house we had the curate dropped calling and nobody decent came near us at last unless edgar visits to miss cathy might be an exception at fifteen she was the queen of the countryside she had no peer and she did turn out a haughty headstrong creature i own i did not like her after her infancy was past and i vexed her frequently by trying to bring down her arrogance she never took an aversion to me though she had a wondrous constancy to old attachments even heathcliff kept his hold on her affections unalterably and young linton with all his superiority found it difficult to make an equally deep impression he was my late master that is his portrait over the fireplace it used to hang on one side and his on the other but hers has been removed or else you might see something of what she was can you make that out 
 mrs dean raised the candle and i discerned a face exceedingly resembling the young lady at the heights but more pensive and amiable in expression it formed a sweet picture the long light hair curled slightly on the temples the eyes were large and serious the figure almost too graceful i did not marvel how catherine earnshaw could forget her first friend for such an individual i marvelled much how he with a mind to correspond with his person could fancy my idea of catherine earnshaw 
 a very agreeable portrait i observed to the housekeeper is it like 
 yes she answered but he looked better when he was animated that is his everyday countenance he wanted spirit in general 
 catherine had kept up her acquaintance with the lintons since her five weeks residence among them and as she had no temptation to show her rough side in their company and had the sense to be ashamed of being rude where she experienced such invariable courtesy she imposed unwittingly on the old lady and gentleman by her ingenious cordiality gained the admiration of isabella and the heart and soul of her brother acquisitions that flattered her from the first for she was full of ambition and led her to adopt a double character without exactly intending to deceive anyone in the place where she heard heathcliff termed a vulgar young ruffian and worse than a brute she took care not to act like him but at home she had small inclination to practise politeness that would only be laughed at and restrain an unruly nature when it would bring her neither credit nor praise mr edgar seldom mustered courage to visit wuthering heights openly he had a terror of reputation and shrunk from encountering him and yet he was always received with our best attempts at civility the master himself avoided offending him knowing why he came and if he could not be gracious kept out of the way i rather think his appearance there was distasteful to catherine she was not artful never played the coquette and had evidently an objection to her two friends meeting at all for when heathcliff expressed contempt of linton in his presence she could not half coincide as she did in his absence and when linton evinced disgust and antipathy to heathcliff she dared not treat his sentiments with indifference as if depreciation of her playmate were of scarcely any consequence to her had many a laugh at her perplexities and untold troubles which she vainly strove to hide from my mockery that sounds but she was so proud it became really impossible to pity her distresses till she should be chastened into more humility she did bring herself finally to confess and confide in me there was not a soul else that she might fashion into an adviser 
 mr hindley had gone from home one afternoon and heathcliff presumed to give himself a holiday on the strength of it he had reached the age of sixteen then i think and without having bad features or being deficient in intellect he contrived to convey an impression of inward and outward repulsiveness that his present aspect retains no traces of in the first place he had by that time lost the benefit of his early education continual hard work begun soon and concluded late had extinguished any curiosity he once possessed in pursuit of knowledge and any love for books or learning his sense of superiority instilled into him by the favours of old mr earnshaw was faded away he struggled long to keep up an equality with catherine in her studies and yielded with poignant though silent regret but he yielded completely and there was no prevailing on him to take a step in the way of moving upward when he found he must necessarily sink beneath his former level then personal appearance sympathized with mental deterioration he acquired a slouching gait and ignoble look his naturally reserved disposition was exaggerated into an almost idiotic excess of unsociable moroseness and he took a grim pleasure apparently in exciting the aversion rather than the esteem of his few acquaintance 
 catherine and he were constant companions still at his seasons of respite from labour but he had ceased to express his fondness for her in words and recoiled with angry suspicion from her girlish caresses as if conscious there could be no gratification in lavishing such marks of affection on him on the occasion he came into the house to announce his intention of doing nothing while i was assisting miss cathy to arrange her dress she had not reckoned on his taking it into his head to be idle and imagining she would have the whole place to herself she managed by some means to inform mr edgar of her absence and was then preparing to receive him 
 cathy are you busy this afternoon asked heathcliff are you going anywhere 
 no it is raining she answered 
 why have you that silk frock on then he said nobody coming here i hope 
 not that i know of stammered miss but you should be in the field now heathcliff it is an hour past dinner time i thought you were gone 
 hindley does not often free us from his accursed presence observed the boy not work any more today stay with you 
 oh but joseph will tell she suggested better go 
 joseph is loading lime on the farther side of pennistow crag it will take him till dark and never know 
 so saying he lounged to the fire and sat down catherine reflected an instant with knitted found it needful to smooth the way for an intrusion isabella and edgar linton talked of calling this afternoon she said at the conclusion of a silence as it rains i hardly expect them but they may come and if they do you run the risk of being scolded for no good 
 order ellen to say you are engaged cathy he persisted turn me out for those pitiful silly friends of yours on the point sometimes of complaining that not 
 that they what cried catherine gazing at him with a troubled countenance oh nelly she added petulantly jerking her head away from my hands combed my hair quite out of curl enough let me alone what are you on the point of complaining about heathcliff 
 look at the almanac on that wall he pointed to a framed sheet hanging near the window and crosses are for the evenings you have spent with the lintons the dots for those spent with me do you see marked every day 
 foolish as if i took notice replied catherine in a peevish tone and where is the sense of that 
 to show that i do take notice said heathcliff 
 and should i always be sitting with you she demanded growing more irritated what good do i get what do you talk about you might be dumb or a baby for anything you say to amuse me or for anything you do either 
 you never told me before that i talked too little or that you disliked my company cathy exclaimed heathcliff in much agitation 
 no company at all when people know nothing and say nothing she muttered 
 her companion rose up but he time to express his feelings further for a feet were heard on the flags and having knocked gently young linton entered his face brilliant with delight at the unexpected summons he had received doubtless catherine marked the difference between her friends as one came in and the other went out the contrast resembled what you see in exchanging a bleak hilly coal country for a beautiful fertile valley and his voice and greeting were as opposite as his aspect 
 he had a sweet low manner of speaking and pronounced his words as you do less gruff than we talk here and softer 
 not come too soon am i he said casting a look at me i had begun to wipe the plate and tidy some drawers at the far end in the dresser 
 no answered catherine what are you doing there nelly 
 my work miss i replied mr hindley had given me directions to make a third parry in any private visits linton chose to pay 
 she stepped behind me and whispered crossly take yourself and your dusters off when company are in the house servants commence scouring and cleaning in the room where they are 
 a good opportunity now that the master is away i answered aloud he hates me to be fidgeting over these things in his presence sure mr edgar will excuse me 
 i hate you to be fidgeting in my presence exclaimed the young lady imperiously not allowing her guest time to speak she had failed to recover her equanimity since the little dispute with heathcliff 
 sorry for it miss catherine was my response and i proceeded assiduously with my occupation 
 she supposing edgar could not see her snatched the cloth from my hand and pinched me with a prolonged wrench very spitefully on the arm said i did not love her and rather relished mortifying her vanity now and then besides she hurt me extremely so i started up from my knees and screamed out oh miss a nasty trick you have no right to nip me and not going to bear it 
 i touch you you lying creature cried she her fingers tingling to repeat the act and her ears red with rage she never had power to conceal her passion it always set her whole complexion in a blaze 
 that then i retorted showing a decided purple witness to refute her 
 she stamped her foot wavered a moment and then irresistibly impelled by the naughty spirit within her slapped me on the cheek a stinging blow that filled both eyes with water 
 catherine love catherine interposed linton greatly shocked at the double fault of falsehood and violence which his idol had committed 
 leave the room ellen she repeated trembling all over 
 little hareton who followed me everywhere and was sitting near me on the floor at seeing my tears commenced crying himself and sobbed out complaints against wicked aunt cathy which drew her fury on to his unlucky head she seized his shoulders and shook him till the poor child waxed livid and edgar thoughtlessly laid hold of her hands to deliver him in an instant one was wrung free and the astonished young man felt it applied over his own ear in a way that could not be mistaken for jest he drew back in consternation i lifted hareton in my arms and walked off to the kitchen with him leaving the door of communication open for i was curious to watch how they would settle their disagreement the insulted visitor moved to the spot where he had laid his hat pale and with a quivering lip 
 right i said to myself take warning and begone a kindness to let you have a glimpse of her genuine disposition 
 where are you going demanded catherine advancing to the door 
 he swerved aside and attempted to pass 
 you must not go she exclaimed energetically 
 i must and shall he replied in a subdued voice 
 no she persisted grasping the handle not yet edgar linton sit down you shall not leave me in that temper i should be miserable all night and i be miserable for you 
 can i stay after you have struck me asked linton catherine was mute 
 made me afraid and ashamed of you he continued not come here again 
 her eyes began to glisten and her lids to twinkle and you told a deliberate untruth he said 
 i she cried recovering her speech i did nothing deliberately well go if you away and now cry myself sick 
 she dropped down on her knees by a chair and set to weeping in serious earnest edgar persevered in his resolution as far as the court there he lingered i resolved to encourage him 
 miss is dreadfully wayward sir i called out as bad as any marred child better be riding home or else she will be sick only to grieve us 
 the soft thing looked askance through the window he possessed the power to depart as much as a cat possesses the power to leave a mouse half killed or a bird half eaten ah i thought there will be no saving him doomed and flies to his fate and so it was he turned abruptly hastened into the house again shut the door behind him and when i went in a while after to inform them that earnshaw had come home rabid drunk ready to pull the whole place about our ears his ordinary frame of mind in that condition i saw the quarrel had merely effected a closer intimacy had broken the outworks of youthful timidity and enabled them to forsake the disguise of friendship and confess themselves lovers

 chapter nine 
 
 i do think it was the most fortunate thing in the world that those children should have the measles just now said meg one april day as she stood packing the go abroady trunk in her room surrounded by her sisters 
 and so nice of annie moffat not to forget her promise a whole fortnight of fun will be regularly splendid replied jo looking like a windmill as she folded skirts with her long arms 
 and such lovely weather so glad of that added beth tidily sorting neck and hair ribbons in her best box lent for the great occasion 
 i wish i was going to have a fine time and wear all these nice things said amy with her mouth full of pins as she artistically replenished her cushion 
 i wish you were all going but as you i shall keep my adventures to tell you when i come back sure the least i can do when you have been so kind lending me things and helping me get ready said meg glancing round the room at the very simple outfit which seemed nearly perfect in their eyes 
 what did mother give you out of the treasure box asked amy who had not been present at the opening of a certain cedar chest in which mrs march kept a few relics of past splendor as gifts for her girls when the proper time came 
 a pair of silk stockings that pretty carved fan and a lovely blue sash i wanted the violet silk but there time to make it over so i must be contented with my old tarlatan 
 it will look nice over my new muslin skirt and the sash will set it off beautifully i wish i smashed my coral bracelet for you might have had it said jo who loved to give and lend but whose possessions were usually too dilapidated to be of much use 
 there is a lovely pearl set in the treasure chest but mother said real flowers were the prettiest ornament for a young girl and laurie promised to send me all i want replied meg now let me see my new gray walking suit just curl up the feather in my hat beth then my poplin for sunday and the small party it looks heavy for spring it the violet silk would be so nice oh dear 
 never mind got the tarlatan for the big party and you always look like an angel in white said amy brooding over the little store of finery in which her soul delighted 
 it and it sweep enough but it will have to do my blue housedress looks so well turned and freshly trimmed that i feel as if got a new one my silk sacque a bit the fashion and my bonnet look like i like to say anything but i was sadly disappointed in my umbrella i told mother black with a white handle but she forgot and bought a green one with a yellowish handle strong and neat so i ought not to complain but i know i shall feel ashamed of it beside silk one with a gold top sighed meg surveying the little umbrella with great disfavor 
 change it advised jo 
 i be so silly or hurt feelings when she took so much pains to get my things a nonsensical notion of mine and not going to give up to it my silk stockings and two pairs of new gloves are my comfort you are a dear to lend me yours jo i feel so rich and sort of elegant with two new pairs and the old ones cleaned up for common and meg took a refreshing peep at her glove box annie moffat has blue and pink bows on her nightcaps would you put some on mine she asked as beth brought up a pile of snowy muslins fresh from hands 
 no i for the smart caps match the plain gowns without any trimming on them poor folks rig said jo decidedly 
 i wonder if i shall ever be happy enough to have real lace on my clothes and bows on my caps said meg impatiently 
 you said the other day that be perfectly happy if you could only go to annie observed beth in her quiet way 
 so i did well i am happy and i fret but it does seem as if the more one gets the more one wants it there now the trays are ready and everything in but my ball dress which i shall leave for mother to pack said meg cheering up as she glanced from the trunk to the many times pressed and mended white tarlatan which she called her ball dress with an important air 
 the next day was fine and meg departed in style for a fortnight of novelty and pleasure mrs march had consented to the visit rather reluctantly fearing that margaret would come back more discontented than she went but she begged so hard and sallie had promised to take good care of her and a little pleasure seemed so delightful after a winter of irksome work that the mother yielded and the daughter went to take her first taste of fashionable life 
 the moffats were very fashionable and simple meg was rather daunted at first by the splendor of the house and the elegance of its occupants but they were kindly people in spite of the frivolous life they led and soon put their guest at her ease perhaps meg felt without understanding why that they were not particularly cultivated or intelligent people and that all their gilding could not quite conceal the ordinary material of which they were made it certainly was agreeable to fare sumptuously drive in a fine carriage wear her best frock every day and do nothing but enjoy herself it suited her exactly and soon she began to imitate the manners and conversation of those about her to put on little airs and graces use french phrases crimp her hair take in her dresses and talk about the fashions as well as she could the more she saw of annie pretty things the more she envied her and sighed to be rich home now looked bare and dismal as she thought of it work grew harder than ever and she felt that she was a very destitute and girl in spite of the new gloves and silk stockings 
 she had not much time for repining however for the three young girls were busily employed in having a good time they shopped walked rode and called all day went to theaters and operas or frolicked at home in the evening for annie had many friends and knew how to entertain them her older sisters were very fine young ladies and one was engaged which was extremely interesting and romantic meg thought mr moffat was a fat jolly old gentleman who knew her father and mrs moffat a fat jolly old lady who took as great a fancy to meg as her daughter had done everyone petted her and daisey as they called her was in a fair way to have her head turned 
 when the evening for the small party came she found that the poplin do at all for the other girls were putting on thin dresses and making themselves very fine indeed so out came the tarlatan looking older limper and shabbier than ever beside crisp new one meg saw the girls glance at it and then at one another and her cheeks began to burn for with all her gentleness she was very proud no one said a word about it but sallie offered to dress her hair and annie to tie her sash and belle the engaged sister praised her white arms but in their kindness meg saw only pity for her poverty and her heart felt very heavy as she stood by herself while the others laughed chattered and flew about like gauzy butterflies the hard bitter feeling was getting pretty bad when the maid brought in a box of flowers before she could speak annie had the cover off and all were exclaiming at the lovely roses heath and fern within 
 for belle of course george always sends her some but these are altogether ravishing cried annie with a great sniff 
 they are for miss march the man said and a note put in the maid holding it to meg 
 what fun who are they from know you had a lover cried the girls fluttering about meg in a high state of curiosity and surprise 
 the note is from mother and the flowers from laurie said meg simply yet much gratified that he had not forgotten her 
 oh indeed said annie with a funny look as meg slipped the note into her pocket as a sort of talisman against envy vanity and false pride for the few loving words had done her good and the flowers cheered her up by their beauty 
 feeling almost happy again she laid by a few ferns and roses for herself and quickly made up the rest in dainty bouquets for the breasts hair or skirts of her friends offering them so prettily that clara the elder sister told her she was the sweetest little thing she ever saw and they looked quite charmed with her small attention somehow the kind act finished her despondency and when all the rest went to show themselves to mrs moffat she saw a happy face in the mirror as she laid her ferns against her rippling hair and fastened the roses in the dress that strike her as so very shabby now 
 she enjoyed herself very much that evening for she danced to her content everyone was very kind and she had three compliments annie made her sing and some one said she had a remarkably fine voice major lincoln asked who the fresh little girl with the beautiful eyes was and mr moffat insisted on dancing with her because she dawdle but had some spring in her as he gracefully expressed it so altogether she had a very nice time till she overheard a bit of conversation which disturbed her extremely she was sitting just inside the conservatory waiting for her partner to bring her an ice when she heard a voice ask on the other side of the flowery wall 
 how old is he 
 sixteen or seventeen i should say replied another voice 
 it would be a grand thing for one of those girls it sallie says they are very intimate now and the old man quite dotes on them 
 mrs m has made her plans i dare say and will play her cards well early as it is the girl evidently think of it yet said mrs moffat 
 she told that fib about her momma as if she did know and colored up when the flowers came quite prettily poor thing be so nice if she was only got up in style do you think be offended if we offered to lend her a dress for thursday asked another voice 
 proud but i believe mind for that dowdy tarlatan is all she has got she may tear it tonight and that will be a good excuse for offering a decent one 
 here partner appeared to find her looking much flushed and rather agitated she was proud and her pride was useful just then for it helped her hide her mortification anger and disgust at what she had just heard for innocent and unsuspicious as she was she could not help understanding the gossip of her friends she tried to forget it but could not and kept repeating to herself mrs m has made her plans that fib about her mamma and dowdy tarlatan till she was ready to cry and rush home to tell her troubles and ask for advice as that was impossible she did her best to seem gay and being rather excited she succeeded so well that no one dreamed what an effort she was making she was very glad when it was all over and she was quiet in her bed where she could think and wonder and fume till her head ached and her hot cheeks were cooled by a few natural tears those foolish yet well meant words had opened a new world to meg and much disturbed the peace of the old one in which till now she had lived as happily as a child her innocent friendship with laurie was spoiled by the silly speeches she had overheard her faith in her mother was a little shaken by the worldly plans attributed to her by mrs moffat who judged others by herself and the sensible resolution to be contented with the simple wardrobe which suited a poor daughter was weakened by the unnecessary pity of girls who thought a shabby dress one of the greatest calamities under heaven 
 poor meg had a restless night and got up unhappy half resentful toward her friends and half ashamed of herself for not speaking out frankly and setting everything right everybody dawdled that morning and it was noon before the girls found energy enough even to take up their worsted work something in the manner of her friends struck meg at once they treated her with more respect she thought took quite a tender interest in what she said and looked at her with eyes that plainly betrayed curiosity all this surprised and flattered her though she did not understand it till miss belle looked up from her writing and said with a sentimental air 
 daisy dear sent an invitation to your friend mr laurence for thursday we should like to know him and only a proper compliment to you 
 meg colored but a mischievous fancy to tease the girls made her reply demurely you are very kind but afraid he come 
 why not cherie asked miss belle 
 too old 
 my child what do you mean what is his age i beg to know cried miss clara 
 nearly seventy i believe answered meg counting stitches to hide the merriment in her eyes 
 you sly creature of course we meant the young man exclaimed miss belle laughing 
 there any laurie is only a little boy and meg laughed also at the queer look which the sisters exchanged as she thus described her supposed you age nan said 
 nearer my sister i am seventeen in august returned meg tossing her head 
 very nice of him to send you flowers it said annie looking wise about nothing 
 yes he often does to all of us for their house is full and we are so fond of them my mother and old mr laurence are friends you know so it is quite natural that we children should play together and meg hoped they would say no more 
 evident daisy out yet said miss clara to belle with a nod 
 quite a pastoral state of innocence all round returned miss belle with a shrug 
 going out to get some little matters for my girls can i do anything for you young ladies asked mrs moffat lumbering in like an elephant in silk and lace 
 no thank you replied sallie got my new pink silk for thursday and want a thing 
 nor i began meg but stopped because it occurred to her that she did want several things and could not have them 
 what shall you wear asked sallie 
 my old white one again if i can mend it fit to be seen it got sadly torn last night said meg trying to speak quite easily but feeling very uncomfortable 
 why you send home for another said sallie who was not an observing young lady 
 i got any other it cost meg an effort to say that but sallie did not see it and exclaimed in amiable surprise only that how funny she did not finish her speech for belle shook her head at her and broke in saying kindly 
 not at all where is the use of having a lot of dresses when she out yet no need of sending home daisy even if you had a dozen for got a sweet blue silk laid away which outgrown and you shall wear it to please me you dear 
 you are very kind but i mind my old dress if you it does well enough for a little girl like me said meg 
 now do let me please myself by dressing you up in style i admire to do it and be a regular little beauty with a touch here and there i let anyone see you till you are done and then burst upon them like cinderella and her godmother going to the ball said belle in her persuasive tone 
 meg refuse the offer so kindly made for a desire to see if she would be a little beauty after touching up caused her to accept and forget all her former uncomfortable feelings toward the moffats 
 on the thursday evening belle shut herself up with her maid and between them they turned meg into a fine lady they crimped and curled her hair they polished her neck and arms with some fragrant powder touched her lips with coralline salve to make them redder and hortense would have added a soupcon of rouge if meg had not rebelled they laced her into a dress which was so tight she could hardly breathe and so low in the neck that modest meg blushed at herself in the mirror a set of silver filagree was added bracelets necklace brooch and even earrings for hortense tied them on with a bit of pink silk which did not show a cluster of buds at the bosom and a ruche reconciled meg to the display of her pretty white shoulders and a pair of silk boots satisfied the last wish of her heart a lace handkerchief a plumy fan and a bouquet in a shoulder holder finished her off and miss belle surveyed her with the satisfaction of a little girl with a newly dressed doll 
 mademoiselle is chatmante tres jolie is she not cried hortense clasping her hands in an affected rapture 
 come and show yourself said miss belle leading the way to the room where the others were waiting 
 as meg went rustling after with her long skirts trailing her earrings tinkling her curls waving and her heart beating she felt as if her fun had really begun at last for the mirror had plainly told her that she was a little beauty her friends repeated the pleasing phrase enthusiastically and for several minutes she stood like a jackdaw in the fable enjoying her borrowed plumes while the rest chattered like a party of magpies 
 while i dress do you drill her nan in the management of her skirt and those french heels or she will trip herself up take your silver butterfly and catch up that long curl on the left side of her head clara and any of you disturb the charming work of my hands said belle as she hurried away looking well pleased with her success 
 you look a bit like yourself but you are very nice nowhere beside you for belle has heaps of taste and quite french i assure you let your flowers hang be so careful of them and be sure you trip returned sallie trying not to care that meg was prettier than herself 
 keeping that warning carefully in mind margaret got safely downstairs and sailed into the drawing rooms where the moffats and a few early guests were assembled she very soon discovered that there is a charm about fine clothes which attracts a certain class of people and secures their respect several young ladies who had taken no notice of her before were very affectionate all of a sudden several young gentlemen who had only stared at her at the other party now not only stared but asked to be introduced and said all manner of foolish but agreeable things to her and several old ladies who sat on the sofas and criticized the rest of the party inquired who she was with an air of interest she heard mrs moffat reply to one of them 
 daisy a colonel in the of our first families but reverses of fortune you know intimate friends of the laurences sweet creature i assure you my ned is quite wild about her 
 dear me said the old lady putting up her glass for another observation of meg who tried to look as if she had not heard and been rather shocked at mrs fibs the queer feeling did not pass away but she imagined herself acting the new part of fine lady and so got on pretty well though the tight dress gave her a the train kept getting under her feet and she was in constant fear lest her earrings should fly off and get lost or broken she was flirting her fan and laughing at the feeble jokes of a young gentleman who tried to be witty when she suddenly stopped laughing and looked confused for just opposite she saw laurie he was staring at her with undisguised surprise and disapproval also she thought for though he bowed and smiled yet something in his honest eyes made her blush and wish she had her old dress on to complete her confusion she saw belle nudge annie and both glance from her to laurie who she was happy to see looked unusually boyish and shy 
 silly creatures to put such thoughts into my head i care for it or let it change me a bit thought meg and rustled across the room to shake hands with her friend 
 glad you came i was afraid you she said with her most air 
 jo wanted me to come and tell her how you looked so i did answered laurie without turning his eyes upon her though he half smiled at her maternal tone 
 what shall you tell her asked meg full of curiosity to know his opinion of her yet feeling ill at ease with him for the first time 
 i shall say i know you for you look so and unlike yourself quite afraid of you he said fumbling at his glove button 
 how absurd of you the girls dressed me up for fun and i rather like it jo stare if she saw me said meg bent on making him say whether he thought her improved or not 
 yes i think she would returned laurie gravely 
 you like me so asked meg 
 no i was the blunt reply 
 why not in an anxious tone 
 he glanced at her frizzled head bare shoulders and fantastically trimmed dress with an expression that abashed her more than his answer which had not particle of his usual politeness in it 
 i like fuss and feathers 
 that was altogether too much from a lad younger than herself and meg walked away saying petulantly you are the rudest boy i ever saw 
 feeling very much ruffled she went and stood at a quiet window to cool her cheeks for the tight dress gave her an uncomfortably brilliant color as she stood there major lincoln passed by and a minute after she heard him saying to his mother 
 they are making a fool of that little girl i wanted you to see her but they have spoiled her entirely nothing but a doll tonight 
 oh dear sighed meg i wish been sensible and worn my own things then i should not have disgusted other people or felt so uncomfortable and ashamed of myself 
 she leaned her forehead on the cool pane and stood half hidden by the curtains never minding that her favorite waltz had begun till some one touched her and turning she saw laurie looking penitent as he said with his very best bow and his hand out 
 please forgive my rudeness and come and dance with me 
 afraid it will be to disagreeable to you said meg trying to look offended and failing entirely 
 not a bit of it dying to do it come be good i like your gown but i do think you are just splendid and he waved his hands as if words failed to express his admiration meg smiled and relented and whispered as they stood waiting to catch the time take care my skirt trip you up the plague of my life and i was a goose to wear it 
 pin it round your neck and then it will be useful said laurie looking down at the little blue boots which he evidently approved of away they went fleetly and gracefully for having practiced at home they were well matched and the blithe young couple were a pleasant sight to see as they twirled merrily round and round feeling more friendly than ever after their small tiff 
 laurie i want you to do me a favor will you said meg as he stood fanning her when her breath gave out which it did very soon though she would not own why 
 i said laurie with alacrity 
 please tell them at home about my dress tonight 
 they understand the joke and it will worry mother 
 then why did you do it said eyes so plainly that meg hastily added 
 i shall tell them myself all about it and fess to mother how silly been but rather do it myself so not tell will you 
 i give you my word i only what shall i say when they ask me 
 just say i looked pretty well and was having a good time 
 say the first with all my heart but how about the other you look as if you were having a good time are you and laurie looked at her with an expression which made her answer in a whisper 
 no not just now think horrid i only wanted a little fun but this sort pay i find and getting tired of it 
 here comes ned moffat what does he want said laurie knitting his black brows as if he did not regard his young host in the light of a pleasant addition to the party 
 he put his name down for three dances and i suppose coming for them what a bore said meg assuming a languid air which amused laurie immensely 
 he did not speak to her again till suppertime when he saw her drinking champagne with ned and his friend fisher who were behaving like a pair of fools as laurie said to himself for he felt a brotherly sort of right to watch over the marches and fight their battles whenever a defender was needed 
 have a splitting headache tomorrow if you drink much of that i meg your mother like it you know he whispered leaning over her chair as ned turned to refill her glass and fisher stooped to pick up her fan 
 not meg tonight a doll who does all sorts of crazy things tomorrow i shall put away my fuss and feathers and be desperately good again se answered with an affected little laugh 
 wish tomorrow was here then muttered laurie walking off at the change he saw in her 
 meg danced and flirted chattered and giggled as the other girls did after supper she undertook the german and blundered through it nearly upsetting her partner with her long skirt and romping in a way that scandalized laurie who looked on and meditated a lecture but he got no chance to deliver it for meg kept away from him till he came to say good night 
 remember she said trying to smile for the splitting headache had already begun 
 silence a la mort replied laurie with a melodramatic flourish as he went away 
 this little bit of byplay excited curiosity but meg was too tired for gossip and went to bed feeling as if she had been to a masquerade and enjoyed herself as much as she expected she was sick all the next day and on saturday went home quite used up with her fun and feeling that she had sat in the lap of luxury long enough 
 it does seem pleasant to be quiet and not have company manners on all the time home is a nice place though it splendid said meg looking about her with a restful expression as she sat with her mother and jo on the sunday evening 
 glad to hear you say so dear for i was afraid home would seem dull and poor to you after your fine quarters replied her mother who had given her many anxious looks that day for motherly eyes are quick to see any change in faces 
 meg had told her adventures gayly and said over and over what a charming time she had had but something still seemed to weigh upon her spirits and when the younger girls were gone to bed she sat thoughtfully staring at the fire saying little and looking worried as the clock struck nine and jo proposed bed meg suddenly left her chair and taking stool leaned her elbows on her knee saying bravely 
 marmee i want to fess 
 i thought so what is it dear 
 shall i go away asked jo discreetly 
 of course not i always tell you everything i was ashamed to speak of it before the younger children but i want you to know all the dreadful things i did at the moffats 
 we are prepared said mrs march smiling but looking a little anxious 
 i told you they dressed me up but i tell you that they powdered and squeezed and frizzled and made me look like a fashion plate laurie thought i proper i know he did though he say so and one man called me a doll i knew it was silly but they flattered me and said i was a beauty and quantities of nonsense so i let them make a fool of me 
 is that all asked jo as mrs march looked silently at the downcast face of her pretty daughter and could not find it in her heart to blame her little follies 
 no i drank champagne and romped and tried to flirt and was altogether abominable said meg 
 there is something more i think and mrs march smoothed the soft cheek which suddenly grew rosy as meg answered slowly 
 yes very silly but i want to tell it because i hate to have people say and think such things about us and laurie 
 then she told the various bits of gossip she had heard at the moffats and as she spoke jo saw her mother fold her lips tightly as if ill pleased that such ideas should be put into innocent mind 
 well if that the greatest rubbish i ever heard cried jo indignantly why you pop out and tell them so on the spot 
 i it was so embarrassing for me i help hearing at first and then i was so angry and ashamed i remember that i ought to go away 
 just wait till i see annie moffat and show you how to settle such ridiculous stuff the idea of having plans and being kind to laurie because rich and may marry us he shout when i tell him what those silly things say about us poor children and jo laughed as if on second thoughts the thing struck her as a good joke 
 if you tell laurie never forgive you she must she mother said meg looking distressed 
 no never repeat that foolish gossip and forget it as soon as you can said mrs march gravely i was very unwise to let you go among people of whom i know so little kind i dare say but worldly and full of these vulgar ideas about young people i am more sorry than i can express for the mischief this visit may have done you meg 
 be sorry i let it hurt me forget all the bad and remember only the good for i did enjoy a great deal and thank you very much for letting me go not be sentimental or dissatisfied mother i know a silly little girl and stay with you till fit to take care of myself but it is nice to be praised and admired and i help saying i like it said meg looking half ashamed of the confession 
 that is perfectly natural and quite harmless if the liking does not become a passion and lead one to do foolish or unmaidenly things learn to know and value the praise which is worth having and to excite the admiration of excellent people by being modest as well as pretty meg 
 margaret sat thinking a moment while jo stood with her hands behind her looking both interested and a little perplexed for it was a new thing to see meg blushing and talking about admiration lovers and things of that sort and jo felt as if during that fortnight her sister had grown up amazingly and was drifting away from her into a world where she could not follow 
 mother do you have plans as mrs moffat said asked meg bashfully 
 yes my dear i have a great many all mothers do but mine differ somewhat from mrs i suspect i will tell you some of them for the time has come when a word may set this romantic little head and heart of yours right on a very serious subject you are young meg but not too young to understand me and mothers lips are the fittest to speak of such things to girls like you jo your turn will come in time perhaps so listen to my plans and help me carry them out if they are good 
 jo went and sat on one arm of the chair looking as if she thought they were about to join in some very solemn affair holding a hand of each and watching the two young faces wistfully mrs march said in her serious yet cheery way 
 i want my daughters to be beautiful accomplished and good to be admired loved and respected to have a happy youth to be well and wisely married and to lead useful pleasant lives with as little care and sorrow to try them as god sees fit to send to be loved and chosen by a good man is the best and sweetest thing which can happen to a woman and i sincerely hope my girls may know this beautiful experience it is natural to think of it meg right to hope and wait for it and wise to prepare for it so that when the happy time comes you may feel ready for the duties and worthy of the joy my dear girls i am ambitious for you but not to have you make a dash in the world marry rich men merely because they are rich or have splendid houses which are not homes because love is wanting money is a needful and precious thing and when well used a noble thing but i never want you to think it is the first or only prize to strive for rather see you poor wives if you were happy beloved contented than queens on thrones without and peace 
 poor girls stand any chance belle says unless they put themselves forward sighed meg 
 then be old maids said jo stoutly right jo better be happy old maids than unhappy wives or unmaidenly girls running about to find husbands said mrs march decidedly be troubled meg poverty seldom daunts a sincere lover some of the best and most honored women i know were poor girls but so that they were not allowed to be old maids leave these things to time make this home happy so that you may be fit for homes of your own if they are offered you and contented here if they are not one thing remember my girls mother is always ready to be your confidante father to be your friend and both of hope and trust that our daughters whether married or single will be the pride and comfort of out lives 
 we will marmee we will cried both with all their hearts as she bade them good night

 chapter nine 
 
 i do think it was the most fortunate thing in the world that those children should have the measles just now said meg one april day as she stood packing the go abroady trunk in her room surrounded by her sisters 
 and so nice of annie moffat not to forget her promise a whole fortnight of fun will be regularly splendid replied jo looking like a windmill as she folded skirts with her long arms 
 and such lovely weather so glad of that added beth tidily sorting neck and hair ribbons in her best box lent for the great occasion 
 i wish i was going to have a fine time and wear all these nice things said amy with her mouth full of pins as she artistically replenished her cushion 
 i wish you were all going but as you i shall keep my adventures to tell you when i come back sure the least i can do when you have been so kind lending me things and helping me get ready said meg glancing round the room at the very simple outfit which seemed nearly perfect in their eyes 
 what did mother give you out of the treasure box asked amy who had not been present at the opening of a certain cedar chest in which mrs march kept a few relics of past splendor as gifts for her girls when the proper time came 
 a pair of silk stockings that pretty carved fan and a lovely blue sash i wanted the violet silk but there time to make it over so i must be contented with my old tarlatan 
 it will look nice over my new muslin skirt and the sash will set it off beautifully i wish i smashed my coral bracelet for you might have had it said jo who loved to give and lend but whose possessions were usually too dilapidated to be of much use 
 there is a lovely pearl set in the treasure chest but mother said real flowers were the prettiest ornament for a young girl and laurie promised to send me all i want replied meg now let me see my new gray walking suit just curl up the feather in my hat beth then my poplin for sunday and the small party it looks heavy for spring it the violet silk would be so nice oh dear 
 never mind got the tarlatan for the big party and you always look like an angel in white said amy brooding over the little store of finery in which her soul delighted 
 it and it sweep enough but it will have to do my blue housedress looks so well turned and freshly trimmed that i feel as if got a new one my silk sacque a bit the fashion and my bonnet look like i like to say anything but i was sadly disappointed in my umbrella i told mother black with a white handle but she forgot and bought a green one with a yellowish handle strong and neat so i ought not to complain but i know i shall feel ashamed of it beside silk one with a gold top sighed meg surveying the little umbrella with great disfavor 
 change it advised jo 
 i be so silly or hurt feelings when she took so much pains to get my things a nonsensical notion of mine and not going to give up to it my silk stockings and two pairs of new gloves are my comfort you are a dear to lend me yours jo i feel so rich and sort of elegant with two new pairs and the old ones cleaned up for common and meg took a refreshing peep at her glove box annie moffat has blue and pink bows on her nightcaps would you put some on mine she asked as beth brought up a pile of snowy muslins fresh from hands 
 no i for the smart caps match the plain gowns without any trimming on them poor folks rig said jo decidedly 
 i wonder if i shall ever be happy enough to have real lace on my clothes and bows on my caps said meg impatiently 
 you said the other day that be perfectly happy if you could only go to annie observed beth in her quiet way 
 so i did well i am happy and i fret but it does seem as if the more one gets the more one wants it there now the trays are ready and everything in but my ball dress which i shall leave for mother to pack said meg cheering up as she glanced from the trunk to the many times pressed and mended white tarlatan which she called her ball dress with an important air 
 the next day was fine and meg departed in style for a fortnight of novelty and pleasure mrs march had consented to the visit rather reluctantly fearing that margaret would come back more discontented than she went but she begged so hard and sallie had promised to take good care of her and a little pleasure seemed so delightful after a winter of irksome work that the mother yielded and the daughter went to take her first taste of fashionable life 
 the moffats were very fashionable and simple meg was rather daunted at first by the splendor of the house and the elegance of its occupants but they were kindly people in spite of the frivolous life they led and soon put their guest at her ease perhaps meg felt without understanding why that they were not particularly cultivated or intelligent people and that all their gilding could not quite conceal the ordinary material of which they were made it certainly was agreeable to fare sumptuously drive in a fine carriage wear her best frock every day and do nothing but enjoy herself it suited her exactly and soon she began to imitate the manners and conversation of those about her to put on little airs and graces use french phrases crimp her hair take in her dresses and talk about the fashions as well as she could the more she saw of annie pretty things the more she envied her and sighed to be rich home now looked bare and dismal as she thought of it work grew harder than ever and she felt that she was a very destitute and girl in spite of the new gloves and silk stockings 
 she had not much time for repining however for the three young girls were busily employed in having a good time they shopped walked rode and called all day went to theaters and operas or frolicked at home in the evening for annie had many friends and knew how to entertain them her older sisters were very fine young ladies and one was engaged which was extremely interesting and romantic meg thought mr moffat was a fat jolly old gentleman who knew her father and mrs moffat a fat jolly old lady who took as great a fancy to meg as her daughter had done everyone petted her and daisey as they called her was in a fair way to have her head turned 
 when the evening for the small party came she found that the poplin do at all for the other girls were putting on thin dresses and making themselves very fine indeed so out came the tarlatan looking older limper and shabbier than ever beside crisp new one meg saw the girls glance at it and then at one another and her cheeks began to burn for with all her gentleness she was very proud no one said a word about it but sallie offered to dress her hair and annie to tie her sash and belle the engaged sister praised her white arms but in their kindness meg saw only pity for her poverty and her heart felt very heavy as she stood by herself while the others laughed chattered and flew about like gauzy butterflies the hard bitter feeling was getting pretty bad when the maid brought in a box of flowers before she could speak annie had the cover off and all were exclaiming at the lovely roses heath and fern within 
 for belle of course george always sends her some but these are altogether ravishing cried annie with a great sniff 
 they are for miss march the man said and a note put in the maid holding it to meg 
 what fun who are they from know you had a lover cried the girls fluttering about meg in a high state of curiosity and surprise 
 the note is from mother and the flowers from laurie said meg simply yet much gratified that he had not forgotten her 
 oh indeed said annie with a funny look as meg slipped the note into her pocket as a sort of talisman against envy vanity and false pride for the few loving words had done her good and the flowers cheered her up by their beauty 
 feeling almost happy again she laid by a few ferns and roses for herself and quickly made up the rest in dainty bouquets for the breasts hair or skirts of her friends offering them so prettily that clara the elder sister told her she was the sweetest little thing she ever saw and they looked quite charmed with her small attention somehow the kind act finished her despondency and when all the rest went to show themselves to mrs moffat she saw a happy face in the mirror as she laid her ferns against her rippling hair and fastened the roses in the dress that strike her as so very shabby now 
 she enjoyed herself very much that evening for she danced to her content everyone was very kind and she had three compliments annie made her sing and some one said she had a remarkably fine voice major lincoln asked who the fresh little girl with the beautiful eyes was and mr moffat insisted on dancing with her because she dawdle but had some spring in her as he gracefully expressed it so altogether she had a very nice time till she overheard a bit of conversation which disturbed her extremely she was sitting just inside the conservatory waiting for her partner to bring her an ice when she heard a voice ask on the other side of the flowery wall 
 how old is he 
 sixteen or seventeen i should say replied another voice 
 it would be a grand thing for one of those girls it sallie says they are very intimate now and the old man quite dotes on them 
 mrs m has made her plans i dare say and will play her cards well early as it is the girl evidently think of it yet said mrs moffat 
 she told that fib about her momma as if she did know and colored up when the flowers came quite prettily poor thing be so nice if she was only got up in style do you think be offended if we offered to lend her a dress for thursday asked another voice 
 proud but i believe mind for that dowdy tarlatan is all she has got she may tear it tonight and that will be a good excuse for offering a decent one 
 here partner appeared to find her looking much flushed and rather agitated she was proud and her pride was useful just then for it helped her hide her mortification anger and disgust at what she had just heard for innocent and unsuspicious as she was she could not help understanding the gossip of her friends she tried to forget it but could not and kept repeating to herself mrs m has made her plans that fib about her mamma and dowdy tarlatan till she was ready to cry and rush home to tell her troubles and ask for advice as that was impossible she did her best to seem gay and being rather excited she succeeded so well that no one dreamed what an effort she was making she was very glad when it was all over and she was quiet in her bed where she could think and wonder and fume till her head ached and her hot cheeks were cooled by a few natural tears those foolish yet well meant words had opened a new world to meg and much disturbed the peace of the old one in which till now she had lived as happily as a child her innocent friendship with laurie was spoiled by the silly speeches she had overheard her faith in her mother was a little shaken by the worldly plans attributed to her by mrs moffat who judged others by herself and the sensible resolution to be contented with the simple wardrobe which suited a poor daughter was weakened by the unnecessary pity of girls who thought a shabby dress one of the greatest calamities under heaven 
 poor meg had a restless night and got up unhappy half resentful toward her friends and half ashamed of herself for not speaking out frankly and setting everything right everybody dawdled that morning and it was noon before the girls found energy enough even to take up their worsted work something in the manner of her friends struck meg at once they treated her with more respect she thought took quite a tender interest in what she said and looked at her with eyes that plainly betrayed curiosity all this surprised and flattered her though she did not understand it till miss belle looked up from her writing and said with a sentimental air 
 daisy dear sent an invitation to your friend mr laurence for thursday we should like to know him and only a proper compliment to you 
 meg colored but a mischievous fancy to tease the girls made her reply demurely you are very kind but afraid he come 
 why not cherie asked miss belle 
 too old 
 my child what do you mean what is his age i beg to know cried miss clara 
 nearly seventy i believe answered meg counting stitches to hide the merriment in her eyes 
 you sly creature of course we meant the young man exclaimed miss belle laughing 
 there any laurie is only a little boy and meg laughed also at the queer look which the sisters exchanged as she thus described her supposed you age nan said 
 nearer my sister i am seventeen in august returned meg tossing her head 
 very nice of him to send you flowers it said annie looking wise about nothing 
 yes he often does to all of us for their house is full and we are so fond of them my mother and old mr laurence are friends you know so it is quite natural that we children should play together and meg hoped they would say no more 
 evident daisy out yet said miss clara to belle with a nod 
 quite a pastoral state of innocence all round returned miss belle with a shrug 
 going out to get some little matters for my girls can i do anything for you young ladies asked mrs moffat lumbering in like an elephant in silk and lace 
 no thank you replied sallie got my new pink silk for thursday and want a thing 
 nor i began meg but stopped because it occurred to her that she did want several things and could not have them 
 what shall you wear asked sallie 
 my old white one again if i can mend it fit to be seen it got sadly torn last night said meg trying to speak quite easily but feeling very uncomfortable 
 why you send home for another said sallie who was not an observing young lady 
 i got any other it cost meg an effort to say that but sallie did not see it and exclaimed in amiable surprise only that how funny she did not finish her speech for belle shook her head at her and broke in saying kindly 
 not at all where is the use of having a lot of dresses when she out yet no need of sending home daisy even if you had a dozen for got a sweet blue silk laid away which outgrown and you shall wear it to please me you dear 
 you are very kind but i mind my old dress if you it does well enough for a little girl like me said meg 
 now do let me please myself by dressing you up in style i admire to do it and be a regular little beauty with a touch here and there i let anyone see you till you are done and then burst upon them like cinderella and her godmother going to the ball said belle in her persuasive tone 
 meg refuse the offer so kindly made for a desire to see if she would be a little beauty after touching up caused her to accept and forget all her former uncomfortable feelings toward the moffats 
 on the thursday evening belle shut herself up with her maid and between them they turned meg into a fine lady they crimped and curled her hair they polished her neck and arms with some fragrant powder touched her lips with coralline salve to make them redder and hortense would have added a soupcon of rouge if meg had not rebelled they laced her into a dress which was so tight she could hardly breathe and so low in the neck that modest meg blushed at herself in the mirror a set of silver filagree was added bracelets necklace brooch and even earrings for hortense tied them on with a bit of pink silk which did not show a cluster of buds at the bosom and a ruche reconciled meg to the display of her pretty white shoulders and a pair of silk boots satisfied the last wish of her heart a lace handkerchief a plumy fan and a bouquet in a shoulder holder finished her off and miss belle surveyed her with the satisfaction of a little girl with a newly dressed doll 
 mademoiselle is chatmante tres jolie is she not cried hortense clasping her hands in an affected rapture 
 come and show yourself said miss belle leading the way to the room where the others were waiting 
 as meg went rustling after with her long skirts trailing her earrings tinkling her curls waving and her heart beating she felt as if her fun had really begun at last for the mirror had plainly told her that she was a little beauty her friends repeated the pleasing phrase enthusiastically and for several minutes she stood like a jackdaw in the fable enjoying her borrowed plumes while the rest chattered like a party of magpies 
 while i dress do you drill her nan in the management of her skirt and those french heels or she will trip herself up take your silver butterfly and catch up that long curl on the left side of her head clara and any of you disturb the charming work of my hands said belle as she hurried away looking well pleased with her success 
 you look a bit like yourself but you are very nice nowhere beside you for belle has heaps of taste and quite french i assure you let your flowers hang be so careful of them and be sure you trip returned sallie trying not to care that meg was prettier than herself 
 keeping that warning carefully in mind margaret got safely downstairs and sailed into the drawing rooms where the moffats and a few early guests were assembled she very soon discovered that there is a charm about fine clothes which attracts a certain class of people and secures their respect several young ladies who had taken no notice of her before were very affectionate all of a sudden several young gentlemen who had only stared at her at the other party now not only stared but asked to be introduced and said all manner of foolish but agreeable things to her and several old ladies who sat on the sofas and criticized the rest of the party inquired who she was with an air of interest she heard mrs moffat reply to one of them 
 daisy a colonel in the of our first families but reverses of fortune you know intimate friends of the laurences sweet creature i assure you my ned is quite wild about her 
 dear me said the old lady putting up her glass for another observation of meg who tried to look as if she had not heard and been rather shocked at mrs fibs the queer feeling did not pass away but she imagined herself acting the new part of fine lady and so got on pretty well though the tight dress gave her a the train kept getting under her feet and she was in constant fear lest her earrings should fly off and get lost or broken she was flirting her fan and laughing at the feeble jokes of a young gentleman who tried to be witty when she suddenly stopped laughing and looked confused for just opposite she saw laurie he was staring at her with undisguised surprise and disapproval also she thought for though he bowed and smiled yet something in his honest eyes made her blush and wish she had her old dress on to complete her confusion she saw belle nudge annie and both glance from her to laurie who she was happy to see looked unusually boyish and shy 
 silly creatures to put such thoughts into my head i care for it or let it change me a bit thought meg and rustled across the room to shake hands with her friend 
 glad you came i was afraid you she said with her most air 
 jo wanted me to come and tell her how you looked so i did answered laurie without turning his eyes upon her though he half smiled at her maternal tone 
 what shall you tell her asked meg full of curiosity to know his opinion of her yet feeling ill at ease with him for the first time 
 i shall say i know you for you look so and unlike yourself quite afraid of you he said fumbling at his glove button 
 how absurd of you the girls dressed me up for fun and i rather like it jo stare if she saw me said meg bent on making him say whether he thought her improved or not 
 yes i think she would returned laurie gravely 
 you like me so asked meg 
 no i was the blunt reply 
 why not in an anxious tone 
 he glanced at her frizzled head bare shoulders and fantastically trimmed dress with an expression that abashed her more than his answer which had not particle of his usual politeness in it 
 i like fuss and feathers 
 that was altogether too much from a lad younger than herself and meg walked away saying petulantly you are the rudest boy i ever saw 
 feeling very much ruffled she went and stood at a quiet window to cool her cheeks for the tight dress gave her an uncomfortably brilliant color as she stood there major lincoln passed by and a minute after she heard him saying to his mother 
 they are making a fool of that little girl i wanted you to see her but they have spoiled her entirely nothing but a doll tonight 
 oh dear sighed meg i wish been sensible and worn my own things then i should not have disgusted other people or felt so uncomfortable and ashamed of myself 
 she leaned her forehead on the cool pane and stood half hidden by the curtains never minding that her favorite waltz had begun till some one touched her and turning she saw laurie looking penitent as he said with his very best bow and his hand out 
 please forgive my rudeness and come and dance with me 
 afraid it will be to disagreeable to you said meg trying to look offended and failing entirely 
 not a bit of it dying to do it come be good i like your gown but i do think you are just splendid and he waved his hands as if words failed to express his admiration meg smiled and relented and whispered as they stood waiting to catch the time take care my skirt trip you up the plague of my life and i was a goose to wear it 
 pin it round your neck and then it will be useful said laurie looking down at the little blue boots which he evidently approved of away they went fleetly and gracefully for having practiced at home they were well matched and the blithe young couple were a pleasant sight to see as they twirled merrily round and round feeling more friendly than ever after their small tiff 
 laurie i want you to do me a favor will you said meg as he stood fanning her when her breath gave out which it did very soon though she would not own why 
 i said laurie with alacrity 
 please tell them at home about my dress tonight 
 they understand the joke and it will worry mother 
 then why did you do it said eyes so plainly that meg hastily added 
 i shall tell them myself all about it and fess to mother how silly been but rather do it myself so not tell will you 
 i give you my word i only what shall i say when they ask me 
 just say i looked pretty well and was having a good time 
 say the first with all my heart but how about the other you look as if you were having a good time are you and laurie looked at her with an expression which made her answer in a whisper 
 no not just now think horrid i only wanted a little fun but this sort pay i find and getting tired of it 
 here comes ned moffat what does he want said laurie knitting his black brows as if he did not regard his young host in the light of a pleasant addition to the party 
 he put his name down for three dances and i suppose coming for them what a bore said meg assuming a languid air which amused laurie immensely 
 he did not speak to her again till suppertime when he saw her drinking champagne with ned and his friend fisher who were behaving like a pair of fools as laurie said to himself for he felt a brotherly sort of right to watch over the marches and fight their battles whenever a defender was needed 
 have a splitting headache tomorrow if you drink much of that i meg your mother like it you know he whispered leaning over her chair as ned turned to refill her glass and fisher stooped to pick up her fan 
 not meg tonight a doll who does all sorts of crazy things tomorrow i shall put away my fuss and feathers and be desperately good again se answered with an affected little laugh 
 wish tomorrow was here then muttered laurie walking off at the change he saw in her 
 meg danced and flirted chattered and giggled as the other girls did after supper she undertook the german and blundered through it nearly upsetting her partner with her long skirt and romping in a way that scandalized laurie who looked on and meditated a lecture but he got no chance to deliver it for meg kept away from him till he came to say good night 
 remember she said trying to smile for the splitting headache had already begun 
 silence a la mort replied laurie with a melodramatic flourish as he went away 
 this little bit of byplay excited curiosity but meg was too tired for gossip and went to bed feeling as if she had been to a masquerade and enjoyed herself as much as she expected she was sick all the next day and on saturday went home quite used up with her fun and feeling that she had sat in the lap of luxury long enough 
 it does seem pleasant to be quiet and not have company manners on all the time home is a nice place though it splendid said meg looking about her with a restful expression as she sat with her mother and jo on the sunday evening 
 glad to hear you say so dear for i was afraid home would seem dull and poor to you after your fine quarters replied her mother who had given her many anxious looks that day for motherly eyes are quick to see any change in faces 
 meg had told her adventures gayly and said over and over what a charming time she had had but something still seemed to weigh upon her spirits and when the younger girls were gone to bed she sat thoughtfully staring at the fire saying little and looking worried as the clock struck nine and jo proposed bed meg suddenly left her chair and taking stool leaned her elbows on her knee saying bravely 
 marmee i want to fess 
 i thought so what is it dear 
 shall i go away asked jo discreetly 
 of course not i always tell you everything i was ashamed to speak of it before the younger children but i want you to know all the dreadful things i did at the moffats 
 we are prepared said mrs march smiling but looking a little anxious 
 i told you they dressed me up but i tell you that they powdered and squeezed and frizzled and made me look like a fashion plate laurie thought i proper i know he did though he say so and one man called me a doll i knew it was silly but they flattered me and said i was a beauty and quantities of nonsense so i let them make a fool of me 
 is that all asked jo as mrs march looked silently at the downcast face of her pretty daughter and could not find it in her heart to blame her little follies 
 no i drank champagne and romped and tried to flirt and was altogether abominable said meg 
 there is something more i think and mrs march smoothed the soft cheek which suddenly grew rosy as meg answered slowly 
 yes very silly but i want to tell it because i hate to have people say and think such things about us and laurie 
 then she told the various bits of gossip she had heard at the moffats and as she spoke jo saw her mother fold her lips tightly as if ill pleased that such ideas should be put into innocent mind 
 well if that the greatest rubbish i ever heard cried jo indignantly why you pop out and tell them so on the spot 
 i it was so embarrassing for me i help hearing at first and then i was so angry and ashamed i remember that i ought to go away 
 just wait till i see annie moffat and show you how to settle such ridiculous stuff the idea of having plans and being kind to laurie because rich and may marry us he shout when i tell him what those silly things say about us poor children and jo laughed as if on second thoughts the thing struck her as a good joke 
 if you tell laurie never forgive you she must she mother said meg looking distressed 
 no never repeat that foolish gossip and forget it as soon as you can said mrs march gravely i was very unwise to let you go among people of whom i know so little kind i dare say but worldly and full of these vulgar ideas about young people i am more sorry than i can express for the mischief this visit may have done you meg 
 be sorry i let it hurt me forget all the bad and remember only the good for i did enjoy a great deal and thank you very much for letting me go not be sentimental or dissatisfied mother i know a silly little girl and stay with you till fit to take care of myself but it is nice to be praised and admired and i help saying i like it said meg looking half ashamed of the confession 
 that is perfectly natural and quite harmless if the liking does not become a passion and lead one to do foolish or unmaidenly things learn to know and value the praise which is worth having and to excite the admiration of excellent people by being modest as well as pretty meg 
 margaret sat thinking a moment while jo stood with her hands behind her looking both interested and a little perplexed for it was a new thing to see meg blushing and talking about admiration lovers and things of that sort and jo felt as if during that fortnight her sister had grown up amazingly and was drifting away from her into a world where she could not follow 
 mother do you have plans as mrs moffat said asked meg bashfully 
 yes my dear i have a great many all mothers do but mine differ somewhat from mrs i suspect i will tell you some of them for the time has come when a word may set this romantic little head and heart of yours right on a very serious subject you are young meg but not too young to understand me and mothers lips are the fittest to speak of such things to girls like you jo your turn will come in time perhaps so listen to my plans and help me carry them out if they are good 
 jo went and sat on one arm of the chair looking as if she thought they were about to join in some very solemn affair holding a hand of each and watching the two young faces wistfully mrs march said in her serious yet cheery way 
 i want my daughters to be beautiful accomplished and good to be admired loved and respected to have a happy youth to be well and wisely married and to lead useful pleasant lives with as little care and sorrow to try them as god sees fit to send to be loved and chosen by a good man is the best and sweetest thing which can happen to a woman and i sincerely hope my girls may know this beautiful experience it is natural to think of it meg right to hope and wait for it and wise to prepare for it so that when the happy time comes you may feel ready for the duties and worthy of the joy my dear girls i am ambitious for you but not to have you make a dash in the world marry rich men merely because they are rich or have splendid houses which are not homes because love is wanting money is a needful and precious thing and when well used a noble thing but i never want you to think it is the first or only prize to strive for rather see you poor wives if you were happy beloved contented than queens on thrones without and peace 
 poor girls stand any chance belle says unless they put themselves forward sighed meg 
 then be old maids said jo stoutly right jo better be happy old maids than unhappy wives or unmaidenly girls running about to find husbands said mrs march decidedly be troubled meg poverty seldom daunts a sincere lover some of the best and most honored women i know were poor girls but so that they were not allowed to be old maids leave these things to time make this home happy so that you may be fit for homes of your own if they are offered you and contented here if they are not one thing remember my girls mother is always ready to be your confidante father to be your friend and both of hope and trust that our daughters whether married or single will be the pride and comfort of out lives 
 we will marmee we will cried both with all their hearts as she bade them good night

 roman holiday 
 part 
 
 giovanni 
 ah double my money eh you tell me you want double my money joe 
 waving his hand up at him reassuring him 
 tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow that way 
 
 repeating to himself after joe has walked past 
 eh tomorrow 
 
 ann walks out onto the busy city street dodging a motorbike as she arrives from a she looks out fascinated at all the activity momentarily intimidated but then venturing out confidently as she enjoys the bustle of the city around her 
 joe peers down the street after her running between the people in order to keep within sight he follows her into a market as ann wanders along taking her time just enjoying herself she walks past several vendors offering her their goods 
 as ann stops to look at a stall joe has to back off and is instantly targetted by the nearest vendor who offers him some of his huge melons he shakes his head at him more interested in keeping an eye on ann who tries on a pair of shoes at the stall then pays the woman vendor for them vendor persists and joe finally buys the melon off him which at once quietens him down so carrying the melon he follows ann down to another street where she stops looking out at the fontana di trevi a magnificent facade ornamented with statues fronted by a pool 
 ann continues down the street that runs beside the fountain stopping outside a salon to look at the drawings of hairstyles in the window which surround a mirror she appears disappointed at the way she looks in the mirror and after smiling at the hair of someone who walks past decides to go inside 
 joe walks up the the shop smiling when he sees where she has gone 
 
 inside the hair salon ann sits on one of the seats in front of the large mirror holding up her long hair as the hairdresser mario delani fastens the cover around her 
 
 mario delani 
 speaking rather hesitant english 
 what a wonderful er hair you have 
 
 he asks her something in italian 
 
 ann 
 just cut thank you 
 
 mario delani 
 just cut 
 
 takes the scissors from his hair 
 well then cut er so 
 
 he holds the hair at a certain length 
 
 ann 
 higher 
 
 mario delani 
 higher 
 
 he holds the hair further up 
 here 
 
 ann 
 more 
 
 mario delani 
 here 
 
 ann 
 even more 
 
 mario delani 
 impatiently 
 where 
 
 ann 
 she holds her hair at the shoulders 
 there 
 
 mario delani 
 there 
 
 snapping his scissors nervously 
 are you sure miss 
 
 ann 
 emphatically 
 quite sure thank you 
 
 mario delani 
 he turns he round in the chair taking her hair in his hand 
 all off 
 
 ann 
 all off 
 joe peers in them through the beaded curtain still holding his melon 
 mario delani 
 uncomfortable as he starts cutting off her long hair 
 off 
 joe goes outside looking round then walks away down the street 
 ann sits in the salon still her hair covering her face 
 
 mario delani 
 pulling apart her hair to see her 
 are you sure 
 
 ann 
 impatiently 
 yes 
 
 mario delani 
 dropping her hair back over her face 
 yes 
 
 as he cuts her locks off working his way round 
 off off off 
 
 wipes his forehead with his arm 
 joe finds a public phone down the street opposite the fountain joe waits impatiently studying his melon as another person speaks on the phone in italian then seeing a group of children playing on the statue goes over to one of them passing his melon to a boy 
 back in the salon the hairdresser cuts of the last lock of her hair 
 
 mario delani 
 off 
 
 he stands to the side of her as they both study the end result as ann moves her head slightly from side to side she looks down at something but engrossed in her the hairdresser jerks her head back to the centre to get a better view 
 outside joe sees a group of american schoolgirls playing and talking around the fountain he approaches one who carries a camera 
 
 joe 
 gently coaxing her to get a look at the camera 
 a nice little camera you have there ah nice mmmm er you mind if i just borrow it do you 
 
 he tries to coax it off her but the strap is around her neck 
 
 schoolgirl 
 calling out putting her hand up 
 miss weber 
 
 joe 
 give it back just for a couple of minutes 
 
 schoolgirl 
 trying to resist him 
 no go my camera 
 their teacher comes over looking over joe darkly he lets go of the camera as the teacher leads the student away then holds his head in his hand embarrassed 
 in the salon someone sweeps the hair up off the floor mario delani is combing her hair touching up the ends 
 
 mario delani 
 you musician maybe you artist aha painter i know you model 
 
 she smiles flattered 
 model hah 
 
 ann

 repeating to himself after joe has walked past

 ann walks out onto the busy city street dodging a motorbike as she arrives from a she looks out fascinated at all the activity momentarily intimidated but then venturing out confidently as she enjoys the bustle of the city around her 
 joe peers down the street after her running between the people in order to keep within sight he follows her into a market as ann wanders along taking her time just enjoying herself she walks past several vendors offering her their goods 
 as ann stops to look at a stall joe has to back off and is instantly targetted by the nearest vendor who offers him some of his huge melons he shakes his head at him more interested in keeping an eye on ann who tries on a pair of shoes at the stall then pays the woman vendor for them vendor persists and joe finally buys the melon off him which at once quietens him down so carrying the melon he follows ann down to another street where she stops looking out at the fontana di trevi a magnificent facade ornamented with statues fronted by a pool 
 ann continues down the street that runs beside the fountain stopping outside a salon to look at the drawings of hairstyles in the window which surround a mirror she appears disappointed at the way she looks in the mirror and after smiling at the hair of someone who walks past decides to go inside 
 joe walks up the the shop smiling when he sees where she has gone 
 
 inside the hair salon ann sits on one of the seats in front of the large mirror holding up her long hair as the hairdresser mario delani fastens the cover around her 
 
 mario delani 
 speaking rather hesitant english 
 what a wonderful er hair you have 
 
 he asks her something in italian 
 
 ann

 mario delani

 mario delani

 snapping his scissors nervously 
 are you sure miss 
 
 ann 
 emphatically 
 quite sure thank you 
 
 mario delani 
 he turns he round in the chair taking her hair in his hand 
 all off 
 
 ann 
 all off 
 joe peers in them through the beaded curtain still holding his melon 
 mario delani 
 uncomfortable as he starts cutting off her long hair 
 off 
 joe goes outside looking round then walks away down the street 
 ann sits in the salon still her hair covering her face 
 
 mario delani 
 pulling apart her hair to see her 
 are you sure 
 
 ann 
 impatiently 
 yes 
 
 mario delani 
 dropping her hair back over her face 
 yes 
 
 as he cuts her locks off working his way round 
 off off off 
 
 wipes his forehead with his arm 
 joe finds a public phone down the street opposite the fountain joe waits impatiently studying his melon as another person speaks on the phone in italian then seeing a group of children playing on the statue goes over to one of them passing his melon to a boy 
 back in the salon the hairdresser cuts of the last lock of her hair 
 
 mario delani 
 off 
 
 he stands to the side of her as they both study the end result as ann moves her head slightly from side to side she looks down at something but engrossed in her the hairdresser jerks her head back to the centre to get a better view 
 outside joe sees a group of american schoolgirls playing and talking around the fountain he approaches one who carries a camera 
 
 joe 
 gently coaxing her to get a look at the camera 
 a nice little camera you have there ah nice mmmm er you mind if i just borrow it do you 
 
 he tries to coax it off her but the strap is around her neck 
 
 schoolgirl 
 calling out putting her hand up 
 miss weber 
 
 joe 
 give it back just for a couple of minutes 
 
 schoolgirl 
 trying to resist him 
 no go my camera 
 their teacher comes over looking over joe darkly he lets go of the camera as the teacher leads the student away then holds his head in his hand embarrassed 
 in the salon someone sweeps the hair up off the floor mario delani is combing her hair touching up the ends 
 
 mario delani

 she smiles flattered

 she finally laughs he lowers the camera and smiles 
 ricky to see the most beautiful thing ever filmed

 jane sits on the bed she watches tv her brow furrowed trying to figure out why this is beautiful 
 from a chair across the room ricky watches smiling 
 rickyit was one of those days when a minute away from snowing and this electricity in the air you can almost hear it right and this bag was like dancing with me like a little kid begging me to play with it for fifteen minutes and the day i knew there was this entire life behind things and this incredibly benevolent force that wanted me to know there was no reason to be afraid ever 
 a beat 
 ricky a poor excuse but it helps me remember and i need to remember 
 now jane is watching him 
 ricky so much beauty in the world i feel like i take it like my going to cave in 
 he points a remote at the tv and switches it off then justsits there lost in thought not unlike his mother 
 after a moment jane gets up ricky watches impassively asshe kneels in front of him and takes his hands and kisses them then she leans up and kisses him softly on the lips his eyes scan hers curious to see how she reacts to this 
 my god what time is it

 int fitts house bedroom continuous 
 behind ricky as he videotapes jane in her window she has now removed her shirt and jeans she stands there in her bra and panties then reaches behind her back to unhook the bra 
 on video we zoom toward jane as she takes off her braclumsily obviously embarrassed but gone this far and no turning back she stands there with her breasts exposed trying to look defiant but achingly vulnerable we continue zooming toward her face as close as we can get to the desperate yearning in her eyes 
 suddenly the door is thrown open and the colonel enters incensed carrying his keys startled ricky turns around as soon as his eyes meet his he knows up

 angle on the open box filled with photographs the colonel pulls one from the bottom of the box 
 close on the grainy black white photograph in his callusedhands of two young servicemen standing in front of a jeep both shirtless and wearing fatigues their muscular arms are draped lazily around each shoulders as they grin for the camera one of these men is the colonel himself albeit much younger almost thirty years younger 
 close on the face as he studies the photo his breathing has finally relaxed his face has gone vacant

 we hear keys turning then the door opens and the colonelenters still disturbed by what he just saw he places his briefcase and keys on the desk then sits and tries to sort through the mail in his hand unable to concentrate he throws the mail down angry he sits very still for a moment some internal struggle obviously taking place then grabs his keys off the desk and turns to unlock the cabinet behind the desk only to find that already open 
 int fitts house bedroom continuous 
 behind ricky as he videotapes jane in her window she has now removed her shirt and jeans she stands there in her bra and panties then reaches behind her back to unhook the bra 
 on video we zoom toward jane as she takes off her braclumsily obviously embarrassed but gone this far and no turning back she stands there with her breasts exposed trying to look defiant but achingly vulnerable we continue zooming toward her face as close as we can get to the desperate yearning in her eyes 
 suddenly the door is thrown open and the colonel enters incensed carrying his keys startled ricky turns around as soon as his eyes meet his he knows up 
 rickydad i just wanted to show

 he lunges toward ricky who scrambles to dodge him but thecolonel is too fast and too agile he quickly grabs the boy by the throat and shoves him up against the wall 
 ext burnham house continuous 
 pov in the window across from us the colonel proceeds to give ricky a serious beating punching his face 
 int fitts house bedroom continuous 
 lip is bleeping but he maintains a clear steady gaze at this father during this violence

 rickyi know sorry 
 colonelyou need structure you need discipline 
 i know thank you for trying to teach give up on me dad 
 the colonel still breathing heavily regards his son forthe briefest moment we see a flash of tenderness across his face but then gone he gets up 
 colonelyou stay out of there 
 he leaves quickly glancing back toward the window on hisway out ricky then gets up and goes into his bathroom where he starts to calmly wash the blood from his face 
 int burnham house jane s bedroom continuous 
 jane sits on her bed crying shaken by what she just saw 
 int fitts house the study continuous 
 the colonel enters still breathing heavily and locks thedoor behind him he paces for a moment agitated then crosses to the cabinet behind his desk and opens it he removes the nazi platter and gingerly places it on the desk then does the same with several other items until he uncovers a small metal box he sits behind the desk staring at the box troubled he finally opens it 
 angle on the open box filled with photographs the colonel pulls one from the bottom of the box 
 close on the grainy black white photograph in his callusedhands of two young servicemen standing in front of a jeep both shirtless and wearing fatigues their muscular arms are draped lazily around each shoulders as they grin for the camera one of these men is the colonel himself albeit much younger almost thirty years younger 
 close on the face as he studies the photo his breathing has finally relaxed his face has gone vacant 
 int fitts house master bedroom night 
 late at night looking down on the colonel and barbara in bed she snores softly but the colonel is awake staring straight up at us after a moment he pushes the covers back gets out of bed and exits the room noisily but barbara is sleeping the sleep of the dead and wake 
 int fitts house kitchen moments later 
 the colonel enters agitated he flips on the lights thenopens the refrigerator scans its contents and closes the door without having noticed what was inside he paces around the kitchen then stops in his tracks when he sees 
 his pov through the window over the sink we can see throughthe garage door window of the burnham house next door inside the garage lester wearing only briefs stands doing shoulder presses his upper body glistening in sweat is pumped 
 the colonel quickly crosses to the light switch and switchesthe lights off he stands absolutely still for a moment then drags a chair from the kitchen table over to the sink and sits in the dark watching lester 
 fade to black 
 in darkness we hear repetitive gunshots 
 fade in

 int power plant close on body 
 floating in a amnion 
 his body spasms fighting against the thick gelatin 
 metal tubes surreal versions of hospital tubes obscure 
 his face other lines like ivs are connected to limbs 
 and cover his genitals 
 he is struggling desperately now air bubbles into the 
 but does not break the surface 
 pressing up the surface distends stretching like a red 
 rubber coccon 
 unable to breathe he fights wildly to stand clawing at 
 the thinning elastic shroud 
 until it ruptures a hole widening around his mouth as he 
 sucks for air tearing himself free he emerges from the 
 cell 
 it is neo 
 he is bald and naked his body slick with gelatin 
 dizzy nauseous he waits for his vision to focus 
 he is standing in an oval capsule of clear alloy filled 
 with red gelatin the surface of which has solidified 
 like curdled milk 
 the ivs in his arms are plugged into outlets that appear 
 to be grafted to his flesh 
 he feels the weight of another cable and reaches to the 
 back of his head where he finds an enormous coaxial 
 plugged and locked into the base of his skull 
 he tries to pull it out but it would be easier to pull 
 off a finger 
 to either side he sees other pods filled with 
 red gelatin beneath the surface pale and 
 motionless he sees other human beings 
 fanning out in a circle there are more all connected 
 to a center core each capsule like a red dimly glowing 
 petal attached to a black metal stem 
 above him level after level the stem rises seemingly 
 forever he moves to the foot of the capsule and looks 
 out 
 the image assaults his mind 
 towers of glowing petals spiral up to incomprehensible 
 heights disappearing down into a dim murk like an 
 underwater abyss 
 his sight is blurred and warped exaggerating the 
 intensity of the vision the sound of the plant is like 
 the sound of the ocean heard from inside the belly of 
 leviathan 
 below neo a petal detaches from the stem bearing away 
 the body of an old man like an automated barge even as a 
 new pod rises up and plugs itself into the empty space 
 inside the new capsule its surface more translucent and 
 pinkish in color neo sees a small baby 
 from above a machine drops directly in front of neo 
 he swallows his scream as it seems to stare at him 
 it is almost in its design beautiful 
 housings of alloyed metal covering systems 
 of hard and soft polymers 
 a black particle beam washes over neo he reacts in pain 
 as the scanner seems to expose the nervous system wired 
 to the coaxial cable at his cerebral cortex 
 at the back of the neck the cable lock spins and opens 
 disengaging 
 the cable pulls itself free a long clear plastic needle 
 and slides from the anterior of neols skull 
 with an ooze of blood and spinal fluid the other 
 connective hoses snap free and snake away as 
 the back of the unit opens and a tremendous vacuum like 
 an airplane door opening sucks the gelatin and then neo 
 into a black hole 
 
 int waste line 
 the pipe is a waste disposal system and neo falls 
 sliding with the clot of gelatin 
 banking through pipe spirals and elbows flushing up 
 through grease traps clogged with cily clunps of 
 cellulite 
 neo begins to drown when he is suddenly snatched from the 
 flow of waste 
 the metallic cable then lifts pulling him up into the 
 belly of the futuristic flying nachine hovering inside 
 the sewer main line 
 
 int hovercraft 
 the metal harness opens and drops the neo 
 onto the floor 
 human hands and arms help him up as he finds himself 
 looking straight at morpheus 
 trinity and apoc and others dressed in bizarre high 
 tech combat gear 
 morpheus smiles 
 morpheus 
 welcome to the real world neo 
 neo passes out 
 fade to black 
 we have no sense of time we hear voices whispering

 do you think morpheus is right 
 do you think he could be the one

 it matter now but if wrong

 dozer and morpheus are operating on neo 
 neo 
 what are you doing

 attracted no doubt by shout argus filch came shouldering his way through the crowd then he saw mrs norris and fell back clutching his face in horror 
 
 my cat my cat happened to mrs norris he shrieked 
 
 and his popping eyes fell on harry 
 
 screeched you murdered my cat killed her kill you 
 
 argus 
 
 dumbledore had arrived on the scene followed by a number of other teachers in seconds he had swept past harry ron and hermione and detached mrs norris from the torch bracket 
 
 come with me argus he said to filch you too mr potter mr weasley miss granger 
 
 lockhart stepped forward eagerly 
 
 my office is nearest headmaster just upstairs please feel free 
 
 thank you gilderoy said dumbledore 
 
 the silent crowd parted to let them pass lockhart looking excited and important hurried after dumbledore so did professors mcgonagall and snape 
 
 as they entered darkened office there was a flurry of movement across the walls harry saw several of the lockharts in the pictures dodging out of sight their hair in rollers the real lockhart lit the candles on his desk and stood back dumbledore lay mrs norris on the polished surface and began to examine her harry ron and hermione exchanged tense looks and sank into chairs outside the pool of candlelight watching 
 
 the tip of long crooked nose was barely an inch from mrs fur he was looking at her closely through his spectacles his long fingers gently prodding and poking professor mcgonagall was bent almost as close her eyes narrowed snape loomed behind them half in shadow wearing a most peculiar expression it was as though he was trying hard not to smile and lockhart was hovering around all of them making suggestions 
 
 it was definitely a curse that killed her probably the transmogrifian torture seen it used many times so unlucky i there i know the very countercurse that would have saved her 
 
 comments were punctuated by dry racking sobs he was slumped in a chair by the desk unable to look at mrs norris his face in his hands much as he detested filch harry help feeling a bit sorry for him though not nearly as sorry as he felt for himself if dumbledore believed filch he would be expelled for sure 
 
 dumbledore was now muttering strange words under his breath and tapping mrs norris with his wand but nothing happened she continued to look as though she had been recently stuffed 
 
 i remember something very similar happening in ouagadogou said lockhart a series of attacks the full in my autobiography i was able to provide the townsfolk with various amulets which cleared the matter up at once 
 
 the photographs of lockhart on the walls were all nodding in agreement as he talked one of them had forgotten to remove his hair net 
 
 at last dumbledore straightened up 
 
 not dead argus he said softly 
 
 lockhart stopped abruptly in the middle of counting the number of murders he had prevented 
 
 not dead choked filch looking through his fingers at mrs norris but she all all stiff and frozen 
 
 she has been petrified said dumbledore ah i thought so said lockhart but how i cannot say 
 
 ask him shrieked filch turning his blotched and tearstained face to harry 
 
 no second year could have done this said dumbledore firmly it would take dark magic of the most advanced 
 
 he did it he did it filch spat his pouchy face purpling you saw what he wrote on the wall he found in my office he knows a a face worked horribly he knows a squib he finished 
 
 i never touched mrs norris harry said loudly uncomfortably aware of everyone looking at him including all the lockharts on the walls and i even know what a squib is 
 
 rubbish snarled filch he saw my kwikspell letter 
 
 if i might speak headmaster said snape from the shadows and sense of foreboding increased he was sure nothing snape had to say was going to do him any good 
 
 potter and his friends may have simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time he said a slight sneer curling his mouth as though he doubted it but we do have a set of suspicious circumstances here why was he in the upstairs corridor at all why he at the halloween feast 
 
 harry ron and hermione all launched into an explanation about the deathday party there were hundreds of ghosts tell you we were there 
 
 but why not join the feast afterward said snape his black eyes glittering in the candlelight why go up to that corridor 
 
 ron and hermione looked at harry 
 
 because because harry said his heart thumping very fast something told him it would sound very if he told them he had been led there by a bodiless voice no one but he could hear because we were tired and wanted to go to bed he said 
 
 without any supper said snape a triumphant smile flickering across his gaunt face i think ghosts provided food fit for living people at their parties 
 
 we hungry said ron loudly as his stomach gave a huge rumble 
 
 nasty smile widened 
 
 i suggest headmaster that potter is not being entirely truthful he said it might be a good idea if he were deprived of certain privileges until he is ready to tell us the whole story i personally feel he should be taken off the gryffindor quidditch team until he is ready to be honest 
 
 really severus said professor mcgonagall sharply i see no reason to stop the boy playing quidditch this cat hit over the head with a broomstick there is no evidence at all that potter has done anything wrong 
 
 dumbledore was giving harry a searching look his twinkling gaze made harry feel as though he were being 
 
 innocent until proven guilty severus he said firmly 
 
 snape looked furious 
 
 so did filch 
 
 my cat has been petrified he shrieked his eyes popping i want to see some punishment 
 
 we will be able to cure her argus said dumbledore patiently professer sprout recently managed to procure some mandrakes as soon as they have reached their full size i will have a potion made that will revive mrs norris 
 
 make it lockhart butted in i must have done it a hundred times i could whip up a mandrake restorative draught in my sleep 
 
 excuse me said snape icily but i believe i am the potions master at this school 
 
 there was a very awkward pause 
 
 you may go dumbledore said to harry ron and hermione 
 
 they went as quickly as they could without actually running when they were a floor up from office they turned into an empty classroom and closed the door quietly behind them harry squinted at his faces 
 
 think i should have told them about that voice i heard 
 
 no said ron without hesitation hearing voices no one else can hear a good sign even in the wizarding world 
 
 something in voice made harry ask you do believe me you 
 
 course i do said ron quickly but you must admit weird 
 
 i know weird said harry the whole weird what was that writing on the wall about the chamber has been opened that supposed to mean 
 
 you know it rings a sort of bell said ron slowly i think someone told me a story about a secret chamber at hogwarts once been bill 
 
 and what on a squib said harry 
 
 to his surprise ron stifled a snigger 
 
 well not funny really but as filch he said a squib is someone who was born into a wizarding family but got any magic powers kind of the opposite of wizards but squibs are quite unusual if trying to learn magic from a kwikspell course i reckon he must be a squib it would explain a lot like why he hates students so much ron gave a satisfied smile bitter 
 
 a clock chimed somewhere 
 
 midnight said harry better get to bed before snape comes along and tries to frame us for something else 
 
 for a few days the school could talk of little else but the attack on mrs norris filch kept it fresh in minds by pacing the spot where she had been attacked as though he thought the attacker might come back harry had seen him scrubbing the message on the wall with mrs magical mess remover but to no effect the words still gleamed as brightly as ever on the stone when filch guarding the scene of the crime he was skulking through the corridors lunging out at unsuspecting students and trying to put them in detention for things like breathing looking happy 
 
 ginny weasley seemed very disturbed by mrs fate according to ron she was a great cat lover 
 
 but you really got to know mrs norris ron told her bracingly honestly much better off without her lip trembled stuff like this often happen at hogwarts ron assured her catch the maniac who did it and have him out of here in no time i just hope got time to petrify filch before expelled only joking ron added hastily as ginny blanched 
 
 the attack had also had an effect on hermione it was quite usual for hermione to spend a lot of time reading but she was now doing almost nothing else nor could harry and ron get much response from her when they asked what she was up to and not until the following wednesday did they find out 
 
 harry had been held back in potions where snape had made him stay behind to scrape tubeworms off the desks after a hurried lunch he went upstairs to meet ron in the library and saw justin the hufflepuff boy from herbology coming toward him harry had just opened his mouth to say hello when justin caught sight of him turned abruptly and sped off in the opposite direction 
 
 harry found ron at the back of the library measuring his history of magic homework professor binns had asked for a three foot long composition on the medieval assembly of european wizards 
 
 i believe it still eight inches short said ron furiously letting go of his parchment which sprang back into a roll and done four feet seven inches and her tiny 
 
 where is she asked harry grabbing the tape measure and unrolling his own homework 
 
 somewhere over there said ron pointing along the shelves looking for another book i think trying to read the whole library before christmas 
 
 harry told ron about justin running away from him 
 
 dunno why you care i thought he was a bit of an idiot said ron scribbling away making his writing as large as possible all that junk about lockhart being so great 
 
 hermione emerged from between the bookshelves she looked irritable and at last seemed ready to talk to them 
 
 all the copies of hogwarts a history have been taken out she said sitting down next to harry and ron and a waiting list i wish i left my copy at home but i fit it in my trunk with all the lockhart books 
 
 why do you want it said harry 
 
 the same reason everyone else wants it said hermione to read up on the legend of the chamber of secrets 
 
 that said harry quickly 
 
 just it i remember said hermione biting her lip and i find the story anywhere else 
 
 hermione let me read your composition said ron desperately checking his watch 
 
 no i said hermione suddenly severe had ten days to finish it 
 
 i only need another two inches come on 
 
 the bell rang ron and hermione led the way to history of magic bickering 
 
 history of magic was the dullest subject on their schedule professor binns who taught it was their only ghost teacher and the most exciting thing that ever happened in his classes was his entering the room through the blackboard ancient and shriveled many people said he noticed he was dead he had simply got up to teach one day and left his body behind him in an armchair in front of the staff room fire his routine had not varied in the slightest since 
 
 today was as boring as ever professor binns opened his notes and began to read in a flat drone like an old vacuum cleaner until nearly everyone in the class was in a deep stupor occasionally coming to long enough to copy down a name or date then falling asleep again he had been speaking for half an hour when something happened that had never happened before hermione put up her hand 
 
 professor binns glancing up in the middle of a deadly dull lecture on the international warlock convention of looked amazed 
 
 miss er 
 
 granger professor i was wondering if you could tell us anything about the chamber of secrets said hermione in a clear voice 
 
 dean thomas who had been sitting with his mouth hanging open gazing out of the window jerked out of his trance lavender head came up off her arms and neville elbow slipped off his desk 
 
 professor binns blinked 
 
 my subject is history of magic he said in his dry wheezy voice i deal with facts miss granger not myths and legends he cleared his throat with a small noise like chalk slipping and continued in september of that year a subcommittee of sardinian sorcerers 
 
 he stuttered to a halt hand was waving in the air again 
 
 miss grant 
 
 please sir legends always have a basis in fact 
 
 professor binns was looking at her in such amazement harry was sure no student had ever interrupted him before alive or dead 
 
 well said professor binns slowly yes one could argue that i suppose he peered at hermione as though he had never seen a student properly before however the legend of which you speak is such a very sensational even ludicrous tale 
 
 but the whole class was now hanging on professor every word he looked dimly at them all every face turned to his harry could tell he was completely thrown by such an unusual show of interest 
 
 oh very well he said slowly let me see the chamber of secrets 
 
 you all know of course that hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago the precise date is uncertain by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age the four school houses are named after them godric gryffindor helga hufflepuff rowena ravenclaw and salazar slytherin they built this castle together far from prying muggle eyes for it was an age when magic was feared by common people and witches and wizards suffered much persecution 
 
 he paused gazed blearily around the room and continued 
 
 for a few years the founders worked in harmony together seeking out youngsters who showed signs of magic and bringing them to the castle to be educated but then disagreements sprang up between them a rift began to grow between slytherin and the others slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to hogwarts he believed that magical learning should be kept within families he disliked taking students of muggle parentage believing them to be untrustworthy after a while there was a serious argument on the subject between slytherin and gryffindor and slytherin left the school 
 
 professor binns paused again pursing his lips looking like a wrinkled old tortoise 
 
 reliable historical sources tell us this much he said but these honest facts have been obscured by the fanciful legend of the chamber of secrets the story goes that slytherin had built a hidden chamber in the castle of which the other founders knew nothing 
 
 slytherin according to the legend sealed the chamber of secrets so that none would be able to open it until his own true heir arrived at the school the heir alone would be able to unseal the chamber of secrets unleash the horror within and use it to purge the school of all who were unworthy to study magic 
 
 there was silence as he finished telling the story but it the usual sleepy silence that filled professor classes there was unease in the air as everyone continued to watch him hoping for more professor binns looked faintly annoyed 
 
 the whole thing is arrant nonsense of course he said naturally the school has been searched for evidence of such a chamber many times by the most learned witches and wizards it does not exist a tale told to frighten the gullible 
 
 hand was back in the air 
 
 sir what exactly do you mean by the horror chamber 
 
 that is believed to be some sort of monster which the heir of slytherin alone can control said professor binns in his dry reedy voice 
 
 the class exchanged nervous looks 
 
 i tell you the thing does not exist said professor binns shuffling his notes there is no chamber and no monster 
 
 but sir said seamus finnigan if the chamber can only be opened by true heir no one else would be able to find it would they 
 
 nonsense said professor binns in an aggravated tone if a long succession of hogwarts headmasters and headmistresses found the thing 
 
 but professor piped up parvati patil probably have to use dark magic to open it 
 
 just because a wizard use dark magic mean he miss pennyfeather snapped professor binns i repeat if the likes of dumbledore 
 
 but maybe got to be related to slytherin so dumbledore began dean thomas but professor binns had had enough 
 
 that will do he said sharply it is a myth it does not exist there is not a shred of evidence that slytherin ever built so much as a secret broom cupboard i regret telling you such a foolish story we will return if you please to history to solid believable verifiable fact 
 
 and within five minutes the class had sunk back into its usual torpor 
 
 i always knew salazar slytherin was a twisted old loony ron told harry and hermione as they fought their way through the teeming corridors at the end of the lesson to drop off their bags before dinner but i never knew he started all this stuff i be in his house if you paid me honestly if the sorting hat had tried to put me in slytherin got the train straight back home 
 
 hermione nodded fervently but harry say anything his stomach had just dropped unpleasantly 
 
 harry had never told ron and hermione that the sorting hat had seriously considered putting him in slytherin he could remember as though it were yesterday the small voice that had spoken in his ear when placed the hat on his head a year before you could be great you know all here in your head and slytherin would help you on the way to greatness no doubt about that 
 
 but harry who had already heard of slytherin reputation for turning out dark wizards had thought desperately not slytherin and the hat had said oh well if sure better be gryffindor 
 
 as they were shunted along in the throng colin creevy went past 
 
 hiya harry 
 
 hullo colin said harry automatically 
 
 harry harry a boy in my class has been saying 
 
 but colin was so small he fight against the tide of people bearing him toward the great hall they heard him squeak see you harry and he was gone 
 
 a boy in his class saying about you hermione wondered 
 
 that heir i expect said harry his stomach dropping another inch or so as he suddenly remembered the way justin had run away from him at lunchtime 
 
 people believe anything said ron in disgust 
 
 the crowd thinned and they were able to climb the next staircase without difficulty 
 
 really think a chamber of secrets ron asked hermione 
 
 i know she said frowning dumbledore cure mrs norris and that makes me think that whatever attacked her might not be well human 
 
 as she spoke they turned a corner and found themselves at the end of the very corridor where the attack had happened they stopped and looked the scene was just as it had been that night except that there was no stiff cat hanging from the torch bracket and an empty chair stood against the wall bearing the message the chamber of secrets has been opened 
 
 where filch has been keeping guard ron muttered 
 
 they looked at each other the corridor was deserted 
 
 hurt to have a poke around said harry dropping his bag and getting to his hands and knees so that he could crawl along searching for clues 
 
 scorch marks he said here and here 
 
 come and look at this said hermione this is funny 
 
 har ry got up and crossed to the window next to the message on the wall hermione was pointing at the topmost pane where around twenty spiders were scuttling apparently fighting to get through a small crack a long silvery thread was dangling like a rope as though they had all climbed it in their hurry to get outside 
 
 have you ever seen spiders act like that said hermione wonderingly 
 
 no said harry have you ron ron 
 
 he looked over his shoulder ron was standing well back and seemed to be fighting the impulse to run 
 
 up said harry 
 
 i like spiders said ron tensely 
 
 i never knew that said hermione looking at ron in surprise used spiders in potions loads of times 
 
 i mind them dead said ron who was carefully looking anywhere but at the window i just like the way they move 
 
 hermione giggled 
 
 not funny said ron fiercely if you must know when i was three fred turned my my teddy bear into a great big filthy spider because i broke his toy broomstick you like them either if been holding your bear and suddenly it had too many legs and 
 
 he broke off shuddering hermione was obviously still trying not to laugh feeling they had better get off the subject harry said remember all that water on the floor where did that come from mopped it up 
 
 it was about here said ron recovering himself to walk a few paces past chair and pointing level with this door 
 
 he reached for the brass doorknob but suddenly withdrew his hand as though been burned 
 
 the matter said harry 
 
 go in there said ron gruffly a 
 
 oh ron there be anyone in there said hermione standing up and coming over moaning place come on have a look 
 
 and ignoring the large out of order sign she opened the door 
 
 it was the gloomiest most depressing bathroom harry had ever set foot in under a large cracked and spotted mirror were a row of chipped sinks the floor was damp and reflected the dull light given off by the stubs of a few candles burning low in their holders the wooden doors to the stalls were flaking and scratched and one of them was dangling off its hinges 
 
 hermione put her fingers to her lips and set off toward the end stall when she reached it she said hello myrtle how are you 
 
 harry and ron went to look moaning myrtle was floating above the tank of the toilet picking a spot on her chin 
 
 this is a girls 
 
 bathroom she said eyeing ron and harry suspiciously not girls 
 
 no hermione agreed i just wanted to show them how er nice it is in here 
 
 she waved vaguely at the dirty old mirror and the damp floor 
 
 ask her if she saw anything harry mouthed at hermione 
 
 what are you whispering said myrtle staring at him 
 
 nothing said harry quickly we wanted to ask 
 
 i wish people would stop talking behind my back said myrtle in a voice choked with tears i do have feelings you know even if i am dead 
 
 myrtle no one wants to upset you said hermione harry only 
 
 no one wants to upset me a good one howled myrtle my life was nothing but misery at this place and now people come along ruining my death 
 
 we wanted to ask you if seen anything funny lately said hermione quickly because a cat was attacked right outside your front door on halloween 
 
 did you see anyone near here that night said harry 
 
 i paying attention said myrtle dramatically peeves upset me so much i came in here and tried to kill myself then of course i remembered that that 
 
 already dead said ron helpfully 
 
 myrtle gave a tragic sob rose up in the air turned over and dived headfirst into the toilet splashing water all over them and vanishing from sight although from the direction of her muffled sobs she had come to rest somewhere in the 
 
 harry and ron stood with their mouths open but hermione shrugged wearily and said honestly that was almost cheerful for myrtle come on go 
 
 harry had barely closed the door on gurgling sobs when a loud voice made all three of them jump 
 
 ron 
 
 percy weasley had stopped dead at the head of the stairs prefect badge agleam an expression of complete shock on his face 
 
 a girls 
 
 bathroom he gasped what were you 
 
 just having a look around ron shrugged clues you know 
 
 percy swelled in a manner that reminded harry forcefully of mrs weasley 
 
 get away from there perry said striding toward them and starting to bustle them along flapping his arms you care what this looks like coming back here while at dinner 
 
 why we be here said ron hotly stopping short and glaring at percy listen we never laid a finger on that cat 
 
 what i told ginny said percy fiercely but she still seems to think going to be expelled never seen her so upset crying her eyes out you might think of her all the first years are thoroughly overexcited by this business 
 
 you care about ginny said ron whose ears were now reddening just worried going to mess up your chances of being head boy 
 
 five points from gryffindor percy said tersely fingering his prefect badge and i hope it teaches you a lesson no more detective work or write to mum 
 
 and he strode off the back of his neck as red as ears 
 
 harry ron and hermione chose seats as far as possible from percy in the common room that night ron was still in a very bad temper and kept blotting his charms homework when he reached absently for his wand to remove the smudges it ignited the parchment fuming almost as much as his homework ron slammed the standard book of spells grade shut to surprise hermione followed suit 
 
 who can it be though she said in a quiet voice as though continuing a conversation they had just been having want to frighten all the squibs and out of 
 
 think said ron in mock puzzlement who do we know who thinks are scum 
 
 he looked at hermione hermione looked back unconvinced 
 
 if talking about malfoy 
 
 of course i am said ron you heard him be next mudbloods come on only got to look at his foul rat face to know him 
 
 malfoy the heir of slytherin said hermione skeptically 
 
 look at his family said harry closing his books too the whole lot of them have been in slytherin always boasting about it they could easily be descendants his definitely evil enough 
 
 they had the key to the chamber of secrets for centuries said ron handing it down father to son 
 
 well said hermione cautiously i suppose possible 
 
 but how do we prove it said harry darkly 
 
 there might be a way said hermione slowly dropping her voice still further with a quick glance across the room at percy of course it would be difficult and dangerous very dangerous be breaking about fifty school rules i expect 
 
 if in a month or so you feel like explaining you will let us know you said ron irritably 
 
 all right said hermione coldly what need to do is to get inside the slytherin common room and ask malfoy a few questions without him realizing us 
 
 but impossible harry said as ron laughed 
 
 no not said hermione all need would be some polyjuice potion 
 
 that said ron and harry together 
 
 snape mentioned it in class a few weeks ago 
 
 think got nothing better to do in potions than listen to snape muttered ron 
 
 it transforms you into somebody else think about it we could change into three of the slytherins no one would know it was us malfoy would probably tell us anything probably boasting about it in the slytherin common room right now if only we could hear him 
 
 this polyjuice stuff sounds a bit dodgy to me said ron frowning what if we were stuck looking like three of the slytherins forever 
 
 it wears off after a while said hermione waving her hand impatiently but getting hold of the recipe will be very difficult snape said it was in a book called moste potente potions and bound to be in the restricted section of the library there was only one way to get out a book from the restricted section you needed a signed note of permission from a teacher hard to see why want the book really said ron if we going to try and make one of the potions i think said hermione that if we made it sound as though we were just interested in the theory we might stand a chance 
 
 oh come on no going to fall for that said ron have to be really thick 
 
 rowling

 attracted no doubt by shout argus filch came shouldering his way through the crowd then he saw mrs norris and fell back clutching his face in horror 
 
 my cat my cat happened to mrs norris he shrieked 
 
 and his popping eyes fell on harry 
 
 screeched you murdered my cat killed her kill you 
 
 argus 
 
 dumbledore had arrived on the scene followed by a number of other teachers in seconds he had swept past harry ron and hermione and detached mrs norris from the torch bracket 
 
 come with me argus he said to filch you too mr potter mr weasley miss granger 
 
 lockhart stepped forward eagerly 
 
 my office is nearest headmaster just upstairs please feel free 
 
 thank you gilderoy said dumbledore 
 
 the silent crowd parted to let them pass lockhart looking excited and important hurried after dumbledore so did professors mcgonagall and snape 
 
 as they entered darkened office there was a flurry of movement across the walls harry saw several of the lockharts in the pictures dodging out of sight their hair in rollers the real lockhart lit the candles on his desk and stood back dumbledore lay mrs norris on the polished surface and began to examine her harry ron and hermione exchanged tense looks and sank into chairs outside the pool of candlelight watching 
 
 the tip of long crooked nose was barely an inch from mrs fur he was looking at her closely through his spectacles his long fingers gently prodding and poking professor mcgonagall was bent almost as close her eyes narrowed snape loomed behind them half in shadow wearing a most peculiar expression it was as though he was trying hard not to smile and lockhart was hovering around all of them making suggestions 
 
 it was definitely a curse that killed her probably the transmogrifian torture seen it used many times so unlucky i there i know the very countercurse that would have saved her 
 
 comments were punctuated by dry racking sobs he was slumped in a chair by the desk unable to look at mrs norris his face in his hands much as he detested filch harry help feeling a bit sorry for him though not nearly as sorry as he felt for himself if dumbledore believed filch he would be expelled for sure 
 
 dumbledore was now muttering strange words under his breath and tapping mrs norris with his wand but nothing happened she continued to look as though she had been recently stuffed 
 
 i remember something very similar happening in ouagadogou said lockhart a series of attacks the full in my autobiography i was able to provide the townsfolk with various amulets which cleared the matter up at once 
 
 the photographs of lockhart on the walls were all nodding in agreement as he talked one of them had forgotten to remove his hair net 
 
 at last dumbledore straightened up 
 
 not dead argus he said softly 
 
 lockhart stopped abruptly in the middle of counting the number of murders he had prevented 
 
 not dead choked filch looking through his fingers at mrs norris but she all all stiff and frozen 
 
 she has been petrified said dumbledore ah i thought so said lockhart but how i cannot say 
 
 ask him shrieked filch turning his blotched and tearstained face to harry 
 
 no second year could have done this said dumbledore firmly it would take dark magic of the most advanced 
 
 he did it he did it filch spat his pouchy face purpling you saw what he wrote on the wall he found in my office he knows a a face worked horribly he knows a squib he finished 
 
 i never touched mrs norris harry said loudly uncomfortably aware of everyone looking at him including all the lockharts on the walls and i even know what a squib is 
 
 rubbish snarled filch he saw my kwikspell letter 
 
 if i might speak headmaster said snape from the shadows and sense of foreboding increased he was sure nothing snape had to say was going to do him any good 
 
 potter and his friends may have simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time he said a slight sneer curling his mouth as though he doubted it but we do have a set of suspicious circumstances here why was he in the upstairs corridor at all why he at the halloween feast

 ron and hermione looked at harry 
 
 because because harry said his heart thumping very fast something told him it would sound very if he told them he had been led there by a bodiless voice no one but he could hear because we were tired and wanted to go to bed he said 
 
 without any supper said snape a triumphant smile flickering across his gaunt face i think ghosts provided food fit for living people at their parties 
 
 we hungry said ron loudly as his stomach gave a huge rumble 
 
 nasty smile widened 
 
 i suggest headmaster that potter is not being entirely truthful he said it might be a good idea if he were deprived of certain privileges until he is ready to tell us the whole story i personally feel he should be taken off the gryffindor quidditch team until he is ready to be honest 
 
 really severus said professor mcgonagall sharply i see no reason to stop the boy playing quidditch this cat hit over the head with a broomstick there is no evidence at all that potter has done anything wrong 
 
 dumbledore was giving harry a searching look his twinkling gaze made harry feel as though he were being 
 
 innocent until proven guilty severus he said firmly 
 
 snape looked furious 
 
 so did filch 
 
 my cat has been petrified he shrieked his eyes popping i want to see some punishment 
 
 we will be able to cure her argus said dumbledore patiently professer sprout recently managed to procure some mandrakes as soon as they have reached their full size i will have a potion made that will revive mrs norris 
 
 make it lockhart butted in i must have done it a hundred times i could whip up a mandrake restorative draught in my sleep 
 
 excuse me said snape icily but i believe i am the potions master at this school 
 
 there was a very awkward pause

 and what on a squib said harry 
 
 to his surprise ron stifled a snigger 
 
 well not funny really but as filch he said a squib is someone who was born into a wizarding family but got any magic powers kind of the opposite of wizards but squibs are quite unusual if trying to learn magic from a kwikspell course i reckon he must be a squib it would explain a lot like why he hates students so much ron gave a satisfied smile bitter 
 
 a clock chimed somewhere 
 
 midnight said harry better get to bed before snape comes along and tries to frame us for something else 
 
 for a few days the school could talk of little else but the attack on mrs norris filch kept it fresh in minds by pacing the spot where she had been attacked as though he thought the attacker might come back harry had seen him scrubbing the message on the wall with mrs magical mess remover but to no effect the words still gleamed as brightly as ever on the stone when filch guarding the scene of the crime he was skulking through the corridors lunging out at unsuspecting students and trying to put them in detention for things like breathing looking happy 
 
 ginny weasley seemed very disturbed by mrs fate according to ron she was a great cat lover 
 
 but you really got to know mrs norris ron told her bracingly honestly much better off without her lip trembled stuff like this often happen at hogwarts ron assured her catch the maniac who did it and have him out of here in no time i just hope got time to petrify filch before expelled only joking ron added hastily as ginny blanched 
 
 the attack had also had an effect on hermione it was quite usual for hermione to spend a lot of time reading but she was now doing almost nothing else nor could harry and ron get much response from her when they asked what she was up to and not until the following wednesday did they find out 
 
 harry had been held back in potions where snape had made him stay behind to scrape tubeworms off the desks after a hurried lunch he went upstairs to meet ron in the library and saw justin the hufflepuff boy from herbology coming toward him harry had just opened his mouth to say hello when justin caught sight of him turned abruptly and sped off in the opposite direction 
 
 harry found ron at the back of the library measuring his history of magic homework professor binns had asked for a three foot long composition on the medieval assembly of european wizards 
 
 i believe it still eight inches short said ron furiously letting go of his parchment which sprang back into a roll and done four feet seven inches and her tiny 
 
 where is she asked harry grabbing the tape measure and unrolling his own homework 
 
 somewhere over there said ron pointing along the shelves looking for another book i think trying to read the whole library before christmas 
 
 harry told ron about justin running away from him 
 
 dunno why you care i thought he was a bit of an idiot said ron scribbling away making his writing as large as possible all that junk about lockhart being so great 
 
 hermione emerged from between the bookshelves she looked irritable and at last seemed ready to talk to them 
 
 all the copies of hogwarts a history have been taken out she said sitting down next to harry and ron and a waiting list i wish i left my copy at home but i fit it in my trunk with all the lockhart books 
 
 why do you want it said harry 
 
 the same reason everyone else wants it said hermione to read up on the legend of the chamber of secrets 
 
 that said harry quickly 
 
 just it i remember said hermione biting her lip and i find the story anywhere else 
 
 hermione let me read your composition said ron desperately checking his watch 
 
 no i said hermione suddenly severe had ten days to finish it 
 
 i only need another two inches come on 
 
 the bell rang ron and hermione led the way to history of magic bickering 
 
 history of magic was the dullest subject on their schedule professor binns who taught it was their only ghost teacher and the most exciting thing that ever happened in his classes was his entering the room through the blackboard ancient and shriveled many people said he noticed he was dead he had simply got up to teach one day and left his body behind him in an armchair in front of the staff room fire his routine had not varied in the slightest since 
 
 today was as boring as ever professor binns opened his notes and began to read in a flat drone like an old vacuum cleaner until nearly everyone in the class was in a deep stupor occasionally coming to long enough to copy down a name or date then falling asleep again he had been speaking for half an hour when something happened that had never happened before hermione put up her hand 
 
 professor binns glancing up in the middle of a deadly dull lecture on the international warlock convention of looked amazed 
 
 miss er 
 
 granger professor i was wondering if you could tell us anything about the chamber of secrets said hermione in a clear voice 
 
 dean thomas who had been sitting with his mouth hanging open gazing out of the window jerked out of his trance lavender head came up off her arms and neville elbow slipped off his desk 
 
 professor binns blinked 
 
 my subject is history of magic he said in his dry wheezy voice i deal with facts miss granger not myths and legends he cleared his throat with a small noise like chalk slipping and continued in september of that year a subcommittee of sardinian sorcerers 
 
 he stuttered to a halt hand was waving in the air again 
 
 miss grant 
 
 please sir legends always have a basis in fact 
 
 professor binns was looking at her in such amazement harry was sure no student had ever interrupted him before alive or dead 
 
 well said professor binns slowly yes one could argue that i suppose he peered at hermione as though he had never seen a student properly before however the legend of which you speak is such a very sensational even ludicrous tale 
 
 but the whole class was now hanging on professor every word he looked dimly at them all every face turned to his harry could tell he was completely thrown by such an unusual show of interest 
 
 oh very well he said slowly let me see the chamber of secrets 
 
 you all know of course that hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago the precise date is uncertain by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age the four school houses are named after them godric gryffindor helga hufflepuff rowena ravenclaw and salazar slytherin they built this castle together far from prying muggle eyes for it was an age when magic was feared by common people and witches and wizards suffered much persecution 
 
 he paused gazed blearily around the room and continued 
 
 for a few years the founders worked in harmony together seeking out youngsters who showed signs of magic and bringing them to the castle to be educated but then disagreements sprang up between them a rift began to grow between slytherin and the others slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to hogwarts he believed that magical learning should be kept within families he disliked taking students of muggle parentage believing them to be untrustworthy after a while there was a serious argument on the subject between slytherin and gryffindor and slytherin left the school 
 
 professor binns paused again pursing his lips looking like a wrinkled old tortoise 
 
 reliable historical sources tell us this much he said but these honest facts have been obscured by the fanciful legend of the chamber of secrets the story goes that slytherin had built a hidden chamber in the castle of which the other founders knew nothing 
 
 slytherin according to the legend sealed the chamber of secrets so that none would be able to open it until his own true heir arrived at the school the heir alone would be able to unseal the chamber of secrets unleash the horror within and use it to purge the school of all who were unworthy to study magic 
 
 there was silence as he finished telling the story but it the usual sleepy silence that filled professor classes there was unease in the air as everyone continued to watch him hoping for more professor binns looked faintly annoyed 
 
 the whole thing is arrant nonsense of course he said naturally the school has been searched for evidence of such a chamber many times by the most learned witches and wizards it does not exist a tale told to frighten the gullible 
 
 hand was back in the air 
 
 sir what exactly do you mean by the horror chamber 
 
 that is believed to be some sort of monster which the heir of slytherin alone can control said professor binns in his dry reedy voice 
 
 the class exchanged nervous looks 
 
 i tell you the thing does not exist said professor binns shuffling his notes there is no chamber and no monster 
 
 but sir said seamus finnigan if the chamber can only be opened by true heir no one else would be able to find it would they 
 
 nonsense said professor binns in an aggravated tone if a long succession of hogwarts headmasters and headmistresses found the thing 
 
 but professor piped up parvati patil probably have to use dark magic to open it 
 
 just because a wizard use dark magic mean he miss pennyfeather snapped professor binns i repeat if the likes of dumbledore 
 
 but maybe got to be related to slytherin so dumbledore began dean thomas but professor binns had had enough 
 
 that will do he said sharply it is a myth it does not exist there is not a shred of evidence that slytherin ever built so much as a secret broom cupboard i regret telling you such a foolish story we will return if you please to history to solid believable verifiable fact 
 
 and within five minutes the class had sunk back into its usual torpor 
 
 i always knew salazar slytherin was a twisted old loony ron told harry and hermione as they fought their way through the teeming corridors at the end of the lesson to drop off their bags before dinner but i never knew he started all this stuff i be in his house if you paid me honestly if the sorting hat had tried to put me in slytherin got the train straight back home 
 
 hermione nodded fervently but harry say anything his stomach had just dropped unpleasantly 
 
 harry had never told ron and hermione that the sorting hat had seriously considered putting him in slytherin he could remember as though it were yesterday the small voice that had spoken in his ear when placed the hat on his head a year before you could be great you know all here in your head and slytherin would help you on the way to greatness no doubt about that 
 
 but harry who had already heard of slytherin reputation for turning out dark wizards had thought desperately not slytherin and the hat had said oh well if sure better be gryffindor 
 
 as they were shunted along in the throng colin creevy went past 
 
 hiya harry 
 
 hullo colin said harry automatically 
 
 harry harry a boy in my class has been saying 
 
 but colin was so small he fight against the tide of people bearing him toward the great hall they heard him squeak see you harry and he was gone 
 
 a boy in his class saying about you hermione wondered 
 
 that heir i expect said harry his stomach dropping another inch or so as he suddenly remembered the way justin had run away from him at lunchtime 
 
 people believe anything said ron in disgust 
 
 the crowd thinned and they were able to climb the next staircase without difficulty 
 
 really think a chamber of secrets ron asked hermione 
 
 i know she said frowning dumbledore cure mrs norris and that makes me think that whatever attacked her might not be well human 
 
 as she spoke they turned a corner and found themselves at the end of the very corridor where the attack had happened they stopped and looked the scene was just as it had been that night except that there was no stiff cat hanging from the torch bracket and an empty chair stood against the wall bearing the message the chamber of secrets has been opened 
 
 where filch has been keeping guard ron muttered 
 
 they looked at each other the corridor was deserted 
 
 hurt to have a poke around said harry dropping his bag and getting to his hands and knees so that he could crawl along searching for clues 
 
 scorch marks he said here and here 
 
 come and look at this said hermione this is funny 
 
 har ry got up and crossed to the window next to the message on the wall hermione was pointing at the topmost pane where around twenty spiders were scuttling apparently fighting to get through a small crack a long silvery thread was dangling like a rope as though they had all climbed it in their hurry to get outside 
 
 have you ever seen spiders act like that said hermione wonderingly 
 
 no said harry have you ron ron 
 
 he looked over his shoulder ron was standing well back and seemed to be fighting the impulse to run 
 
 up said harry 
 
 i like spiders said ron tensely 
 
 i never knew that said hermione looking at ron in surprise used spiders in potions loads of times 
 
 i mind them dead said ron who was carefully looking anywhere but at the window i just like the way they move 
 
 hermione giggled 
 
 not funny said ron fiercely if you must know when i was three fred turned my my teddy bear into a great big filthy spider because i broke his toy broomstick you like them either if been holding your bear and suddenly it had too many legs and 
 
 he broke off shuddering hermione was obviously still trying not to laugh feeling they had better get off the subject harry said remember all that water on the floor where did that come from mopped it up 
 
 it was about here said ron recovering himself to walk a few paces past chair and pointing level with this door 
 
 he reached for the brass doorknob but suddenly withdrew his hand as though been burned 
 
 the matter said harry 
 
 go in there said ron gruffly a 
 
 oh ron there be anyone in there said hermione standing up and coming over moaning place come on have a look 
 
 and ignoring the large out of order sign she opened the door 
 
 it was the gloomiest most depressing bathroom harry had ever set foot in under a large cracked and spotted mirror were a row of chipped sinks the floor was damp and reflected the dull light given off by the stubs of a few candles burning low in their holders the wooden doors to the stalls were flaking and scratched and one of them was dangling off its hinges 
 
 hermione put her fingers to her lips and set off toward the end stall when she reached it she said hello myrtle how are you 
 
 harry and ron went to look moaning myrtle was floating above the tank of the toilet picking a spot on her chin 
 
 this is a girls 
 
 bathroom she said eyeing ron and harry suspiciously not girls 
 
 no hermione agreed i just wanted to show them how er nice it is in here 
 
 she waved vaguely at the dirty old mirror and the damp floor 
 
 ask her if she saw anything harry mouthed at hermione 
 
 what are you whispering said myrtle staring at him 
 
 nothing said harry quickly we wanted to ask 
 
 i wish people would stop talking behind my back said myrtle in a voice choked with tears i do have feelings you know even if i am dead 
 
 myrtle no one wants to upset you said hermione harry only 
 
 no one wants to upset me a good one howled myrtle my life was nothing but misery at this place and now people come along ruining my death 
 
 we wanted to ask you if seen anything funny lately said hermione quickly because a cat was attacked right outside your front door on halloween 
 
 did you see anyone near here that night said harry 
 
 i paying attention said myrtle dramatically peeves upset me so much i came in here and tried to kill myself then of course i remembered that that 
 
 already dead said ron helpfully 
 
 myrtle gave a tragic sob rose up in the air turned over and dived headfirst into the toilet splashing water all over them and vanishing from sight although from the direction of her muffled sobs she had come to rest somewhere in the 
 
 harry and ron stood with their mouths open but hermione shrugged wearily and said honestly that was almost cheerful for myrtle come on go 
 
 harry had barely closed the door on gurgling sobs when a loud voice made all three of them jump 
 
 ron 
 
 percy weasley had stopped dead at the head of the stairs prefect badge agleam an expression of complete shock on his face 
 
 a girls 
 
 bathroom he gasped what were you 
 
 just having a look around ron shrugged clues you know 
 
 percy swelled in a manner that reminded harry forcefully of mrs weasley 
 
 get away from there perry said striding toward them and starting to bustle them along flapping his arms you care what this looks like coming back here while at dinner 
 
 why we be here said ron hotly stopping short and glaring at percy listen we never laid a finger on that cat 
 
 what i told ginny said percy fiercely but she still seems to think going to be expelled never seen her so upset crying her eyes out you might think of her all the first years are thoroughly overexcited by this business 
 
 you care about ginny said ron whose ears were now reddening just worried going to mess up your chances of being head boy 
 
 five points from gryffindor percy said tersely fingering his prefect badge and i hope it teaches you a lesson no more detective work or write to mum 
 
 and he strode off the back of his neck as red as ears 
 
 harry ron and hermione chose seats as far as possible from percy in the common room that night ron was still in a very bad temper and kept blotting his charms homework when he reached absently for his wand to remove the smudges it ignited the parchment fuming almost as much as his homework ron slammed the standard book of spells grade shut to surprise hermione followed suit 
 
 who can it be though she said in a quiet voice as though continuing a conversation they had just been having want to frighten all the squibs and out of 
 
 think said ron in mock puzzlement who do we know who thinks are scum 
 
 he looked at hermione hermione looked back unconvinced 
 
 if talking about malfoy 
 
 of course i am said ron you heard him be next mudbloods come on only got to look at his foul rat face to know him 
 
 malfoy the heir of slytherin said hermione skeptically 
 
 look at his family said harry closing his books too the whole lot of them have been in slytherin always boasting about it they could easily be descendants his definitely evil enough 
 
 they had the key to the chamber of secrets for centuries said ron handing it down father to son 
 
 well said hermione cautiously i suppose possible 
 
 but how do we prove it said harry darkly 
 
 there might be a way said hermione slowly dropping her voice still further with a quick glance across the room at percy of course it would be difficult and dangerous very dangerous be breaking about fifty school rules i expect 
 
 if in a month or so you feel like explaining you will let us know you said ron irritably 
 
 all right said hermione coldly what need to do is to get inside the slytherin common room and ask malfoy a few questions without him realizing us 
 
 but impossible harry said as ron laughed 
 
 no not said hermione all need would be some polyjuice potion 
 
 that said ron and harry together 
 
 snape mentioned it in class a few weeks ago 
 
 think got nothing better to do in potions than listen to snape muttered ron 
 
 it transforms you into somebody else think about it we could change into three of the slytherins no one would know it was us malfoy would probably tell us anything probably boasting about it in the slytherin common room right now if only we could hear him 
 
 this polyjuice stuff sounds a bit dodgy to me said ron frowning what if we were stuck looking like three of the slytherins forever 
 
 it wears off after a while said hermione waving her hand impatiently but getting hold of the recipe will be very difficult snape said it was in a book called moste potente potions and bound to be in the restricted section of the library there was only one way to get out a book from the restricted section you needed a signed note of permission from a teacher hard to see why want the book really said ron if we going to try and make one of the potions i think said hermione that if we made it sound as though we were just interested in the theory we might stand a chance 
 
 oh come on no going to fall for that said ron have to be really thick 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the chamber of secrets 
 

lionfish nov chapter nine grim defeatcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 professor dumbledore sent all the gryffindors back to the great hall where they were joined ten minutes later by the students from hufflepuff ravenclaw and slytherin who all looked extremely confused 
 
 the teachers and i need to conduct a thorough search of the castle professor dumbledore told them as professors mcgonagall and flitwick closed all doors into the hall afraid that for your own safety you will have to spend the night here i want the prefects to stand guard over the entrances to the hall and i am leaving the head boy and girl in charge any disturbance should be reported to me immediately he added to percy who was looking immensely proud and important send word with one of the ghosts 
 
 professor dumbledore paused about to leave the hall and said oh yes be needing 
 
 one casual wave of his wand and the long tables flew to the edges of the hall and stood themselves against the walls another wave and the floor was covered with hundreds of squashy purple sleeping bags 
 
 sleep well said professor dumbledore closing the door behind him 
 
 the hall immediately began to buzz excitedly the gryffindors were telling the rest of the school what had just happened 
 
 everyone into their sleeping bags shouted percy come on now no more talking lights out in ten minutes 
 
 ron said to harry and hermione they seized three sleeping bags and dragged them into a corner 
 
 do you think still in the castle hermione whispered anxiously 
 
 dumbledore obviously thinks he might be said ron 
 
 very lucky he picked tonight you know said hermione as they climbed fully dressed into their sleeping bags and propped themselves on their elbows to talk the one night we in the tower 
 
 i reckon lost track of time being on the run said ron realize it was halloween otherwise have come bursting in here 
 
 hermione shuddered 
 
 all around them people were asking one another the same question how did he get in 
 
 maybe he knows how to apparate said a ravenclaw a few feet away just appear out of thin air you know 
 
 disguised himself probably said a hufflepuff fifth year 
 
 he flown in suggested dean thomas 
 
 honestly am i the only person ever bothered to read hogwarts a history said hermione crossly to harry and ron 
 
 probably said ron why 
 
 because the protected by more than walls you know said hermione there are all sorts of enchantments on it to stop people entering by stealth you just apparate in here and like to see the disguise that could fool those dementors guarding every single entrance to the grounds have seen him fly in too and filch knows all the secret passages have them covered 
 
 the lights are going out now percy shouted i want everyone in their sleeping bags and no more talking 
 
 the candles all went out at once the only light now came from the silvery ghosts who were drifting about talking seriously to the prefects and the enchanted ceiling which like the sky outside was scattered with stars what with that and the whispering that still filled the hall harry felt as though he were sleeping outdoors in a light wind 
 
 once every hour a teacher would reappear in the hall to check that everything was quiet around three in the morning when many students had finally fallen asleep professor dumbledore came in harry watched him looking around for percy who had been prowling between the sleeping bags telling people off for talking percy was only a short way away from harry ron and hermione who quickly pretended to be asleep as footsteps drew nearer 
 
 any sign of him professor asked percy in a whisper 
 
 no all well here 
 
 everything under control sir 
 
 good no point moving them all now found a temporary guardian for the gryffindor portrait hole be able to move them back in tomorrow 
 
 and the fat lady sir 
 
 hiding in a map of argyllshire on the second floor apparently she refused to let black in without the password so he attacked still very distressed but once calmed down have mr filch restore her 
 
 harry heard the door of the hall creak open again and more footsteps 
 
 headmaster it was snape harry kept quite still listening hard the whole of the third floor has been searched not there and filch has done the dungeons nothing there either 
 
 what about the astronomy tower professor room the owlery 
 
 all searched 
 
 very well severus i really expect black to linger 
 
 have you any theory as to how he got in professor asked snape 
 
 harry raised his head very slightly off his arms to free his other ear 
 
 many severus each of them as unlikely as the next 
 
 harry opened his eyes a fraction and squinted up to where they stood back was to him but he could see face rapt with attention and profile which looked angry 
 
 you remember the conversation we had headmaster just before ah the start of term said snape who was barely opening his lips as though trying to block percy out of the conversation 
 
 i do severus said dumbledore and there was something like warning in his voice 
 
 it seems almost impossible that black could have entered the school without inside help i did express my concerns when you appointed 
 
 i do not believe a single person inside this castle would have helped black enter it said dumbledore and his tone made it so clear that the subject was closed that snape reply i must go down to the dementors said dumbledore i said i would inform them when our search was complete 
 
 they want to help sir said percy 
 
 oh yes said dumbledore coldly but afraid no dementor will cross the threshold of this castle while i am headmaster 
 
 percy looked slightly abashed dumbledore left the hall walking quickly and quietly snape stood for a moment watching the headmaster with an expression of deep resentment on his face then he too left 
 
 harry glanced sideways at ron and hermione both of them had their eyes open too reflecting the starry ceiling 
 
 what was all that about ron mouthed 
 
 
 
 the school talked of nothing but sirius black for the next few days the theories about how he had entered the castle became wilder and wilder hannah abbott from hufflepuff spent much of their next herbology class telling anyone listen that black could turn into a flowering shrub 
 
 the fat ripped canvas had been taken off the wall and replaced with the portrait of sir cadogan and his fat gray pony nobody was very happy about this sir cadogan spent half his time challenging people to duels and the rest thinking up ridiculously complicated passwords which he changed at least twice a day 
 
 a complete lunatic said seamus finnigan angrily to percy we get anyone else 
 
 none of the other pictures wanted the job said percy frightened of what happened to the fat lady sir cadogan was the only one brave enough to volunteer 
 
 sir cadogan however was the least of worries he was now being closely watched teachers found excuses to walk along corridors with him and percy weasley acting harry suspected on his orders was tailing him everywhere like an extremely pompous guard dog to cap it all professor mcgonagall summoned harry into her office with such a somber expression on her face harry thought someone must have died 
 
 no point hiding it from you any longer potter she said in a very serious voice i know this will come as a shock to you but sirius black 
 
 i know after me said harry wearily i heard dad telling his mum mr weasley works for the ministry of magic 
 
 professor mcgonagall seemed very taken aback she stared at harry for a moment or two then said i see well in that case potter understand why i think a good idea for you to be practicing quidditch in the evenings out on the field with only your team members very exposed potter 
 
 got our first match on saturday said harry outraged got to train professor 
 
 professor mcgonagall considered him intently harry knew she was deeply interested in the gryffindor prospects it had been she after all suggested him as seeker in the first place he waited holding his breath 
 
 hmmprofessor mcgonagall stood up and stared out of the window at the quidditch field just visible through the rain wellgoodness knows like to see us win the cup at lastbut all the same be happier if a teacher were present ask madam hooch to oversee your training sessions 
 
 
 
 the weather worsened steadily as the first quidditch match drew nearer undaunted the gryffindor team was training harder than ever under the eye of madam hooch then at their final training session before match oliver wood gave his team some unwelcome news 
 
 not playing slytherin he told them looking very angry just been to see me playing hufflepuff instead 
 
 why chorused the rest of the team 
 
 excuse is that their still injured said wood grinding his teeth furiously but obvious why doing it want to play in this weather think damage their chances 
 
 there had been strong winds and heavy rain all day and as wood spoke they heard a distant rumble of thunder 
 
 nothing wrong with arm said harry furiously faking it 
 
 i know that but we prove it said wood bitterly and been practicing all those moves assuming playing slytherin and instead hufflepuff and their quite different got a new captain and seeker cedric diggory 
 
 angelina alicia and katie suddenly giggled 
 
 what said wood frowning at this lighthearted behavior 
 
 that tall one he said angelina 
 
 strong and silent said katie and they started to giggle again 
 
 only silent because too thick to string two words together said fred impatiently i know why worried oliver hufflepuff is a pushover last time we played them harry caught the snitch in about five minutes remember 
 
 we were playing in completely different conditions wood shouted his eyes bulging slightly put a very strong side together an excellent seeker i was afraid take it like this we relax we must keep our focus slytherin is trying to us we must win 
 
 oliver calm down said fred looking slightly alarmed taking hufflepuff very seriously seriously 
 
 
 
 the day before the match the winds reached howling point and the rain fell harder than ever it was so dark inside the corridors and classrooms that extra torches and lanterns were lit the slytherin team was looking very smug indeed and none more so than malfoy 
 
 ah if only my arm was feeling a bit better he sighed as the gale outside pounded the windows 
 
 harry had no room in his head to worry about anything except the match tomorrow oliver wood kept hurrying up to him between classes and giving him tips the third time this happened wood talked for so long that harry suddenly realized he was ten minutes late for defense against the dark arts and set off at a run with wood shouting after him got a very fast swerve harry so you might want to try looping him 
 
 harry skidded to a halt outside the defense against the dark arts classroom pulled the door open and dashed inside 
 
 sorry late professor lupin i 
 
 but it professor lupin who looked up at him from the desk it was snape 
 
 this lesson began ten minutes ago potter so i think make it ten points from gryffindor sit down 
 
 but harry move 
 
 professor lupin he said 
 
 he says he is feeling too ill to teach today said snape with a twisted smile i believe i told you to sit down 
 
 but harry stayed where he was 
 
 wrong with him 
 
 black eyes glittered 
 
 nothing he said looking as though he wished it were five more points from gryffindor and if i have to ask you to sit down again it will be fifty 
 
 harry walked slowly to his seat and sat down snape looked around at the class 
 
 as i was saying before potter interrupted professor lupin has not left any record of the topics you have covered so far 
 
 please sir done boggarts red caps kappas and grindylows said hermione quickly and just about to start 
 
 be quiet said snape coldly i did not ask for information i was merely commenting on professor lack of organization 
 
 the best defense against the dark arts teacher ever had said dean thomas boldly and there was a murmur of agreement from the rest of the class snape looked more menacing than ever 
 
 you are easily satisfied lupin is hardly overtaxing you i would expect first years to be able to deal with red caps and grindylows today we shall discuss 
 
 harry watched him flick through the textbook to the very back chapter which he must know they covered 
 
 werewolves said snape 
 
 but sir said hermione seemingly unable to restrain herself not supposed to do werewolves yet due to start hinkypunks 
 
 miss granger said snape in a voice of deadly calm i was under the impression that i am teaching this lesson not you and i am telling you all to turn to page he glanced around again all of you now 
 
 with many bitter sidelong looks and some sullen muttering the class opened their books 
 
 which of you can tell me how we distinguish between the werewolf and the true wolf said snape 
 
 everyone sat in motionless silence everyone except hermione whose hand as it so often did had shot straight into the air 
 
 anyone snape said ignoring hermione his twisted smile was back are you telling me that professor lupin even taught you the basic distinction between 
 
 we told you said parvati suddenly we got as far as werewolves yet still on 
 
 silence snarled snape well well well i never thought meet a class who even recognize a werewolf when they saw one i shall make a point of informing professor dumbledore how very behind you all are 
 
 please sir said hermione whose hand was still in the air the werewolf differs from the true wolf in several small ways the snout of the werewolf 
 
 that is the second time you have spoken out of turn miss granger said snape coolly five more points from gryffindor for being an insufferable 
 
 hermione went very red put down her hand and stared at the floor with her eyes full of tears it was a mark of how much the class loathed snape that they were all glaring at him because every one of them had called hermione a at least once and ron who told hermione she was a at least twice a week said loudly you asked us a question and she knows the answer why ask if you want to be told 
 
 the class knew instantly gone too far snape advanced on ron slowly and the room held its breath 
 
 detention weasley snape said silkily his face very close to and if i ever hear you criticize the way i teach a class again you will be very sorry indeed 
 
 no one made a sound throughout the rest of the lesson they sat and made notes on werewolves from the textbook while snape prowled up and down the rows of desks examining the work they had been doing with professor lupin 
 
 very poorly explainedthat is incorrect the kappa is more commonly found in mongoliaprofessor lupin gave this eight out of ten i have given it three 
 
 when the bell rang at last snape held them back 
 
 you will each write an essay to be handed in to me on the ways you recognize and kill werewolves i want two rolls of parchment on the subject and i want them by monday morning it is time somebody took this class in hand weasley stay behind we need to arrange your detention 
 
 harry and hermione left the room with the rest of the class who waited until they were well out of earshot then burst into a furious tirade about snape 
 
 never been like this with any of our other defense against the dark arts teachers even if he did want the job harry said to hermione he got it in for lupin think this is all because of the boggart 
 
 i know said hermione pensively but i really hope professor lupin gets better soon 
 
 ron caught up with them five minutes later in a towering rage 
 
 know what that he called snape something that made hermione say ron is making me do got to scrub out the bedpans in the hospital wing without magic he was breathing deeply his fists clenched why black have hidden in office eh he could have finished him off for us 
 
 
 
 harry woke extremely early the next morning so early that it was still dark for a moment he thought the roaring of the wind had woken him then he felt a cold breeze on the back of his neck and sat bolt upright peeves the poltergeist had been floating next to him blowing hard in his ear 
 
 what did you do that for said harry furiously peeves puffed out his cheeks blew hard and zoomed backward out of the room cackling 
 
 harry fumbled for his alarm clock and looked at it it was half past four cursing peeves he rolled over and tried to get back to sleep but it was very difficult now that he was awake to ignore the sounds of the thunder rumbling overhead the pounding of the wind against the castle walls and the distant creaking of the trees in the forbidden forest in a few hours he would be out on the quidditch field battling through that gale finally he gave up any thought of more sleep got up dressed picked up his nimbus two thousand and walked quietly out of the dormitory 
 
 as harry opened the door something brushed against his leg he bent down just in time to grab crookshanks by the end of his bushy tail and drag him outside 
 
 you know i reckon ron was right about you harry told crookshanks suspiciously there are plenty of mice around this place go and chase them go on he added nudging crookshanks down the spiral staircase with his foot leave scabbers alone 
 
 the noise of the storm was even louder in the common room harry knew better than to think the match would be canceled quidditch matches called off for trifles like thunderstorms nevertheless he was starting to feel very apprehensive wood had pointed out cedric diggory to him in the corridor diggory was a fifth year and a lot bigger than harry seekers were usually light and speedy but weight would be an advantage in this weather because he was less likely to be blown off course 
 
 harry whiled away the hours until dawn in front of the fire getting up every now and then to stop crookshanks from sneaking up the boys staircase again at long last harry thought it must be time for breakfast so he headed through the portrait hole alone 
 
 stand and fight you mangy cur yelled sir cadogan 
 
 oh shut up harry yawned 
 
 he revived a bit over a large bowl of porridge and by the time started on toast the rest of the team had turned up 
 
 going to be a tough one said wood who eating anything 
 
 stop worrying oliver said alicia soothingly we mind a bit of rain 
 
 but it was considerably more than a bit of rain such was the popularity of quidditch that the whole school turned out to watch the match as usual but they ran down the lawns toward the quidditch field heads bowed against the ferocious wind umbrellas being whipped out of their hands as they went just before he entered the locker room harry saw malfoy crabbe and goyle laughing and pointing at him from under an enormous umbrella on their way to the stadium 
 
 the team changed into their scarlet robes and waited for usual pep talk but it come he tried to speak several times made an odd gulping noise then shook his head hopelessly and beckoned them to follow him 
 
 the wind was so strong that they staggered sideways as they walked out onto the field if the crowd was cheering they hear it over the fresh rolls of thunder rain was splattering over glasses how on earth was he going to see the snitch in this 
 
 the hufflepuffs were approaching from the opposite side of the field wearing robes the captains walked up to each other and shook hands diggory smiled at wood but wood now looked as though he had lockjaw and merely nodded harry saw madam mouth form the words mount your brooms he pulled his right foot out of the mud with a squelch and swung it over his nimbus two thousand madam hooch put her whistle to her lips and gave it a blast that sounded shrill and distant they were off 
 
 harry rose fast but his nimbus was swerving slightly with the wind he held it as steady as he could and turned squinting into the rain 
 
 within five minutes harry was soaked to his skin and frozen hardly able to see his teammates let alone the tiny snitch he flew backward and forward across the field past blurred red and yellow shapes with no idea of what was happening in the rest of the game he hear the commentary over the wind the crowd was hidden beneath a sea of cloaks and battered umbrellas twice harry came very close to being unseated by a bludger his vision was so clouded by the rain on his glasses he seen them coming 
 
 he lost track of time it was getting harder and harder to hold his broom straight the sky was getting darker as though night had decided to come early twice harry nearly hit another player without knowing whether it was a teammate or opponent everyone was now so wet and the rain so thick he could hardly tell them apart 
 
 with the first flash of lightning came the sound of madam whistle harry could just see the outline of wood through the thick rain gesturing him to the ground the whole team splashed down into the mud 
 
 i called for wood roared at his team come on under here 
 
 they huddled at the edge of the field under a large umbrella harry took off his glasses and wiped them hurriedly on his robes 
 
 the score 
 
 fifty points up said wood but unless we get the snitch soon be playing into the night 
 
 got no chance with these on harry said exasperatedly waving his glasses 
 
 at that very moment hermione appeared at his shoulder she was holding her cloak over her head and was inexplicably beaming 
 
 had an idea harry give me your glasses quick 
 
 he handed them to her and as the team watched in amazement hermione tapped them with her wand and said impervius 
 
 there she said handing them back to harry repel water 
 
 wood looked as though he could have kissed her 
 
 brilliant he called hoarsely after her as she disappeared into the crowd okay team go for it 
 
 spell had done the trick harry was still numb with cold still wetter than ever been in his life but he could see full of fresh determination he urged his broom through the turbulent air staring in every direction for the snitch avoiding a bludger ducking beneath diggory who was streaking in the opposite direction 
 
 there was another clap of thunder followed immediately by forked lightning this was getting more and more dangerous harry needed to get the snitch quickly 
 
 he turned intending to head back toward the middle of the field but at that moment another flash of lightning illuminated the stands and harry saw something that distracted him completely the silhouette of an enormous shaggy black dog clearly imprinted against the sky motionless in the topmost empty row of seats 
 
 numb hands slipped on the broom handle and his nimbus dropped a few feet shaking his sodden bangs out of his eyes he squinted back into the stands the dog had vanished 
 
 harry came anguished yell from the gryffindor goal posts harry behind you 
 
 harry looked wildly around cedric diggory was pelting up the field and a tiny speck of gold was shimmering in the air between them 
 
 with a jolt of panic harry threw himself flat to the broom handle and zoomed toward the snitch 
 
 come on he growled at his nimbus as the rain whipped his face faster 
 
 but something odd was happening an eerie silence was falling across the stadium the wind though as strong as ever was forgetting to roar it was as though someone had turned off the sound as though harry had gone suddenly deaf what was going on 
 
 and then a horribly familiar wave of cold swept over him inside him just as he became aware of something moving on the field below 
 
 before had time to think harry had taken his eyes off the snitch and looked down 
 
 at least a hundred dementors their hidden faces pointing up at him were standing beneath him it was as though freezing water were rising in his chest cutting at his insides and then he heard it againsomeone was screaming screaming inside his heada woman 
 
 not harry not harry please not harry 
 
 stand aside you silly girlstand aside now 
 
 not harry please no take me kill me instead 
 
 numbing swirling white mist was filling brainwhat was he doing why was he flying he needed to help hershe was going to dieshe was going to be murdered 
 
 he was falling falling through the icy mist 
 
 not harry pleasehave mercyhave mercy 
 
 a shrill voice was laughing the woman was screaming and harry knew no more 
 
 lucky the ground was so soft 
 
 i thought he was dead for sure 
 
 but he even break his glasses 
 
 harry could hear the voices whispering but they made no sense whatsoever he have a clue where he was or how got there or what been doing before he got there all he knew was that every inch of him was aching as though it had been beaten 
 
 that was the scariest thing ever seen in my life 
 
 scariestthe scariest thinghooded black figurescoldscreaming 
 
 eyes snapped open he was lying in the hospital wing the gryffindor quidditch team spattered with mud from head to foot was gathered around his bed ron and hermione were also there looking as though just climbed out of a swimming pool 
 
 harry said fred who looked extremely white underneath the mud you feeling 
 
 it was as though memory was on fast forward the lightningthe grimthe snitchand the dementors 
 
 what happened he said sitting up so suddenly they all gasped 
 
 you fell off said fred been what fifty feet 
 
 we thought died said alicia who was shaking 
 
 hermione made a small squeaky noise her eyes were extremely bloodshot 
 
 but the match said harry what happened are we doing a replay 
 
 no one said anything the horrible truth sank into harry like a stone 
 
 we lose 
 
 diggory got the snitch said george just after you fell he realize what had happened when he looked back and saw you on the ground he tried to call it off wanted a rematch but they won fair and squareeven wood admits it 
 
 where is wood said harry suddenly realizing he there 
 
 still in the showers said fred we think trying to drown himself 
 
 harry put his face to his knees his hands gripping his hair fred grabbed his shoulder and shook it roughly 
 
 harry never missed the snitch before 
 
 there had to be one time you get it said george 
 
 not over yet said fred we lost by a hundred points 
 
 right so if hufflepuff loses to ravenclaw and we beat ravenclaw and slytherin 
 
 have to lose by at least two hundred points said george 
 
 but if they beat ravenclaw 
 
 no way ravenclaw is too good but if slytherin loses against hufflepuff 
 
 it all depends on the points a margin of a hundred either way 
 
 harry lay there not saying a word they had lostfor the first time ever he had lost a quidditch match 
 
 after ten minutes or so madam pomfrey came over to tell the team to leave him in peace 
 
 come and see you later fred told him beat yourself up harry still the best seeker ever had 
 
 the team trooped out trailing mud behind them madam pomfrey shut the door behind them looking disapproving ron and hermione moved nearer to bed 
 
 dumbledore was really angry hermione said in a quaking voice never seen him like that before he ran onto the field as you fell waved his wand and you sort of slowed down before you hit the ground then he whirled his wand at the dementors shot silver stuff at them they left the stadium right awayhe was furious come onto the grounds we heard him 
 
 then he magicked you onto a stretcher said ron and walked up to school with you floating on it everyone thought you were 
 
 his voice faded but harry hardly noticed he was thinking about what the dementors had done to himabout the screaming voice he looked up and saw ron and hermione looking at him so anxiously that he quickly cast around for something to say 
 
 did someone get my nimbus 
 
 ron and hermione looked quickly at each other 
 
 er 
 
 what said harry looking from one to the other 
 
 wellwhen you fell off it got blown away said hermione hesitantly 
 
 and 
 
 and it hit it hit oh harry it hit the whomping willow 
 
 insides lurched the whomping willow was a very violent tree that stood alone in the middle of the grounds 
 
 and he said dreading the answer 
 
 well you know the whomping willow said ron it it like being hit 
 
 professor flitwick brought it back just before you came around said hermione in a very small voice 
 
 slowly she reached down for a bag at her feet turned it upside down and tipped a dozen bits of splintered wood and twig onto the bed the only remains of faithful finally beaten broomstick 
 
 rowling

lionfish nov chapter nine grim defeatcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 professor dumbledore sent all the gryffindors back to the great hall where they were joined ten minutes later by the students from hufflepuff ravenclaw and slytherin who all looked extremely confused 
 
 the teachers and i need to conduct a thorough search of the castle professor dumbledore told them as professors mcgonagall and flitwick closed all doors into the hall afraid that for your own safety you will have to spend the night here i want the prefects to stand guard over the entrances to the hall and i am leaving the head boy and girl in charge any disturbance should be reported to me immediately he added to percy who was looking immensely proud and important send word with one of the ghosts 
 
 professor dumbledore paused about to leave the hall and said oh yes be needing 
 
 one casual wave of his wand and the long tables flew to the edges of the hall and stood themselves against the walls another wave and the floor was covered with hundreds of squashy purple sleeping bags 
 
 sleep well said professor dumbledore closing the door behind him 
 
 the hall immediately began to buzz excitedly the gryffindors were telling the rest of the school what had just happened 
 
 everyone into their sleeping bags shouted percy come on now no more talking lights out in ten minutes 
 
 ron said to harry and hermione they seized three sleeping bags and dragged them into a corner 
 
 do you think still in the castle hermione whispered anxiously 
 
 dumbledore obviously thinks he might be said ron 
 
 very lucky he picked tonight you know said hermione as they climbed fully dressed into their sleeping bags and propped themselves on their elbows to talk the one night we in the tower 
 
 i reckon lost track of time being on the run said ron realize it was halloween otherwise have come bursting in here 
 
 hermione shuddered 
 
 all around them people were asking one another the same question how did he get in 
 
 maybe he knows how to apparate said a ravenclaw a few feet away just appear out of thin air you know 
 
 disguised himself probably said a hufflepuff fifth year 
 
 he flown in suggested dean thomas 
 
 honestly am i the only person ever bothered to read hogwarts a history said hermione crossly to harry and ron 
 
 probably said ron why 
 
 because the protected by more than walls you know said hermione there are all sorts of enchantments on it to stop people entering by stealth you just apparate in here and like to see the disguise that could fool those dementors guarding every single entrance to the grounds have seen him fly in too and filch knows all the secret passages have them covered 
 
 the lights are going out now percy shouted i want everyone in their sleeping bags and no more talking 
 
 the candles all went out at once the only light now came from the silvery ghosts who were drifting about talking seriously to the prefects and the enchanted ceiling which like the sky outside was scattered with stars what with that and the whispering that still filled the hall harry felt as though he were sleeping outdoors in a light wind 
 
 once every hour a teacher would reappear in the hall to check that everything was quiet around three in the morning when many students had finally fallen asleep professor dumbledore came in harry watched him looking around for percy who had been prowling between the sleeping bags telling people off for talking percy was only a short way away from harry ron and hermione who quickly pretended to be asleep as footsteps drew nearer 
 
 any sign of him professor asked percy in a whisper 
 
 no all well here 
 
 everything under control sir 
 
 good no point moving them all now found a temporary guardian for the gryffindor portrait hole be able to move them back in tomorrow 
 
 and the fat lady sir 
 
 hiding in a map of argyllshire on the second floor apparently she refused to let black in without the password so he attacked still very distressed but once calmed down have mr filch restore her 
 
 harry heard the door of the hall creak open again and more footsteps 
 
 headmaster it was snape harry kept quite still listening hard the whole of the third floor has been searched not there and filch has done the dungeons nothing there either 
 
 what about the astronomy tower professor room the owlery 
 
 all searched 
 
 very well severus i really expect black to linger 
 
 have you any theory as to how he got in professor asked snape 
 
 harry raised his head very slightly off his arms to free his other ear 
 
 many severus each of them as unlikely as the next 
 
 harry opened his eyes a fraction and squinted up to where they stood back was to him but he could see face rapt with attention and profile which looked angry 
 
 you remember the conversation we had headmaster just before ah the start of term said snape who was barely opening his lips as though trying to block percy out of the conversation 
 
 i do severus said dumbledore and there was something like warning in his voice 
 
 it seems almost impossible that black could have entered the school without inside help i did express my concerns when you appointed 
 
 i do not believe a single person inside this castle would have helped black enter it said dumbledore and his tone made it so clear that the subject was closed that snape reply i must go down to the dementors said dumbledore i said i would inform them when our search was complete 
 
 they want to help sir said percy 
 
 oh yes said dumbledore coldly but afraid no dementor will cross the threshold of this castle while i am headmaster 
 
 percy looked slightly abashed dumbledore left the hall walking quickly and quietly snape stood for a moment watching the headmaster with an expression of deep resentment on his face then he too left 
 
 harry glanced sideways at ron and hermione both of them had their eyes open too reflecting the starry ceiling 
 
 what was all that about ron mouthed 
 
 
 
 the school talked of nothing but sirius black for the next few days the theories about how he had entered the castle became wilder and wilder hannah abbott from hufflepuff spent much of their next herbology class telling anyone listen that black could turn into a flowering shrub 
 
 the fat ripped canvas had been taken off the wall and replaced with the portrait of sir cadogan and his fat gray pony nobody was very happy about this sir cadogan spent half his time challenging people to duels and the rest thinking up ridiculously complicated passwords which he changed at least twice a day 
 
 a complete lunatic said seamus finnigan angrily to percy we get anyone else 
 
 none of the other pictures wanted the job said percy frightened of what happened to the fat lady sir cadogan was the only one brave enough to volunteer 
 
 sir cadogan however was the least of worries he was now being closely watched teachers found excuses to walk along corridors with him and percy weasley acting harry suspected on his orders was tailing him everywhere like an extremely pompous guard dog to cap it all professor mcgonagall summoned harry into her office with such a somber expression on her face harry thought someone must have died 
 
 no point hiding it from you any longer potter she said in a very serious voice i know this will come as a shock to you but sirius black 
 
 i know after me said harry wearily i heard dad telling his mum mr weasley works for the ministry of magic 
 
 professor mcgonagall seemed very taken aback she stared at harry for a moment or two then said i see well in that case potter understand why i think a good idea for you to be practicing quidditch in the evenings out on the field with only your team members very exposed potter 
 
 got our first match on saturday said harry outraged got to train professor 
 
 professor mcgonagall considered him intently harry knew she was deeply interested in the gryffindor prospects it had been she after all suggested him as seeker in the first place he waited holding his breath 
 
 hmmprofessor mcgonagall stood up and stared out of the window at the quidditch field just visible through the rain wellgoodness knows like to see us win the cup at lastbut all the same be happier if a teacher were present ask madam hooch to oversee your training sessions 
 
 
 
 the weather worsened steadily as the first quidditch match drew nearer undaunted the gryffindor team was training harder than ever under the eye of madam hooch then at their final training session before match oliver wood gave his team some unwelcome news 
 
 not playing slytherin he told them looking very angry just been to see me playing hufflepuff instead 
 
 why chorused the rest of the team 
 
 excuse is that their still injured said wood grinding his teeth furiously but obvious why doing it want to play in this weather think damage their chances 
 
 there had been strong winds and heavy rain all day and as wood spoke they heard a distant rumble of thunder 
 
 nothing wrong with arm said harry furiously faking it 
 
 i know that but we prove it said wood bitterly and been practicing all those moves assuming playing slytherin and instead hufflepuff and their quite different got a new captain and seeker cedric diggory 
 
 angelina alicia and katie suddenly giggled 
 
 what said wood frowning at this lighthearted behavior 
 
 that tall one he said angelina 
 
 strong and silent said katie and they started to giggle again 
 
 only silent because too thick to string two words together said fred impatiently i know why worried oliver hufflepuff is a pushover last time we played them harry caught the snitch in about five minutes remember 
 
 we were playing in completely different conditions wood shouted his eyes bulging slightly put a very strong side together an excellent seeker i was afraid take it like this we relax we must keep our focus slytherin is trying to us we must win 
 
 oliver calm down said fred looking slightly alarmed taking hufflepuff very seriously seriously 
 
 
 
 the day before the match the winds reached howling point and the rain fell harder than ever it was so dark inside the corridors and classrooms that extra torches and lanterns were lit the slytherin team was looking very smug indeed and none more so than malfoy 
 
 ah if only my arm was feeling a bit better he sighed as the gale outside pounded the windows 
 
 harry had no room in his head to worry about anything except the match tomorrow oliver wood kept hurrying up to him between classes and giving him tips the third time this happened wood talked for so long that harry suddenly realized he was ten minutes late for defense against the dark arts and set off at a run with wood shouting after him got a very fast swerve harry so you might want to try looping him 
 
 harry skidded to a halt outside the defense against the dark arts classroom pulled the door open and dashed inside 
 
 sorry late professor lupin i 
 
 but it professor lupin who looked up at him from the desk it was snape 
 
 this lesson began ten minutes ago potter so i think make it ten points from gryffindor sit down 
 
 but harry move 
 
 professor lupin he said 
 
 he says he is feeling too ill to teach today said snape with a twisted smile i believe i told you to sit down 
 
 but harry stayed where he was 
 
 wrong with him 
 
 black eyes glittered 
 
 nothing he said looking as though he wished it were five more points from gryffindor and if i have to ask you to sit down again it will be fifty 
 
 harry walked slowly to his seat and sat down snape looked around at the class 
 
 as i was saying before potter interrupted professor lupin has not left any record of the topics you have covered so far 
 
 please sir done boggarts red caps kappas and grindylows said hermione quickly and just about to start 
 
 be quiet said snape coldly i did not ask for information i was merely commenting on professor lack of organization 
 
 the best defense against the dark arts teacher ever had said dean thomas boldly and there was a murmur of agreement from the rest of the class snape looked more menacing than ever 
 
 you are easily satisfied lupin is hardly overtaxing you i would expect first years to be able to deal with red caps and grindylows today we shall discuss 
 
 harry watched him flick through the textbook to the very back chapter which he must know they covered 
 
 werewolves said snape 
 
 but sir said hermione seemingly unable to restrain herself not supposed to do werewolves yet due to start hinkypunks 
 
 miss granger said snape in a voice of deadly calm i was under the impression that i am teaching this lesson not you and i am telling you all to turn to page he glanced around again all of you now 
 
 with many bitter sidelong looks and some sullen muttering the class opened their books 
 
 which of you can tell me how we distinguish between the werewolf and the true wolf said snape 
 
 everyone sat in motionless silence everyone except hermione whose hand as it so often did had shot straight into the air 
 
 anyone snape said ignoring hermione his twisted smile was back are you telling me that professor lupin even taught you the basic distinction between 
 
 we told you said parvati suddenly we got as far as werewolves yet still on 
 
 silence snarled snape well well well i never thought meet a class who even recognize a werewolf when they saw one i shall make a point of informing professor dumbledore how very behind you all are 
 
 please sir said hermione whose hand was still in the air the werewolf differs from the true wolf in several small ways the snout of the werewolf 
 
 that is the second time you have spoken out of turn miss granger said snape coolly five more points from gryffindor for being an insufferable 
 
 hermione went very red put down her hand and stared at the floor with her eyes full of tears it was a mark of how much the class loathed snape that they were all glaring at him because every one of them had called hermione a at least once and ron who told hermione she was a at least twice a week said loudly you asked us a question and she knows the answer why ask if you want to be told 
 
 the class knew instantly gone too far snape advanced on ron slowly and the room held its breath 
 
 detention weasley snape said silkily his face very close to and if i ever hear you criticize the way i teach a class again you will be very sorry indeed 
 
 no one made a sound throughout the rest of the lesson they sat and made notes on werewolves from the textbook while snape prowled up and down the rows of desks examining the work they had been doing with professor lupin 
 
 very poorly explainedthat is incorrect the kappa is more commonly found in mongoliaprofessor lupin gave this eight out of ten i have given it three 
 
 when the bell rang at last snape held them back 
 
 you will each write an essay to be handed in to me on the ways you recognize and kill werewolves i want two rolls of parchment on the subject and i want them by monday morning it is time somebody took this class in hand weasley stay behind we need to arrange your detention 
 
 harry and hermione left the room with the rest of the class who waited until they were well out of earshot then burst into a furious tirade about snape 
 
 never been like this with any of our other defense against the dark arts teachers even if he did want the job harry said to hermione he got it in for lupin think this is all because of the boggart 
 
 i know said hermione pensively but i really hope professor lupin gets better soon 
 
 ron caught up with them five minutes later in a towering rage 
 
 know what that he called snape something that made hermione say ron is making me do got to scrub out the bedpans in the hospital wing without magic he was breathing deeply his fists clenched why black have hidden in office eh he could have finished him off for us 
 
 
 
 harry woke extremely early the next morning so early that it was still dark for a moment he thought the roaring of the wind had woken him then he felt a cold breeze on the back of his neck and sat bolt upright peeves the poltergeist had been floating next to him blowing hard in his ear 
 
 what did you do that for said harry furiously peeves puffed out his cheeks blew hard and zoomed backward out of the room cackling 
 
 harry fumbled for his alarm clock and looked at it it was half past four cursing peeves he rolled over and tried to get back to sleep but it was very difficult now that he was awake to ignore the sounds of the thunder rumbling overhead the pounding of the wind against the castle walls and the distant creaking of the trees in the forbidden forest in a few hours he would be out on the quidditch field battling through that gale finally he gave up any thought of more sleep got up dressed picked up his nimbus two thousand and walked quietly out of the dormitory 
 
 as harry opened the door something brushed against his leg he bent down just in time to grab crookshanks by the end of his bushy tail and drag him outside 
 
 you know i reckon ron was right about you harry told crookshanks suspiciously there are plenty of mice around this place go and chase them go on he added nudging crookshanks down the spiral staircase with his foot leave scabbers alone 
 
 the noise of the storm was even louder in the common room harry knew better than to think the match would be canceled quidditch matches called off for trifles like thunderstorms nevertheless he was starting to feel very apprehensive wood had pointed out cedric diggory to him in the corridor diggory was a fifth year and a lot bigger than harry seekers were usually light and speedy but weight would be an advantage in this weather because he was less likely to be blown off course 
 
 harry whiled away the hours until dawn in front of the fire getting up every now and then to stop crookshanks from sneaking up the boys staircase again at long last harry thought it must be time for breakfast so he headed through the portrait hole alone 
 
 stand and fight you mangy cur yelled sir cadogan 
 
 oh shut up harry yawned 
 
 he revived a bit over a large bowl of porridge and by the time started on toast the rest of the team had turned up 
 
 going to be a tough one said wood who eating anything 
 
 stop worrying oliver said alicia soothingly we mind a bit of rain 
 
 but it was considerably more than a bit of rain such was the popularity of quidditch that the whole school turned out to watch the match as usual but they ran down the lawns toward the quidditch field heads bowed against the ferocious wind umbrellas being whipped out of their hands as they went just before he entered the locker room harry saw malfoy crabbe and goyle laughing and pointing at him from under an enormous umbrella on their way to the stadium 
 
 the team changed into their scarlet robes and waited for usual pep talk but it come he tried to speak several times made an odd gulping noise then shook his head hopelessly and beckoned them to follow him 
 
 the wind was so strong that they staggered sideways as they walked out onto the field if the crowd was cheering they hear it over the fresh rolls of thunder rain was splattering over glasses how on earth was he going to see the snitch in this 
 
 the hufflepuffs were approaching from the opposite side of the field wearing robes the captains walked up to each other and shook hands diggory smiled at wood but wood now looked as though he had lockjaw and merely nodded harry saw madam mouth form the words mount your brooms he pulled his right foot out of the mud with a squelch and swung it over his nimbus two thousand madam hooch put her whistle to her lips and gave it a blast that sounded shrill and distant they were off 
 
 harry rose fast but his nimbus was swerving slightly with the wind he held it as steady as he could and turned squinting into the rain 
 
 within five minutes harry was soaked to his skin and frozen hardly able to see his teammates let alone the tiny snitch he flew backward and forward across the field past blurred red and yellow shapes with no idea of what was happening in the rest of the game he hear the commentary over the wind the crowd was hidden beneath a sea of cloaks and battered umbrellas twice harry came very close to being unseated by a bludger his vision was so clouded by the rain on his glasses he seen them coming 
 
 he lost track of time it was getting harder and harder to hold his broom straight the sky was getting darker as though night had decided to come early twice harry nearly hit another player without knowing whether it was a teammate or opponent everyone was now so wet and the rain so thick he could hardly tell them apart 
 
 with the first flash of lightning came the sound of madam whistle harry could just see the outline of wood through the thick rain gesturing him to the ground the whole team splashed down into the mud 
 
 i called for wood roared at his team come on under here 
 
 they huddled at the edge of the field under a large umbrella harry took off his glasses and wiped them hurriedly on his robes 
 
 the score 
 
 fifty points up said wood but unless we get the snitch soon be playing into the night 
 
 got no chance with these on harry said exasperatedly waving his glasses 
 
 at that very moment hermione appeared at his shoulder she was holding her cloak over her head and was inexplicably beaming 
 
 had an idea harry give me your glasses quick 
 
 he handed them to her and as the team watched in amazement hermione tapped them with her wand and said impervius 
 
 there she said handing them back to harry repel water 
 
 wood looked as though he could have kissed her 
 
 brilliant he called hoarsely after her as she disappeared into the crowd okay team go for it 
 
 spell had done the trick harry was still numb with cold still wetter than ever been in his life but he could see full of fresh determination he urged his broom through the turbulent air staring in every direction for the snitch avoiding a bludger ducking beneath diggory who was streaking in the opposite direction 
 
 there was another clap of thunder followed immediately by forked lightning this was getting more and more dangerous harry needed to get the snitch quickly 
 
 he turned intending to head back toward the middle of the field but at that moment another flash of lightning illuminated the stands and harry saw something that distracted him completely the silhouette of an enormous shaggy black dog clearly imprinted against the sky motionless in the topmost empty row of seats 
 
 numb hands slipped on the broom handle and his nimbus dropped a few feet shaking his sodden bangs out of his eyes he squinted back into the stands the dog had vanished 
 
 harry came anguished yell from the gryffindor goal posts harry behind you 
 
 harry looked wildly around cedric diggory was pelting up the field and a tiny speck of gold was shimmering in the air between them 
 
 with a jolt of panic harry threw himself flat to the broom handle and zoomed toward the snitch 
 
 come on he growled at his nimbus as the rain whipped his face faster 
 
 but something odd was happening an eerie silence was falling across the stadium the wind though as strong as ever was forgetting to roar it was as though someone had turned off the sound as though harry had gone suddenly deaf what was going on 
 
 and then a horribly familiar wave of cold swept over him inside him just as he became aware of something moving on the field below 
 
 before had time to think harry had taken his eyes off the snitch and looked down 
 
 at least a hundred dementors their hidden faces pointing up at him were standing beneath him it was as though freezing water were rising in his chest cutting at his insides and then he heard it againsomeone was screaming screaming inside his heada woman 
 
 not harry not harry please not harry 
 
 stand aside you silly girlstand aside now 
 
 not harry please no take me kill me instead 
 
 numbing swirling white mist was filling brainwhat was he doing why was he flying he needed to help hershe was going to dieshe was going to be murdered 
 
 he was falling falling through the icy mist 
 
 not harry pleasehave mercyhave mercy 
 
 a shrill voice was laughing the woman was screaming and harry knew no more 
 
 lucky the ground was so soft 
 
 i thought he was dead for sure 
 
 but he even break his glasses 
 
 harry could hear the voices whispering but they made no sense whatsoever he have a clue where he was or how got there or what been doing before he got there all he knew was that every inch of him was aching as though it had been beaten 
 
 that was the scariest thing ever seen in my life 
 
 scariestthe scariest thinghooded black figurescoldscreaming 
 
 eyes snapped open he was lying in the hospital wing the gryffindor quidditch team spattered with mud from head to foot was gathered around his bed ron and hermione were also there looking as though just climbed out of a swimming pool 
 
 harry said fred who looked extremely white underneath the mud you feeling 
 
 it was as though memory was on fast forward the lightningthe grimthe snitchand the dementors 
 
 what happened he said sitting up so suddenly they all gasped 
 
 you fell off said fred been what fifty feet 
 
 we thought died said alicia who was shaking 
 
 hermione made a small squeaky noise her eyes were extremely bloodshot 
 
 but the match said harry what happened are we doing a replay 
 
 no one said anything the horrible truth sank into harry like a stone 
 
 we lose 
 
 diggory got the snitch said george just after you fell he realize what had happened when he looked back and saw you on the ground he tried to call it off wanted a rematch but they won fair and squareeven wood admits it 
 
 where is wood said harry suddenly realizing he there 
 
 still in the showers said fred we think trying to drown himself 
 
 harry put his face to his knees his hands gripping his hair fred grabbed his shoulder and shook it roughly 
 
 harry never missed the snitch before 
 
 there had to be one time you get it said george 
 
 not over yet said fred we lost by a hundred points 
 
 right so if hufflepuff loses to ravenclaw and we beat ravenclaw and slytherin 
 
 have to lose by at least two hundred points said george 
 
 but if they beat ravenclaw 
 
 no way ravenclaw is too good but if slytherin loses against hufflepuff 
 
 it all depends on the points a margin of a hundred either way 
 
 harry lay there not saying a word they had lostfor the first time ever he had lost a quidditch match 
 
 after ten minutes or so madam pomfrey came over to tell the team to leave him in peace 
 
 come and see you later fred told him beat yourself up harry still the best seeker ever had 
 
 the team trooped out trailing mud behind them madam pomfrey shut the door behind them looking disapproving ron and hermione moved nearer to bed 
 
 dumbledore was really angry hermione said in a quaking voice never seen him like that before he ran onto the field as you fell waved his wand and you sort of slowed down before you hit the ground then he whirled his wand at the dementors shot silver stuff at them they left the stadium right awayhe was furious come onto the grounds we heard him 
 
 then he magicked you onto a stretcher said ron and walked up to school with you floating on it everyone thought you were 
 
 his voice faded but harry hardly noticed he was thinking about what the dementors had done to himabout the screaming voice he looked up and saw ron and hermione looking at him so anxiously that he quickly cast around for something to say 
 
 did someone get my nimbus 
 
 ron and hermione looked quickly at each other 
 
 er 
 
 what said harry looking from one to the other 
 
 wellwhen you fell off it got blown away said hermione hesitantly 
 
 and 
 
 and it hit it hit oh harry it hit the whomping willow 
 
 insides lurched the whomping willow was a very violent tree that stood alone in the middle of the grounds 
 
 and he said dreading the answer 
 
 well you know the whomping willow said ron it it like being hit 
 
 professor flitwick brought it back just before you came around said hermione in a very small voice 
 
 slowly she reached down for a bag at her feet turned it upside down and tipped a dozen bits of splintered wood and twig onto the bed the only remains of faithful finally beaten broomstick

lionfish nov chapter nine the dark markcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 tell your mother been gambling mr weasley implored fred and george as they all made their way slowly down the stairs 
 
 worry dad said fred gleefully got big plans for this money we want it confiscated 
 
 mr weasley looked for a moment as though he was going to ask what these big plans were but seemed to decide upon reflection that he want to know 
 
 they were soon caught up in the crowds now flooding out of the stadium and back to their campsites raucous singing was borne toward them on the night air as they retraced their steps along the path and leprechauns kept shooting over their heads cackling and waving their lanterns when they finally reached the tents nobody felt like sleeping at all and given the level of noise around them mr weasley agreed that they could all have one last cup of cocoa together before turning in they were soon arguing enjoyably about the match mr weasley got drawn into a disagreement about cobbing with charlie and it was only when ginny fell asleep right at the tiny table and spilled hot chocolate all over the floor that mr weasley called a halt to the verbal replays and insisted that everyone go to bed hermione and ginny went into the next tent and harry and the rest of the weasleys changed into pajamas and clambered into their bunks from the other side of the campsite they could still hear much singing and the odd echoing bang 
 
 oh i am glad not on duty muttered mr weasley sleepily i fancy having to go and tell the irish got to stop celebrating 
 
 harry who was on a top bunk above ron lay staring up at the canvas ceiling of the tent watching the glow of an occasional leprechaun lantern flying overhead and picturing again some of more spectacular moves he was itching to get back on his own firebolt and try out the wronski oliver wood had never managed to convey with all his wriggling diagrams what that move was supposed to look saw himself in robes that had his name on the back and imagined the sensation of hearing a crowd roar as ludo voice echoed throughout the stadium i give 
 
 harry never knew whether or not he had actually dropped off to sleep his fantasies of flying like krum might well have slipped into actual dreams all he knew was that quite suddenly mr weasley was shouting 
 
 get up ron harry come on now get up this is urgent 
 
 harry sat up quickly and the top of his head hit canvas 
 
 s matter he said 
 
 dimly he could tell that something was wrong the noises in the campsite had changed the singing had stopped he could hear screams and the sound of people running he slipped down from the bunk and reached for his clothes but mr weasley who had pulled on his jeans over his own pajamas said no time harry just grab a jacket and get outside quickly 
 
 harry did as he was told and hurried out of the tent ron at his heels 
 
 by the light of the few fires that were still burning he could see people running away into the woods fleeing something that was moving across the field toward them something that was emitting odd flashes of light and noises like gunfire loud jeering roars of laughter and drunken yells were drifting toward them then came a burst of strong green light which illuminated the scene 
 
 a crowd of wizards tightly packed and moving together with wands pointing straight upward was marching slowly across the field harry squinted at seem to have he realized that their heads were hooded and their faces masked high above them floating along in midair four struggling figures were being contorted into grotesque shapes it was as though the masked wizards on the ground were puppeteers and the people above them were marionettes operated by invisible strings that rose from the wands into the air two of the figures were very small 
 
 more wizards were joining the marching group laughing and pointing up at the floating bodies tents crumpled and fell as the marching crowd swelled once or twice harry saw one of the marchers blast a tent out of his way with his wand several caught fire the screaming grew louder 
 
 the floating people were suddenly illuminated as they passed over a burning tent and harry recognized one of them mr roberts the campsite manager the other three looked as though they might be his wife and children one of the marchers below flipped mrs roberts upside down with his wand her nightdress fell down to reveal voluminous drawers and she struggled to cover herself up as the crowd below her screeched and hooted with glee 
 
 sick ron muttered watching the smallest muggle child who had begun to spin like a top sixty feet above the ground his head flopping limply from side to side that is really sick 
 
 hermione and ginny came hurrying toward them pulling coats over their nightdresses with mr weasley right behind them at the same moment bill charlie and percy emerged from the boys tent fully dressed with their sleeves rolled up and their wands out 
 
 going to help the ministry mr weasley shouted over all the noise rolling up his own sleeves you lot get into the woods and stick together come and fetch you when sorted this out 
 
 bill charlie and percy were already sprinting away toward the oncoming marchers mr weasley tore after them ministry wizards were dashing from every direction toward the source of the trouble the crowd beneath the roberts family was coming ever closer 
 
 said fred grabbing hand and starting to pull her toward the wood harry ron hermione and george followed they all looked back as they reached the trees the crowd beneath the roberts family was larger than ever they could see the ministry wizards trying to get through it to the hooded wizards in the center but they were having great difficulty it looked as though they were scared to perform any spell that might make the roberts family fall 
 
 the colored lanterns that had lit the path to the stadium had been extinguished dark figures were blundering through the trees children were crying anxious shouts and panicked voices were reverberating around them in the cold night air harry felt himself being pushed hither and thither by people whose faces he could not see then he heard ron yell with pain 
 
 what happened said hermione anxiously stopping so abruptly that harry walked into her ron where are you oh this is stupid lumos 
 
 she illuminated her wand and directed its narrow beam across the path ron was lying sprawled on the ground 
 
 tripped over a tree root he said angrily getting to his feet again 
 
 well with feet that size hard not to said a drawling voice from behind them 
 
 harry ron and hermione turned sharply draco malfoy was standing alone nearby leaning against a tree looking utterly relaxed his arms folded he seemed to have been watching the scene at the campsite through a gap in the trees 
 
 ron told malfoy to do something that harry knew he would never have dared say in front of mrs weasley 
 
 language weasley said malfoy his pale eyes glittering you better be hurrying along now you like her spotted would you 
 
 he nodded at hermione and at the same moment a blast like a bomb sounded from the campsite and a flash of green light momentarily lit the trees around them 
 
 that supposed to mean said hermione defiantly 
 
 granger after muggles said malfoy want to be showing off your knickers in midair because if you do hang moving this way and it would give us all a laugh 
 
 a witch harry snarled 
 
 have it your own way potter said malfoy grinning maliciously if you think they spot a mudblood stay where you are 
 
 you watch your mouth shouted ron everybody present knew that mudblood was a very offensive term for a witch or wizard of muggle parentage 
 
 never mind ron said hermione quickly seizing arm to restrain him as he took a step toward malfoy 
 
 there came a bang from the other side of the trees that was louder than anything they had heard several people nearby screamed malfoy chuckled softly 
 
 scare easily they he said lazily i suppose your daddy told you all to hide he up to trying to rescue the muggles 
 
 your parents said harry his temper rising out there wearing masks are they 
 
 malfoy turned his face to harry still smiling 
 
 wellif they were i be likely to tell you would i potter 
 
 oh come on said hermione with a disgusted look at malfoy go and find the others 
 
 keep that big bushy head down granger sneered malfoy 
 
 come on hermione repeated and she pulled harry and ron up the path again 
 
 bet you anything his dad is one of that masked lot said ron hotly 
 
 well with any luck the ministry will catch him said hermione fervently oh i believe this where have the others got to 
 
 fred george and ginny were nowhere to be seen though the path was packed with plenty of other people all looking nervously over their shoulders toward the commotion back at the campsite a huddle of teenagers in pajamas was arguing vociferously a little way along the path when they saw harry ron and hermione a girl with thick curly hair turned and said quickly o est madame maxime nous perdue 
 
 er what said ron 
 
 oh the girl who had spoken turned her back on him and as they walked on they distinctly heard her say ogwarts 
 
 beauxbatons muttered hermione 
 
 sorry said harry 
 
 they must go to beauxbatons said hermione you knowbeauxbatons academy of read about it in an appraisal of magical education in europe 
 
 ohyeahright said harry 
 
 fred and george have gone that far said ron pulling out his wand lighting it like and squinting up the path harry dug in the pockets of his jacket for his own wand but it there the only thing he could find was his omnioculars 
 
 ah no i believe lost my wand 
 
 kidding 
 
 ron and hermione raised their wands high enough to spread the narrow beams of light farther on the ground harry looked all around him but his wand was nowhere to be seen 
 
 maybe back in the tent said ron 
 
 maybe it fell out of your pocket when we were running hermione suggested anxiously 
 
 yeah said harry maybe 
 
 he usually kept his wand with him at all times in the wizarding world and finding himself without it in the midst of a scene like this made him feel very vulnerable 
 
 a rustling noise nearby made all three of them jump winky the was fighting her way out of a clump of bushes nearby she was moving in a most peculiar fashion apparently with great difficulty it was as though someone invisible were trying to hold her back 
 
 there is bad wizards about she squeaked distractedly as she leaned forward and labored to keep running people high high in the air winky is getting out of the way 
 
 and she disappeared into the trees on the other side of the path panting and squeaking as she fought the force that was restraining her 
 
 up with her said ron looking curiously after winky why she run properly 
 
 bet she ask permission to hide said harry he was thinking of dobby every time he had tried to do something the malfoys like the had been forced to start beating himself up 
 
 you know get a very raw deal said hermione indignantly slavery what it is that mr crouch made her go up to the top of the stadium and she was terrified and got her bewitched so she even run when they start trampling tents why anyone do something about it 
 
 well the elves are happy they ron said you heard old winky back at the is not supposed to have what she likes being bossed around 
 
 people like you ron hermione began hotly who prop up rotten and unjust systems just because too lazy to 
 
 another loud bang echoed from the edge of the wood 
 
 just keep moving shall we said ron and harry saw him glance edgily at hermione perhaps there was truth in what malfoy had said perhaps hermione was in more danger than they were they set off again harry still searching his pockets even though he knew his wand there 
 
 they followed the dark path deeper into the wood still keeping an eye out for fred george and ginny they passed a group of goblins who were cackling over a sack of gold that they had undoubtedly won betting on the match and who seemed quite unperturbed by the trouble at the campsite farther still along the path they walked into a patch of silvery light and when they looked through the trees they saw three tall and beautiful veela standing in a clearing surrounded by a gaggle of young wizards all of whom were talking very loudly 
 
 i pull down about a hundred sacks of galleons a year one of them shouted a dragon killer for the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures 
 
 no not yelled his friend a dishwasher at the leaky cauldronbut a vampire hunter killed about ninety so far 
 
 a third young wizard whose pimples were visible even by the dim silvery light of the veela now cut in about to become the youngest ever minister of magic i am 
 
 harry snorted with laughter he recognized the pimply wizard his name was stan shunpike and he was in fact a conductor on the knight bus he turned to tell ron this but face had gone oddly slack and next second ron was yelling did i tell you invented a broomstick reach jupiter 
 
 honestly said hermione and she and harry grabbed ron firmly by the arms wheeled him around and marched him away by the time the sounds of the veela and their admirers had faded completely they were in the very heart of the wood they seemed to be alone now everything was much quieter 
 
 harry looked around i reckon we can just wait here you know hear anyone coming a mile off 
 
 the words were hardly out of his mouth when ludo bagman emerged from behind a tree right ahead of them 
 
 even by the feeble light of the two wands harry could see that a great change had come over bagman he no longer looked buoyant and there was no more spring in his step he looked very white and strained 
 
 that he said blinking down at them trying to make out their faces what are you doing in here all alone 
 
 they looked at one another surprised 
 
 well a sort of riot going on said ron 
 
 bagman stared at him 
 
 what 
 
 at the campsitesome people have got hold of a family of muggles 
 
 bagman swore loudly 
 
 damn them he said looking quite distracted and without another word he disapparated with a small pop 
 
 not exactly on top of things mr bagman is he said hermione frowning 
 
 he was a great beater though said ron leading the way off the path into a small clearing and sitting down on a patch of dry grass at the foot of a tree the wimbourne wasps won the league three times in a row while he was with them 
 
 he took his small figure of krum out of his pocket set it down on the ground and watched it walk around like the real krum the model was slightly and much less impressive on his splayed feet than on his broomstick harry was listening for noise from the campsite everything seemed much quieter perhaps the riot was over 
 
 i hope the others are okay said hermione after a while 
 
 be fine said ron 
 
 imagine if your dad catches lucius malfoy said harry sitting down next to ron and watching the small figure of krum slouching over the fallen leaves always said like to get something on him 
 
 wipe the smirk off old face all right said ron 
 
 those poor muggles though said hermione nervously what if they get them down 
 
 they will said ron reassuringly find a way 
 
 mad though to do something like that when the whole ministry of out here tonight said hermione i mean how do they expect to get away with it do you think been drinking or are they just 
 
 but she broke off abruptly and looked over her shoulder harry and ron looked quickly around too it sounded as though someone was staggering toward their clearing they waited listening to the sounds of the uneven steps behind the dark trees but the footsteps came to a sudden halt 
 
 hello called harry 
 
 there was silence harry got to his feet and peered around the tree it was too dark to see very far but he could sense somebody standing just beyond the range of his vision 
 
 there he said 
 
 and then without warning the silence was rent by a voice unlike any they had heard in the wood and it uttered not a panicked shout but what sounded like a spell 
 
 morsmordre 
 
 and something vast green and glittering erupted from the patch of darkness eyes had been struggling to penetrate it flew up over the treetops and into the sky 
 
 what the gasped ron as he sprang to his feet again staring up at the thing that had appeared 
 
 for a split second harry thought it was another leprechaun formation then he realized that it was a colossal skull comprised of what looked like emerald stars with a serpent protruding from its mouth like a tongue as they watched it rose higher and higher blazing in a haze of greenish smoke etched against the black sky like a new constellation 
 
 suddenly the wood all around them erupted with screams harry understand why but the only possible cause was the sudden appearance of the skull which had now risen high enough to illuminate the entire wood like some grisly neon sign he scanned the darkness for the person who had conjured the skull but he see anyone 
 
 there he called again 
 
 harry come on move hermione had seized the collar of his jacket and was tugging him backward 
 
 the matter harry said startled to see her face so white and terrified 
 
 the dark mark harry hermione moaned pulling him as hard as she could sign 
 
 
 
 harry come on 
 
 harry turned ron was hurriedly scooping up his miniature krum the three of them started across the clearing but before they had taken a few hurried steps a series of popping noises announced the arrival of twenty wizards appearing from thin air surrounding them 
 
 harry whirled around and in an instant he registered one fact each of these wizards had his wand out and every wand was pointing right at himself ron and hermione 
 
 without pausing to think he yelled duck 
 
 he seized the other two and pulled them down onto the ground 
 
 stupefy roared twenty voices there was a blinding series of flashes and harry felt the hair on his head ripple as though a powerful wind had swept the clearing raising his head a fraction of an inch he saw jets of fiery red light flying over them from the wizards wands crossing one another bouncing off tree trunks rebounding into the darkness 
 
 stop yelled a voice he recognized stop my son 
 
 hair stopped blowing about he raised his head a little higher the wizard in front of him had lowered his wand he rolled over and saw mr weasley striding toward them looking terrified 
 
 ron harry his voice sounded shaky hermione are you all right 
 
 out of the way arthur said a cold curt voice 
 
 it was mr crouch he and the other ministry wizards were closing in on them harry got to his feet to face them mr face was taut with rage 
 
 which of you did it he snapped his sharp eyes darting between them which of you conjured the dark mark 
 
 we do that said harry gesturing up at the skull 
 
 we do anything said ron who was rubbing his elbow and looking indignantly at his father what did you want to attack us for 
 
 do not lie sir shouted mr crouch his wand was still pointing directly at ron and his eyes were popping he looked slightly mad you have been discovered at the scene of the crime 
 
 barty whispered a witch in a long woolen dressing gown kids barty never have been able to 
 
 where did the mark come from you three said mr weasley quickly 
 
 over there said hermione shakily pointing at the place where they had heard the voice there was someone behind the treesthey shouted words an incantation 
 
 oh stood over there did they said mr crouch turning his popping eyes on hermione now disbelief etched all over his face said an incantation did they you seem very well informed about how that mark is summoned missy 
 
 but none of the ministry wizards apart from mr crouch seemed to think it remotely likely that harry ron or hermione had conjured the skull on the contrary at words they had all raised their wands again and were pointing in the direction she had indicated squinting through the dark trees 
 
 too late said the witch in the woolen dressing gown shaking her head have disapparated 
 
 i think so said a wizard with a scrubby brown beard it was amos diggory father our stunners went right through those a good chance we got them 
 
 amos be careful said a few of the wizards warningly as mr diggory squared his shoulders raised his wand marched across the clearing and disappeared into the darkness hermione watched him vanish with her hands over her mouth 
 
 a few seconds later they heard mr diggory shout 
 
 yes we got them someone here unconscious but blimey 
 
 got someone shouted mr crouch sounding highly disbelieving who who is it 
 
 they heard snapping twigs the rustling of leaves and then crunching footsteps as mr diggory reemerged from behind the trees he was carrying a tiny limp figure in his arms harry recognized the tea towel at once it was winky 
 
 mr crouch did not move or speak as mr diggory deposited his elf on the ground at his feet the other ministry wizards were all staring at mr crouch for a few seconds crouch remained transfixed his eyes blazing in his white face as he stared down at winky then he appeared to come to life again 
 
 this cannot be he said jerkily no 
 
 he moved quickly around mr diggory and strode off toward the place where he had found winky 
 
 no point mr crouch mr diggory called after him no one else there 
 
 but mr crouch did not seem prepared to take his word for it they could hear him moving around and the rustling of leaves as he pushed the bushes aside searching 
 
 bit embarrassing mr diggory said grimly looking down at unconscious form barty mean to say 
 
 come off it amos said mr weasley quietly you seriously think it was the elf the dark a sign it requires a wand 
 
 yeah said mr diggory and she had a wand 
 
 what said mr weasley 
 
 here look mr diggory held up a wand and showed it to mr weasley had it in her hand so clause three of the code of wand use broken for a start no creature is permitted to carry or use a wand 
 
 just then there was another pop and ludo bagman apparated right next to mr weasley looking breathless and disorientated he spun on the spot goggling upward at the skull 
 
 the dark mark he panted almost trampling winky as he turned inquiringly to his colleagues who did it did you get them barry going on 
 
 mr crouch had returned his face was still ghostly white and his hands and his toothbrush mustache were both twitching 
 
 where have you been barty said bagman why you at the match your elf was saving you a seat too gulping gargoyles bagman had just noticed winky lying at his feet what happened to her 
 
 i have been busy ludo said mr crouch still talking in the same jerky fashion barely moving his lips and my elf has been stunned 
 
 stunned by you lot you mean but why 
 
 comprehension dawned suddenly on round shiny face he looked up at the skull down at winky and then at mr crouch 
 
 no he said winky conjure the dark mark she know how need a wand for a start 
 
 and she had one said mr diggory i found her holding one ludo if all right with you mr crouch i think we should hear what got to say for herself 
 
 crouch gave no sign that he had heard mr diggory but mr diggory seemed to take his silence for assent he raised his own wand pointed it at winky and said ennervate 
 
 winky stirred feebly her great brown eyes opened and she blinked several times in a bemused sort of way watched by the silent wizards she raised herself shakily into a sitting position 
 
 she caught sight of mr feet and slowly tremulously raised her eyes to stare up into his face then more slowly still she looked up into the sky harry could see the floating skull reflected twice in her enormous glassy eyes she gave a gasp looked wildly around the crowded clearing and burst into terrified sobs 
 
 elf said mr diggory sternly do you know who i am a member of the department for the regulation and control of magical creatures 
 
 winky began to rock backward and forward on the ground her breath coming in sharp bursts harry was reminded forcibly of dobby in his moments of terrified disobedience 
 
 as you see elf the dark mark was conjured here a short while ago said mr diggory and you were discovered moments later right beneath it an explanation if you please 
 
 i i i is not doing it sir winky gasped i is not knowing how sir 
 
 you were found with a wand in your hand barked mr diggory brandishing it in front of her and as the wand caught the green light that was filling the clearing from the skull above harry recognized it 
 
 hey mine he said 
 
 everyone in the clearing looked at him 
 
 excuse me said mr diggory incredulously 
 
 my wand said harry i dropped it 
 
 you dropped it repeated mr diggory in disbelief is this a confession you threw it aside after you conjured the mark 
 
 amos think who talking to said mr weasley very angrily is harry potter likely to conjure the dark mark 
 
 er of course not mumbled mr diggory sorrycarried away 
 
 i drop it there anyway said harry jerking his thumb toward the trees beneath the skull i missed it right after we got into the wood 
 
 so said mr diggory his eyes hardening as he turned to look at winky again cowering at his feet you found this wand eh elf and you picked it up and thought have some fun with it did you 
 
 i is not doing magic with it sir squealed winky tears streaming down the sides of her squashed and bulbous nose i isi isi is just picking it up sir i is not making the dark mark sir i is not knowing how 
 
 it her said hermione she looked very nervous speaking up in front of all these ministry wizards yet determined all the same got a squeaky little voice and the voice we heard doing the incantation was much deeper she looked around at harry and ron appealing for their support it sound anything like winky did it 
 
 no said harry shaking his head it definitely sound like an elf 
 
 yeah it was a human voice said ron 
 
 well soon see growled mr diggory looking unimpressed a simple way of discovering the last spell a wand performed elf did you know that 
 
 winky trembled and shook her head frantically her ears flapping as mr diggory raised his own wand again and placed it tip to tip with 
 
 prior incantato roared mr diggory 
 
 harry heard hermione gasp horrified as a gigantic skull erupted from the point where the two wands met but it was a mere shadow of the green skull high above them it looked as though it were made of thick gray smoke the ghost of a spell 
 
 deletrius mr diggory shouted and the smoky skull vanished in a wisp of smoke 
 
 so said mr diggory with a kind of savage triumph looking down upon winky who was still shaking convulsively 
 
 i is not doing it she squealed her eyes rolling in terror i is not i is not i is not knowing how i is a good elf i using wands i knowing how 
 
 been caught elf mr diggory roared caught with the guilty wand in your hand 
 
 amos said mr weasley loudly think about itprecious few wizards know how to do that would she have learned it 
 
 perhaps amos is suggesting said mr crouch cold anger in every syllable that i routinely teach my servants to conjure the dark mark 
 
 there was a deeply unpleasant silence amos diggory looked horrified mr crouchnotnot at all 
 
 you have now come very close to accusing the two people in this clearing who are least likely to conjure that mark barked mr crouch harry potter and myself i suppose you are familiar with the story amos 
 
 of course everyone knows muttered mr diggory looking highly discomforted 
 
 and i trust you remember the many proofs i have given over a long career that i despise and detest the dark arts and those who practice them mr crouch shouted his eyes bulging again 
 
 mr crouch i i never suggested you had anything to do with it amos diggory muttered again now reddening behind his scrubby brown beard 
 
 if you accuse my elf you accuse me diggory shouted mr crouch where else would she have learned to conjure it 
 
 she she picked it up anywhere 
 
 precisely amos said mr weasley she might have picked it up he said kindly turning to the elf but she flinched as though he too was shouting at her where exactly did you find wand 
 
 winky was twisting the hem of her tea towel so violently that it was fraying beneath her fingers 
 
 i i is finding itfinding it there sir she whispered therein the trees sir 
 
 you see amos said mr weasley whoever conjured the mark could have disapparated right after done it leaving wand behind a clever thing to do not using their own wand which could have betrayed them and winky here had the misfortune to come across the wand moments later and pick it up 
 
 but then have been only a few feet away from the real culprit said mr diggory impatiently elf did you see anyone 
 
 winky began to tremble worse than ever her giant eyes flickered from mr diggory to ludo bagman and onto mr crouch then she gulped and said i is seeing no one sirno one 
 
 amos said mr crouch curtly i am fully aware that in the ordinary course of events you would want to take winky into your department for questioning i ask you however to allow me to deal with her 
 
 mr diggory looked as though he think much of this suggestion at all but it was clear to harry that mr crouch was such an important member of the ministry that he did not dare refuse him 
 
 you may rest assured that she will be punished mr crouch added coldly 
 
 winky stammered looking up at mr crouch her eyes brimming with tears 
 
 mr crouch stared back his face somehow sharpened each line upon it more deeply etched there was no pity in his gaze 
 
 winky has behaved tonight in a manner i would not have believed possible he said slowly i told her to remain in the tent i told her to stay there while i went to sort out the trouble and i find that she disobeyed me this means clothes 
 
 no shrieked winky prostrating herself at mr feet no master not clothes not clothes 
 
 harry knew that the only way to turn a free was to present it with proper garments it was pitiful to see the way winky clutched at her tea towel as she sobbed over mr feet 
 
 but she was frightened hermione burst out angrily glaring at mr crouch your scared of heights and those wizards in masks were levitating people you blame her for wanting to get out of their way 
 
 mr crouch took a step backward freeing himself from contact with the elf whom he was surveying as though she were something filthy and rotten that was contaminating his shoes 
 
 i have no use for a who disobeys me he said coldly looking over at hermione i have no use for a servant who forgets what is due to her master and to her reputation 
 
 winky was crying so hard that her sobs echoed around the clearing there was a very nasty silence which was ended by mr weasley who said quietly well i think take my lot back to the tent if got any objections amos that told us all it can if harry could have it back please 
 
 mr diggory handed harry his wand and harry pocketed it 
 
 come on you three mr weasley said quietly but hermione seem to want to move her eyes were still upon the sobbing elf hermione mr weasley said more urgently she turned and followed harry and ron out of the clearing and off through the trees 
 
 going to happen to winky said hermione the moment they had left the clearing 
 
 i know said mr weasley 
 
 the way they were treating her said hermione furiously mr diggory calling her elf all the timeand mr crouch he knows she do it and still going to sack her he care how frightened been or how upset she was it was like she even human 
 
 well not said ron 
 
 hermione rounded on him 
 
 that mean she got feelings ron disgusting the way 
 
 hermione i agree with you said mr weasley quickly beckoning her on but now is not the time to discuss elf rights i want to get back to the tent as fast as we can what happened to the others 
 
 we lost them in the dark said ron dad why was everyone so uptight about that skull thing 
 
 explain everything back at the tent said mr weasley tensely 
 
 but when they reached the edge of the wood their progress was impeded a large crowd of witches and wizards was congregated there and when they saw mr weasley coming toward them many of them surged forward 
 
 going on in there 
 
 who conjured it 
 
 arthur not him 
 
 of course not him said mr weasley impatiently we know who it was it looks like they disapparated now excuse me please i want to get to bed 
 
 he led harry ron and hermione through the crowd and back into the campsite all was quiet now there was no sign of the masked wizards though several ruined tents were still smoking 
 
 head was poking out of the boys tent 
 
 dad going on he called through the dark fred george and ginny got back okay but the others 
 
 got them here said mr weasley bending down and entering the tent harry ron and hermione entered after him 
 
 bill was sitting at the small kitchen table holding a bedsheet to his arm which was bleeding profusely charlie had a large rip in his shirt and percy was sporting a bloody nose fred george and ginny looked unhurt though shaken 
 
 did you get them dad said bill sharply the person who conjured the mark 
 
 no said mr weasley we found barry elf holding wand but none the wiser about who actually conured the mark 
 
 what said bill charlie and percy together 
 
 wand said fred 
 
 mr elf said percy sounding thunderstruck 
 
 with some assistance from harry ron and hermione mr weasley explained what had happened in the woods when they had finished their story percy swelled indignantly 
 
 well mr crouch is quite right to get rid of an elf like that he said running away when expressly told her not toembarrassing him in front of the whole ministryhow would that have looked if been brought up in front of the department for the regulation and control 
 
 she do anything she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time hermione snapped at percy who looked very taken aback hermione had always got on fairly well with percy better indeed than any of the others 
 
 hermione a wizard in mr position afford a going to run amok with a wand said percy pompously recovering himself 
 
 she run amok shouted hermione she just picked it up off the ground 
 
 look can someone just explain what that skull thing was said ron impatiently it hurting it such a big deal 
 
 i told you symbol ron said hermione before anyone else could answer i read about it in the rise and fall of the dark arts 
 
 and it been seen for thirteen years said mr weasley quietly of course people panickedit was almost like seeing back again 
 
 i get it said ron frowning i still only a shape in the sky 
 
 ron and his followers sent the dark mark into the air whenever they killed said mr weasley the terror it inspiredyou have no idea too young just picture coming home and finding the dark mark hovering over your house and knowing what about to find inside mr weasley winced worst fearthe very worst 
 
 there was silence for a moment then bill removing the sheet from his arm to check on his cut said well it help us tonight whoever conjured it it scared the death eaters away the moment they saw it they all disapparated before got near enough to unmask any of them we caught the robertses before they hit the ground though having their memories modified right now 
 
 death eaters said harry what are death eaters 
 
 what supporters called themselves said bill i think we saw left of them tonight the ones who managed to keep themselves out of azkaban anyway 
 
 we prove it was them bill said mr weasley though it probably was he added hopelessly 
 
 yeah i bet it was said ron suddenly dad we met draco malfoy in the woods and he as good as told us his dad was one of those nutters in masks and we all know the malfoys were right in with 
 
 but what were supporters harry began everybody flinched like most of the wizarding world the weasleys always avoided saying name sorry said harry quickly what were supporters up to levitating muggles i mean what was the point 
 
 the point said mr weasley with a hollow laugh harry their idea of fun half the muggle killings back when was in power were done for fun i suppose they had a few drinks tonight and resist reminding us all that lots of them are still at large a nice little reunion for them he finished disgustedly 
 
 but if they were the death eaters why did they disapparate when they saw the dark mark said ron have been pleased to see it they 
 
 use your brains ron said bill if they really were death eaters they worked very hard to keep out of azkaban when lost power and told all sorts of lies about him forcing them to kill and torture people i bet be even more frightened than the rest of us to see him come back they denied ever been involved with him when he lost his powers and went back to their daily reckon be with them do you 
 
 sowhoever conjured the dark mark said hermione slowly were they doing it to show support for the death eaters or to scare them away 
 
 your guess is as good as ours hermione said mr weasley but tell you thisit was only the death eaters who ever knew how to conjure it be very surprised if the person who did it been a death eater once even if not very late and if your mother hears happened be worried sick get a few more hours sleep and then try and get an early portkey out of here 
 
 harry got back into his bunk with his head buzzing he knew he ought to feel exhausted it was nearly three in the morning but he felt and worried 
 
 three days ago it felt like much longer but it had only been three days he had awoken with his scar burning and tonight for the first time in thirteen years lord mark had appeared in the sky what did these things mean 
 
 he thought of the letter he had written to sirius before leaving privet drive would sirius have gotten it yet when would he reply harry lay looking up at the canvas but no flying fantasies came to him now to ease him to sleep and it was a long time after snores filled the tent that harry finally dozed off 
 
 rowling

lionfish nov chapter nine the dark markcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 tell your mother been gambling mr weasley implored fred and george as they all made their way slowly down the stairs 
 
 worry dad said fred gleefully got big plans for this money we want it confiscated 
 
 mr weasley looked for a moment as though he was going to ask what these big plans were but seemed to decide upon reflection that he want to know 
 
 they were soon caught up in the crowds now flooding out of the stadium and back to their campsites raucous singing was borne toward them on the night air as they retraced their steps along the path and leprechauns kept shooting over their heads cackling and waving their lanterns when they finally reached the tents nobody felt like sleeping at all and given the level of noise around them mr weasley agreed that they could all have one last cup of cocoa together before turning in they were soon arguing enjoyably about the match mr weasley got drawn into a disagreement about cobbing with charlie and it was only when ginny fell asleep right at the tiny table and spilled hot chocolate all over the floor that mr weasley called a halt to the verbal replays and insisted that everyone go to bed hermione and ginny went into the next tent and harry and the rest of the weasleys changed into pajamas and clambered into their bunks from the other side of the campsite they could still hear much singing and the odd echoing bang 
 
 oh i am glad not on duty muttered mr weasley sleepily i fancy having to go and tell the irish got to stop celebrating 
 
 harry who was on a top bunk above ron lay staring up at the canvas ceiling of the tent watching the glow of an occasional leprechaun lantern flying overhead and picturing again some of more spectacular moves he was itching to get back on his own firebolt and try out the wronski oliver wood had never managed to convey with all his wriggling diagrams what that move was supposed to look saw himself in robes that had his name on the back and imagined the sensation of hearing a crowd roar as ludo voice echoed throughout the stadium i give 
 
 harry never knew whether or not he had actually dropped off to sleep his fantasies of flying like krum might well have slipped into actual dreams all he knew was that quite suddenly mr weasley was shouting 
 
 get up ron harry come on now get up this is urgent 
 
 harry sat up quickly and the top of his head hit canvas 
 
 s matter he said 
 
 dimly he could tell that something was wrong the noises in the campsite had changed the singing had stopped he could hear screams and the sound of people running he slipped down from the bunk and reached for his clothes but mr weasley who had pulled on his jeans over his own pajamas said no time harry just grab a jacket and get outside quickly 
 
 harry did as he was told and hurried out of the tent ron at his heels 
 
 by the light of the few fires that were still burning he could see people running away into the woods fleeing something that was moving across the field toward them something that was emitting odd flashes of light and noises like gunfire loud jeering roars of laughter and drunken yells were drifting toward them then came a burst of strong green light which illuminated the scene 
 
 a crowd of wizards tightly packed and moving together with wands pointing straight upward was marching slowly across the field harry squinted at seem to have he realized that their heads were hooded and their faces masked high above them floating along in midair four struggling figures were being contorted into grotesque shapes it was as though the masked wizards on the ground were puppeteers and the people above them were marionettes operated by invisible strings that rose from the wands into the air two of the figures were very small 
 
 more wizards were joining the marching group laughing and pointing up at the floating bodies tents crumpled and fell as the marching crowd swelled once or twice harry saw one of the marchers blast a tent out of his way with his wand several caught fire the screaming grew louder 
 
 the floating people were suddenly illuminated as they passed over a burning tent and harry recognized one of them mr roberts the campsite manager the other three looked as though they might be his wife and children one of the marchers below flipped mrs roberts upside down with his wand her nightdress fell down to reveal voluminous drawers and she struggled to cover herself up as the crowd below her screeched and hooted with glee 
 
 sick ron muttered watching the smallest muggle child who had begun to spin like a top sixty feet above the ground his head flopping limply from side to side that is really sick 
 
 hermione and ginny came hurrying toward them pulling coats over their nightdresses with mr weasley right behind them at the same moment bill charlie and percy emerged from the boys tent fully dressed with their sleeves rolled up and their wands out 
 
 going to help the ministry mr weasley shouted over all the noise rolling up his own sleeves you lot get into the woods and stick together come and fetch you when sorted this out 
 
 bill charlie and percy were already sprinting away toward the oncoming marchers mr weasley tore after them ministry wizards were dashing from every direction toward the source of the trouble the crowd beneath the roberts family was coming ever closer 
 
 said fred grabbing hand and starting to pull her toward the wood harry ron hermione and george followed they all looked back as they reached the trees the crowd beneath the roberts family was larger than ever they could see the ministry wizards trying to get through it to the hooded wizards in the center but they were having great difficulty it looked as though they were scared to perform any spell that might make the roberts family fall 
 
 the colored lanterns that had lit the path to the stadium had been extinguished dark figures were blundering through the trees children were crying anxious shouts and panicked voices were reverberating around them in the cold night air harry felt himself being pushed hither and thither by people whose faces he could not see then he heard ron yell with pain 
 
 what happened said hermione anxiously stopping so abruptly that harry walked into her ron where are you oh this is stupid lumos 
 
 she illuminated her wand and directed its narrow beam across the path ron was lying sprawled on the ground 
 
 tripped over a tree root he said angrily getting to his feet again 
 
 well with feet that size hard not to said a drawling voice from behind them 
 
 harry ron and hermione turned sharply draco malfoy was standing alone nearby leaning against a tree looking utterly relaxed his arms folded he seemed to have been watching the scene at the campsite through a gap in the trees 
 
 ron told malfoy to do something that harry knew he would never have dared say in front of mrs weasley 
 
 language weasley said malfoy his pale eyes glittering you better be hurrying along now you like her spotted would you 
 
 he nodded at hermione and at the same moment a blast like a bomb sounded from the campsite and a flash of green light momentarily lit the trees around them 
 
 that supposed to mean said hermione defiantly 
 
 granger after muggles said malfoy want to be showing off your knickers in midair because if you do hang moving this way and it would give us all a laugh 
 
 a witch harry snarled 
 
 have it your own way potter said malfoy grinning maliciously if you think they spot a mudblood stay where you are 
 
 you watch your mouth shouted ron everybody present knew that mudblood was a very offensive term for a witch or wizard of muggle parentage 
 
 never mind ron said hermione quickly seizing arm to restrain him as he took a step toward malfoy 
 
 there came a bang from the other side of the trees that was louder than anything they had heard several people nearby screamed malfoy chuckled softly 
 
 scare easily they he said lazily i suppose your daddy told you all to hide he up to trying to rescue the muggles 
 
 your parents said harry his temper rising out there wearing masks are they 
 
 malfoy turned his face to harry still smiling 
 
 wellif they were i be likely to tell you would i potter 
 
 oh come on said hermione with a disgusted look at malfoy go and find the others 
 
 keep that big bushy head down granger sneered malfoy 
 
 come on hermione repeated and she pulled harry and ron up the path again 
 
 bet you anything his dad is one of that masked lot said ron hotly 
 
 well with any luck the ministry will catch him said hermione fervently oh i believe this where have the others got to 
 
 fred george and ginny were nowhere to be seen though the path was packed with plenty of other people all looking nervously over their shoulders toward the commotion back at the campsite a huddle of teenagers in pajamas was arguing vociferously a little way along the path when they saw harry ron and hermione a girl with thick curly hair turned and said quickly o est madame maxime nous perdue 
 
 er what said ron 
 
 oh the girl who had spoken turned her back on him and as they walked on they distinctly heard her say ogwarts 
 
 beauxbatons muttered hermione 
 
 sorry said harry 
 
 they must go to beauxbatons said hermione you knowbeauxbatons academy of read about it in an appraisal of magical education in europe 
 
 ohyeahright said harry 
 
 fred and george have gone that far said ron pulling out his wand lighting it like and squinting up the path harry dug in the pockets of his jacket for his own wand but it there the only thing he could find was his omnioculars 
 
 ah no i believe lost my wand 
 
 kidding 
 
 ron and hermione raised their wands high enough to spread the narrow beams of light farther on the ground harry looked all around him but his wand was nowhere to be seen 
 
 maybe back in the tent said ron 
 
 maybe it fell out of your pocket when we were running hermione suggested anxiously 
 
 yeah said harry maybe 
 
 he usually kept his wand with him at all times in the wizarding world and finding himself without it in the midst of a scene like this made him feel very vulnerable 
 
 a rustling noise nearby made all three of them jump winky the was fighting her way out of a clump of bushes nearby she was moving in a most peculiar fashion apparently with great difficulty it was as though someone invisible were trying to hold her back 
 
 there is bad wizards about she squeaked distractedly as she leaned forward and labored to keep running people high high in the air winky is getting out of the way 
 
 and she disappeared into the trees on the other side of the path panting and squeaking as she fought the force that was restraining her 
 
 up with her said ron looking curiously after winky why she run properly 
 
 bet she ask permission to hide said harry he was thinking of dobby every time he had tried to do something the malfoys like the had been forced to start beating himself up 
 
 you know get a very raw deal said hermione indignantly slavery what it is that mr crouch made her go up to the top of the stadium and she was terrified and got her bewitched so she even run when they start trampling tents why anyone do something about it 
 
 well the elves are happy they ron said you heard old winky back at the is not supposed to have what she likes being bossed around 
 
 people like you ron hermione began hotly who prop up rotten and unjust systems just because too lazy to 
 
 another loud bang echoed from the edge of the wood 
 
 just keep moving shall we said ron and harry saw him glance edgily at hermione perhaps there was truth in what malfoy had said perhaps hermione was in more danger than they were they set off again harry still searching his pockets even though he knew his wand there 
 
 they followed the dark path deeper into the wood still keeping an eye out for fred george and ginny they passed a group of goblins who were cackling over a sack of gold that they had undoubtedly won betting on the match and who seemed quite unperturbed by the trouble at the campsite farther still along the path they walked into a patch of silvery light and when they looked through the trees they saw three tall and beautiful veela standing in a clearing surrounded by a gaggle of young wizards all of whom were talking very loudly 
 
 i pull down about a hundred sacks of galleons a year one of them shouted a dragon killer for the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures 
 
 no not yelled his friend a dishwasher at the leaky cauldronbut a vampire hunter killed about ninety so far 
 
 a third young wizard whose pimples were visible even by the dim silvery light of the veela now cut in about to become the youngest ever minister of magic i am 
 
 harry snorted with laughter he recognized the pimply wizard his name was stan shunpike and he was in fact a conductor on the knight bus he turned to tell ron this but face had gone oddly slack and next second ron was yelling did i tell you invented a broomstick reach jupiter 
 
 honestly said hermione and she and harry grabbed ron firmly by the arms wheeled him around and marched him away by the time the sounds of the veela and their admirers had faded completely they were in the very heart of the wood they seemed to be alone now everything was much quieter 
 
 harry looked around i reckon we can just wait here you know hear anyone coming a mile off 
 
 the words were hardly out of his mouth when ludo bagman emerged from behind a tree right ahead of them 
 
 even by the feeble light of the two wands harry could see that a great change had come over bagman he no longer looked buoyant and there was no more spring in his step he looked very white and strained 
 
 that he said blinking down at them trying to make out their faces what are you doing in here all alone 
 
 they looked at one another surprised 
 
 well a sort of riot going on said ron 
 
 bagman stared at him 
 
 what 
 
 at the campsitesome people have got hold of a family of muggles 
 
 bagman swore loudly 
 
 damn them he said looking quite distracted and without another word he disapparated with a small pop 
 
 not exactly on top of things mr bagman is he said hermione frowning 
 
 he was a great beater though said ron leading the way off the path into a small clearing and sitting down on a patch of dry grass at the foot of a tree the wimbourne wasps won the league three times in a row while he was with them 
 
 he took his small figure of krum out of his pocket set it down on the ground and watched it walk around like the real krum the model was slightly and much less impressive on his splayed feet than on his broomstick harry was listening for noise from the campsite everything seemed much quieter perhaps the riot was over 
 
 i hope the others are okay said hermione after a while 
 
 be fine said ron 
 
 imagine if your dad catches lucius malfoy said harry sitting down next to ron and watching the small figure of krum slouching over the fallen leaves always said like to get something on him 
 
 wipe the smirk off old face all right said ron 
 
 those poor muggles though said hermione nervously what if they get them down 
 
 they will said ron reassuringly find a way 
 
 mad though to do something like that when the whole ministry of out here tonight said hermione i mean how do they expect to get away with it do you think been drinking or are they just 
 
 but she broke off abruptly and looked over her shoulder harry and ron looked quickly around too it sounded as though someone was staggering toward their clearing they waited listening to the sounds of the uneven steps behind the dark trees but the footsteps came to a sudden halt 
 
 hello called harry 
 
 there was silence harry got to his feet and peered around the tree it was too dark to see very far but he could sense somebody standing just beyond the range of his vision 
 
 there he said 
 
 and then without warning the silence was rent by a voice unlike any they had heard in the wood and it uttered not a panicked shout but what sounded like a spell 
 
 morsmordre 
 
 and something vast green and glittering erupted from the patch of darkness eyes had been struggling to penetrate it flew up over the treetops and into the sky 
 
 what the gasped ron as he sprang to his feet again staring up at the thing that had appeared 
 
 for a split second harry thought it was another leprechaun formation then he realized that it was a colossal skull comprised of what looked like emerald stars with a serpent protruding from its mouth like a tongue as they watched it rose higher and higher blazing in a haze of greenish smoke etched against the black sky like a new constellation 
 
 suddenly the wood all around them erupted with screams harry understand why but the only possible cause was the sudden appearance of the skull which had now risen high enough to illuminate the entire wood like some grisly neon sign he scanned the darkness for the person who had conjured the skull but he see anyone 
 
 there he called again 
 
 harry come on move hermione had seized the collar of his jacket and was tugging him backward 
 
 the matter harry said startled to see her face so white and terrified 
 
 the dark mark harry hermione moaned pulling him as hard as she could sign 
 
 
 
 harry come on 
 
 harry turned ron was hurriedly scooping up his miniature krum the three of them started across the clearing but before they had taken a few hurried steps a series of popping noises announced the arrival of twenty wizards appearing from thin air surrounding them 
 
 harry whirled around and in an instant he registered one fact each of these wizards had his wand out and every wand was pointing right at himself ron and hermione 
 
 without pausing to think he yelled duck 
 
 he seized the other two and pulled them down onto the ground 
 
 stupefy roared twenty voices there was a blinding series of flashes and harry felt the hair on his head ripple as though a powerful wind had swept the clearing raising his head a fraction of an inch he saw jets of fiery red light flying over them from the wizards wands crossing one another bouncing off tree trunks rebounding into the darkness 
 
 stop yelled a voice he recognized stop my son 
 
 hair stopped blowing about he raised his head a little higher the wizard in front of him had lowered his wand he rolled over and saw mr weasley striding toward them looking terrified 
 
 ron harry his voice sounded shaky hermione are you all right 
 
 out of the way arthur said a cold curt voice 
 
 it was mr crouch he and the other ministry wizards were closing in on them harry got to his feet to face them mr face was taut with rage 
 
 which of you did it he snapped his sharp eyes darting between them which of you conjured the dark mark 
 
 we do that said harry gesturing up at the skull 
 
 we do anything said ron who was rubbing his elbow and looking indignantly at his father what did you want to attack us for 
 
 do not lie sir shouted mr crouch his wand was still pointing directly at ron and his eyes were popping he looked slightly mad you have been discovered at the scene of the crime 
 
 barty whispered a witch in a long woolen dressing gown kids barty never have been able to 
 
 where did the mark come from you three said mr weasley quickly 
 
 over there said hermione shakily pointing at the place where they had heard the voice there was someone behind the treesthey shouted words an incantation 
 
 oh stood over there did they said mr crouch turning his popping eyes on hermione now disbelief etched all over his face said an incantation did they you seem very well informed about how that mark is summoned missy 
 
 but none of the ministry wizards apart from mr crouch seemed to think it remotely likely that harry ron or hermione had conjured the skull on the contrary at words they had all raised their wands again and were pointing in the direction she had indicated squinting through the dark trees 
 
 too late said the witch in the woolen dressing gown shaking her head have disapparated 
 
 i think so said a wizard with a scrubby brown beard it was amos diggory father our stunners went right through those a good chance we got them 
 
 amos be careful said a few of the wizards warningly as mr diggory squared his shoulders raised his wand marched across the clearing and disappeared into the darkness hermione watched him vanish with her hands over her mouth 
 
 a few seconds later they heard mr diggory shout 
 
 yes we got them someone here unconscious but blimey 
 
 got someone shouted mr crouch sounding highly disbelieving who who is it 
 
 they heard snapping twigs the rustling of leaves and then crunching footsteps as mr diggory reemerged from behind the trees he was carrying a tiny limp figure in his arms harry recognized the tea towel at once it was winky 
 
 mr crouch did not move or speak as mr diggory deposited his elf on the ground at his feet the other ministry wizards were all staring at mr crouch for a few seconds crouch remained transfixed his eyes blazing in his white face as he stared down at winky then he appeared to come to life again 
 
 this cannot be he said jerkily no 
 
 he moved quickly around mr diggory and strode off toward the place where he had found winky 
 
 no point mr crouch mr diggory called after him no one else there 
 
 but mr crouch did not seem prepared to take his word for it they could hear him moving around and the rustling of leaves as he pushed the bushes aside searching 
 
 bit embarrassing mr diggory said grimly looking down at unconscious form barty mean to say 
 
 come off it amos said mr weasley quietly you seriously think it was the elf the dark a sign it requires a wand 
 
 yeah said mr diggory and she had a wand 
 
 what said mr weasley 
 
 here look mr diggory held up a wand and showed it to mr weasley had it in her hand so clause three of the code of wand use broken for a start no creature is permitted to carry or use a wand 
 
 just then there was another pop and ludo bagman apparated right next to mr weasley looking breathless and disorientated he spun on the spot goggling upward at the skull 
 
 the dark mark he panted almost trampling winky as he turned inquiringly to his colleagues who did it did you get them barry going on 
 
 mr crouch had returned his face was still ghostly white and his hands and his toothbrush mustache were both twitching 
 
 where have you been barty said bagman why you at the match your elf was saving you a seat too gulping gargoyles bagman had just noticed winky lying at his feet what happened to her 
 
 i have been busy ludo said mr crouch still talking in the same jerky fashion barely moving his lips and my elf has been stunned 
 
 stunned by you lot you mean but why 
 
 comprehension dawned suddenly on round shiny face he looked up at the skull down at winky and then at mr crouch 
 
 no he said winky conjure the dark mark she know how need a wand for a start 
 
 and she had one said mr diggory i found her holding one ludo if all right with you mr crouch i think we should hear what got to say for herself 
 
 crouch gave no sign that he had heard mr diggory but mr diggory seemed to take his silence for assent he raised his own wand pointed it at winky and said ennervate 
 
 winky stirred feebly her great brown eyes opened and she blinked several times in a bemused sort of way watched by the silent wizards she raised herself shakily into a sitting position 
 
 she caught sight of mr feet and slowly tremulously raised her eyes to stare up into his face then more slowly still she looked up into the sky harry could see the floating skull reflected twice in her enormous glassy eyes she gave a gasp looked wildly around the crowded clearing and burst into terrified sobs 
 
 elf said mr diggory sternly do you know who i am a member of the department for the regulation and control of magical creatures 
 
 winky began to rock backward and forward on the ground her breath coming in sharp bursts harry was reminded forcibly of dobby in his moments of terrified disobedience 
 
 as you see elf the dark mark was conjured here a short while ago said mr diggory and you were discovered moments later right beneath it an explanation if you please 
 
 i i i is not doing it sir winky gasped i is not knowing how sir 
 
 you were found with a wand in your hand barked mr diggory brandishing it in front of her and as the wand caught the green light that was filling the clearing from the skull above harry recognized it 
 
 hey mine he said 
 
 everyone in the clearing looked at him 
 
 excuse me said mr diggory incredulously 
 
 my wand said harry i dropped it 
 
 you dropped it repeated mr diggory in disbelief is this a confession you threw it aside after you conjured the mark 
 
 amos think who talking to said mr weasley very angrily is harry potter likely to conjure the dark mark 
 
 er of course not mumbled mr diggory sorrycarried away 
 
 i drop it there anyway said harry jerking his thumb toward the trees beneath the skull i missed it right after we got into the wood 
 
 so said mr diggory his eyes hardening as he turned to look at winky again cowering at his feet you found this wand eh elf and you picked it up and thought have some fun with it did you 
 
 i is not doing magic with it sir squealed winky tears streaming down the sides of her squashed and bulbous nose i isi isi is just picking it up sir i is not making the dark mark sir i is not knowing how 
 
 it her said hermione she looked very nervous speaking up in front of all these ministry wizards yet determined all the same got a squeaky little voice and the voice we heard doing the incantation was much deeper she looked around at harry and ron appealing for their support it sound anything like winky did it 
 
 no said harry shaking his head it definitely sound like an elf 
 
 yeah it was a human voice said ron 
 
 well soon see growled mr diggory looking unimpressed a simple way of discovering the last spell a wand performed elf did you know that 
 
 winky trembled and shook her head frantically her ears flapping as mr diggory raised his own wand again and placed it tip to tip with 
 
 prior incantato roared mr diggory 
 
 harry heard hermione gasp horrified as a gigantic skull erupted from the point where the two wands met but it was a mere shadow of the green skull high above them it looked as though it were made of thick gray smoke the ghost of a spell 
 
 deletrius mr diggory shouted and the smoky skull vanished in a wisp of smoke 
 
 so said mr diggory with a kind of savage triumph looking down upon winky who was still shaking convulsively 
 
 i is not doing it she squealed her eyes rolling in terror i is not i is not i is not knowing how i is a good elf i using wands i knowing how 
 
 been caught elf mr diggory roared caught with the guilty wand in your hand 
 
 amos said mr weasley loudly think about itprecious few wizards know how to do that would she have learned it 
 
 perhaps amos is suggesting said mr crouch cold anger in every syllable that i routinely teach my servants to conjure the dark mark 
 
 there was a deeply unpleasant silence amos diggory looked horrified mr crouchnotnot at all 
 
 you have now come very close to accusing the two people in this clearing who are least likely to conjure that mark barked mr crouch harry potter and myself i suppose you are familiar with the story amos 
 
 of course everyone knows muttered mr diggory looking highly discomforted 
 
 and i trust you remember the many proofs i have given over a long career that i despise and detest the dark arts and those who practice them mr crouch shouted his eyes bulging again 
 
 mr crouch i i never suggested you had anything to do with it amos diggory muttered again now reddening behind his scrubby brown beard 
 
 if you accuse my elf you accuse me diggory shouted mr crouch where else would she have learned to conjure it 
 
 she she picked it up anywhere 
 
 precisely amos said mr weasley she might have picked it up he said kindly turning to the elf but she flinched as though he too was shouting at her where exactly did you find wand 
 
 winky was twisting the hem of her tea towel so violently that it was fraying beneath her fingers 
 
 i i is finding itfinding it there sir she whispered therein the trees sir 
 
 you see amos said mr weasley whoever conjured the mark could have disapparated right after done it leaving wand behind a clever thing to do not using their own wand which could have betrayed them and winky here had the misfortune to come across the wand moments later and pick it up 
 
 but then have been only a few feet away from the real culprit said mr diggory impatiently elf did you see anyone 
 
 winky began to tremble worse than ever her giant eyes flickered from mr diggory to ludo bagman and onto mr crouch then she gulped and said i is seeing no one sirno one 
 
 amos said mr crouch curtly i am fully aware that in the ordinary course of events you would want to take winky into your department for questioning i ask you however to allow me to deal with her 
 
 mr diggory looked as though he think much of this suggestion at all but it was clear to harry that mr crouch was such an important member of the ministry that he did not dare refuse him 
 
 you may rest assured that she will be punished mr crouch added coldly 
 
 winky stammered looking up at mr crouch her eyes brimming with tears 
 
 mr crouch stared back his face somehow sharpened each line upon it more deeply etched there was no pity in his gaze 
 
 winky has behaved tonight in a manner i would not have believed possible he said slowly i told her to remain in the tent i told her to stay there while i went to sort out the trouble and i find that she disobeyed me this means clothes 
 
 no shrieked winky prostrating herself at mr feet no master not clothes not clothes 
 
 harry knew that the only way to turn a free was to present it with proper garments it was pitiful to see the way winky clutched at her tea towel as she sobbed over mr feet 
 
 but she was frightened hermione burst out angrily glaring at mr crouch your scared of heights and those wizards in masks were levitating people you blame her for wanting to get out of their way 
 
 mr crouch took a step backward freeing himself from contact with the elf whom he was surveying as though she were something filthy and rotten that was contaminating his shoes 
 
 i have no use for a who disobeys me he said coldly looking over at hermione i have no use for a servant who forgets what is due to her master and to her reputation 
 
 winky was crying so hard that her sobs echoed around the clearing there was a very nasty silence which was ended by mr weasley who said quietly well i think take my lot back to the tent if got any objections amos that told us all it can if harry could have it back please 
 
 mr diggory handed harry his wand and harry pocketed it 
 
 come on you three mr weasley said quietly but hermione seem to want to move her eyes were still upon the sobbing elf hermione mr weasley said more urgently she turned and followed harry and ron out of the clearing and off through the trees 
 
 going to happen to winky said hermione the moment they had left the clearing 
 
 i know said mr weasley 
 
 the way they were treating her said hermione furiously mr diggory calling her elf all the timeand mr crouch he knows she do it and still going to sack her he care how frightened been or how upset she was it was like she even human 
 
 well not said ron 
 
 hermione rounded on him 
 
 that mean she got feelings ron disgusting the way 
 
 hermione i agree with you said mr weasley quickly beckoning her on but now is not the time to discuss elf rights i want to get back to the tent as fast as we can what happened to the others 
 
 we lost them in the dark said ron dad why was everyone so uptight about that skull thing 
 
 explain everything back at the tent said mr weasley tensely 
 
 but when they reached the edge of the wood their progress was impeded a large crowd of witches and wizards was congregated there and when they saw mr weasley coming toward them many of them surged forward 
 
 going on in there 
 
 who conjured it 
 
 arthur not him 
 
 of course not him said mr weasley impatiently we know who it was it looks like they disapparated now excuse me please i want to get to bed 
 
 he led harry ron and hermione through the crowd and back into the campsite all was quiet now there was no sign of the masked wizards though several ruined tents were still smoking 
 
 head was poking out of the boys tent 
 
 dad going on he called through the dark fred george and ginny got back okay but the others 
 
 got them here said mr weasley bending down and entering the tent harry ron and hermione entered after him 
 
 bill was sitting at the small kitchen table holding a bedsheet to his arm which was bleeding profusely charlie had a large rip in his shirt and percy was sporting a bloody nose fred george and ginny looked unhurt though shaken 
 
 did you get them dad said bill sharply the person who conjured the mark 
 
 no said mr weasley we found barry elf holding wand but none the wiser about who actually conured the mark 
 
 what said bill charlie and percy together 
 
 wand said fred 
 
 mr elf said percy sounding thunderstruck 
 
 with some assistance from harry ron and hermione mr weasley explained what had happened in the woods when they had finished their story percy swelled indignantly 
 
 well mr crouch is quite right to get rid of an elf like that he said running away when expressly told her not toembarrassing him in front of the whole ministryhow would that have looked if been brought up in front of the department for the regulation and control 
 
 she do anything she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time hermione snapped at percy who looked very taken aback hermione had always got on fairly well with percy better indeed than any of the others 
 
 hermione a wizard in mr position afford a going to run amok with a wand said percy pompously recovering himself 
 
 she run amok shouted hermione she just picked it up off the ground 
 
 look can someone just explain what that skull thing was said ron impatiently it hurting it such a big deal 
 
 i told you symbol ron said hermione before anyone else could answer i read about it in the rise and fall of the dark arts 
 
 and it been seen for thirteen years said mr weasley quietly of course people panickedit was almost like seeing back again 
 
 i get it said ron frowning i still only a shape in the sky 
 
 ron and his followers sent the dark mark into the air whenever they killed said mr weasley the terror it inspiredyou have no idea too young just picture coming home and finding the dark mark hovering over your house and knowing what about to find inside mr weasley winced worst fearthe very worst 
 
 there was silence for a moment then bill removing the sheet from his arm to check on his cut said well it help us tonight whoever conjured it it scared the death eaters away the moment they saw it they all disapparated before got near enough to unmask any of them we caught the robertses before they hit the ground though having their memories modified right now 
 
 death eaters said harry what are death eaters 
 
 what supporters called themselves said bill i think we saw left of them tonight the ones who managed to keep themselves out of azkaban anyway 
 
 we prove it was them bill said mr weasley though it probably was he added hopelessly 
 
 yeah i bet it was said ron suddenly dad we met draco malfoy in the woods and he as good as told us his dad was one of those nutters in masks and we all know the malfoys were right in with 
 
 but what were supporters harry began everybody flinched like most of the wizarding world the weasleys always avoided saying name sorry said harry quickly what were supporters up to levitating muggles i mean what was the point 
 
 the point said mr weasley with a hollow laugh harry their idea of fun half the muggle killings back when was in power were done for fun i suppose they had a few drinks tonight and resist reminding us all that lots of them are still at large a nice little reunion for them he finished disgustedly 
 
 but if they were the death eaters why did they disapparate when they saw the dark mark said ron have been pleased to see it they 
 
 use your brains ron said bill if they really were death eaters they worked very hard to keep out of azkaban when lost power and told all sorts of lies about him forcing them to kill and torture people i bet be even more frightened than the rest of us to see him come back they denied ever been involved with him when he lost his powers and went back to their daily reckon be with them do you 
 
 sowhoever conjured the dark mark said hermione slowly were they doing it to show support for the death eaters or to scare them away 
 
 your guess is as good as ours hermione said mr weasley but tell you thisit was only the death eaters who ever knew how to conjure it be very surprised if the person who did it been a death eater once even if not very late and if your mother hears happened be worried sick get a few more hours sleep and then try and get an early portkey out of here 
 
 harry got back into his bunk with his head buzzing he knew he ought to feel exhausted it was nearly three in the morning but he felt and worried 
 
 three days ago it felt like much longer but it had only been three days he had awoken with his scar burning and tonight for the first time in thirteen years lord mark had appeared in the sky what did these things mean 
 
 he thought of the letter he had written to sirius before leaving privet drive would sirius have gotten it yet when would he reply harry lay looking up at the canvas but no flying fantasies came to him now to ease him to sleep and it was a long time after snores filled the tent that harry finally dozed off 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire 
 

lionfish nov chapter nine the woes of mrs weasleycontents prev chapter next chapter 
 abrupt departure took harry completely by surprise he remained sitting where he was in the chained chair struggling with his feelings of shock and relief the wizengamot were all getting to their feet talking gathering up their papers and packing them away harry stood up nobody seemed to be paying him the slightest bit of attention except the toadlike witch on right who was now gazing down at him instead of at dumbledore ignoring her he tried to catch eye or madam wanting to ask whether he was free to go but fudge seemed quite determined not to notice harry and madam bones was busy with her briefcase so he took a lew tentative steps towards the exit and when nobody called him back broke into a very fast walk 
 
 he took the last lew steps at a run wrenched open the door and almost collided with mr weasley who was standing right outside looking pale and apprehensive 
 
 dumbledore say 
 
 cleared harry said pulling the door closed behind him of all charges 
 
 beaming mr weasley seized harry by the shoulders 
 
 harry wonderful well of course they have found you guilty not on the evidence but even so i pretend i 
 
 but mr weasley broke off because the courtroom door had ust opened again the wizengamot were filing out 
 
 beard exclaimed mr weasley wonderingly pulling harry aside to let them all pass you were tried by the full court 
 
 i think so said harry quietly 
 
 one or two of the wizards nodded to harry as they passed and a few including madam bones said morning arthur to mr weasley but most averted their eyes cornelius fudge and the toadlike witch were almost the last to leave the dungeon fudge acted as though mr weasley and harry were part of the wall but again the witch looked almost appraisingly at harry as she passed last of all to pass was percy like fudge he completely ignored his father and harry he marched past clutching a large roll of parchment and a handful of spare quills his back rigid and his nose in the air the lines around mr mouth tightened slightly but other than this he gave no sign that he had seen his third son 
 
 going to take you straight back so you can tell the others the good news he said beckoning harry forwards as heels disappeared up the steps to level nine drop you off on the way to that toilet in bethnal green come on 
 
 so what will you have to do about the toilet harry asked grinning everything suddenly seemed five times funnier than usual it was starting to sink in he was cleared he was going back to hogwarts 
 
 oh a simple enough said mr weasley as they mounted the stairs but not so much having to repair the damage more the attitude behind the vandalism harry might strike some wizards as funny but an expression of something much deeper and nastier and i for one 
 
 mr weasley broke off in they had just reached the corridor and cornelius fudge was standing a few feet away from them talking quietly to a tall man with sleek blond hair and a pointed pale face 
 
 the second man turned at the sound of their footsteps he too broke off in his cold grey eyes narrowed and fixed upon face 
 
 well well well patronus potter said lucius malfoy coolly 
 
 harry felt winded as though he had just walked into something solid he had last seen those cold grey eyes through slits in a death hood and last heard that voice jeering in a dark graveyard while lord voldemort tortured him harry could not believe that lucius malfoy dared look him in the face he could not believe that he was here in the ministry of magic or that cornelius fudge was talking to him when harry had told fudge mere weeks ago that malfoy was a death eater 
 
 the minister was just telling me about your lucky escape potter drawled mr malfoy quite astonishing the way you continue to wriggle out of very tight holes snakelike in fact 
 
 mr weasley gripped shoulder in warning 
 
 yeah said harry yeah good at escaping 
 
 lucius malfoy raised his eyes to mr face 
 
 and arthur weasley too what are you doing here arthur 
 
 i work here said mr weasley curtly 
 
 not here surely said mr malfoy raising his eyebrows and glancing towards the door over mr shoulder i thought you were up on the second floor you do something that involves sneaking muggle artefacts home and bewitching them 
 
 no mr weasley snapped his fingers now biting into shoulder 
 
 what areyou doing here anyway harry asked lucius malfoy 
 
 i think private matters between myself and the minister are any concern of yours potter said malfoy smoothing the front of his robes harry distinctly heard the gentle clinking of what sounded like a full pocket of gold really just because you are favourite boy you must not expect the same indulgence from the rest of us shall we go up to your office then minister 
 
 certainly said fudge turning his back on harry and mr weasley this way lucius 
 
 they strode off together talking in low voices mr weasley did not let go of shoulder until they had disappeared into the lift 
 
 why he waiting outside office if got business to do together harry burst out furiously what was he doing down here 
 
 trying to sneak down to the courtroom if you ask me said mr weasley looking extremely agitated and glancing over his shoulder as though making sure they could not be overheard trying to find out whether been expelled or not leave a note for dumbledore when i drop you off he ought to know been talking to fudge again 
 
 what private business have they got together anyway 
 
 gold i expect said mr weasley angrily been giving generously to all sorts of things for years gets him in with the right people then he can ask favours delay laws he want passed oh very lucius malfoy 
 
 the lift arrived it was empty except for a flock of memos that flapped around mr head as he pressed the button for the atrium and the doors clanged shut he waved them away irritably 
 
 mr weasley said harry slowly if fudge is meeting death eaters like malfoy if seeing them alone how do we know they put the imperius curse on him 
 
 think it occurred to us harry said mr weasley quietly but dumbledore thinks fudge is acting of his own accord at the momentwhich as dumbledore says is not a lot of comfort best not talk about it any more just now harry 
 
 the doors slid open and they stepped out into the now atrium eric the watchwizard was hidden behind his daily prophet again they had walked straight past the golden fountain before harry remembered 
 
 wait he told mr weasley and pulling his moneybag from his pocket he turned back to the fountain 
 
 he looked up into the handsome face but up close harry thought he looked rather weak and foolish the witch was wearing a vapid smile like a beauty contestant and from what harry knew of goblins and centaurs they were most unlikely to be caught staring so soppily at humans of any description only the attitude of creeping servility looked convincing with a grin at the thought of what hermione would say if she could see the statue of the elf harry turned his moneybag and emptied not just ten galleons but the whole contents into the pool at the statues feet 
 
 i knew it yelled ron punching the air you always get away with stuff 
 
 they were bound to clear you said hermione who had looked positively faint with anxiety when harry had entered the kitchen and was now holding a shaking hand over her eyes there was no case against you none at all 
 
 everyone seems quite relieved though considering you all knew get off said harry smiling 
 
 mrs weasley was wiping her face on her apron and fred george and ginny were doing a kind of war dance to a chant that went he got off he got off he got off 
 
 enough settle down shouted mr weasley though he too was smiling listen sirius lucius malfoy was at the ministry 
 
 what said sirius sharply 
 
 he got off he got off he got off 
 
 be quiet you three yes we saw him talking to fudge on level nine then they went up to office together dumbledore ought to know 
 
 absolutely said sirius tell him worry 
 
 well better get going a vomiting toilet waiting for me in bethnal green molly be late covering for tonks but kingsley might be dropping in for dinner 
 
 he got off he got off he got off 
 
 enoughfredgeorgeginny said mrs weasley as mr weasley left the kitchen harry dear come and sit down have some lunch you hardly ate breakfast 
 
 ron and hermione sat themselves down opposite him looking happier than they had done since he had first arrived at grimmauld place and feeling of giddy relief which had been somewhat dented by his encounter with lucius malfoy swelled again the gloomy house seemed warmer and more welcoming all of a sudden even kreacher looked less ugly as he poked his snoutlike nose into the kitchen to investigate the source of all the noise 
 
 course once dumbledore turned up on your side there was no way they were going to convict you said ron happily now dishing great mounds of mashed potato on to plates 
 
 yeah he swung it for me said harry he felt it would sound highly ungrateful not to mention childish to say i wish talked to me though or even looked at me 
 
 and as he thought this the scar on his forehead burned so badly that he clapped his hand to it 
 
 up said hermione looking alarmed 
 
 scar harry mumbled but nothing it happens all the time now 
 
 none of the others had noticed a thing all of them were now helping themselves to food while gloating over narrow escape fred george and ginny were still singing hermione looked rather anxious but before she could say anything ron had said happily i bet dumbledore turns up this evening to celebrate with us you know 
 
 i think be able to ron said mrs weasley setting a huge plate of roast chicken down in front of harry really very busy at the moment 
 
 he got off he got off he got off 
 
 shut up roared mrs weasley 
 
 over the next few days harry could not help noticing that there was one person within number twelve grimmauld place who did not seem wholly overjoyed that he would be returning to hogwarts sirius had put up a very good show of happiness on first hearing the news wringing hand and beaming just like the rest of them soon however he was moodier and surlier than before talking less to everybody even harry and spending increasing amounts of time shut up in his room with buckbeak 
 
 you go feeling guilty said hermione sternly after harry had confided some of his feelings to her and ron while they scrubbed out a mouldy cupboard on the third floor a few days later you belong at hogwarts and sirius knows it personally i think being selfish 
 
 a bit harsh hermione said ron frowning as he attempted to prise off a bit of mould that had attached itself firmly to his finger you want to be stuck inside this house without any company 
 
 have company said hermione headquarters to the order of the phoenix it he just got his hopes up that harry would be coming to live here with him 
 
 i think true said harry wringing out his cloth he give me a straight answer when i asked him if i could 
 
 he just want to get his own hopes up even more said hermione wisely and he probably felt a bit guilty himself because i think a part of him was really hoping be expelled then both be outcasts together 
 
 come off it said harry and ron together but hermione merely shrugged 
 
 suit yourselves but i sometimes think right and sirius gets confused about whether you or your father harry 
 
 so you think touched in the head said harry heatedly 
 
 no i just think been very lonely for a long time said hermione simply 
 
 at this point mrs weasley entered the bedroom behind them 
 
 still not finished she said poking her head into the cupboard 
 
 i thought you might be here to tell us to have a break said ron bitterly know how much mould got rid of since we arrived here 
 
 you were so keen to help the order said mrs weasley you can do your bit by making headquarters fit to live in 
 
 i feel like a grumbled ron 
 
 well now you understand what dreadful lives they lead perhaps be a bit more active in said hermione hopefully as mrs weasley left them to it you know maybe it be a bad idea to show people exactly how horrible it is to clean all the timewe could do a sponsored scrub of gryffindor common room all proceeds to it would raise awareness as well as funds 
 
 sponsor you to shut up about spew ron muttered irritably but only so harry could hear him 
 
 harry found himself daydreaming about hogwarts more and more as the end of the holidays approached he could not wait to see hagrid again to play quidditch even to stroll across the vegetable patches to the herbology greenhouses it would be a treat just to leave this dusty musty house where half of the cupboards were still bolted shut and kreacher wheezed insults out of the shadows as you passed though harry was careful not to say any of this within earshot of sirius 
 
 the fact was that living at the headquarters of the movement was not nearly as interesting or exciting as harry would have expected before experienced it though members of the order of the phoenix came and went regularly sometimes staying for meals sometimes only for a few minutes of whispered conversation mrs weasley made sure that harry and the others were kept well out of earshot whether extendable or normal and nobody not even sirius seemed to feel that harry needed to know anything more than he had heard on the night of his arrival 
 
 on the very last day of the holidays harry was sweeping up owl droppings from the top of the wardrobe when ron entered their bedroom carrying a couple of envelopes 
 
 booklists have arrived he said throwing one of the envelopes up to harry who was standing on a chair about time i thought forgotten they usually come much earlier than this 
 
 harry swept the last of the droppings into a rubbish bag and threw the bag over head into the wastepaper basket in the corner which swallowed it and belched loudly he then opened his letter it contained two pieces of parchment one the usual reminder that term started on the first of september the other telling him which books he would need for the coming year 
 
 only two new ones he said reading the list the standard book of spells grade by miranda goshawk and defensive magical theory by wilbert slinkhard 
 
 crack 
 
 fred and george apparated right beside harry he was so used to them doing this by now that he even fall off his chair 
 
 we were just wondering who assigned the slinkhard book said fred conversationally 
 
 because it means found a new defence against the dark arts teacher said george 
 
 and about time too said fred 
 
 what mean harry asked jumping down beside them 
 
 well we overheard mum and dad talking on the extendable ears a few weeks back fred told harry and from what they were saying dumbledore was having real trouble finding anyone to do the job this year 
 
 not surprising is it when you look at happened to the last four said george 
 
 one sacked one dead memory removed and one locked in a trunk for nine months said harry counting them off on his fingers yeah i see what you mean 
 
 up with you ron asked fred 
 
 ron did not answer harry looked round ron was standing very still with his mouth slightly open gaping at his letter from hogwarts 
 
 the matter said fred impatiently moving around ron to look over his shoulder at the parchment 
 
 mouth fell open too 
 
 prefect he said staring incredulously at the letter prefect 
 
 george leapt forward seized the envelope in other hand and turned it harry saw something scarlet and gold fall into palm 
 
 no way said george in a hushed voice 
 
 been a mistake said fred snatching the letter out of grasp and holding it up to the light as though checking for a watermark no one in their right mind would make ron a prefect 
 
 the twins heads turned in unison and both of them stared at harry 
 
 we thought you were a cert said fred in a tone that suggested harry had tricked them in some way 
 
 we thought dumbledore was bound to pick you said george indignantly 
 
 winning the triwizard and everything said fred 
 
 i suppose all the mad stuff counted against him said george to fred 
 
 yeah said fred slowly yeah caused too much trouble mate well at least one of got their priorities right 
 
 he strode over to harry and clapped him on the back while giving ron a scathing look 
 
 prefect ickle ronnie the prefect 
 
 oh going to be revolting groaned george thrusting the prefect badge back at ron as though it might contaminate him 
 
 ron who still had not said a word took the badge stared at it for a moment then held it out to harry as though asking mutely for confirmation that it was genuine harry took it a large p was superimposed on the gryffindor lion he had seen a badge just like this on chest on his very first day at hogwarts 
 
 the door banged open hermione came tearing into the room her cheeks flushed and her hair flying there was an envelope in her hand 
 
 did youdid you get 
 
 she spotted the badge in hand and let out a shriek 
 
 i knew it she said excitedly brandishing her letter me too harry me too 
 
 no said harry quickly pushing the badge back into hand ron not me 
 
 itwhat 
 
 prefect not me harry said 
 
 ron said hermione her jaw dropping but are you sure i mean 
 
 she turned red as ron looked round at her with a defiant expression on his lace 
 
 my name on the letter he said 
 
 i said hermione looking thoroughly bewildered i well wow well done ron really 
 
 unexpected said george nodding 
 
 no said hermione blushing harder than ever no not done loads of really 
 
 the door behind her opened a little wider and mrs weasley backed into the room carrying a pile of freshly laundered robes 
 
 ginny said the booklists had come at last she said glancing around at all the envelopes as she made her way over to the bed and started sorting the robes into two piles if you give them to me take them over to diagon alley this afternoon and get your books while packing ron have to get you more pyjamas these are at least six inches too short i believe how fast growing what colour would you like 
 
 get him red and gold to match his badge said george smirking 
 
 match his what said mrs weasley absently rolling up a pair of maroon socks and placing them on pile 
 
 his badge said fred with the air of getting the worst over quickly his lovely shiny new badge 
 
 words took a moment to penetrate mrs preoccupation with pyjamas 
 
 his but ron not 
 
 ron held up his badge 
 
 mrs weasley let out a shriek just like 
 
 i believe it i believe it oh ron how wonderful a prefect everyone in the family 
 
 what are fred and i neighbours said george indignantly as his mother pushed him aside and flung her arms around her youngest son 
 
 wait until your father hears ron so proud of you what wonderful news you could end up head boy just like bill and percy the first step oh what a thing to happen in the middle of all this worry just thrilled oh ronnie 
 
 fred and george were both making loud retching noises behind her back but mrs weasley did not notice arms tight around neck she was kissing him all over his face which had turned a brighter scarlet than his badge 
 
 mum mum get a grip he muttered trying to push her away 
 
 she let go of him and said breathlessly well what will it be we gave percy an owl but already got one of course 
 
 do you mean said ron looking as though he did not dare believe his ears 
 
 got to have a reward for this said mrs weasley fondly how about a nice new set of dress robes 
 
 already bought him some said fred sourly who looked as though he sincerely regretted this generosity 
 
 or a new cauldron old rusting through or a new rat you always liked scabbers 
 
 mum said ron hopefully can i have a new broom 
 
 mrs face fell slightly broomsticks were expensive 
 
 not a really good one ron hastened to add justjust a new one for a change 
 
 mrs weasley hesitated then smiled 
 
 of course you can well better get going if got a broom to buy too see you all later little ronnie a prefect and forget to pack your trunks a prefect oh all of a dither 
 
 she gave ron yet another kiss on the cheek sniffed loudly and bustled from the room 
 
 fred and george exchanged looks 
 
 you mind if we kiss you do you ron said fred in a falsely anxious voice 
 
 we could curtsey if you like said george 
 
 oh shut up said ron scowling at them 
 
 or what said fred an evil grin spreading across his face going to put us in detention 
 
 love to see him try sniggered george 
 
 he could if you watch out said hermione angrily 
 
 fred and george burst out laughing and ron muttered drop it hermione 
 
 going to have to watch our step george said fred pretending to tremble with these two on our case 
 
 yeah it looks like our days are finally over said george shaking his head 
 
 and with another loud crack the twins disapparated 
 
 those two said hermione furiously staring up at the ceiling through which they could now hear fred and george roaring with laughter in the room upstairs pay any attention to them ron only jealous 
 
 i think they are said ron doubtfully also looking up at the ceiling always said only prats become prefects still he added on a happier note never had new brooms i wish i could go with mum and choose never be able to afford a nimbus but the new cleansweep out be great yeah i think go and tell her i like the cleansweep just so she knows 
 
 he dashed from the room leaving harry and hermione alone 
 
 for some reason harry found he did not want to look at hermione he turned to his bed picked up the pile of clean robes mrs weasley had laid on it and crossed the room to his trunk 
 
 harry said hermione tentatively 
 
 well done hermione said harry so heartily it did not sound like his voice at all and still not looking at her brilliant prefect great 
 
 thanks said hermione ermharrycould i borrow hedwig so i can tell mum and dad be really pleasedi mean prefect is something they can understand 
 
 yeah no problem said harry still in the horrible hearty voice that did not belong to him take her 
 
 he leaned over his trunk laid the robes on the bottom of it and pretended to be rummaging for something while hermione crossed to the wardrobe and called hedwig down a few moments passed harry heard the door close but remained bent double listening the only sounds he could hear were the blank picture on the wall sniggering again and the wastepaper basket in the corner coughing up the owl droppings 
 
 he straightened up and looked behind him hermione had left and hedwig had gone harry hurried across the room closed the door then returned slowly to his bed and sank on to it gazing unseeingly at the foot of the wardrobe 
 
 he had forgotten completely about prefects being chosen in the fifth year he had been too anxious about the possibility of being expelled to spare a thought for the fact that badges must be winging their way towards certain people but if he had remembered if he had thought about it what would he have expected 
 
 not this said a small and truthful voice inside his head 
 
 harry screwed up his face and buried it in his hands he could not lie to himself if he had known the prefect badge was on its way he would have expected it to come to him not ron did this make him as arrogant as draco malfoy did he think himself superior to everyone else did he really believe he was better than ron 
 
 no said the small voice defiantly 
 
 was that true harry wondered anxiously probing his own feelings 
 
 better at quidditch said the voice but not better at anything else 
 
 that was definitely true harry thought he was no better than ron in lessons but what about outside lessons what about those adventures he ron and hermione had had together since starting at hogwarts often risking much worse than expulsion 
 
 well ron and hermione were with me most of the time said the voice in head 
 
 not all the time though harry argued with himself they fight quirrell with me they take on riddle and the basilisk they get rid of all those dementors the night sirius escaped they in that graveyard with me the night voldemort returned 
 
 and the same feeling of that had overwhelmed him on the night he had arrived rose again definitely done more harry thought indignantly done more than either of them 
 
 but maybe said the small voice fairly maybe dumbledore choose prefects because got themselves into a load of dangerous situations maybe he chooses them for other reasons ron must have something you 
 
 harry opened his eyes and stared through his fingers at the clawed feet remembering what fred had said 
 
 no one in their right mind would make ron a prefect 
 
 harry gave a small snort of laughter a second later he felt sickened with himself 
 
 ron had not asked dumbledore to give him the prefect badge this was not fault was he harry best friend in the world going to sulk because he have a badge laugh with the twins behind back ruin this for ron when for the first time he had beaten harry at something 
 
 at this point harry heard footsteps on the stairs again he stood up straightened his glasses and hitched a grin on to his face as ron bounded back through the door 
 
 just caught her he said happily she says get the cleansweep if she can 
 
 cool harry said and he was relieved to hear that his voice had stopped sounding hearty listenronwell done mate 
 
 the smile faded off face 
 
 i never thought it would be me he said shaking his head i thought it would be you 
 
 nah caused too much trouble harry said echoing fred 
 
 yeah said ron yeah i suppose well better get our trunks packed we 
 
 it was odd how widely their possessions seemed to have scattered themselves since they had arrived it took them most of the afternoon to retrieve their books and belongings from all over the house and stow them back inside their school trunks marry noticed that ron kept moving his badge around first placing it on his bedside table then putting it into his jeans pocket then taking it out and lying it on his folded robes as though to see the effect of the red on the black only when fred and george dropped in and offered to attach it to his forehead with a permanent sticking charm did he wrap it tenderly in his maroon socks and lock it in his trunk 
 
 mrs weasley returned from diagon alley around six laden with books and carrying a long package wrapped in thick brown paper that ron took from her with a moan of longing 
 
 never mind unwrapping it now people are arriving for dinner i want you all downstairs she said but the moment she was out of sight ron ripped off the paper in a frenzy and examined every inch of his new broom an ecstatic expression on his face 
 
 down in the basement mrs weasley had hung a scarlet banner over the heavily laden dinner table which read congratulations ron and hermionenew prefects she looked in a better mood than harry had seen her all holiday 
 
 i thought have a little party not a dinner she told harry ron hermione fred george and ginny as they entered the room your father and bill are on their way ron sent them both owls and thrilled she added beaming 
 
 fred rolled his eyes 
 
 sirius lupin tonks and kingsley shacklebolt were already there and moody stumped in shortly after harry had got himself a butterbeer 
 
 oh alastor i am glad here said mrs weasley brightly as shrugged off his travelling cloak been wanting to ask you for agescould you have a look in the writing desk in the drawing room and tell us inside it we wanted to open it just in case something really nasty 
 
 no problem molly 
 
 eye swivelled upwards and stared fixedly through the ceiling of the kitchen 
 
 drawing room he growled as the pupil contracted desk in the corner yeah i see it yeah a boggart want me to go up and get rid of it molly 
 
 no no do it myself later beamed mrs weasley you have your drink having a little bit of a celebration actually she gestured at the scarlet banner fourth prefect in the family she said fondly ruffling hair 
 
 prefect eh growled moody his normal eye on ron and his magical eye swivelling around to gaze into the side of his head harry had the very uncomfortable feeling it was looking at him and moved away towards sirius and lupin 
 
 well congratulations said moody still glaring at ron with his normal eye authority figures always attract trouble but i suppose dumbledore thinks you can withstand most major jinxes or he have appointed you 
 
 ron looked rather startled at this view of the matter but was saved the trouble of responding by the arrival of his father and eldest brother mrs weasley was in such a good mood she did not even complain that they had brought mundungus with them he was wearing a long overcoat that seemed oddly lumpy in unlikely places and declined the offer to remove it and put it with travelling cloak 
 
 well i think a toast is in order said mr weasley when everyone had a drink he raised his goblet to ron and hermione the new gryffindor prefects 
 
 ron and hermione beamed as everyone drank to them and then applauded 
 
 i was never a prefect myself said tonks brightly from behind harry as everybody moved towards the table to help themselves to food her hair was tomato red and today she looked like older sister my head of house said i lacked certain necessary qualities 
 
 like what said ginny who was choosing a baked potato 
 
 like the ability to behave myself said tonks 
 
 ginny laughed hermione looked as though she did not know whether to smile or not and compromised by taking an extra large gulp of butterbeer and choking on it 
 
 what about you sirius ginny asked thumping hermione on the back 
 
 sirius who was right beside harry let out his usual laugh 
 
 no one would have made me a prefect i spent too much time in detention with james lupin was the good boy he got the badge 
 
 i think dumbledore might have hoped i would be able to exercise some control over my best friends said lupin i need scarcely say that i failed dismally 
 
 mood suddenly lifted his father had not been a prefect either all at once the party seemed much more enjoyable he loaded up his plate feeling doubly fond of everyone in the room 
 
 ron was rhapsodising about his new broom to anybody who would listen 
 
 nought to seventy in ten seconds not bad is it when you think the comet two only nought to sixty and with a decent tailwind according to which broomstick 
 
 hermione was talking very earnestly to lupin about her view of elf rights 
 
 i mean the same kind of nonsense as werewolf segregation it it all stems from this horrible thing wizards have of thinking superior to other creatures 
 
 mrs weasley and bill were having their usual argument about hair 
 
 getting really out of hand and so it would look much better shorter it harry 
 
 ohi dunno said harry slightly alarmed at being asked his opinion he slid away from them in the direction of fred and george who were huddled in a corner with mundungus 
 
 mundungus stopped talking when he saw harry but fred winked and beckoned harry closer 
 
 ok he told mundungus we can trust harry our financial backer 
 
 look what got us said george holding out his hand to harry it was full of what looked like shrivelled black pods a faint rattling noise was coming from them even though they were completely stationary 
 
 venomous tentacula seeds said george we need them for the skiving snackboxes but a class c substance so been having a bit of trouble getting hold of them 
 
 ten galleons the lot then dung said fred 
 
 wiv all the trouble i went to to get em said mundungus his saggy bloodshot eyes stretching even wider sorry lads but not taking a knut under twenty 
 
 dung likes his little joke fred said to harry 
 
 yeah his best one so far has been six sickles for a bag of knarl quills said george 
 
 be careful harry warned them quietly 
 
 what said fred busy cooing over prefect ron okay 
 
 but moody could have his eye on you harry pointed out 
 
 mundungus looked nervously over his shoulder 
 
 good point that he grunted all right lads ten it is if take em quick 
 
 cheers harry said fred delightedly when mundungus had emptied his pockets into the twins outstretched hands and scuttled off towards the food better get these upstairs 
 
 harry watched them go feeling slightly uneasy it had just occurred to him that mr and mrs weasley would want to know how fred and george were financing their joke shop business when as was inevitable they finally found out about it giving the twins his triwizard winnings had seemed a simple thing to do at the time but what if it led to another family row and a estrangement would mrs weasley still feel that harry was as good as her son if she found out he had made it possible for fred and george to start a career she thought quite unsuitable 
 
 standing where the twins had left him with nothing but a guilty weight in the pit of his stomach for company harry caught the sound of his own name kingsley deep voice was audible even over the surrounding chatter 
 
 why dumbledore make potter a prefect said kingsley 
 
 have had his reasons replied lupin 
 
 but it shown confidence in him what done persisted kingsley specially with the daily prophet having a go at him every few days 
 
 harry did not look round he did not want lupin or kingsley to know he had heard though not remotely hungry he followed mundungus back towards the table his pleasure in the party had evaporated as quickly as it had come he wished he were upstairs in bed 
 
 moody was sniffing at a chicken leg with what remained of his nose evidently he could not detect any trace of poison because he then tore a strip off it with his teeth 
 
 the made of spanish oak with varnish and vibration control ron was saying to tonks 
 
 mrs weasley yawned widely 
 
 well i think sort out that boggart before i turn in arthur i want this lot up too late all right night harry dear 
 
 she left the kitchen harry set down his plate and wondered whether he could follow her without attracting attention 
 
 you all right potter grunted moody 
 
 yeah fine lied harry 
 
 moody took a swig from his hipflask his eye staring sideways at harry 
 
 come here got something that might interest you he said 
 
 from an inner pocket of his robes moody pulled a very tattered old wizarding photograph 
 
 original order of the phoenix growled moody found it last night when i was looking for my spare invisibility cloak seeing as podmore had the manners to return my best one thought people might like to see it 
 
 harry took the photograph a small crowd of people some waving at him others lifting their glasses looked back up at him 
 
 me said moody unnecessarily pointing at himself the moody in the picture was unmistakeable though his hair was slightly less grey and his nose was intact and dumbledore beside me dedalus diggle on the other side marlene mckinnon she was killed two weeks after this was taken they got her whole family frank and alice longbottom 
 
 stomach already uncomfortable clenched as he looked at alice longbottom he knew her round friendly face very well even though he had never met her because she was the image of her son neville 
 
 poor devils growled moody better dead than what happened to them and emmeline vance met her and that lupin obviously benjy fenwick he copped it too we only ever found bits of him shift aside there he added poking the picture and the little photographic people edged sideways so that those who were partially obscured could move to the front 
 
 edgar bones brother of amelia bones they got him and his family too he was a great wizard sturgis podmore blimey he looks young caradoc dearborn vanished six months after this we never found his body hagrid of course looks exactly the same as ever elphias doge met him forgotten he used to wear that stupid hat gideon prewett it took five death eaters to kill him and his brother fabian they fought like heroes budge along budge along 
 
 the little people in the photograph jostled among themselves and those hidden right at the back appeared at the forefront of the picture 
 
 brother aberforth only time i ever met him strange bloke dorcas meadowes voldemort killed her personally sirius when he still had short hair and there you go thought that would interest you 
 
 heart turned over his mother and father were beaming up at him sitting on either side of a small man whom harry recognised at once as wormtail the one who had betrayed his parents whereabouts to voldemort and so helped to bring about their deaths 
 
 eh said moody 
 
 harry looked up into moody s heavily scarred and pitted face evidently moody was under the impression he had just given harry a bit of a treat 
 
 yeah said harry once again attempting to grin er listen just remembered i packed my 
 
 he was spared the trouble of inventing an object he had not packed sirius had just said that got there and moody had turned towards him harry crossed the kitchen slipped through the door and up the stairs before anyone could call him back 
 
 he did not know why it had been such a shock he had seen pictures of his parents before after all and he had met wormtail but to have them sprung on him like that when he was least expecting it no one would like that he thought angrily 
 
 and then to see them surrounded by all those other happy faces benjy fenwick who had been found in bits and gideon prewett who had died like a hero and the longbottoms who had been tortured into madness all waving happily out of the photograph forever more not knowing that they were doomed well moody might find that interesting he harry found it disturbing 
 
 harry tiptoed up the stairs in the hall past the stuffed glad to be on his own again but as he approached the first landing he heard noises someone was sobbing in the drawing room 
 
 hello harry said 
 
 there was no answer but the sobbing continued he climbed the remaining stairs two at a time walked across the landing and opened the door 
 
 someone was cowering against the dark wall her wand in her hand her whole body shaking with sobs sprawled on the dusty old carpet in a patch of moonlight clearly dead was ron 
 
 all the air seemed to vanish from lungs he felt as though he were falling through the floor his brain turned icy coldron dead no it be 
 
 but wait a moment it be ron was downstairs 
 
 mrs weasley harry croaked 
 
 mrs weasley sobbed pointing her shaking wand at body 
 
 crack 
 
 body turned into on his back his eyes wide open and empty mrs weasley sobbed harder than ever 
 
 she sobbed again 
 
 crack 
 
 mr body replaced his glasses askew a trickle of blood running down his face 
 
 no mrs weasley moaned no riddikulus riddikulus riddikulus 
 
 crack dead twins crack dead percy crack dead harry 
 
 mrs weasley just get out of here shouted harry staring down at his own dead body on the floor let someone else 
 
 going on 
 
 lupin had come running into the room closely followed by sirius with moody stumping along behind them lupin looked from mrs weasley to the dead harry on the floor and seemed to understand in an instant pulling out his own wand he said very firmly and clearly riddikulus 
 
 body vanished a silvery orb hung in the air over the spot where it had lain lupin waved his wand once more and the orb vanished in a puff of smoke 
 
 ohohoh gulped mrs weasley and she broke into a storm of crying her face in her hands 
 
 molly said lupin bleakly walking over to her molly 
 
 next second she was sobbing her heart out on shoulder 
 
 molly it was just a boggart he said soothingly patting her on the head just a stupid boggart 
 
 i see them all the time mrs weasley moaned into his shoulder all the i about it 
 
 sirius was staring at the patch of carpet where the boggart pretending to be body had lain moody was looking at harry who avoided his gaze he had a funny feeling magical eye had followed him all the way out of the kitchen 
 
 tell arthur mrs weasley was gulping now mopping her eyes frantically with her cuffs i want him to know being silly 
 
 lupin handed her a handkerchief and she blew her nose 
 
 harry so sorry what must you think of me she said shakily not even able to get rid of a boggart 
 
 be stupid said harry trying to smile 
 
 just worried she said tears spilling out of her eyes again half the in the order a miracle if we all come through this and not talking to us what if something happens and never it up with him and going to happen if arthur and i get killed to look after ron and ginny 
 
 molly enough said lupin firmly this like last time the order are better prepared got a head start we know what up to 
 
 mrs weasley gave a little squeak of fright at the sound of the name 
 
 oh molly come on about time you got used to hearing his namelook i promise no going to get hurt nobody can promise that but much better off than we were last time you in the order then you understand last time we were outnumbered twenty to one by the death eaters and they were picking us off one by one 
 
 harry thought of the photograph again of his parents beaming faces he knew moody was still watching him 
 
 worry about percy said sirius abruptly come round only a matter of time before voldemort moves into the open once he does the whole going to be begging us to forgive them and not sure be accepting their apology he added bitterly 
 
 and as for going to look after ron and ginny if you and arthur died said lupin smiling slightly what do you think do let them starve 
 
 mrs weasley smiled tremulously 
 
 being silly she muttered again mopping her eyes 
 
 but harry closing his bedroom door behind him some ten minutes later could not think mrs weasley silly he could still see his parents beaming up at him from the battered old photograph unaware that their lives like so many of those around them were drawing to a close the image of the boggart posing as the corpse of each member of mrs family in turn kept flashing before his eyes 
 
 without warning the scar on his forehead seared with pain again and his stomach churned horribly 
 
 cut it out he said firmly rubbing the scar as the pain receded 
 
 first sign of madness talking to your own head said a sly voice from the empty picture on the wall 
 
 harry ignored it he felt older than he had ever felt in his life and it seemed extraordinary to him that barely an hour ago he had been worried about a joke shop and who had got a badge 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter nine the woes of mrs weasleycontents prev chapter next chapter 
 abrupt departure took harry completely by surprise he remained sitting where he was in the chained chair struggling with his feelings of shock and relief the wizengamot were all getting to their feet talking gathering up their papers and packing them away harry stood up nobody seemed to be paying him the slightest bit of attention except the toadlike witch on right who was now gazing down at him instead of at dumbledore ignoring her he tried to catch eye or madam wanting to ask whether he was free to go but fudge seemed quite determined not to notice harry and madam bones was busy with her briefcase so he took a lew tentative steps towards the exit and when nobody called him back broke into a very fast walk 
 
 he took the last lew steps at a run wrenched open the door and almost collided with mr weasley who was standing right outside looking pale and apprehensive 
 
 dumbledore say 
 
 cleared harry said pulling the door closed behind him of all charges 
 
 beaming mr weasley seized harry by the shoulders 
 
 harry wonderful well of course they have found you guilty not on the evidence but even so i pretend i 
 
 but mr weasley broke off because the courtroom door had ust opened again the wizengamot were filing out 
 
 beard exclaimed mr weasley wonderingly pulling harry aside to let them all pass you were tried by the full court 
 
 i think so said harry quietly 
 
 one or two of the wizards nodded to harry as they passed and a few including madam bones said morning arthur to mr weasley but most averted their eyes cornelius fudge and the toadlike witch were almost the last to leave the dungeon fudge acted as though mr weasley and harry were part of the wall but again the witch looked almost appraisingly at harry as she passed last of all to pass was percy like fudge he completely ignored his father and harry he marched past clutching a large roll of parchment and a handful of spare quills his back rigid and his nose in the air the lines around mr mouth tightened slightly but other than this he gave no sign that he had seen his third son 
 
 going to take you straight back so you can tell the others the good news he said beckoning harry forwards as heels disappeared up the steps to level nine drop you off on the way to that toilet in bethnal green come on 
 
 so what will you have to do about the toilet harry asked grinning everything suddenly seemed five times funnier than usual it was starting to sink in he was cleared he was going back to hogwarts 
 
 oh a simple enough said mr weasley as they mounted the stairs but not so much having to repair the damage more the attitude behind the vandalism harry might strike some wizards as funny but an expression of something much deeper and nastier and i for one 
 
 mr weasley broke off in they had just reached the corridor and cornelius fudge was standing a few feet away from them talking quietly to a tall man with sleek blond hair and a pointed pale face 
 
 the second man turned at the sound of their footsteps he too broke off in his cold grey eyes narrowed and fixed upon face 
 
 well well well patronus potter said lucius malfoy coolly 
 
 harry felt winded as though he had just walked into something solid he had last seen those cold grey eyes through slits in a death hood and last heard that voice jeering in a dark graveyard while lord voldemort tortured him harry could not believe that lucius malfoy dared look him in the face he could not believe that he was here in the ministry of magic or that cornelius fudge was talking to him when harry had told fudge mere weeks ago that malfoy was a death eater 
 
 the minister was just telling me about your lucky escape potter drawled mr malfoy quite astonishing the way you continue to wriggle out of very tight holes snakelike in fact 
 
 mr weasley gripped shoulder in warning 
 
 yeah said harry yeah good at escaping 
 
 lucius malfoy raised his eyes to mr face 
 
 and arthur weasley too what are you doing here arthur 
 
 i work here said mr weasley curtly 
 
 not here surely said mr malfoy raising his eyebrows and glancing towards the door over mr shoulder i thought you were up on the second floor you do something that involves sneaking muggle artefacts home and bewitching them 
 
 no mr weasley snapped his fingers now biting into shoulder 
 
 what areyou doing here anyway harry asked lucius malfoy 
 
 i think private matters between myself and the minister are any concern of yours potter said malfoy smoothing the front of his robes harry distinctly heard the gentle clinking of what sounded like a full pocket of gold really just because you are favourite boy you must not expect the same indulgence from the rest of us shall we go up to your office then minister 
 
 certainly said fudge turning his back on harry and mr weasley this way lucius 
 
 they strode off together talking in low voices mr weasley did not let go of shoulder until they had disappeared into the lift 
 
 why he waiting outside office if got business to do together harry burst out furiously what was he doing down here 
 
 trying to sneak down to the courtroom if you ask me said mr weasley looking extremely agitated and glancing over his shoulder as though making sure they could not be overheard trying to find out whether been expelled or not leave a note for dumbledore when i drop you off he ought to know been talking to fudge again 
 
 what private business have they got together anyway 
 
 gold i expect said mr weasley angrily been giving generously to all sorts of things for years gets him in with the right people then he can ask favours delay laws he want passed oh very lucius malfoy 
 
 the lift arrived it was empty except for a flock of memos that flapped around mr head as he pressed the button for the atrium and the doors clanged shut he waved them away irritably 
 
 mr weasley said harry slowly if fudge is meeting death eaters like malfoy if seeing them alone how do we know they put the imperius curse on him 
 
 think it occurred to us harry said mr weasley quietly but dumbledore thinks fudge is acting of his own accord at the momentwhich as dumbledore says is not a lot of comfort best not talk about it any more just now harry 
 
 the doors slid open and they stepped out into the now atrium eric the watchwizard was hidden behind his daily prophet again they had walked straight past the golden fountain before harry remembered 
 
 wait he told mr weasley and pulling his moneybag from his pocket he turned back to the fountain 
 
 he looked up into the handsome face but up close harry thought he looked rather weak and foolish the witch was wearing a vapid smile like a beauty contestant and from what harry knew of goblins and centaurs they were most unlikely to be caught staring so soppily at humans of any description only the attitude of creeping servility looked convincing with a grin at the thought of what hermione would say if she could see the statue of the elf harry turned his moneybag and emptied not just ten galleons but the whole contents into the pool at the statues feet 
 
 i knew it yelled ron punching the air you always get away with stuff 
 
 they were bound to clear you said hermione who had looked positively faint with anxiety when harry had entered the kitchen and was now holding a shaking hand over her eyes there was no case against you none at all 
 
 everyone seems quite relieved though considering you all knew get off said harry smiling 
 
 mrs weasley was wiping her face on her apron and fred george and ginny were doing a kind of war dance to a chant that went he got off he got off he got off 
 
 enough settle down shouted mr weasley though he too was smiling listen sirius lucius malfoy was at the ministry 
 
 what said sirius sharply 
 
 he got off he got off he got off 
 
 be quiet you three yes we saw him talking to fudge on level nine then they went up to office together dumbledore ought to know 
 
 absolutely said sirius tell him worry 
 
 well better get going a vomiting toilet waiting for me in bethnal green molly be late covering for tonks but kingsley might be dropping in for dinner 
 
 he got off he got off he got off 
 
 enoughfredgeorgeginny said mrs weasley as mr weasley left the kitchen harry dear come and sit down have some lunch you hardly ate breakfast 
 
 ron and hermione sat themselves down opposite him looking happier than they had done since he had first arrived at grimmauld place and feeling of giddy relief which had been somewhat dented by his encounter with lucius malfoy swelled again the gloomy house seemed warmer and more welcoming all of a sudden even kreacher looked less ugly as he poked his snoutlike nose into the kitchen to investigate the source of all the noise 
 
 course once dumbledore turned up on your side there was no way they were going to convict you said ron happily now dishing great mounds of mashed potato on to plates 
 
 yeah he swung it for me said harry he felt it would sound highly ungrateful not to mention childish to say i wish talked to me though or even looked at me 
 
 and as he thought this the scar on his forehead burned so badly that he clapped his hand to it 
 
 up said hermione looking alarmed 
 
 scar harry mumbled but nothing it happens all the time now 
 
 none of the others had noticed a thing all of them were now helping themselves to food while gloating over narrow escape fred george and ginny were still singing hermione looked rather anxious but before she could say anything ron had said happily i bet dumbledore turns up this evening to celebrate with us you know 
 
 i think be able to ron said mrs weasley setting a huge plate of roast chicken down in front of harry really very busy at the moment 
 
 he got off he got off he got off 
 
 shut up roared mrs weasley 
 
 over the next few days harry could not help noticing that there was one person within number twelve grimmauld place who did not seem wholly overjoyed that he would be returning to hogwarts sirius had put up a very good show of happiness on first hearing the news wringing hand and beaming just like the rest of them soon however he was moodier and surlier than before talking less to everybody even harry and spending increasing amounts of time shut up in his room with buckbeak 
 
 you go feeling guilty said hermione sternly after harry had confided some of his feelings to her and ron while they scrubbed out a mouldy cupboard on the third floor a few days later you belong at hogwarts and sirius knows it personally i think being selfish 
 
 a bit harsh hermione said ron frowning as he attempted to prise off a bit of mould that had attached itself firmly to his finger you want to be stuck inside this house without any company 
 
 have company said hermione headquarters to the order of the phoenix it he just got his hopes up that harry would be coming to live here with him 
 
 i think true said harry wringing out his cloth he give me a straight answer when i asked him if i could 
 
 he just want to get his own hopes up even more said hermione wisely and he probably felt a bit guilty himself because i think a part of him was really hoping be expelled then both be outcasts together 
 
 come off it said harry and ron together but hermione merely shrugged 
 
 suit yourselves but i sometimes think right and sirius gets confused about whether you or your father harry 
 
 so you think touched in the head said harry heatedly 
 
 no i just think been very lonely for a long time said hermione simply 
 
 at this point mrs weasley entered the bedroom behind them 
 
 still not finished she said poking her head into the cupboard 
 
 i thought you might be here to tell us to have a break said ron bitterly know how much mould got rid of since we arrived here 
 
 you were so keen to help the order said mrs weasley you can do your bit by making headquarters fit to live in 
 
 i feel like a grumbled ron 
 
 well now you understand what dreadful lives they lead perhaps be a bit more active in said hermione hopefully as mrs weasley left them to it you know maybe it be a bad idea to show people exactly how horrible it is to clean all the timewe could do a sponsored scrub of gryffindor common room all proceeds to it would raise awareness as well as funds 
 
 sponsor you to shut up about spew ron muttered irritably but only so harry could hear him 
 
 harry found himself daydreaming about hogwarts more and more as the end of the holidays approached he could not wait to see hagrid again to play quidditch even to stroll across the vegetable patches to the herbology greenhouses it would be a treat just to leave this dusty musty house where half of the cupboards were still bolted shut and kreacher wheezed insults out of the shadows as you passed though harry was careful not to say any of this within earshot of sirius 
 
 the fact was that living at the headquarters of the movement was not nearly as interesting or exciting as harry would have expected before experienced it though members of the order of the phoenix came and went regularly sometimes staying for meals sometimes only for a few minutes of whispered conversation mrs weasley made sure that harry and the others were kept well out of earshot whether extendable or normal and nobody not even sirius seemed to feel that harry needed to know anything more than he had heard on the night of his arrival 
 
 on the very last day of the holidays harry was sweeping up owl droppings from the top of the wardrobe when ron entered their bedroom carrying a couple of envelopes 
 
 booklists have arrived he said throwing one of the envelopes up to harry who was standing on a chair about time i thought forgotten they usually come much earlier than this 
 
 harry swept the last of the droppings into a rubbish bag and threw the bag over head into the wastepaper basket in the corner which swallowed it and belched loudly he then opened his letter it contained two pieces of parchment one the usual reminder that term started on the first of september the other telling him which books he would need for the coming year 
 
 only two new ones he said reading the list the standard book of spells grade by miranda goshawk and defensive magical theory by wilbert slinkhard 
 
 crack 
 
 fred and george apparated right beside harry he was so used to them doing this by now that he even fall off his chair 
 
 we were just wondering who assigned the slinkhard book said fred conversationally 
 
 because it means found a new defence against the dark arts teacher said george 
 
 and about time too said fred 
 
 what mean harry asked jumping down beside them 
 
 well we overheard mum and dad talking on the extendable ears a few weeks back fred told harry and from what they were saying dumbledore was having real trouble finding anyone to do the job this year 
 
 not surprising is it when you look at happened to the last four said george 
 
 one sacked one dead memory removed and one locked in a trunk for nine months said harry counting them off on his fingers yeah i see what you mean 
 
 up with you ron asked fred 
 
 ron did not answer harry looked round ron was standing very still with his mouth slightly open gaping at his letter from hogwarts 
 
 the matter said fred impatiently moving around ron to look over his shoulder at the parchment 
 
 mouth fell open too 
 
 prefect he said staring incredulously at the letter prefect 
 
 george leapt forward seized the envelope in other hand and turned it harry saw something scarlet and gold fall into palm 
 
 no way said george in a hushed voice 
 
 been a mistake said fred snatching the letter out of grasp and holding it up to the light as though checking for a watermark no one in their right mind would make ron a prefect 
 
 the twins heads turned in unison and both of them stared at harry 
 
 we thought you were a cert said fred in a tone that suggested harry had tricked them in some way 
 
 we thought dumbledore was bound to pick you said george indignantly 
 
 winning the triwizard and everything said fred 
 
 i suppose all the mad stuff counted against him said george to fred 
 
 yeah said fred slowly yeah caused too much trouble mate well at least one of got their priorities right 
 
 he strode over to harry and clapped him on the back while giving ron a scathing look 
 
 prefect ickle ronnie the prefect 
 
 oh going to be revolting groaned george thrusting the prefect badge back at ron as though it might contaminate him 
 
 ron who still had not said a word took the badge stared at it for a moment then held it out to harry as though asking mutely for confirmation that it was genuine harry took it a large p was superimposed on the gryffindor lion he had seen a badge just like this on chest on his very first day at hogwarts 
 
 the door banged open hermione came tearing into the room her cheeks flushed and her hair flying there was an envelope in her hand 
 
 did youdid you get 
 
 she spotted the badge in hand and let out a shriek 
 
 i knew it she said excitedly brandishing her letter me too harry me too 
 
 no said harry quickly pushing the badge back into hand ron not me 
 
 itwhat 
 
 prefect not me harry said 
 
 ron said hermione her jaw dropping but are you sure i mean 
 
 she turned red as ron looked round at her with a defiant expression on his lace 
 
 my name on the letter he said 
 
 i said hermione looking thoroughly bewildered i well wow well done ron really 
 
 unexpected said george nodding 
 
 no said hermione blushing harder than ever no not done loads of really 
 
 the door behind her opened a little wider and mrs weasley backed into the room carrying a pile of freshly laundered robes 
 
 ginny said the booklists had come at last she said glancing around at all the envelopes as she made her way over to the bed and started sorting the robes into two piles if you give them to me take them over to diagon alley this afternoon and get your books while packing ron have to get you more pyjamas these are at least six inches too short i believe how fast growing what colour would you like 
 
 get him red and gold to match his badge said george smirking 
 
 match his what said mrs weasley absently rolling up a pair of maroon socks and placing them on pile 
 
 his badge said fred with the air of getting the worst over quickly his lovely shiny new badge 
 
 words took a moment to penetrate mrs preoccupation with pyjamas 
 
 his but ron not 
 
 ron held up his badge 
 
 mrs weasley let out a shriek just like 
 
 i believe it i believe it oh ron how wonderful a prefect everyone in the family 
 
 what are fred and i neighbours said george indignantly as his mother pushed him aside and flung her arms around her youngest son 
 
 wait until your father hears ron so proud of you what wonderful news you could end up head boy just like bill and percy the first step oh what a thing to happen in the middle of all this worry just thrilled oh ronnie 
 
 fred and george were both making loud retching noises behind her back but mrs weasley did not notice arms tight around neck she was kissing him all over his face which had turned a brighter scarlet than his badge 
 
 mum mum get a grip he muttered trying to push her away 
 
 she let go of him and said breathlessly well what will it be we gave percy an owl but already got one of course 
 
 do you mean said ron looking as though he did not dare believe his ears 
 
 got to have a reward for this said mrs weasley fondly how about a nice new set of dress robes 
 
 already bought him some said fred sourly who looked as though he sincerely regretted this generosity 
 
 or a new cauldron old rusting through or a new rat you always liked scabbers 
 
 mum said ron hopefully can i have a new broom 
 
 mrs face fell slightly broomsticks were expensive 
 
 not a really good one ron hastened to add justjust a new one for a change 
 
 mrs weasley hesitated then smiled 
 
 of course you can well better get going if got a broom to buy too see you all later little ronnie a prefect and forget to pack your trunks a prefect oh all of a dither 
 
 she gave ron yet another kiss on the cheek sniffed loudly and bustled from the room 
 
 fred and george exchanged looks 
 
 you mind if we kiss you do you ron said fred in a falsely anxious voice 
 
 we could curtsey if you like said george 
 
 oh shut up said ron scowling at them 
 
 or what said fred an evil grin spreading across his face going to put us in detention 
 
 love to see him try sniggered george 
 
 he could if you watch out said hermione angrily 
 
 fred and george burst out laughing and ron muttered drop it hermione 
 
 going to have to watch our step george said fred pretending to tremble with these two on our case 
 
 yeah it looks like our days are finally over said george shaking his head 
 
 and with another loud crack the twins disapparated 
 
 those two said hermione furiously staring up at the ceiling through which they could now hear fred and george roaring with laughter in the room upstairs pay any attention to them ron only jealous 
 
 i think they are said ron doubtfully also looking up at the ceiling always said only prats become prefects still he added on a happier note never had new brooms i wish i could go with mum and choose never be able to afford a nimbus but the new cleansweep out be great yeah i think go and tell her i like the cleansweep just so she knows 
 
 he dashed from the room leaving harry and hermione alone 
 
 for some reason harry found he did not want to look at hermione he turned to his bed picked up the pile of clean robes mrs weasley had laid on it and crossed the room to his trunk 
 
 harry said hermione tentatively 
 
 well done hermione said harry so heartily it did not sound like his voice at all and still not looking at her brilliant prefect great 
 
 thanks said hermione ermharrycould i borrow hedwig so i can tell mum and dad be really pleasedi mean prefect is something they can understand 
 
 yeah no problem said harry still in the horrible hearty voice that did not belong to him take her 
 
 he leaned over his trunk laid the robes on the bottom of it and pretended to be rummaging for something while hermione crossed to the wardrobe and called hedwig down a few moments passed harry heard the door close but remained bent double listening the only sounds he could hear were the blank picture on the wall sniggering again and the wastepaper basket in the corner coughing up the owl droppings 
 
 he straightened up and looked behind him hermione had left and hedwig had gone harry hurried across the room closed the door then returned slowly to his bed and sank on to it gazing unseeingly at the foot of the wardrobe 
 
 he had forgotten completely about prefects being chosen in the fifth year he had been too anxious about the possibility of being expelled to spare a thought for the fact that badges must be winging their way towards certain people but if he had remembered if he had thought about it what would he have expected 
 
 not this said a small and truthful voice inside his head 
 
 harry screwed up his face and buried it in his hands he could not lie to himself if he had known the prefect badge was on its way he would have expected it to come to him not ron did this make him as arrogant as draco malfoy did he think himself superior to everyone else did he really believe he was better than ron 
 
 no said the small voice defiantly 
 
 was that true harry wondered anxiously probing his own feelings 
 
 better at quidditch said the voice but not better at anything else 
 
 that was definitely true harry thought he was no better than ron in lessons but what about outside lessons what about those adventures he ron and hermione had had together since starting at hogwarts often risking much worse than expulsion 
 
 well ron and hermione were with me most of the time said the voice in head 
 
 not all the time though harry argued with himself they fight quirrell with me they take on riddle and the basilisk they get rid of all those dementors the night sirius escaped they in that graveyard with me the night voldemort returned 
 
 and the same feeling of that had overwhelmed him on the night he had arrived rose again definitely done more harry thought indignantly done more than either of them 
 
 but maybe said the small voice fairly maybe dumbledore choose prefects because got themselves into a load of dangerous situations maybe he chooses them for other reasons ron must have something you 
 
 harry opened his eyes and stared through his fingers at the clawed feet remembering what fred had said 
 
 no one in their right mind would make ron a prefect 
 
 harry gave a small snort of laughter a second later he felt sickened with himself 
 
 ron had not asked dumbledore to give him the prefect badge this was not fault was he harry best friend in the world going to sulk because he have a badge laugh with the twins behind back ruin this for ron when for the first time he had beaten harry at something 
 
 at this point harry heard footsteps on the stairs again he stood up straightened his glasses and hitched a grin on to his face as ron bounded back through the door 
 
 just caught her he said happily she says get the cleansweep if she can 
 
 cool harry said and he was relieved to hear that his voice had stopped sounding hearty listenronwell done mate 
 
 the smile faded off face 
 
 i never thought it would be me he said shaking his head i thought it would be you 
 
 nah caused too much trouble harry said echoing fred 
 
 yeah said ron yeah i suppose well better get our trunks packed we 
 
 it was odd how widely their possessions seemed to have scattered themselves since they had arrived it took them most of the afternoon to retrieve their books and belongings from all over the house and stow them back inside their school trunks marry noticed that ron kept moving his badge around first placing it on his bedside table then putting it into his jeans pocket then taking it out and lying it on his folded robes as though to see the effect of the red on the black only when fred and george dropped in and offered to attach it to his forehead with a permanent sticking charm did he wrap it tenderly in his maroon socks and lock it in his trunk 
 
 mrs weasley returned from diagon alley around six laden with books and carrying a long package wrapped in thick brown paper that ron took from her with a moan of longing 
 
 never mind unwrapping it now people are arriving for dinner i want you all downstairs she said but the moment she was out of sight ron ripped off the paper in a frenzy and examined every inch of his new broom an ecstatic expression on his face 
 
 down in the basement mrs weasley had hung a scarlet banner over the heavily laden dinner table which read congratulations ron and hermionenew prefects she looked in a better mood than harry had seen her all holiday 
 
 i thought have a little party not a dinner she told harry ron hermione fred george and ginny as they entered the room your father and bill are on their way ron sent them both owls and thrilled she added beaming 
 
 fred rolled his eyes 
 
 sirius lupin tonks and kingsley shacklebolt were already there and moody stumped in shortly after harry had got himself a butterbeer 
 
 oh alastor i am glad here said mrs weasley brightly as shrugged off his travelling cloak been wanting to ask you for agescould you have a look in the writing desk in the drawing room and tell us inside it we wanted to open it just in case something really nasty 
 
 no problem molly 
 
 eye swivelled upwards and stared fixedly through the ceiling of the kitchen 
 
 drawing room he growled as the pupil contracted desk in the corner yeah i see it yeah a boggart want me to go up and get rid of it molly 
 
 no no do it myself later beamed mrs weasley you have your drink having a little bit of a celebration actually she gestured at the scarlet banner fourth prefect in the family she said fondly ruffling hair 
 
 prefect eh growled moody his normal eye on ron and his magical eye swivelling around to gaze into the side of his head harry had the very uncomfortable feeling it was looking at him and moved away towards sirius and lupin 
 
 well congratulations said moody still glaring at ron with his normal eye authority figures always attract trouble but i suppose dumbledore thinks you can withstand most major jinxes or he have appointed you 
 
 ron looked rather startled at this view of the matter but was saved the trouble of responding by the arrival of his father and eldest brother mrs weasley was in such a good mood she did not even complain that they had brought mundungus with them he was wearing a long overcoat that seemed oddly lumpy in unlikely places and declined the offer to remove it and put it with travelling cloak 
 
 well i think a toast is in order said mr weasley when everyone had a drink he raised his goblet to ron and hermione the new gryffindor prefects 
 
 ron and hermione beamed as everyone drank to them and then applauded 
 
 i was never a prefect myself said tonks brightly from behind harry as everybody moved towards the table to help themselves to food her hair was tomato red and today she looked like older sister my head of house said i lacked certain necessary qualities 
 
 like what said ginny who was choosing a baked potato 
 
 like the ability to behave myself said tonks 
 
 ginny laughed hermione looked as though she did not know whether to smile or not and compromised by taking an extra large gulp of butterbeer and choking on it 
 
 what about you sirius ginny asked thumping hermione on the back 
 
 sirius who was right beside harry let out his usual laugh 
 
 no one would have made me a prefect i spent too much time in detention with james lupin was the good boy he got the badge 
 
 i think dumbledore might have hoped i would be able to exercise some control over my best friends said lupin i need scarcely say that i failed dismally 
 
 mood suddenly lifted his father had not been a prefect either all at once the party seemed much more enjoyable he loaded up his plate feeling doubly fond of everyone in the room 
 
 ron was rhapsodising about his new broom to anybody who would listen 
 
 nought to seventy in ten seconds not bad is it when you think the comet two only nought to sixty and with a decent tailwind according to which broomstick 
 
 hermione was talking very earnestly to lupin about her view of elf rights 
 
 i mean the same kind of nonsense as werewolf segregation it it all stems from this horrible thing wizards have of thinking superior to other creatures 
 
 mrs weasley and bill were having their usual argument about hair 
 
 getting really out of hand and so it would look much better shorter it harry 
 
 ohi dunno said harry slightly alarmed at being asked his opinion he slid away from them in the direction of fred and george who were huddled in a corner with mundungus 
 
 mundungus stopped talking when he saw harry but fred winked and beckoned harry closer 
 
 ok he told mundungus we can trust harry our financial backer 
 
 look what got us said george holding out his hand to harry it was full of what looked like shrivelled black pods a faint rattling noise was coming from them even though they were completely stationary 
 
 venomous tentacula seeds said george we need them for the skiving snackboxes but a class c substance so been having a bit of trouble getting hold of them 
 
 ten galleons the lot then dung said fred 
 
 wiv all the trouble i went to to get em said mundungus his saggy bloodshot eyes stretching even wider sorry lads but not taking a knut under twenty 
 
 dung likes his little joke fred said to harry 
 
 yeah his best one so far has been six sickles for a bag of knarl quills said george 
 
 be careful harry warned them quietly 
 
 what said fred busy cooing over prefect ron okay 
 
 but moody could have his eye on you harry pointed out 
 
 mundungus looked nervously over his shoulder 
 
 good point that he grunted all right lads ten it is if take em quick 
 
 cheers harry said fred delightedly when mundungus had emptied his pockets into the twins outstretched hands and scuttled off towards the food better get these upstairs 
 
 harry watched them go feeling slightly uneasy it had just occurred to him that mr and mrs weasley would want to know how fred and george were financing their joke shop business when as was inevitable they finally found out about it giving the twins his triwizard winnings had seemed a simple thing to do at the time but what if it led to another family row and a estrangement would mrs weasley still feel that harry was as good as her son if she found out he had made it possible for fred and george to start a career she thought quite unsuitable 
 
 standing where the twins had left him with nothing but a guilty weight in the pit of his stomach for company harry caught the sound of his own name kingsley deep voice was audible even over the surrounding chatter 
 
 why dumbledore make potter a prefect said kingsley 
 
 have had his reasons replied lupin 
 
 but it shown confidence in him what done persisted kingsley specially with the daily prophet having a go at him every few days 
 
 harry did not look round he did not want lupin or kingsley to know he had heard though not remotely hungry he followed mundungus back towards the table his pleasure in the party had evaporated as quickly as it had come he wished he were upstairs in bed 
 
 moody was sniffing at a chicken leg with what remained of his nose evidently he could not detect any trace of poison because he then tore a strip off it with his teeth 
 
 the made of spanish oak with varnish and vibration control ron was saying to tonks 
 
 mrs weasley yawned widely 
 
 well i think sort out that boggart before i turn in arthur i want this lot up too late all right night harry dear 
 
 she left the kitchen harry set down his plate and wondered whether he could follow her without attracting attention 
 
 you all right potter grunted moody 
 
 yeah fine lied harry 
 
 moody took a swig from his hipflask his eye staring sideways at harry 
 
 come here got something that might interest you he said 
 
 from an inner pocket of his robes moody pulled a very tattered old wizarding photograph 
 
 original order of the phoenix growled moody found it last night when i was looking for my spare invisibility cloak seeing as podmore had the manners to return my best one thought people might like to see it 
 
 harry took the photograph a small crowd of people some waving at him others lifting their glasses looked back up at him 
 
 me said moody unnecessarily pointing at himself the moody in the picture was unmistakeable though his hair was slightly less grey and his nose was intact and dumbledore beside me dedalus diggle on the other side marlene mckinnon she was killed two weeks after this was taken they got her whole family frank and alice longbottom 
 
 stomach already uncomfortable clenched as he looked at alice longbottom he knew her round friendly face very well even though he had never met her because she was the image of her son neville 
 
 poor devils growled moody better dead than what happened to them and emmeline vance met her and that lupin obviously benjy fenwick he copped it too we only ever found bits of him shift aside there he added poking the picture and the little photographic people edged sideways so that those who were partially obscured could move to the front 
 
 edgar bones brother of amelia bones they got him and his family too he was a great wizard sturgis podmore blimey he looks young caradoc dearborn vanished six months after this we never found his body hagrid of course looks exactly the same as ever elphias doge met him forgotten he used to wear that stupid hat gideon prewett it took five death eaters to kill him and his brother fabian they fought like heroes budge along budge along 
 
 the little people in the photograph jostled among themselves and those hidden right at the back appeared at the forefront of the picture 
 
 brother aberforth only time i ever met him strange bloke dorcas meadowes voldemort killed her personally sirius when he still had short hair and there you go thought that would interest you 
 
 heart turned over his mother and father were beaming up at him sitting on either side of a small man whom harry recognised at once as wormtail the one who had betrayed his parents whereabouts to voldemort and so helped to bring about their deaths 
 
 eh said moody 
 
 harry looked up into moody s heavily scarred and pitted face evidently moody was under the impression he had just given harry a bit of a treat 
 
 yeah said harry once again attempting to grin er listen just remembered i packed my 
 
 he was spared the trouble of inventing an object he had not packed sirius had just said that got there and moody had turned towards him harry crossed the kitchen slipped through the door and up the stairs before anyone could call him back 
 
 he did not know why it had been such a shock he had seen pictures of his parents before after all and he had met wormtail but to have them sprung on him like that when he was least expecting it no one would like that he thought angrily 
 
 and then to see them surrounded by all those other happy faces benjy fenwick who had been found in bits and gideon prewett who had died like a hero and the longbottoms who had been tortured into madness all waving happily out of the photograph forever more not knowing that they were doomed well moody might find that interesting he harry found it disturbing 
 
 harry tiptoed up the stairs in the hall past the stuffed glad to be on his own again but as he approached the first landing he heard noises someone was sobbing in the drawing room 
 
 hello harry said 
 
 there was no answer but the sobbing continued he climbed the remaining stairs two at a time walked across the landing and opened the door 
 
 someone was cowering against the dark wall her wand in her hand her whole body shaking with sobs sprawled on the dusty old carpet in a patch of moonlight clearly dead was ron 
 
 all the air seemed to vanish from lungs he felt as though he were falling through the floor his brain turned icy coldron dead no it be 
 
 but wait a moment it be ron was downstairs 
 
 mrs weasley harry croaked 
 
 mrs weasley sobbed pointing her shaking wand at body 
 
 crack 
 
 body turned into on his back his eyes wide open and empty mrs weasley sobbed harder than ever 
 
 she sobbed again 
 
 crack 
 
 mr body replaced his glasses askew a trickle of blood running down his face 
 
 no mrs weasley moaned no riddikulus riddikulus riddikulus 
 
 crack dead twins crack dead percy crack dead harry 
 
 mrs weasley just get out of here shouted harry staring down at his own dead body on the floor let someone else 
 
 going on 
 
 lupin had come running into the room closely followed by sirius with moody stumping along behind them lupin looked from mrs weasley to the dead harry on the floor and seemed to understand in an instant pulling out his own wand he said very firmly and clearly riddikulus 
 
 body vanished a silvery orb hung in the air over the spot where it had lain lupin waved his wand once more and the orb vanished in a puff of smoke 
 
 ohohoh gulped mrs weasley and she broke into a storm of crying her face in her hands 
 
 molly said lupin bleakly walking over to her molly 
 
 next second she was sobbing her heart out on shoulder 
 
 molly it was just a boggart he said soothingly patting her on the head just a stupid boggart 
 
 i see them all the time mrs weasley moaned into his shoulder all the i about it 
 
 sirius was staring at the patch of carpet where the boggart pretending to be body had lain moody was looking at harry who avoided his gaze he had a funny feeling magical eye had followed him all the way out of the kitchen 
 
 tell arthur mrs weasley was gulping now mopping her eyes frantically with her cuffs i want him to know being silly 
 
 lupin handed her a handkerchief and she blew her nose 
 
 harry so sorry what must you think of me she said shakily not even able to get rid of a boggart 
 
 be stupid said harry trying to smile 
 
 just worried she said tears spilling out of her eyes again half the in the order a miracle if we all come through this and not talking to us what if something happens and never it up with him and going to happen if arthur and i get killed to look after ron and ginny 
 
 molly enough said lupin firmly this like last time the order are better prepared got a head start we know what up to 
 
 mrs weasley gave a little squeak of fright at the sound of the name 
 
 oh molly come on about time you got used to hearing his namelook i promise no going to get hurt nobody can promise that but much better off than we were last time you in the order then you understand last time we were outnumbered twenty to one by the death eaters and they were picking us off one by one 
 
 harry thought of the photograph again of his parents beaming faces he knew moody was still watching him 
 
 worry about percy said sirius abruptly come round only a matter of time before voldemort moves into the open once he does the whole going to be begging us to forgive them and not sure be accepting their apology he added bitterly 
 
 and as for going to look after ron and ginny if you and arthur died said lupin smiling slightly what do you think do let them starve 
 
 mrs weasley smiled tremulously 
 
 being silly she muttered again mopping her eyes 
 
 but harry closing his bedroom door behind him some ten minutes later could not think mrs weasley silly he could still see his parents beaming up at him from the battered old photograph unaware that their lives like so many of those around them were drawing to a close the image of the boggart posing as the corpse of each member of mrs family in turn kept flashing before his eyes 
 
 without warning the scar on his forehead seared with pain again and his stomach churned horribly 
 
 cut it out he said firmly rubbing the scar as the pain receded 
 
 first sign of madness talking to your own head said a sly voice from the empty picture on the wall 
 
 harry ignored it he felt older than he had ever felt in his life and it seemed extraordinary to him that barely an hour ago he had been worried about a joke shop and who had got a badge 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter nine the princecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry and ron met hermione in the common room before breakfast next morning hoping for some support in his theory harry lost no time in telling hermione what he had overheard malfoy saying on the hogwarts express 
 
 but he was obviously showing off for parkinson he interjected ron quickly before hermione could say anything 
 
 well she said uncertainly i know it would be like malfoy to make himself seem more important than he is but a big lie to tell 
 
 exactly said harry but he could nor press the point because so many people were trying to listen in to his conversation not to mention staring at him and whispering behind their hands 
 
 rude to point ron snapped at a particularly minuscule boy as they joined the queue to climb out of the portrait hole the boy who had been muttering something about harry behind his hand to his friend promptly turned scarlet and toppled out of the hole in alarm ron sniggered i love being a sixth year and going to be getting free time this year whole periods when we can just sit up here and relax 
 
 going to need that time for studying ron said hermione as they set off down the corridor 
 
 yeah but not today said ron going to be a real loss i reckon 
 
 hold it said hermione throwing out an arm and halting a passing fourth year who was attempting to push past her with a disk clutched tightly in his hand fanged frisbees banned hand it over she told him sternly the scowling boy handed over the snarling frisbee ducked under her arm and took off after his friends ron waited for him to vanish then tugged the frisbee from grip 
 
 excellent always wanted one of these 
 
 remonstration was drowned by a loud giggle lavender brown had apparently found remark highly amusing she continued to laugh as she passed them glancing back at ron over her shoulder ron looked rather pleased with himself 
 
 the ceiling of the great hall was serenely blue and streaked with frail wispy clouds just like the squares of sky visible through the high mullioned windows while they tucked into porridge and eggs and bacon harry and ron told hermione about their embarassing conversation with hagrid the previous evening 
 
 but he really think continue care of magical creatures she said looking distressed i mean when has any of us expressed you know any enthusiasm 
 
 it though innit said ron swallowing an entire fried egg whole we were the ones who made the most effort in classes because we like hagrid but he thinks we liked the stupid subject reckon going to go on to 
 
 neither harry nor hermione answered there was no need they knew perfectly well that nobody in their year would want to continue care of magical creatures they avoided eye and returned his cheery wave only when he left the staff table ten minutes later 
 
 after they had eaten they remained in their places awaiting professor descent from the staff table the distribution of class schedules was more complicated than usual this year for professor mcgonagall needed first to confirm that everybody had achieved the necessary grades to continue with their chosen 
 
 hermione was immediately cleared to continue with charms defense against the dark arts transfiguration herbology arithmancy ancient runes and potions and shot off to a first period ancient runes class without further ado neville took a little longer to sort out his round face was anxious as professor mcgonagall looked down his application and then consulted his results 
 
 herbology fine she said professor sprout will be delighted to see you back with an outstanding and you qualify for defense against the dark arts with exceeds expectations but the problem is transfiguration sorry longbottom but an acceptable really good enough to continue to level just think be able to cope with the coursework 
 
 neville hung his head professor mcgonagall peered at him through her square spectacles 
 
 why do you want to continue with transfiguration anyway never had the impression that you particularly enjoyed it 
 
 neville looked miserable and muttered something about my grandmother wants 
 
 hmph snorted professot mcgonagall high time your grandmother learned to be proud of the grandson got rather than the one she thinks she ought to haveparticularly after what happened at the ministry 
 
 neville turned very pink and blinked confusedly professor mcgonagall had never paid him a compliment before 
 
 sorry longbottom but i cannot let you into my class i see that you have an exceeds expectations in charm howeverwhy not try for a in charms 
 
 my grandmother thinks charms is a soft option mumbled neville 
 
 take charms said professor mcgonagall and i shall drop augusta a line reminding her that just because she failed her charms the subject is not necessarily worthless smiling slightly at the look of delighted incredulity on face professor mcgonagall tapped a blank schedule with the tip of her wand and handed it now carrying details of his new classes to neville 
 
 professor mcgonagall turned next to parvati patil whose first question was whether firenze the handsome centaur was still teaching divination 
 
 he and professor trelawney are dividing classes between them this year said professor mcgonagall a hint of disapproval in her voice it was common knowledge that she despised the subject of divination the sixth year is being taken by professor trelawney 
 
 parvati set off for divination five minutes later looking slightly crestfallen 
 
 so potter potter said professor mcgonagall consulting her notes as she turned to harry charms defense against the dark arts herbology transfiguration all fine i must say i was pleased with your transfiguration mark potter very pleased now why you applied to continue with potions i thought it was your ambition to become an auror 
 
 it was but you told me i had to get an outstanding in my professor 
 
 and so you did when professor snape was teaching the subject professor slughorn however is perfectly happy to accept students with exceeds expectations at do you wish to proceed with potions 
 
 yes said harry but i buy the books or any ingredients or anything 
 
 sure professor slughorn will be able to lend you some said professor mcgonagall very well potter here is your schedule oh by the waytwenty hopefuls have already put down their names for the gryffindor quidditch team i shall pass the list to you in due course and you can fix up trials at your leisure 
 
 a few minutes later ron was cleared to do the same subjects as harry and the two of them left the table together 
 
 look said ron delightedly gazing ar his schedule got a free period now and a free period after break and after lunch excellent 
 
 they returned to the common room which was empty apart from a half dozen seventh years including katie bell the only remaining member of the original gryffindor quidditch team that harry had joined in his first year 
 
 i thought get that well done she called over pointing at the captains badge on chest tell me when you call trials 
 
 be stupid said harry you need to try out i watched you play for five years 
 
 you start off like that she said warningly for all you know someone much better than me out there good teams have been ruined before now because captains just kept playing the old faces or letting in their friends 
 
 ron looked a little uncomfortable and began playing with the fanged frisbee hermione had taken from the student it zoomed around the common room snarling and attempting to take bites of the tapestry yellow eyes followed it and he hissed when it came too close 
 
 an hour later they reluctantly left the sunlit common room for the defense against the dark arts classroom four floors below hermione was already queuing outside carrying an armful of heavy books and looking 
 
 we got so much homework for runes she said anxiously when harry and ron joined her a essay two translations and got to read these by wednesday 
 
 shame yawned ron 
 
 you wait she said resentfully i bet snape gives us loads 
 
 the classroom door opened as she spoke and snape stepped into the corridor his sallow face framed as ever by two curtains of greasy black hair silence fell over the queue immediately 
 
 inside he said 
 
 harry looked around as they entered snape had imposed his personality upon the room already it was gloomier than usual as curtains had been drawn over the windows and was lit by candlelight new pictures adorned the walls many of them showing people who appeared to be in pain sporting grisly injuries or strangely contorted body parts nobody spoke as they settled down looking around at the shadowy gruesome pictures 
 
 i have not asked you to take out your books said snape closing the door and moving to face the class from behind his desk hermione hastily dropped her copy of confronting the faceless back into her bag and stowed it under her chair i wish to speak to you and i want your fullest attention 
 
 his black eyes roved over their upturned faces lingering for a fraction of a second longer on than anyone 
 
 you have had five teachers in this subject so far i believe 
 
 you believe like you watched them all come and go hoping be next thought harry scathingly 
 
 naturally these teachers will all have had their own methods and priorities given this confusion i am surprised so many of you scraped an in this subject i shall be even more surprised if all of you manage to keep up with the work which will be more advanced 
 
 snape set off around the edge of the room speaking now in a lower voice the class craned their necks to keep him in view 
 
 the dark arts said snape are many varied and eternal fighting them is like fighting a monster which each time a neck is severed sprouts a head even fiercer and cleverer than before you are fighting that which is unfixed mutating indestructible 
 
 harry stared at snape it was surely one thing to respect the dark arts as a dangerous enemy another to speak of them as snape was doing with a loving caress in his voice 
 
 your defenses said snape a little louder must therefore be as flexible and inventive as the arts you seek to undo these pictures he indicated a few of them as he swept past give a fair representation of what happens to those who suffer for instance the cruciatus curse he waved a hand toward a witch who was clearly shrieking in agony feel the kiss a wizard lying huddled and slumped against a wall or provoke the aggression of the inferius a bloody mass upon ground 
 
 has an inferius been seen then said parvati patil in a high pitched voice is it definite is he using them 
 
 the dark lord has used inferi in the past said snape which means you would be to assume he might use them again now 
 
 he set off again around the other side of the classroom toward his desk and again they watched him as he walked his dark robes billowing behind him 
 
 you are i believe complete novices in the use of spells what is the advantage of a spell 
 
 hand shot into the air snape took his time looking around at everybody else making sure he had no choice before saying curtly very wellmiss granger 
 
 your adversary has no warning about what kind of magic about to perform said hermione which gives you a advantage 
 
 an answer copied almost word for word from the standard book of spells grade six said snape dismissively over in the corner malfoy sniggered but correct in essentials yes those who progress in using magic without shouting incantations gain an element of surprise in their not all wizards can do this of course it is a question of concentration and mind power which some his gaze lingered maliciously upon harry once more lack 
 
 harry knew snape was thinking of their disastrous occlumency lessons of the previous year he refused to drop his gaze but glowered at snape until snape looked away 
 
 you will now divide snape went on into pairs one partner will attempt to jinx the other without speaking the other will attempt to repel the jinx in equal silence carry on 
 
 although snape did not know it harry had taught at least half the class everyone who had been a member of the how to perform a shield charm the previous year none of them had ever cast the charm without speaking however a reasonable amount of cheating ensued many people were merely whispering the incantation instead of saying it aloud typically ten minutes into the lesson hermione managed to repel muttered jinx without uttering a single word a feat that would surely have earned her twenty points for gryffindor from any reasonable teacher thought harry bitterly but which snape ignored he swept between them as they practiced looking just as much like an overgrown bat as ever lingering to watch harry and ron struggling with the task 
 
 ron who was supposed to be jinxing harry was purple in the face his lips tightly compressed to save himself from the temptation of muttering the incantation harry had his wand raised waiting on tenterhooks to repel a jinx that seemed unlikely ever to come 
 
 pathetic weasley said snape after a while herelet me show you 
 
 he turned his wand on harry so fast that harry reacted instinctively all thought of spells forgotten he yelled protego 
 
 his shield charm was so strong snape was knocked and hit a desk the whole class had looked around and now watched as snape righted himself scowling 
 
 do you remember me telling you we are practicing spells potter 
 
 yes said harry stiffly 
 
 yes sir 
 
 no need to call me sir professor the words had escaped him before he knew what he was saying several people gasped including hermione behind snape however ron dean and seamus grinned appreciatively 
 
 detention saturday night my office said snape i do not take cheek from anyone potter not even the chosen one 
 
 that was brilliant harry chortled ron once they were safely on their way to break a short while later 
 
 you really have said it said hermione frowning at ron what made you 
 
 he tried to jinx me in case you notice fumed harry i had enough of that during those occlumency lessons why he use another guinea pig for a change dumbledore playing at anyway letting him teach defense did you hear him talking about the dark arts he loves them all that unfixed indestructible stuff 
 
 well said hermione i thought he sounded a bit like you 
 
 like me 
 
 yes when you were telling us what like to face voldemort you said it just memorizing a bunch of spells you said it was just you and your brains and your gutswell that what snape was saying that it really comes down to being brave and 
 
 harry was so disarmed that she had thought his words as well worth memorizing as the standard book of spells that he did not argue 
 
 harry hey harry 
 
 harry looked around jack sloper one of the beaters on last gryffindor quidditch team was hurrying toward him holding a roll of parchment 
 
 for you panted sloper listen i heard the new captain you holding trials 
 
 not sure yet said harry thinking privately that sloper would be very lucky to get back on the team let you know 
 
 oh right i was hoping be this weekend 
 
 but harry was not listening he had just recognized the thin slanting writing on the parchment leaving sloper in he hurried away with ron and hermione unrolling the parchment as he went 
 
 dear harry 
 i would like to start our private lessons this saturday kindly come along to my office at eight i hope you are enjoying your first day back at school 
 yours sincerely 
 albus dumbledore 
 i enjoy acid pops 
 he enjoys acid pops said ron who had read the message over shoulder and was looking perplexed 
 
 the password to get past the gargoyle outside his study said harry in a low voice ha not going to be pleased i be able to do his detention 
 
 he ron and hermione spent the whole of break speculating on what dumbledore would teach harry ron thought it most likely to be spectacular jinxes and hexes of the type the death eaters would not know hermione said such things were illegal and thought it much more likely that dumbledore wanted to teach harry advanced defensive magic after break she went off to arithmancy while harry and ron returned to the common room where they grudgingly started homework this turned out to be so complex that they still had not finished when hermione joined them for their free period though she considerably speeded up the process they had only just finished when the bell rang for the double potions and they beat the familiar path down to the dungeon classroom that had for so long been 
 
 when they arrived in the corridor they saw that there were only a dozen people progressing to level crabbe and goyle had evidently failed to achieve the required grade but four slytherins had made it through including malfoy four ravenclaws were there and one hufflepuff ernie macmillan whom harry liked despite his rather pompous manner 
 
 harry ernie said portentously holding out his hand as harry approached get a chance to speak in defense against the dark arts this morning good lesson i thought but shield charms are old hat of course for us old lags and how are you ronhermione 
 
 before they could say more than fine the dungeon door opened and belly preceded him out of the door as they filed into the room his great walrus mustache curved above his beaming mouth and he greeted harry and zabini with particular enthusiasm 
 
 the dungeon was most unusually already full of vapors and odd smells harry ron and hermione sniffed interestedly as they passed large bubbling cauldrons the four slytherins took a table together as did the four ravenclaws this left harry ron and hermione to share a table with ernie they chose the one nearest a cauldron that was emitting one of the most seductive scents harry had ever inhaled somehow it reminded him simultaneously of treacle tart the woody smell of a broomstick handle and something flowery he thought he might have smelled at the burrow he found that he was breathing very slowly and deeply and that the fumes seemed to be filling him up like drink a great contentment stole over him he grinned across at ron who grinned back lazily 
 
 now then now then now then said slughorn whose massive outline was quivering through the many shimmering vapors scales out everyone and potion kits and forget your copies of advanced 
 
 sir said harry raising his hand 
 
 harry 
 
 i got a book or scales or ronwe realize be able to do the you see 
 
 ah yes professor mcgonagall did mention not to worry my dear boy not to worry at all you can use ingredients from the store cupboard today and sure we can lend you some scales and got a small stock of old books here do until you can write to flourish and blotts 
 
 slughorn strode over to a corner cupboard and after a foraging emerged with two very copies of advanced by libatius borage which he gave to harry and ron along with two sets of tarnished scales 
 
 now then said slughorn returning to the front of the class and inflating his already bulging chest so that the buttons on his waistcoat threatened to burst off prepared a few potions for you to have a look at just out of interest you know these are the kind of thing you ought to be able to make after completing your you ought to have heard of em even if you made em yet anyone tell me what this one is 
 
 he indicated the cauldron nearest the slytherin table harry raised himself slighty in his seat and saw what looked like plain water boiling away inside it 
 
 hand hit the air before anybody slughorn pointed at her 
 
 veritaserum a colorless odorless potion thar forces the drinker to tell the truth said hermione 
 
 very good very good said slughorn happily now he continued pointing at the cauldron nearest the ravenclaw table this one here is pretty well known featured in a few ministry leaflets lately too who can 
 
 hand was fastest once more 
 
 polyjuice potion sir she said 
 
 harry too had recognized the mudlike substance the second cauldron but did not resent hermione getting the credit for answering the question she after all was the one who had succeeded in making it back in their second year 
 
 excellent excellent now this one her yes my dear said slughorn now looking slightly bemused as hand punched the air again 
 
 amortentia 
 
 it is indeed ir seems almost foolish to ask said slughorn who was looking mightily impressed but i assume you know what it does 
 
 the most powerful love porion in the world said hermione 
 
 quite right you recognized it i suppose by its distinctive sheen 
 
 and the steam rising in characteristic spirals said hermione enthusiastically and supposed to smell differently to each of according to what attracts us and i can smell freshly mown grass and new parchment and 
 
 but she turned slightly pink and did not complete the sentence 
 
 may i ask your name my dear said slughorn ignoring embarrassment 
 
 hermione granger sir 
 
 granger granger can you possibly be related to hector who founded the most extraordinary society of potioneers 
 
 no i think so sir you see 
 
 harry saw malfoy lean close to nott and whisper something both of them sniggered but slughorn showed no dismay on the contrary he beamed and looked from hermione to harry who was sitting next to her 
 
 oho one of my best friends is and the best in our year assuming this is the very friend of whom you spoke harry 
 
 yes sir said harry 
 
 well well take twenty points for gryffindor miss granger said slughorn genially 
 
 malfoy looked rather as he had done the time hermione had punched him in the face hermione turned to harry with a radiant expression and whispered did you really tell him the best in the year oh harry 
 
 well so impressive about that whispered ron who for some reason looked annoyed you are the best in the told him so if asked me 
 
 hermione smiled but made a shushing gesture so that they could hear what slughorn was saying ron looked slightly disgruntled 
 
 amortentia really create love of course it is impossible to manufacture or imitate love no this will simply cause a powerful infatuation or obsession it is probably the most dangerous and powerful potion in this roomoh yes he said nodding gravely at malfoy and nott both of whom were smirking skeptically when you have seen as much of life as i have you will not underestimate the power of obsessive love 
 
 and now said slughorn it is time for us to start work 
 
 sir you told us in this one said ernie macmillan pointing at a small black cauldron standing on desk the potion within was splashing about merrily it was the color of molten gold and large drops were leaping like goldfish above the surface though not a particle had spilled 
 
 oho said slughorn again harry was sure that slughorn had not forgotten the potion at all but had waited to be asked for dramatic effect yes that well that one ladies and gentlemen is a most curious little potion called felix felicis i take it he turned smiling to look at hermione who had let out an audible gasp that you know what felix felicis does miss granger 
 
 liquid luck said hermione excitedly it makes you lucky 
 
 the whole class seemed to sit up a little straighter now all harry could see of malfoy was the back of his sleek blond head because he was at last giving slughorn his full and undivided attention 
 
 quite right take another ten points for gryffindor yes a funny little potion felix felicis said slughorn desperately tricky to make and disastrous to get wrong however if brewed correctly as this has been you will find that all your endeavors tend to succeed at least until the effects wear off 
 
 why people drink it all the time sir said terry boot eagerly 
 
 because if taken in excess it causes giddiness recklessness and dangerous overconfidence said slughorn too much of a good thing you know highly toxic in large quantities but taken sparingly and very occasionally 
 
 have you ever taken it sir asked michael corner with great interest 
 
 twice in my life said slughorn once when i was once when i was two tablespoonfuls taken with breakfast two perfect days 
 
 he gazed dreamily into the distance whether he was playacting or not thought harry the effect was good 
 
 and that said slughorn apparently coming back to earth is what i shall be offering as a prize in this lesson 
 
 there was silence in which every bubble and gurgle of the surrounding potions seemed magnified tenfold 
 
 one tiny bottle of felix felicis said slughorn taking a minuscule glass bottle with a cork in it out of his pocket and showing it to them all enough for twelve hours luck from dawn till dusk you will be lucky in everything you attempt 
 
 now i must give you warning that felix felicis is a banned substance in organized competition sporting events for instance examinations or elections so the winner is to use it on an ordinary day only and watch how that ordinary day becomes extraordinary 
 
 so said slughorn suddenly brisk how are you to win this fabulous prize well by turning to page ten of advanced potion making we have a little over an hour left to us which should be time for you to make a decent attempt at the draught of living death i know it is more complex than anything you have attempted before and i do not expect a perfect potion from anybody the person who does best however will win little felix here off you go 
 
 there was a scraping as everyone drew their cauldrons toward them and some loud clunks as people began adding weights to their scales but nobody spoke the concentration within the room was almost tangible harry saw malfoy riffling feverishly through his copy of advanced it could not have been clearer that malfoy really wanted that lucky day harry bent swiftly over the tattered book slughorn had lent him 
 
 to his annoyance he saw that the previous owner had scribbled all over the pages so that the margins were as black as the printed portions bending low to decipher the ingredients even here the previous owner had made annotations and crossed things out harry hurried off toward the store cupboard to find what he needed as he dashed back to his cauldron he saw malfoy cutting up valerian roots as fast as he could 
 
 everyone kept glancing around at what the rest of the class was doing this was both an advantage and a disadvantage of potions that it was hard to keep your work private within ten minutes the whole place was full of bluish steam hermione of course seemed to have progressed furthest her potion already resembled the smooth black liquid mentioned as the ideal halfway stage 
 
 having finished chopping his roots harry bent low over his book again it was really very irritating having to try and decipher the directions under all the stupid scribbles of the previous owner who for some reason had taken issue with the order to cut up the sopophorous bean and had written in the alternative instruction 
 
 crush with flat side of silver dagger releases juice better than cutting 
 
 sir i think you knew my grandfather abraxas malfoy harry looked up slughorn was just passing the slytherin table 
 
 yes said slughorn without looking at malfoy i was sorry to hear he had died although of course it unexpected dragon pox at his age 
 
 and he walked away harry bent back over his cauldron smirking he could tell that malfoy had expected to be treated like harry or zabini perhaps even hoped for some preferential treatment of the type he had learned to expect from snape it looked as though malfoy would have to rely on nothing but talent to win the bottle of felix felicis 
 
 the sopophorous bean was proving very difficult to cut up harry turned to hermione 
 
 can i borrow your silver knife 
 
 she nodded impatiently not taking her eyes off her potion which was still deep purple though according to the book ought to be turning a light shade of lilac by now 
 
 harry crushed his bean with the flat side of the dagger to his astonishment it immediately exuded so much juice he was amazed the shriveled bean could have held it all 
 
 hastily scooping it all into the cauldron he saw to his surprise that the potion immediately turned exactly the shade of lilac described by the textbook 
 
 his annoyance with the previous owner vanishing on the spot harry now squinted at the next line of instructions according the book he had to stir counterclockwise until the potion turned clear as water according to the addition the previous owner made however he ought to add a clockwise stir after every seventh counterclockwise stir could the old owner be right twice 
 
 harry stirred counterclockwise held his breath and stirred once clockwise the effect was immediate the potion turned pale pink 
 
 how are you doing that demanded hermione who was redfaced and whose hair was growing bushier and bushier in the fumes from her cauldron her potion was still resolutely purple 
 
 add a clockwise stir 
 
 no no the book says counterclockwise she snapped 
 
 harry shrugged and continued what he was doing seven stirs counterclockwise one clockwise pause seven stirs counterclockwise one stir clockwise 
 
 across the table ron was cursing fluently under his breath his potion looked like liquid licorice harry glanced around as far as he could see no one potion had turned as pale as his he felt elated something that had certainly never happened before in this dungeon 
 
 and up called slughorn stop stirring please 
 
 slughorn moved slowly among the tables peering into cauldrons he made no comment but occasionally gave the potions a stir or a sniff at last he reached the table where harry ron hermione and ernie were sitting he smiled ruefully at the tarlike substance in cauldron he passed over navy concoction potion he gave an approving nod then he saw and a look of incredulous delight spread over his face 
 
 the clear winner he cried to the dungeon excellent excellent harry good lord clear inherited your talent she was a dab hand at potions lily was here you are then here you areone bottle of felix felicis as promised and use it well 
 
 harry slipped the tiny bottle of golden liquid into his inner pocket feeling an odd combination of delight at the furious looks on the slytherins faces and guilt at the disappointed expression on ron looked simply dumbfounded 
 
 how did you do that he whispered to harry as they left the dungeon 
 
 got lucky i suppose said harry because malfoy was within earshot 
 
 once they were securely ensconced at the gryffindor table for dinner however he felt safe enough to tell them face became stonier with every word he uttered 
 
 i you think i cheated he finished aggravated by her expression 
 
 well it exactly your own work was it she said stiffly 
 
 he only followed different instructions to ours said ron been a catastrophe it but he took a risk and it paid off he heaved a sigh slughorn handed me that book but no i get the one no ever written on puked on by the look of page but 
 
 hang on said a voice close by left ear and he caught a sudden waft of that flowery smell he had picked up in dungeon he looked around and saw that ginny had joined them did i hear right been taking orders from something someone wrote in a book harry 
 
 she looked alarmed and angry harry knew what was on her mind at once 
 
 nothing he said reassuringly lowering his voice not like you know diary just an old textbook scribbled on 
 
 but doing what it says 
 
 i just tried a few of the tips written in the margins honestly ginny nothing funny 
 
 got a point said hermione perking up at once we ought to check that nothing odd about it i mean all these funny instructions who knows 
 
 hey said harry indignantly as she pulled his copy of advanced out of his bag and raised her wand 
 
 specialis revelio she said rapping it smartly on the front cover nothing whatsoever happened the book simply lay there looking old and dirty and 
 
 finished said harry irritably or want to wait and see if it does a few backflips 
 
 it seems all right said hermione still staring at the book suspiciously i mean it really does seem to be just a textbook 
 
 good then have it back said harry snatching it off the table but it slipped from his hand and landed open on the floor nobody else was looking harry bent low to retrieve the book and as he did so he saw something scribbled along the bottom of the back cover in the same small cramped handwriting as the instructions that had won him his bottle of felix felicis now safely hidden inside a pair of socks in his trunk upstairs 
 
 this book is the property of the half blood prince 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the half blood prince 
 

lionfish nov chapter nine the princecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry and ron met hermione in the common room before breakfast next morning hoping for some support in his theory harry lost no time in telling hermione what he had overheard malfoy saying on the hogwarts express 
 
 but he was obviously showing off for parkinson he interjected ron quickly before hermione could say anything 
 
 well she said uncertainly i know it would be like malfoy to make himself seem more important than he is but a big lie to tell 
 
 exactly said harry but he could nor press the point because so many people were trying to listen in to his conversation not to mention staring at him and whispering behind their hands 
 
 rude to point ron snapped at a particularly minuscule boy as they joined the queue to climb out of the portrait hole the boy who had been muttering something about harry behind his hand to his friend promptly turned scarlet and toppled out of the hole in alarm ron sniggered i love being a sixth year and going to be getting free time this year whole periods when we can just sit up here and relax 
 
 going to need that time for studying ron said hermione as they set off down the corridor 
 
 yeah but not today said ron going to be a real loss i reckon 
 
 hold it said hermione throwing out an arm and halting a passing fourth year who was attempting to push past her with a disk clutched tightly in his hand fanged frisbees banned hand it over she told him sternly the scowling boy handed over the snarling frisbee ducked under her arm and took off after his friends ron waited for him to vanish then tugged the frisbee from grip 
 
 excellent always wanted one of these 
 
 remonstration was drowned by a loud giggle lavender brown had apparently found remark highly amusing she continued to laugh as she passed them glancing back at ron over her shoulder ron looked rather pleased with himself 
 
 the ceiling of the great hall was serenely blue and streaked with frail wispy clouds just like the squares of sky visible through the high mullioned windows while they tucked into porridge and eggs and bacon harry and ron told hermione about their embarassing conversation with hagrid the previous evening 
 
 but he really think continue care of magical creatures she said looking distressed i mean when has any of us expressed you know any enthusiasm 
 
 it though innit said ron swallowing an entire fried egg whole we were the ones who made the most effort in classes because we like hagrid but he thinks we liked the stupid subject reckon going to go on to 
 
 neither harry nor hermione answered there was no need they knew perfectly well that nobody in their year would want to continue care of magical creatures they avoided eye and returned his cheery wave only when he left the staff table ten minutes later 
 
 after they had eaten they remained in their places awaiting professor descent from the staff table the distribution of class schedules was more complicated than usual this year for professor mcgonagall needed first to confirm that everybody had achieved the necessary grades to continue with their chosen 
 
 hermione was immediately cleared to continue with charms defense against the dark arts transfiguration herbology arithmancy ancient runes and potions and shot off to a first period ancient runes class without further ado neville took a little longer to sort out his round face was anxious as professor mcgonagall looked down his application and then consulted his results 
 
 herbology fine she said professor sprout will be delighted to see you back with an outstanding and you qualify for defense against the dark arts with exceeds expectations but the problem is transfiguration sorry longbottom but an acceptable really good enough to continue to level just think be able to cope with the coursework 
 
 neville hung his head professor mcgonagall peered at him through her square spectacles 
 
 why do you want to continue with transfiguration anyway never had the impression that you particularly enjoyed it 
 
 neville looked miserable and muttered something about my grandmother wants 
 
 hmph snorted professot mcgonagall high time your grandmother learned to be proud of the grandson got rather than the one she thinks she ought to haveparticularly after what happened at the ministry 
 
 neville turned very pink and blinked confusedly professor mcgonagall had never paid him a compliment before 
 
 sorry longbottom but i cannot let you into my class i see that you have an exceeds expectations in charm howeverwhy not try for a in charms 
 
 my grandmother thinks charms is a soft option mumbled neville 
 
 take charms said professor mcgonagall and i shall drop augusta a line reminding her that just because she failed her charms the subject is not necessarily worthless smiling slightly at the look of delighted incredulity on face professor mcgonagall tapped a blank schedule with the tip of her wand and handed it now carrying details of his new classes to neville 
 
 professor mcgonagall turned next to parvati patil whose first question was whether firenze the handsome centaur was still teaching divination 
 
 he and professor trelawney are dividing classes between them this year said professor mcgonagall a hint of disapproval in her voice it was common knowledge that she despised the subject of divination the sixth year is being taken by professor trelawney 
 
 parvati set off for divination five minutes later looking slightly crestfallen 
 
 so potter potter said professor mcgonagall consulting her notes as she turned to harry charms defense against the dark arts herbology transfiguration all fine i must say i was pleased with your transfiguration mark potter very pleased now why you applied to continue with potions i thought it was your ambition to become an auror 
 
 it was but you told me i had to get an outstanding in my professor 
 
 and so you did when professor snape was teaching the subject professor slughorn however is perfectly happy to accept students with exceeds expectations at do you wish to proceed with potions 
 
 yes said harry but i buy the books or any ingredients or anything 
 
 sure professor slughorn will be able to lend you some said professor mcgonagall very well potter here is your schedule oh by the waytwenty hopefuls have already put down their names for the gryffindor quidditch team i shall pass the list to you in due course and you can fix up trials at your leisure 
 
 a few minutes later ron was cleared to do the same subjects as harry and the two of them left the table together 
 
 look said ron delightedly gazing ar his schedule got a free period now and a free period after break and after lunch excellent 
 
 they returned to the common room which was empty apart from a half dozen seventh years including katie bell the only remaining member of the original gryffindor quidditch team that harry had joined in his first year 
 
 i thought get that well done she called over pointing at the captains badge on chest tell me when you call trials 
 
 be stupid said harry you need to try out i watched you play for five years 
 
 you start off like that she said warningly for all you know someone much better than me out there good teams have been ruined before now because captains just kept playing the old faces or letting in their friends 
 
 ron looked a little uncomfortable and began playing with the fanged frisbee hermione had taken from the student it zoomed around the common room snarling and attempting to take bites of the tapestry yellow eyes followed it and he hissed when it came too close 
 
 an hour later they reluctantly left the sunlit common room for the defense against the dark arts classroom four floors below hermione was already queuing outside carrying an armful of heavy books and looking 
 
 we got so much homework for runes she said anxiously when harry and ron joined her a essay two translations and got to read these by wednesday 
 
 shame yawned ron 
 
 you wait she said resentfully i bet snape gives us loads 
 
 the classroom door opened as she spoke and snape stepped into the corridor his sallow face framed as ever by two curtains of greasy black hair silence fell over the queue immediately 
 
 inside he said 
 
 harry looked around as they entered snape had imposed his personality upon the room already it was gloomier than usual as curtains had been drawn over the windows and was lit by candlelight new pictures adorned the walls many of them showing people who appeared to be in pain sporting grisly injuries or strangely contorted body parts nobody spoke as they settled down looking around at the shadowy gruesome pictures 
 
 i have not asked you to take out your books said snape closing the door and moving to face the class from behind his desk hermione hastily dropped her copy of confronting the faceless back into her bag and stowed it under her chair i wish to speak to you and i want your fullest attention 
 
 his black eyes roved over their upturned faces lingering for a fraction of a second longer on than anyone 
 
 you have had five teachers in this subject so far i believe 
 
 you believe like you watched them all come and go hoping be next thought harry scathingly 
 
 naturally these teachers will all have had their own methods and priorities given this confusion i am surprised so many of you scraped an in this subject i shall be even more surprised if all of you manage to keep up with the work which will be more advanced 
 
 snape set off around the edge of the room speaking now in a lower voice the class craned their necks to keep him in view 
 
 the dark arts said snape are many varied and eternal fighting them is like fighting a monster which each time a neck is severed sprouts a head even fiercer and cleverer than before you are fighting that which is unfixed mutating indestructible 
 
 harry stared at snape it was surely one thing to respect the dark arts as a dangerous enemy another to speak of them as snape was doing with a loving caress in his voice 
 
 your defenses said snape a little louder must therefore be as flexible and inventive as the arts you seek to undo these pictures he indicated a few of them as he swept past give a fair representation of what happens to those who suffer for instance the cruciatus curse he waved a hand toward a witch who was clearly shrieking in agony feel the kiss a wizard lying huddled and slumped against a wall or provoke the aggression of the inferius a bloody mass upon ground 
 
 has an inferius been seen then said parvati patil in a high pitched voice is it definite is he using them 
 
 the dark lord has used inferi in the past said snape which means you would be to assume he might use them again now 
 
 he set off again around the other side of the classroom toward his desk and again they watched him as he walked his dark robes billowing behind him 
 
 you are i believe complete novices in the use of spells what is the advantage of a spell 
 
 hand shot into the air snape took his time looking around at everybody else making sure he had no choice before saying curtly very wellmiss granger 
 
 your adversary has no warning about what kind of magic about to perform said hermione which gives you a advantage 
 
 an answer copied almost word for word from the standard book of spells grade six said snape dismissively over in the corner malfoy sniggered but correct in essentials yes those who progress in using magic without shouting incantations gain an element of surprise in their not all wizards can do this of course it is a question of concentration and mind power which some his gaze lingered maliciously upon harry once more lack 
 
 harry knew snape was thinking of their disastrous occlumency lessons of the previous year he refused to drop his gaze but glowered at snape until snape looked away 
 
 you will now divide snape went on into pairs one partner will attempt to jinx the other without speaking the other will attempt to repel the jinx in equal silence carry on 
 
 although snape did not know it harry had taught at least half the class everyone who had been a member of the how to perform a shield charm the previous year none of them had ever cast the charm without speaking however a reasonable amount of cheating ensued many people were merely whispering the incantation instead of saying it aloud typically ten minutes into the lesson hermione managed to repel muttered jinx without uttering a single word a feat that would surely have earned her twenty points for gryffindor from any reasonable teacher thought harry bitterly but which snape ignored he swept between them as they practiced looking just as much like an overgrown bat as ever lingering to watch harry and ron struggling with the task 
 
 ron who was supposed to be jinxing harry was purple in the face his lips tightly compressed to save himself from the temptation of muttering the incantation harry had his wand raised waiting on tenterhooks to repel a jinx that seemed unlikely ever to come 
 
 pathetic weasley said snape after a while herelet me show you 
 
 he turned his wand on harry so fast that harry reacted instinctively all thought of spells forgotten he yelled protego 
 
 his shield charm was so strong snape was knocked and hit a desk the whole class had looked around and now watched as snape righted himself scowling 
 
 do you remember me telling you we are practicing spells potter 
 
 yes said harry stiffly 
 
 yes sir 
 
 no need to call me sir professor the words had escaped him before he knew what he was saying several people gasped including hermione behind snape however ron dean and seamus grinned appreciatively 
 
 detention saturday night my office said snape i do not take cheek from anyone potter not even the chosen one 
 
 that was brilliant harry chortled ron once they were safely on their way to break a short while later 
 
 you really have said it said hermione frowning at ron what made you 
 
 he tried to jinx me in case you notice fumed harry i had enough of that during those occlumency lessons why he use another guinea pig for a change dumbledore playing at anyway letting him teach defense did you hear him talking about the dark arts he loves them all that unfixed indestructible stuff 
 
 well said hermione i thought he sounded a bit like you 
 
 like me 
 
 yes when you were telling us what like to face voldemort you said it just memorizing a bunch of spells you said it was just you and your brains and your gutswell that what snape was saying that it really comes down to being brave and 
 
 harry was so disarmed that she had thought his words as well worth memorizing as the standard book of spells that he did not argue 
 
 harry hey harry 
 
 harry looked around jack sloper one of the beaters on last gryffindor quidditch team was hurrying toward him holding a roll of parchment 
 
 for you panted sloper listen i heard the new captain you holding trials 
 
 not sure yet said harry thinking privately that sloper would be very lucky to get back on the team let you know 
 
 oh right i was hoping be this weekend 
 
 but harry was not listening he had just recognized the thin slanting writing on the parchment leaving sloper in he hurried away with ron and hermione unrolling the parchment as he went 
 
 dear harry 
 i would like to start our private lessons this saturday kindly come along to my office at eight i hope you are enjoying your first day back at school 
 yours sincerely 
 albus dumbledore 
 i enjoy acid pops 
 he enjoys acid pops said ron who had read the message over shoulder and was looking perplexed 
 
 the password to get past the gargoyle outside his study said harry in a low voice ha not going to be pleased i be able to do his detention 
 
 he ron and hermione spent the whole of break speculating on what dumbledore would teach harry ron thought it most likely to be spectacular jinxes and hexes of the type the death eaters would not know hermione said such things were illegal and thought it much more likely that dumbledore wanted to teach harry advanced defensive magic after break she went off to arithmancy while harry and ron returned to the common room where they grudgingly started homework this turned out to be so complex that they still had not finished when hermione joined them for their free period though she considerably speeded up the process they had only just finished when the bell rang for the double potions and they beat the familiar path down to the dungeon classroom that had for so long been 
 
 when they arrived in the corridor they saw that there were only a dozen people progressing to level crabbe and goyle had evidently failed to achieve the required grade but four slytherins had made it through including malfoy four ravenclaws were there and one hufflepuff ernie macmillan whom harry liked despite his rather pompous manner 
 
 harry ernie said portentously holding out his hand as harry approached get a chance to speak in defense against the dark arts this morning good lesson i thought but shield charms are old hat of course for us old lags and how are you ronhermione 
 
 before they could say more than fine the dungeon door opened and belly preceded him out of the door as they filed into the room his great walrus mustache curved above his beaming mouth and he greeted harry and zabini with particular enthusiasm 
 
 the dungeon was most unusually already full of vapors and odd smells harry ron and hermione sniffed interestedly as they passed large bubbling cauldrons the four slytherins took a table together as did the four ravenclaws this left harry ron and hermione to share a table with ernie they chose the one nearest a cauldron that was emitting one of the most seductive scents harry had ever inhaled somehow it reminded him simultaneously of treacle tart the woody smell of a broomstick handle and something flowery he thought he might have smelled at the burrow he found that he was breathing very slowly and deeply and that the fumes seemed to be filling him up like drink a great contentment stole over him he grinned across at ron who grinned back lazily 
 
 now then now then now then said slughorn whose massive outline was quivering through the many shimmering vapors scales out everyone and potion kits and forget your copies of advanced 
 
 sir said harry raising his hand 
 
 harry 
 
 i got a book or scales or ronwe realize be able to do the you see 
 
 ah yes professor mcgonagall did mention not to worry my dear boy not to worry at all you can use ingredients from the store cupboard today and sure we can lend you some scales and got a small stock of old books here do until you can write to flourish and blotts 
 
 slughorn strode over to a corner cupboard and after a foraging emerged with two very copies of advanced by libatius borage which he gave to harry and ron along with two sets of tarnished scales 
 
 now then said slughorn returning to the front of the class and inflating his already bulging chest so that the buttons on his waistcoat threatened to burst off prepared a few potions for you to have a look at just out of interest you know these are the kind of thing you ought to be able to make after completing your you ought to have heard of em even if you made em yet anyone tell me what this one is 
 
 he indicated the cauldron nearest the slytherin table harry raised himself slighty in his seat and saw what looked like plain water boiling away inside it 
 
 hand hit the air before anybody slughorn pointed at her 
 
 veritaserum a colorless odorless potion thar forces the drinker to tell the truth said hermione 
 
 very good very good said slughorn happily now he continued pointing at the cauldron nearest the ravenclaw table this one here is pretty well known featured in a few ministry leaflets lately too who can 
 
 hand was fastest once more 
 
 polyjuice potion sir she said 
 
 harry too had recognized the mudlike substance the second cauldron but did not resent hermione getting the credit for answering the question she after all was the one who had succeeded in making it back in their second year 
 
 excellent excellent now this one her yes my dear said slughorn now looking slightly bemused as hand punched the air again 
 
 amortentia 
 
 it is indeed ir seems almost foolish to ask said slughorn who was looking mightily impressed but i assume you know what it does 
 
 the most powerful love porion in the world said hermione 
 
 quite right you recognized it i suppose by its distinctive sheen 
 
 and the steam rising in characteristic spirals said hermione enthusiastically and supposed to smell differently to each of according to what attracts us and i can smell freshly mown grass and new parchment and 
 
 but she turned slightly pink and did not complete the sentence 
 
 may i ask your name my dear said slughorn ignoring embarrassment 
 
 hermione granger sir 
 
 granger granger can you possibly be related to hector who founded the most extraordinary society of potioneers 
 
 no i think so sir you see 
 
 harry saw malfoy lean close to nott and whisper something both of them sniggered but slughorn showed no dismay on the contrary he beamed and looked from hermione to harry who was sitting next to her 
 
 oho one of my best friends is and the best in our year assuming this is the very friend of whom you spoke harry 
 
 yes sir said harry 
 
 well well take twenty points for gryffindor miss granger said slughorn genially 
 
 malfoy looked rather as he had done the time hermione had punched him in the face hermione turned to harry with a radiant expression and whispered did you really tell him the best in the year oh harry 
 
 well so impressive about that whispered ron who for some reason looked annoyed you are the best in the told him so if asked me 
 
 hermione smiled but made a shushing gesture so that they could hear what slughorn was saying ron looked slightly disgruntled 
 
 amortentia really create love of course it is impossible to manufacture or imitate love no this will simply cause a powerful infatuation or obsession it is probably the most dangerous and powerful potion in this roomoh yes he said nodding gravely at malfoy and nott both of whom were smirking skeptically when you have seen as much of life as i have you will not underestimate the power of obsessive love 
 
 and now said slughorn it is time for us to start work 
 
 sir you told us in this one said ernie macmillan pointing at a small black cauldron standing on desk the potion within was splashing about merrily it was the color of molten gold and large drops were leaping like goldfish above the surface though not a particle had spilled 
 
 oho said slughorn again harry was sure that slughorn had not forgotten the potion at all but had waited to be asked for dramatic effect yes that well that one ladies and gentlemen is a most curious little potion called felix felicis i take it he turned smiling to look at hermione who had let out an audible gasp that you know what felix felicis does miss granger 
 
 liquid luck said hermione excitedly it makes you lucky 
 
 the whole class seemed to sit up a little straighter now all harry could see of malfoy was the back of his sleek blond head because he was at last giving slughorn his full and undivided attention 
 
 quite right take another ten points for gryffindor yes a funny little potion felix felicis said slughorn desperately tricky to make and disastrous to get wrong however if brewed correctly as this has been you will find that all your endeavors tend to succeed at least until the effects wear off 
 
 why people drink it all the time sir said terry boot eagerly 
 
 because if taken in excess it causes giddiness recklessness and dangerous overconfidence said slughorn too much of a good thing you know highly toxic in large quantities but taken sparingly and very occasionally 
 
 have you ever taken it sir asked michael corner with great interest 
 
 twice in my life said slughorn once when i was once when i was two tablespoonfuls taken with breakfast two perfect days 
 
 he gazed dreamily into the distance whether he was playacting or not thought harry the effect was good 
 
 and that said slughorn apparently coming back to earth is what i shall be offering as a prize in this lesson 
 
 there was silence in which every bubble and gurgle of the surrounding potions seemed magnified tenfold 
 
 one tiny bottle of felix felicis said slughorn taking a minuscule glass bottle with a cork in it out of his pocket and showing it to them all enough for twelve hours luck from dawn till dusk you will be lucky in everything you attempt 
 
 now i must give you warning that felix felicis is a banned substance in organized competition sporting events for instance examinations or elections so the winner is to use it on an ordinary day only and watch how that ordinary day becomes extraordinary 
 
 so said slughorn suddenly brisk how are you to win this fabulous prize well by turning to page ten of advanced potion making we have a little over an hour left to us which should be time for you to make a decent attempt at the draught of living death i know it is more complex than anything you have attempted before and i do not expect a perfect potion from anybody the person who does best however will win little felix here off you go 
 
 there was a scraping as everyone drew their cauldrons toward them and some loud clunks as people began adding weights to their scales but nobody spoke the concentration within the room was almost tangible harry saw malfoy riffling feverishly through his copy of advanced it could not have been clearer that malfoy really wanted that lucky day harry bent swiftly over the tattered book slughorn had lent him 
 
 to his annoyance he saw that the previous owner had scribbled all over the pages so that the margins were as black as the printed portions bending low to decipher the ingredients even here the previous owner had made annotations and crossed things out harry hurried off toward the store cupboard to find what he needed as he dashed back to his cauldron he saw malfoy cutting up valerian roots as fast as he could 
 
 everyone kept glancing around at what the rest of the class was doing this was both an advantage and a disadvantage of potions that it was hard to keep your work private within ten minutes the whole place was full of bluish steam hermione of course seemed to have progressed furthest her potion already resembled the smooth black liquid mentioned as the ideal halfway stage 
 
 having finished chopping his roots harry bent low over his book again it was really very irritating having to try and decipher the directions under all the stupid scribbles of the previous owner who for some reason had taken issue with the order to cut up the sopophorous bean and had written in the alternative instruction 
 
 crush with flat side of silver dagger releases juice better than cutting 
 
 sir i think you knew my grandfather abraxas malfoy harry looked up slughorn was just passing the slytherin table 
 
 yes said slughorn without looking at malfoy i was sorry to hear he had died although of course it unexpected dragon pox at his age 
 
 and he walked away harry bent back over his cauldron smirking he could tell that malfoy had expected to be treated like harry or zabini perhaps even hoped for some preferential treatment of the type he had learned to expect from snape it looked as though malfoy would have to rely on nothing but talent to win the bottle of felix felicis 
 
 the sopophorous bean was proving very difficult to cut up harry turned to hermione 
 
 can i borrow your silver knife 
 
 she nodded impatiently not taking her eyes off her potion which was still deep purple though according to the book ought to be turning a light shade of lilac by now 
 
 harry crushed his bean with the flat side of the dagger to his astonishment it immediately exuded so much juice he was amazed the shriveled bean could have held it all 
 
 hastily scooping it all into the cauldron he saw to his surprise that the potion immediately turned exactly the shade of lilac described by the textbook 
 
 his annoyance with the previous owner vanishing on the spot harry now squinted at the next line of instructions according the book he had to stir counterclockwise until the potion turned clear as water according to the addition the previous owner made however he ought to add a clockwise stir after every seventh counterclockwise stir could the old owner be right twice 
 
 harry stirred counterclockwise held his breath and stirred once clockwise the effect was immediate the potion turned pale pink 
 
 how are you doing that demanded hermione who was redfaced and whose hair was growing bushier and bushier in the fumes from her cauldron her potion was still resolutely purple 
 
 add a clockwise stir 
 
 no no the book says counterclockwise she snapped 
 
 harry shrugged and continued what he was doing seven stirs counterclockwise one clockwise pause seven stirs counterclockwise one stir clockwise 
 
 across the table ron was cursing fluently under his breath his potion looked like liquid licorice harry glanced around as far as he could see no one potion had turned as pale as his he felt elated something that had certainly never happened before in this dungeon 
 
 and up called slughorn stop stirring please 
 
 slughorn moved slowly among the tables peering into cauldrons he made no comment but occasionally gave the potions a stir or a sniff at last he reached the table where harry ron hermione and ernie were sitting he smiled ruefully at the tarlike substance in cauldron he passed over navy concoction potion he gave an approving nod then he saw and a look of incredulous delight spread over his face 
 
 the clear winner he cried to the dungeon excellent excellent harry good lord clear inherited your talent she was a dab hand at potions lily was here you are then here you areone bottle of felix felicis as promised and use it well 
 
 harry slipped the tiny bottle of golden liquid into his inner pocket feeling an odd combination of delight at the furious looks on the slytherins faces and guilt at the disappointed expression on ron looked simply dumbfounded 
 
 how did you do that he whispered to harry as they left the dungeon 
 
 got lucky i suppose said harry because malfoy was within earshot 
 
 once they were securely ensconced at the gryffindor table for dinner however he felt safe enough to tell them face became stonier with every word he uttered 
 
 i you think i cheated he finished aggravated by her expression 
 
 well it exactly your own work was it she said stiffly 
 
 he only followed different instructions to ours said ron been a catastrophe it but he took a risk and it paid off he heaved a sigh slughorn handed me that book but no i get the one no ever written on puked on by the look of page but 
 
 hang on said a voice close by left ear and he caught a sudden waft of that flowery smell he had picked up in dungeon he looked around and saw that ginny had joined them did i hear right been taking orders from something someone wrote in a book harry 
 
 she looked alarmed and angry harry knew what was on her mind at once 
 
 nothing he said reassuringly lowering his voice not like you know diary just an old textbook scribbled on 
 
 but doing what it says 
 
 i just tried a few of the tips written in the margins honestly ginny nothing funny 
 
 got a point said hermione perking up at once we ought to check that nothing odd about it i mean all these funny instructions who knows 
 
 hey said harry indignantly as she pulled his copy of advanced out of his bag and raised her wand 
 
 specialis revelio she said rapping it smartly on the front cover nothing whatsoever happened the book simply lay there looking old and dirty and 
 
 finished said harry irritably or want to wait and see if it does a few backflips 
 
 it seems all right said hermione still staring at the book suspiciously i mean it really does seem to be just a textbook 
 
 good then have it back said harry snatching it off the table but it slipped from his hand and landed open on the floor nobody else was looking harry bent low to retrieve the book and as he did so he saw something scribbled along the bottom of the back cover in the same small cramped handwriting as the instructions that had won him his bottle of felix felicis now safely hidden inside a pair of socks in his trunk upstairs
