 harry managed not to shout out but it was a close thing the little creature on the bed had large ears and bulging green eyes the size of tennis balls harry knew instantly that this was what had been watching him out of the garden hedge that morning 
 
 as they stared at each other harry heard voice from the hall 
 
 may i take your coats mr and mrs mason 
 
 the creature slipped off the bed and bowed so low that the end of its long thin nose touched the carpet harry noticed that it was wearing what looked like an old pillowcase with rips for arm and 
 
 er hello said harry nervously 
 
 harry potter said the creature in a voice harry was sure would carry down the stairs so long has dobby wanted to meet you sir such an honor it is

 dobby sir just dobby dobby the said the creature 
 
 oh really said harry er i want to be rude or anything but this a great time for me to have a in my bedroom 
 
 aunt petunias high false laugh sounded from the living room the elf hung his head

 oh yes sir said dobby earnestly dobby has come to tell you sir it is difficult sir dobby wonders where to begin 
 
 sit down said harry politely pointing at the bed 
 
 to his horror the elf burst into tears very noisy tears 
 
 down he wailed never never ever 
 
 harry thought he heard the voices downstairs falter 
 
 sorry he whispered i mean to offend you or anything 
 
 offend dobby choked the elf dobby has never been asked to sit down by a wizard like an equal 
 
 harry trying to say shh and look comforting at the same time ushered dobby back onto the bed where he sat hiccoughing looking like a large and very ugly doll at last he managed to control himself and sat with his great eyes fixed on harry in an expression of watery adoration 
 
 you have met many decent wizards said harry trying to cheer him up 
 
 dobby shook his head then without warning he leapt up and started banging his head furiously on the window shouting bad dobby bad dobby 
 
 what are you doing harry hissed springing up and pulling dobby back onto the bed hedwig had woken up with a particularly loud screech and was beating her wings wildly against the bars of her cage 
 
 dobby had to punish himself sir said the elf who had gone slightly dobby almost spoke ill of his family sir 
 
 your family 
 
 the wizard family dobby serves sir dobby is a bound to serve one house and one family forever

 dobby shuddered 
 
 oh no sir no dobby will have to punish himself most grievously for coming to see you sir dobby will have to shut his ears in the oven door for this if they ever knew sir 
 
 but they notice if you shut your ears in the oven door 
 
 dobby doubts it sir dobby is always having to punish himself for something sir they lets dobby get on with it sir sometimes they reminds me to do extra punishments 
 
 but why you leave escape 
 
 a must be set free sir and the family will never set dobby free dobby will serve the family until he dies sir 
 
 harry stared 
 
 and i thought i had it bad staying here for another four weeks he said this makes the dursleys sound almost human anyone help you i 
 
 almost at once harry wished he spoken dobby dissolved again into wails of gratitude 
 
 please harry whispered frantically please be quiet if the dursleys hear anything if they know here 
 
 harry potter asks if he can help dobby dobby has heard of your greatness sir but of your goodness dobby never knew 
 
 harry who was feeling distinctly hot in the face said whatever heard about my greatness is a load of rubbish not even top of my year at hogwarts hermione she 
 
 but he stopped quickly because thinking about hermione was painful 
 
 harry potter is humble and modest said dobby reverently his eyes aglow harry potter speaks not of his triumph over 
 
 voldemort said harry 
 
 dobby clapped his hands over his bat ears and moaned ah speak not the name sir speak not the name 
 
 sorry said harry quickly i know lots of people like it my friend ron 
 
 he stopped again thinking about ron was painful too 
 
 dobby leaned toward harry his eyes wide as headlights 
 
 dobby heard tell he said hoarsely that harry potter met the dark lord for a second time just weeks ago that harry potter escaped yet again 
 
 harry nodded and eyes suddenly shone with tears 
 
 ah sir he gasped dabbing his face with a corner of the grubby pillowcase he was wearing harry potter is valiant and bold he has braved so many dangers already but dobby has come to protect harry potter to warn him even if he does have to shut his ears in the oven door later harry potter must not go back to hogwarts 
 
 there was a silence broken only by the chink of knives and forks from downstairs and the distant rumble of uncle voice 
 
 harry stammered but got to go back term starts on september first all keeping me going you know what like here i belong here i belong in your world at hogwarts 
 
 no no no squeaked dobby shaking his head so hard his ears flapped harry potter must stay where he is safe he is too great too good to lose if harry potter goes back to hogwarts he will be in mortal danger 
 
 why said harry in surprise 
 
 there is a plot harry potter a plot to make most terrible things happen at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry this year whispered dobby suddenly trembling all over dobby has known it for months sir harry potter must not put himself in peril he is too important sir 
 
 what terrible things said harry at once plotting them 
 
 dobby made a funny choking noise and then banged his head frantically against the wall 
 
 all right cried harry grabbing the arm to stop him you tell me i understand but why are you warning me a sudden unpleasant thought struck him hang on this got anything to do with vol sorry with has it you could just shake or nod he added hastily as head tilted worryingly close to the wall again 
 
 slowly dobby shook his head 
 
 not not sir 
 
 but eyes were wide and he seemed to be trying to give harry a hint harry however was completely lost 
 
 he got a brother has he 
 
 dobby shook his head his eyes wider than ever 
 
 well then i think who else would have a chance of making horrible things happen at hogwarts said harry i mean dumbledore for one thing you know who dumbledore is you 
 
 dobby bowed his head 
 
 albus dumbledore is the greatest headmaster hogwarts has ever had dobby knows it sir dobby has heard powers rival those of at the height of his strength but sir voice dropped to an urgent whisper there are powers dumbledore powers no decent wizard 
 
 and before harry could stop him dobby bounded off the bed seized desk lamp and started beating himself around the head with earsplitting yelps 
 
 a sudden silence fell downstairs two seconds later harry heart thudding madly heard uncle vernon coming into the hall calling dudley must have left his television on again the little tyke 
 
 quick in the closet hissed harry stuffing dobby in shutting the door and flinging himself onto the bed just as the door handle turned 
 
 what the devil are you doing said uncle vernon through gritted teeth his face horribly close to just ruined the punch line of my japanese golfer joke one more sound and wish never been born boy 
 
 he stomped from the room 
 
 shaking harry let dobby out of the closet 
 
 see what like here he said see why got to go back to hogwarts the only place got well i think got friends 
 
 friends who even write to harry potter said dobby slyly 
 
 i expect just been wait a minute said harry frowning how do you know my friends been writing to me 
 
 dobby shuffled his feet 
 
 harry potter be angry with dobby dobby did it for the best 
 
 have you been stopping my letters 
 
 dobby has them here sir said the elf stepping nimbly out of reach he pulled a thick wad of envelopes from the inside of the pillowcase he was wearing harry could make out neat writing untidy scrawl and even a scribble that looked as though it was from the hogwarts gamekeeper hagrid 
 
 dobby blinked anxiously up at harry 
 
 harry potter be angry dobby hoped if harry potter thought his friends had forgotten him harry potter might not want to go back to school sir 
 
 harry listening he made a grab for the letters but dobby jumped out of reach 
 
 harry potter will have them sir if he gives dobby his word that he will not return to hogwarts ah sir this is a danger you must not face say you go back sir 
 
 no said harry angrily give me my 
 
 then harry potter leaves dobby no choice said the elf sadly 
 
 before harry could move dobby had darted to the bedroom door pulled it open and sprinted down the stairs 
 
 mouth dry stomach lurching harry sprang after him trying not to make a sound he jumped the last six steps landing catlike on the hall carpet looking around for dobby from the dining room he heard uncle vernon saying tell petunia that very funny story about those american plumbers mr mason been dying to hear 
 
 harry ran up the hall into the kitchen and felt his stomach disappear 
 
 aunt masterpiece of a pudding the mountain of cream and sugared violets was floating up near the ceiling on top of a cupboard in the corner crouched dobby 
 
 no croaked harry please kill me 
 
 harry potter must say not going back to school 
 
 dobby please 
 
 say it sir 
 
 i 
 
 dobby gave him a tragic look 
 
 then dobby must do it sir for harry own good 
 
 the pudding fell to the floor with a crash cream splattered the windows and walls as the dish shattered with a crack like a whip dobby vanished 
 
 there were screams from the dining room and uncle vernon burst into the kitchen to find harry rigid with shock covered from head to foot in aunt pudding 
 
 at first it looked as though uncle vernon would manage to gloss the whole thing over just our nephew very disturbed meeting strangers upsets him so we kept him upstairs he shooed the shocked masons back into the dining room promised harry he would flay him to within an inch of his life when the masons had left and handed him a mop aunt petunia dug some ice cream out of the freezer and harry still shaking started scrubbing the kitchen clean 
 
 uncle vernon might still have been able to make his deal if it been for the owl 
 
 aunt petunia was just passing around a box of mints when a huge barn owl swooped through the dining room window dropped a letter on mrs head and swooped out again mrs mason screamed like a banshee and ran from the house shouting about lunatics mr mason stayed just long enough to tell the dursleys that his wife was mortally afraid of birds of all shapes and sizes and to ask whether this was their idea of a joke 
 
 harry stood in the kitchen clutching the mop for support as uncle vernon advanced on him a demonic glint in his tiny eyes 
 
 read it he hissed evilly brandishing the letter the owl had delivered go on read it 
 
 harry took it it did not contain birthday greetings

 as you know underage wizards are not permitted to perform spells outside school and further spellwork on your part may lead to expulsion from said school decree for the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery paragraph c 
 
 we would also ask you to remember that any magical activity that risks notice by members of the non magical community muggles is a serious offense under section of the international confederation of of secrecy

 harry looked up from the letter and gulped 
 
 you tell us you allowed to use magic outside school said uncle vernon a mad gleam dancing in his eyes forgot to mention it slipped your mind i daresay 
 
 he was bearing down on harry like a great bulldog all his teeth bared well got news for you boy locking you up never going back to that school never and if you try and magic yourself out expel you 
 
 and laughing like a maniac he dragged harry back upstairs 
 
 uncle vernon was as bad as his word the following morning he paid a man to fit bars on window he himself fitted a in the bedroom door so that small amounts of food could be pushed inside three times a day they let harry out to use the bathroom morning and evening otherwise he was locked in his room around the clock 
 
 three days later the dursleys were showing no sign of relenting and harry see any way out of his situation he lay on his bed watching the sun sinking behind the bars on the window and wondered miserably what was going to happen to him 
 
 what was the good of magicking himself out of his room if hogwarts would expel him for doing it yet life at privet drive had reached an low now that the dursleys knew they going to wake up as fruit bats he had lost his only weapon dobby might have saved harry from horrible happenings at hogwarts but the way things were going probably starve to death anyway 
 
 the rattled and aunt petunias hand appeared pushing a bowl of canned soup into the room harry whose insides were aching with hunger jumped off his bed and seized it the soup was but he drank half of it in one gulp then he crossed the room to cage and tipped the soggy vegetables at the bottom of the bowl into her empty food tray she ruffled her feathers and gave him a look of deep disgust 
 
 no good turning your beak up at it all got said harry grimly 
 
 he put the empty bowl back on the floor next to the and lay back down on the bed somehow even hungrier than he had been before the soup 
 
 supposing he was still alive in another four weeks hat would happen if he turn up at hogwarts would someone be sent to see why he come back would they be able to make the dursleys let him go 
 
 the room was growing dark exhausted stomach rumbling mind spinning over the same unanswerable questions harry fell into an uneasy sleep 
 
 he dreamed that he was on show in a zoo with a card reading underage wizard attached to his cage people goggled through the bars at him as he lay starving and weak on a bed of straw he saw face in the crowd and shouted out asking for help but dobby called harry potter is safe there sir and vanished then the dursleys appeared and dudley rattled the bars of the cage laughing at him 
 
 stop it harry muttered as the rattling pounded in his sore head leave me alone cut it out trying to sleep 
 
 he opened his eyes moonlight was shining through the bars on the window and someone was goggling through the bars at him a someone 
 
 ron weasley was outside window

 harry went down to breakfast the next morning to find the three dursleys already sitting around the kitchen table they were watching a television a present for dudley who had been complaining loudly about the long walk between the fridge and the television in the living room dudley had spent most of the summer in the kitchen his piggy little eyes fixed on the screen and his five chins wobbling as he ate continually 
 
 harry sat down between dudley and uncle vernon a large beefy man with very little neck and a lot of mustache far from wishing harry a happy birthday none of the dursleys made any sign that they had noticed harry enter the room but harry was far too used to this to care he helped himself to a piece of toast and then looked up at the reporter on the television who was halfway through a report on an escaped convict 
 
 the public is warned that black is armed and extremely dangerous a special hot line has been set up and any sighting of black should be reported immediately 
 
 no need to tell us no good snorted uncle vernon staring over the top of his newspaper at the prisoner look at the state of him the filthy layabout look at his hair 
 
 he shot a nasty look sideways at harry whose untidy hair had always been a source of great annoyance to uncle vernon compared to the man on the television however whose gaunt face was surrounded by a matted tangle harry felt very well groomed indeed 
 
 the reporter had reappeared 
 
 the ministry of agriculture and fisheries will announce today 
 
 hang on barked uncle vernon staring furiously at the reporter you tell us where that escaped from what use is that lunatic could be coming up the street right now 
 
 aunt petunia who was bony and whipped around and peered intently out of the kitchen window harry knew aunt petunia would simply love to be the one to call the hot line number she was the nosiest woman in the world and spent most of her life spying on the boring neighbors 
 
 when will they learn said uncle vernon pounding the table with his large purple fist that the only way to deal with these people 
 
 very true said aunt petunia who was still squinting into next 
 
 uncle vernon drained his teacup glanced at his watch and added better be off in a minute petunia train gets in at ten 
 
 harry whose thoughts had been upstairs with the broomstick servicing kit was brought back to earth with an unpleasant bump 
 
 aunt marge he blurted out not coming here is she 
 
 aunt marge was uncle sister even though she was not a blood relative of whose mother had been aunt sister he had been forced to call her aunt all his life aunt marge lived in the country in a house with a large garden where she bred bulldogs she often stay at privet drive because she bear to leave her precious dogs but each of her visits stood out horribly vividly in mind 
 
 at fifth birthday party aunt margo had whacked harry around the shins with her walking stick to stop him from beating dudley at musical statues a few years later she had turned up at christmas with a computerized robot for dudley and a box of dog biscuits for harry on her last visit the year before harry started at hogwarts harry had accidentally trodden on the tail of her favorite dog ripper had chased harry out into the garden and up a tree and aunt marge had refused to call him off until past midnight the memory of this incident still brought tears of laughter to eyes 
 
 be here for a week uncle vernon snarled and while on the subject he pointed a fat finger threateningly at harry we need to get a few things straight before i go and collect her 
 
 dudley smirked and withdrew his gaze from the television watching harry being bullied by uncle vernon was favorite form of entertainment 
 
 firstly growled uncle vernon keep a civil tongue in your head when talking to marge 
 
 all right said harry bitterly if she does when talking to me 
 
 secondly said uncle vernon acting as though he had not heard reply as marge know anything about your abnormality i want any any funny stuff while here you behave yourself got me 
 
 i will if she does said harry through gritted teeth 
 
 and thirdly said uncle vernon his mean little eyes now slits in his great purple face told marge you attend st secure center for incurably criminal boys 
 
 what harry yelled 
 
 and be sticking to that story boy or be trouble spat uncle vernon 
 
 harry sat there and furious staring at uncle vernon hardly able to believe it aunt marge coming for a weeklong visit it was the worst birthday present the dursleys had ever given him including that pair of uncle old socks 
 
 well petunia said uncle vernon getting heavily to his feet be off to the station then want to come along for the ride dudders 
 
 no said dudley whose attention had returned to the television now that uncle vernon had finished threatening harry 
 
 got to make himself smart for his auntie said aunt petunia smoothing thick blond hair bought him a lovely new 
 
 uncle vernon clapped dudley on his porky shoulder 
 
 see you in a bit then he said and he left the kitchen 
 
 harry who had been sitting in a kind of horrified trance had a sudden idea abandoning his toast he got quickly to his feet and followed uncle vernon to the front door 
 
 uncle vernon was pulling on his car coat 
 
 not taking you he snarled as he turned to see harry watching him 
 
 like i wanted to come said harry coldly i want to ask you something 
 
 uncle vernon eyed him suspiciously 
 
 third years at hog at my school are allowed to visit the village sometimes said harry 
 
 so snapped uncle vernon taking his car keys from a hook next to the door 
 
 i need you to sign the permission form said harry in a rush 
 
 and why should i do that sneered uncle vernon 
 
 well said harry choosing his words carefully be hard work pretending to aunt marge i go to that st whatsits 
 
 st secure center for incurably criminal boys bellowed uncle vernon and harry was pleased to hear a definite note of panic in uncle voice 
 
 exactly said harry looking calmly up into uncle large purple face a lot to remember have to make it sound convincing i what if i accidentally let something slip 
 
 get the stuffing knocked out of you you roared uncle vernon advancing on harry with his fist raised but harry stood his ground 
 
 knocking the stuffing out of me make aunt marge forget what i could tell her he said grimly 
 
 uncle vernon stopped his fist still raised his face an ugly puce 
 
 but if you sign my permission form harry went on quickly i swear ill remember where supposed to go to school and ill act like a mug like normal and everything 
 
 harry could tell that uncle vernon was thinking it over even if his teeth were bared and a vein was throbbing in his temple 
 
 right he snapped finally i shall monitor your behavior carefully during visit if at the end of it toed the line and kept to the story ill sign your ruddy form 
 
 he wheeled around pulled open the front door and slammed it so hard that one of the little panes of glass at the top fell out 
 
 harry return to the kitchen he went back upstairs to his bedroom if he was going to act like a real muggle heed better start now slowly and sadly he gathered up all his presents and his birthday cards and hid them under the loose floorboard with his homework then he went to cage errol seemed to have recovered he and hedwig were both asleep heads under their wings harry sighed then poked them both awake 
 
 hedwig he said gloomily going to have to clear off for a week go with errol look after you ill write him a note explaining and look at me like that large amber eyes were reproachful not my fault the only way be allowed to visit hogsmeade with ron and hermione 
 
 ten minutes later errol and hedwig who had a note to ron bound to her leg soared out of the window and out of sight harry now feeling thoroughly miserable put the empty cage away inside the wardrobe 
 
 but harry have long to brood in next to no time aunt petunia was shrieking up the stairs for harry to come down and get ready to welcome their guest 
 
 do something about your hair aunt petunia snapped as he reached the hall 
 
 harry see the point of trying to make his hair lie flat aunt marge loved criticizing him so the untidier he looked the happier she would be 
 
 all too soon there was a crunch of gravel outside as uncle car pulled back into the driveway then the clunk of the car doors and footsteps on the garden path 
 
 get the door aunt petunia hissed at harry 
 
 a feeling of great gloom in his stomach harry pulled the door open 
 
 on the threshold stood aunt marge she was very like uncle vernon large beefy and she even had a mustache though not as bushy as his in one hand she held an enormous suitcase and tucked under the other was an old and bulldog 
 
 my dudders roared aunt marge my neffy poo 
 
 dudley came waddling down the hall his blond hair plastered flat to his fat head a bow tie just visible under his many chins aunt marge thrust the suitcase into stomach knocking the wind out of him seized dudley in a tight hug and planted a large kiss on his cheek 
 
 harry knew perfectly well that dudley only put up with aunt hugs because he was well paid for it and sure enough when they broke apart dudley had a crisp note clutched in his fat fist 
 
 petunia shouted aunt marge striding past harry as though he was a aunt marge and aunt petunia kissed or rather aunt marge bumped her large jaw against aunt petunias bony cheekbone 
 
 uncle vernon now came in smiling jovially as he shut the door 
 
 tea marge he said and what will ripper take 
 
 ripper can have some tea out of my saucer said aunt marge as they all proceeded into the kitchen leaving harry alone in the hall with the suitcase but harry complaining any excuse not to be with aunt marge was fine by him so he began to heave the case upstairs into the spare bedroom taking as long as he could 
 
 
 by the time he got back to the kitchen aunt marge had been supplied with tea and fruitcake and ripper was lapping noisily in the corner harry saw aunt petunia wince slightly as specks of tea and drool flecked her clean floor aunt petunia hated animals 
 
 looking after the other dogs marge uncle vernon asked 
 
 oh got colonel fubster managing them boomed aunt marge retired now good for him to have something to do but i leave poor old ripper he pines if away from me 
 
 ripper began to growl again as harry sat down this directed aunt attention to harry for the first time 
 
 so she barked still here are you 
 
 yes said harry 
 
 you say yes in that ungrateful tone aunt marge growled damn good of vernon and petunia to keep you have done it myself have gone straight to an orphanage if been dumped on my doorstep 
 
 harry was bursting to say that rather live in an orphanage than with the dursleys but the thought of the hogsmeade form stopped him he forced his face into a painful smile 
 
 you smirk at me boomed aunt marge i can see you improved since i last saw you i hoped school would knock some manners into you she took a large gulp of tea wiped her mustache and said where is it that you send him again vernon 
 
 st said uncle vernon promptly a institution for hopeless cases 
 
 i see said aunt marge do they use the cane at st boy she barked across the table 
 
 er 
 
 uncle vernon nodded curtly behind aunt back 
 
 yes said harry then feeling he might as well do the thing properly he added all the time 
 
 excellent said aunt marge i have this nonsense about not hitting people who deserve it a good thrashing is needed in cases out of a hundred have you been beaten often 
 
 oh yeah said harry loads of times 
 
 aunt marge narrowed her eyes 
 
 i still like your tone boy she said if you can speak of your beatings in that casual way they clearly hitting you hard enough petunia write if i were you make it clear that you approve the use of extreme force in this case 
 
 perhaps uncle vernon was worried that harry might forget their bargain in any case he changed the subject abruptly 
 
 heard the news this morning marge what about that escaped prisoner eh 
 
 
 
 as aunt marge started to make herself at home harry caught himself thinking almost longingly of life at number four without her uncle vernon and aunt petunia usually encouraged harry to stay out of their way which harry was only too happy to do aunt marge on the other hand wanted harry under her eye at all times so that she could boom out suggestions for his improvement she delighted in comparing harry with dudley and took huge pleasure in buying dudley expensive presents while glaring at harry as though daring him to ask why he got a present too she also kept throwing out dark hints about what made harry such an unsatisfactory person 
 
 you blame yourself for the way the turned out vernon she said over lunch on the third day if something rotten on the inside nothing anyone can do about it 
 
 harry tried to concentrate on his food but his hands shook and his face was starting to burn with anger remember the form he told himself think about hogsmeade say anything rise 
 
 aunt marge reached for her glass of wine 
 
 one of the basic rules of breeding she said you see it all the time with dogs if something wrong with the bitch be something wrong with the pup 
 
 at that moment the wineglass aunt marge was holding exploded in her hand shards of glass flew in every direction and aunt marge sputtered and blinked her great ruddy face dripping 
 
 marge squealed aunt petunia marge are you all right 
 
 not to worry grunted aunt marge mopping her face with her napkin must have squeezed it too hard did the same thing at colonel the other day no need to fuss petunia i have a very firm grip 
 
 but aunt petunia and uncle vernon were both looking at harry suspiciously so he decided better skip dessert and escape from the table as soon as he could 
 
 outside in the hall he leaned against the wall breathing deeply it had been a long time since lost control and made something explode he afford to let it happen again the hogsmeade form the only thing at stake if he carried on like that be in trouble with the ministry of magic 
 
 harry was still an underage wizard and he was forbidden by wizard law to do magic outside school his record exactly clean either only last summer gotten an official warning that had stated quite clearly that if the ministry got wind of any more magic in privet drive harry would face expulsion from hogwarts 
 
 he heard the dursleys leaving the table and hurried upstairs out of the way 
 
 
 
 harry got through the next three days by forcing himself to think about his handbook of broomcare whenever aunt marge started on him this worked quite well though it seemed to give him a glazed look because aunt marge started voicing the opinion that he was mentally subnormal 
 
 at last at long last the final evening of stay arrived aunt petunia cooked a fancy dinner and uncle vernon uncorked several bottles of wine they got all the way through the soup and the salmon without a single mention of faults during the lemon meringue pie uncle vernon bored them a with a long talk about grunnings his company then aunt petunia made coffee and uncle vernon brought out a bottle of brandy 
 
 can i tempt you marge 
 
 aunt marge had already had quite a lot of wine her huge face was very red 
 
 just a small one then she chuckled a bit more than thatand a bit the ticket 
 
 dudley was eating his fourth slice of pie aunt petunia was sipping coffee with her little finger sticking out harry really wanted to disappear into his bedroom but he met uncle angry little eyes and knew he would have to sit it out 
 
 aah said aunt marge smacking her lips and putting the empty brandy glass back down excellent nosh petunia normally just a for me of an evening with twelve dogs to look after she burped richly and patted her great tweed stomach pardon me but i do like to see a boy she went on winking at dudley be a man dudders like your father yes have a spot more brandy vernon 
 
 now this one here 
 
 she jerked her head at harry who felt his stomach clench the handbook he thought quickly 
 
 this got a mean runty look about him you get that with dogs i had colonel fubster drown one last year ratty little thing it was weak underbred 
 
 harry was trying to remember page twelve of his book a charm to cure reluctant reversers 
 
 it all comes down to blood as i was saying the other day bad blood will out now saying nothing against your family petunia she patted aunt bony hand with her one but your sister was a bad egg they turn up in the best families then she ran off with a wastrel and the result right in front of us 
 
 harry was staring at his plate a funny ringing in his ears grasp your broom firmly by the tail he thought but he remember what came next aunt voice seemed to be boring into him like one of uncle drills 
 
 this potter said aunt marge loudly seizing the brandy bottle and splashing more into her glass and over the tablecloth you never told me what he did 
 
 uncle vernon and aunt petunia were looking extremely tense dudley had even looked up from his pie to gape at his parents 
 
 he work said uncle vernon with half a glance at harry unemployed 
 
 as i expected said aunt marge taking a huge swig of brandy and wiping her chin on her sleeve a lazy scrounger who 
 
 he was not said harry suddenly the table went very quiet harry was shaking all over he had never felt so angry in his life 
 
 more brandy yelled uncle vernon who had gone very white he emptied the bottle into aunt glass you boy he snarled at harry go to bed go on 
 
 no vernon hiccuped aunt marge holding up a hand her tiny bloodshot eyes fixed on go on boy go on proud of your parents are you they go and get themselves killed in a car crash drunk i expect 
 
 they die in a car crash said harry who found himself on his feet 
 
 they died in a car crash you nasty little liar and left you to be a burden on their decent hardworking relatives screamed aunt marge swelling with fury you are an insolent ungrateful little 
 
 but aunt marge suddenly stopped speaking for a moment it looked as though words had failed her she seemed to be swelling with inexpressible anger but the swelling stop her great red face started to expand her tiny eyes bulged and her mouth stretched too tightly for speech next second several buttons had just burst from her tweed jacket and pinged off the walls she was inflating like a monstrous balloon her stomach bursting free of her tweed waistband each of her fingers blowing up like a salami 
 
 marge yelled uncle vernon and aunt petunia together as aunt whole body began to rise off her chair toward the ceiling she was entirely round now like a vast life buoy with piggy eyes and her hands and feet stuck out weirdly as she drifted up into the air making apoplectic popping noises ripper came skidding into the room barking madly 
 
 nooooooo 
 
 uncle vernon seized one of feet and tried to pull her down again but was almost lifted from the floor himself a second later ripper leapt forward and sank his teeth into uncle leg 
 
 harry tore from the dining room before anyone could stop him heading for the cupboard under the stairs the cupboard door burst magically open as he reached it in seconds he had heaved his trunk to the front door he sprinted upstairs and threw himself under the bed wrenching up the loose floorboard and grabbed the pillowcase full of his books and birthday presents he wriggled out seized empty cage and dashed back downstairs to his trunk just as uncle vernon burst out of the dining room his trouser leg in bloody tatters 
 
 come back in here he bellowed come back and put her right 
 
 but a reckless rage had come over harry he kicked his trunk open pulled out his wand and pointed it at uncle vernon 
 
 she deserved it harry said breathing very fast she deserved what she got you keep away from me 
 
 he fumbled behind him for the latch on the door 
 
 going harry said had enough 
 
 and in the next moment he was out in the dark quiet street heaving his heavy trunk behind him cage under his arm 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the prisoner of azkaban 
 

lionfish nov chapter two aunt big mistakecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry went down to breakfast the next morning to find the three dursleys already sitting around the kitchen table they were watching a television a present for dudley who had been complaining loudly about the long walk between the fridge and the television in the living room dudley had spent most of the summer in the kitchen his piggy little eyes fixed on the screen and his five chins wobbling as he ate continually 
 
 harry sat down between dudley and uncle vernon a large beefy man with very little neck and a lot of mustache far from wishing harry a happy birthday none of the dursleys made any sign that they had noticed harry enter the room but harry was far too used to this to care he helped himself to a piece of toast and then looked up at the reporter on the television who was halfway through a report on an escaped convict 
 
 the public is warned that black is armed and extremely dangerous a special hot line has been set up and any sighting of black should be reported immediately 
 
 no need to tell us no good snorted uncle vernon staring over the top of his newspaper at the prisoner look at the state of him the filthy layabout look at his hair 
 
 he shot a nasty look sideways at harry whose untidy hair had always been a source of great annoyance to uncle vernon compared to the man on the television however whose gaunt face was surrounded by a matted tangle harry felt very well groomed indeed 
 
 the reporter had reappeared 
 
 the ministry of agriculture and fisheries will announce today 
 
 hang on barked uncle vernon staring furiously at the reporter you tell us where that escaped from what use is that lunatic could be coming up the street right now 
 
 aunt petunia who was bony and whipped around and peered intently out of the kitchen window harry knew aunt petunia would simply love to be the one to call the hot line number she was the nosiest woman in the world and spent most of her life spying on the boring neighbors 
 
 when will they learn said uncle vernon pounding the table with his large purple fist that the only way to deal with these people 
 
 very true said aunt petunia who was still squinting into next 
 
 uncle vernon drained his teacup glanced at his watch and added better be off in a minute petunia train gets in at ten 
 
 harry whose thoughts had been upstairs with the broomstick servicing kit was brought back to earth with an unpleasant bump 
 
 aunt marge he blurted out not coming here is she 
 
 aunt marge was uncle sister even though she was not a blood relative of whose mother had been aunt sister he had been forced to call her aunt all his life aunt marge lived in the country in a house with a large garden where she bred bulldogs she often stay at privet drive because she bear to leave her precious dogs but each of her visits stood out horribly vividly in mind 
 
 at fifth birthday party aunt margo had whacked harry around the shins with her walking stick to stop him from beating dudley at musical statues a few years later she had turned up at christmas with a computerized robot for dudley and a box of dog biscuits for harry on her last visit the year before harry started at hogwarts harry had accidentally trodden on the tail of her favorite dog ripper had chased harry out into the garden and up a tree and aunt marge had refused to call him off until past midnight the memory of this incident still brought tears of laughter to eyes 
 
 be here for a week uncle vernon snarled and while on the subject he pointed a fat finger threateningly at harry we need to get a few things straight before i go and collect her 
 
 dudley smirked and withdrew his gaze from the television watching harry being bullied by uncle vernon was favorite form of entertainment 
 
 firstly growled uncle vernon keep a civil tongue in your head when talking to marge 
 
 all right said harry bitterly if she does when talking to me 
 
 secondly said uncle vernon acting as though he had not heard reply as marge know anything about your abnormality i want any any funny stuff while here you behave yourself got me 
 
 i will if she does said harry through gritted teeth 
 
 and thirdly said uncle vernon his mean little eyes now slits in his great purple face told marge you attend st secure center for incurably criminal boys 
 
 what harry yelled 
 
 and be sticking to that story boy or be trouble spat uncle vernon 
 
 harry sat there and furious staring at uncle vernon hardly able to believe it aunt marge coming for a weeklong visit it was the worst birthday present the dursleys had ever given him including that pair of uncle old socks 
 
 well petunia said uncle vernon getting heavily to his feet be off to the station then want to come along for the ride dudders

 come back in here he bellowed come back and put her right 
 
 but a reckless rage had come over harry he kicked his trunk open pulled out his wand and pointed it at uncle vernon 
 
 she deserved it harry said breathing very fast she deserved what she got you keep away from me 
 
 he fumbled behind him for the latch on the door 
 
 going harry said had enough 
 
 and in the next moment he was out in the dark quiet street heaving his heavy trunk behind him cage under his arm

lionfish nov chapter two the scarcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry lay flat on his back breathing hard as though he had been running he had awoken from a vivid dream with his hands pressed over his face the old scar on his forehead which was shaped like a bolt of lightning was burning beneath his fingers as though someone had just pressed a wire to his skin 
 
 he sat up one hand still on his scar the other hand reaching out in the darkness for his glasses which were on the bedside table he put them on and his bedroom came into clearer focus lit by a faint misty orange light that was filtering through the curtains from the street lamp outside the window 
 
 harry ran his fingers over the scar again it was still painful he turned on the lamp beside him scrambled out of bed crossed the room opened his wardrobe and peered into the mirror on the inside of the door a skinny boy of fourteen looked back at him his bright green eyes puzzled under his untidy black hair he examined the scar of his reflection more closely it looked normal but it was still stinging 
 
 harry tried to recall what he had been dreaming about before he had awoken it had seemed so realthere had been two people he knew and one he concentrated hard frowning trying to remember 
 
 the dim picture of a darkened room came to himthere had been a snake on a hearth ruga small man called peter nicknamed wormtailand a cold high voicethe voice of lord voldemort harry felt as though an ice cube had slipped down into his stomach at the very thought 
 
 he closed his eyes tightly and tried to remember what voldemort had looked like but it was impossibleall harry knew was that at the moment when chair had swung around and he harry had seen what was sitting in it he had felt a spasm of horror which had awoken himor had that been the pain in his scar 
 
 and who had the old man been for there had definitely been an old man harry had watched him fall to the ground it was all becoming confused harry put his face into his hands blocking out his bedroom trying to hold on to the picture of that dimly lit room but it was like trying to keep water in his cupped hands the details were now trickling away as fast as he tried to hold on to themvoldemort and wormtail had been talking about someone they had killed though harry could not remember the nameand they had been plotting to kill someone elsehim 
 
 harry took his face out of his hands opened his eyes and stared around his bedroom as though expecting to see something unusual there as it happened there was an extraordinary number of unusual things in this room a large wooden trunk stood open at the foot of his bed revealing a cauldron broomstick black robes and assorted spellbooks rolls of parchment littered that part of his desk that was not taken up by the large empty cage in which his snowy owl hedwig usually perched on the floor beside his bed a book lay open harry had been reading it before he fell asleep last night the pictures in this book were all moving men in bright orange robes were zooming in and out of sight on broomsticks throwing a red ball to one another 
 
 harry walked over to the book picked it up and watched one of the wizards score a spectacular goal by putting the ball through a hoop then he snapped the book shut even quidditch in opinion the best sport in the world distract him at the moment he placed flying with the cannons on his bedside table crossed to the window and drew back the curtains to survey the street below 
 
 privet drive looked exactly as a respectable suburban street would be expected to look in the early hours of saturday morning all the curtains were closed as far as harry could see through the darkness there a living creature in sight not even a cat 
 
 and yetand yetharry went restlessly back to the bed and sat down on it running a finger over his scar again it the pain that bothered him harry was no stranger to pain and injury he had lost all the bones from his right arm once and had them painfully regrown in a night the same arm had been pierced by a venomous fang not long afterward only last year harry had fallen fifty feet from an airborne broomstick he was used to bizarre accidents and injuries they were unavoidable if you attended hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry and had a knack for attracting a lot of trouble 
 
 no the thing that was bothering harry was the last time his scar had hurt him it had been because voldemort had been close bybut voldemort be here nowthe idea of voldemort lurking in privet drive was absurd impossible 
 
 harry listened closely to the silence around him was he half expecting to hear the creak of a stair or the swish of a cloak and then he jumped slightly as he heard his cousin dudley give a tremendous grunting snore from the next room 
 
 harry shook himself mentally he was being stupid there was no one in the house with him except uncle vernon aunt petunia and dudley and they were plainly still asleep their dreams untroubled and painless 
 
 asleep was the way harry liked the dursleys best it as though they were ever any help to him awake uncle vernon aunt petunia and dudley were only living relatives they were muggles who hated and despised magic in any form which meant that harry was about as welcome in their house as dry rot they had explained away long absences at hogwarts over the last three years by telling everyone that he went to st secure center for incurably criminal boys they knew perfectly well that as an underage wizard harry allowed to use magic outside hogwarts but they were still apt to blame him for anything that went wrong about the house harry had never been able to confide in them or tell them anything about his life in the wizarding world the very idea of going to them when they awoke and telling them about his scar hurting him and about his worries about voldemort was laughable 
 
 and yet it was because of voldemort that harry had come to live with the dursleys in the first place if it been for voldemort harry would not have had the lightning scar on his forehead if it been for voldemort harry would still have had parents 
 
 harry had been a year old the night that voldemort the most powerful dark wizard for a century a wizard who had been gaining power steadily for eleven years arrived at his house and killed his father and mother voldemort had then turned his wand on harry he had performed the curse that had disposed of many witches and wizards in his steady rise to power and incredibly it had not worked instead of killing the small boy the curse had rebounded upon voldemort harry had survived with nothing but a cut on his forehead and voldemort had been reduced to something barely alive his powers gone his life almost extinguished voldemort had fled the terror in which the secret community of witches and wizards had lived for so long had lifted followers had disbanded and harry potter had become famous 
 
 it had been enough of a shock for harry to discover on his eleventh birthday that he was a wizard it had been even more disconcerting to find out that everyone in the hidden wizarding world knew his name harry had arrived at hogwarts to find that heads turned and whispers followed him wherever he went but he was used to it now at the end of this summer he would be starting his fourth year at hogwarts and harry was already counting the days until he would be back at the castle again 
 
 but there was still a fortnight to go before he went back to school he looked hopelessly around his room again and his eye paused on the birthday cards his two best friends had sent him at the end of july what would they say if harry wrote to them and told them about his scar hurting 
 
 at once hermione voice seemed to fill his head shrill and panicky 
 
 your scar hurt harry really seriouswrite to professor dumbledore nd go and check common magical ailments and afflictionsmaybe something in there about curse scars 
 
 yes that would be advice go straight to the headmaster of hogwarts and in the meantime consult a book harry stared out of the window at the inky sky he doubted very much whether a book could help him now as far as he knew he was the only living person to have survived a curse like it was highly unlikely therefore that he would find his symptoms listed in common magical ailments and afflictions as for informing the headmaster harry had no idea where dumbledore went during the summer holidays he amused himself for a moment picturing dumbledore with his long silver beard full length robes and pointed hat stretched out on a beach somewhere rubbing suntan lotion onto his long crooked nose wherever dumbledore was though harry was sure that hedwig would be able to find him owl had never yet failed to deliver a letter to anyone even without an address but what would he write 
 
 dear professor dumbledore sorry to bother you but my scar hurt this morning yours sincerely harry potter 
 
 even inside his head the words sounded stupid 
 
 and so he tried to imagine his other best friend ron reaction and in a moment red hair and freckled face seemed to swim before harry wearing a bemused expression 
 
 your scar hurt butbut be near you now can he i know you be trying to do you in again be i dunno harry maybe curse scars always twinge a ask dad 
 
 mr weasley was a fully qualified wizard who worked in the misuse of muggle artifacts office at the ministry of magic but he have any particular expertise in the matter of curses as far as harry knew in any case harry like the idea of the whole weasley family knowing that he harry was getting jumpy about a few moments pain mrs weasley would fuss worse than hermione and fred and george sixteen year old twin brothers might think harry was losing his nerve the weasleys were favorite family in the world he was hoping that they might invite him to stay any time now ron had mentioned something about the quidditch world cup and he somehow want his visit punctuated with anxious inquiries about his scar 
 
 harry kneaded his forehead with his knuckles what he really wanted and it felt almost shameful to admit it to himself was someone like someone like a parent an adult wizard whose advice he could ask without feeling stupid someone who cared about him who had had experience with dark magic 
 
 and then the solution came to him it was so simple and so obvious that he believe it had taken so long sirius 
 
 harry leapt up from the bed hurried across the room and sat down at his desk he pulled a piece of parchment toward him loaded his quill with ink wrote dear sirius then paused wondering how best to phrase his problem still marveling at the fact that he thought of sirius straight away but then perhaps it so surprising after all he had only found out that sirius was his godfather two months ago 
 
 there was a simple reason for complete absence from life until then sirius had been in azkaban the terrifying wizard jail guarded by creatures called dementors sightless fiends who had come to search for sirius at hogwarts when he had escaped yet sirius had been innocent the murders for which he had been convicted had been committed by wormtail supporter whom nearly everybody now believed dead harry ron and hermione knew otherwise however they had come with wormtail only the previous year though only professor dumbledore had believed their story 
 
 for one glorious hour harry had believed that he was leaving the dursleys at last because sirius had offered him a home once his name had been cleared but the chance had been snatched away from him wormtail had escaped before they could take him to the ministry of magic and sirius had had to flee for his life harry had helped him escape on the back of a hippogriff called buckbeak and since then sirius had been on the run the home harry might have had if wormtail had not escaped had been haunting him all summer it had been doubly hard to return to the dursleys knowing that he had so nearly escaped them forever 
 
 nevertheless sirius had been of some help to harry even if he be with him it was due to sirius that harry now had all his school things in his bedroom with him the dursleys had never allowed this before their general wish of keeping harry as miserable as possible coupled with their fear of his powers had led them to lock his school trunk in the cupboard under the stairs every summer prior to this but their attitude had changed since they had found out that harry had a dangerous murderer for a godfather for harry had conveniently forgotten to tell them that sirius was innocent 
 
 harry had received two letters from sirius since he had been back at privet drive both had been delivered not by owls as was usual with wizards but by large brightly colored tropical birds hedwig had not approved of these flashy intruders she had been most reluctant to allow them to drink from her water tray before flying off again harry on the other hand had liked them they put him in mind of palm trees and white sand and he hoped that wherever sirius was sirius never said in case the letters were intercepted he was enjoying himself somehow harry found it hard to imaging dementors surviving for long in bright sunlight perhaps that was why sirius had gone south letters which were now hidden beneath the highly useful loose floorboards under bed sounded cheerful and in both of them he had reminded harry to call on him if ever harry needed to well he needed to right now all right 
 
 lamp seemed to grow dimmer as the cold gray light that precedes sunrise slowly crept into the room finally when the sun had risen when his bedroom walls had turned gold and when sounds of movement could be heard from uncle vernon and aunt room harry cleared his desk of crumpled pieces of parchment and reread his finished letter 
 
 dear sirius 
 thanks for your last letter that bird was enormous it could hardly get through my window things are the same as usual here diet going too well my aunt found him smuggling doughnuts into his room yesterday they told him have to cut his pocket money if he keeps doing it so he got really angry and chucked his playstation out of the window a sort of computer thing you can play games on bit stupid really now he even got part three to take his mind off things 
 okay mainly because the dursleys are terrified you might turn up and turn them all into bats if i ask you to 
 a weird thing happened this morning though my scar hurt again last time that happened it was because voldemort was at hogwarts but i reckon he can be anywhere near me now can he do you know if curse scars sometimes hurt years afterward 
 send this with hedwig when she gets back off hunting at the moment say hello to buckbeak for me 
 harry 
 yes thought harry that looked all right there was no point putting in the dream he want it to look as though he was too worried he folded up the parchment and laid it aside on his desk ready for when hedwig returned then he got to his feet stretched and opened his wardrobe once more without glancing at his reflection he started to get dressed before going down to breakfast

 what said harry blankly 
 
 he left said mrs figg wringing her hands left to see someone about a batch of cauldrons that fell off the back of a broom i told him flay him alive if he went and now look dementors just lucky i put mr tibbles on the case but we got time to stand around hurry now got to get you back oh the trouble this is going to cause i will kill him 
 
 but 
 
 the revelation that his batty old neighbour knew what dementors were was almost as big a shock to harry as meeting two of them down the alleyway a witch 
 
 a squib as mundungus knows full well so how on earth was i supposed to help you fight off dementors he left you completely without cover when warned him 
 
 this mundungus has been following me hang onit was him he disapparated from the front of my house 
 
 yes yes yes but luckily stationed mr tibbles under a car just in case and mr tibbles came and warned me but by the time i got to your house gone and nowoh dumbledore going to say you she shrieked at dudley still supine on the alley floor get your fat bottom off the ground quick 
 
 you know dumbledore said harry staring at her 
 
 of course i know dumbledore who know dumbledore but come on be no help if they come back never so much as transfigured a teabag 
 
 she stooped down seized one of massive arms in her wizened hands and tugged 
 
 get up you useless lump get up 
 
 but dudley either could not or would not move he remained on the ground trembling and his mouth shut very tight 
 
 do it harry took hold of arm and heaved with an enormous effort he managed to hoist him to his feet dudley seemed to be on the point of fainting his small eyes were rolling in their sockets and sweat was beading his face the moment harry let go of him he swayed dangerously 
 
 hurry up said mrs figg hysterically 
 
 harry pulled one of massive arms around his own shoulders and dragged him towards the road sagging slightly under the weight mrs figg tottered along in front of them peering anxiously around the corner 
 
 keep your wand out she told harry as they entered wisteria walk never mind the statute of secrecy now going to be hell to pay anyway we might as well be hanged for a dragon as an egg talk about the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery this was exactly what dumbledore was afraid that at the end of the street oh just mr prentice put your wand away boy i keep telling you no use 
 
 it was not easy to hold a wand steady and haul dudley along at the same time harry gave his cousin an impatient dig in the ribs but dudley seemed to have lost all desire for independent movement he was slumped on shoulder his large feet dragging along the ground 
 
 why you tell me a squib mrs figg asked harry panting with the effort to keep walking all those times i came round your housewhy you say anything 
 
 orders i was to keep an eye on you but not say anything you were too young sorry i gave you such a miserable time harry but the dursleys would never have let you come if thought you enjoyed it it easy you know but oh my word she said tragically wringing her hands once more when dumbledore hears about thishow could mundungus have left he was supposed to be on duty until midnightwhere is he how am i going to tell dumbledore happened i apparate 
 
 got an owl you can borrow her harry groaned wondering whether his spine was going to snap under weight 
 
 harry you understand dumbledore will need to act as quickly as possible the ministry have their own ways of detecting underage magic know already you mark my words 
 
 but i was getting rid of dementors i had to use going to be more worried about what dementors were doing floating around wisteria walk surely 
 
 oh my dear i wish it were so but afraid mundungus fletcher i am going to kill you 
 
 there was a loud crack and a strong smell of drink mingled with stale tobacco filled the air as a squat unshaven man in a tattered overcoat materialised right in front of them he had short bandy legs long straggly ginger hair and bloodshot baggy eyes that gave him the doleful look of a basset hound he was also clutching a silvery bundle that harry recognised at once as an invisibility cloak 
 
 s up figgy he said staring from mrs figg to harry and dudley what appened to staying undercover 
 
 give you undercover cried mrs figg dementors you useless skiving sneak thief 
 
 dementors repeated mundungus aghast dementors here 
 
 yes here you worthless pile of bat droppings here shrieked mrs figg dementors attacking the boy on your watch 
 
 blimey said mundungus weakly looking from mrs figg to harry and back again blimey i 
 
 and you off buying stolen cauldrons i tell you not to go i 
 
 iwell i mundungus looked deeply uncomfortable it it was a very good business opportunity see 
 
 mrs figg raised the arm from which her string bag dangled and whacked mundungus around the face and neck with it judging by the clanking noise it made it was full of cat food 
 
 ouchgerroff gerroff you mad old bat gotta tell dumbledore 
 
 yesthey have yelled mrs figg swinging the bag of cat food at every bit of mundungus she could reach andithadbetterbeyouandyoucantell 
 
 keep your airnet on said mundungus his arms over his head cowering going going 
 
 and with another loud crack he vanished 
 
 i hope dumbledore murders him said mrs figg furiously now come on harry what are you waiting for 
 
 harry decided not to waste his remaining breath on pointing out that he could barely walk under bulk he gave the dudley a heave and staggered onwards 
 
 take you to the door said mrs figg as they turned into privet drive just in case there are more of them around oh my word what a catastrophe and you had to fight them off yourself and dumbledore said we were to keep you from doing magic at all costs well no good crying over spilt potion i suppose but the among the pixies now 
 
 so harry panted been having me followed 
 
 of course he has said mrs figg impatiently did you expect him to let you wander around on your own after what happened in june good lord boy they told me you were intelligent right get inside and stay there she said as they reached number four i expect someone will be in touch with you soon enough 
 
 what are you going to do asked harry quickly 
 
 going straight home said mrs figg staring around the dark street and shuddering need to wait for more instructions just stay in the house goodnight 
 
 hang on go yet i want to know 
 
 but mrs figg had already set off at a trot carpet slippers flopping string bag clanking 
 
 wait harry shouted after her he had a million questions to ask anyone who was in contact with dumbledore but within seconds mrs figg was swallowed by the darkness scowling harry readjusted dudley on his shoulder and made his slow painful way up number garden path 
 
 the hall light was on harry stuck his wand back inside the waistband of his jeans rang the bell and watched aunt outline grow larger and larger oddly distorted by the rippling glass in the front door 
 
 diddy about time too i was getting quitequite diddy the matter 
 
 harry looked sideways at dudley and ducked out from under his arm just in time dudley swayed on the spot for a moment his face pale green then he opened his mouth and vomited all over the doormat 
 
 diddy diddy the matter with you vernon vernon 
 
 uncle came galumphing out of the living room walrus moustache blowing hither and thither as it always did when he was agitated he hurried forwards to help aunt petunia negotiate a dudley over the threshold while avoiding stepping in the pool of sick 
 
 ill vernon 
 
 what is it son happened did mrs polkiss give you something foreign for tea 
 
 why are you all covered in dirt darling have you been lying on the ground 
 
 hang onyou been mugged have you son 
 
 aunt petunia screamed 
 
 phone the police vernon phone the police diddy darling speak to mummy what did they do to you 
 
 in all the kerfuffle nobody seemed to have noticed harry which suited him perfectly he managed to slip inside just before uncle vernon slammed the door and while the dursleys made their noisy progress down the hall towards the kitchen harry moved carefully and quietly towards the stairs 
 
 who did it son give us names get them worry 
 
 shh trying to say something vernon what is it diddy tell mummy 
 
 foot was on the stair when dudley found his voice 
 
 him 
 
 harry froze foot on the stair face screwed up braced for the explosion 
 
 boy come here 
 
 with a feeling of mingled dread and anger harry removed his foot slowly from the stair and turned to follow the dursleys 
 
 the scrupulously clean kitchen had an oddly unreal glitter after the darkness outside aunt petunia was ushering dudley into a chair he was still very green and uncle vernon was standing in front of the draining board glaring at harry through tiny narrowed eyes 
 
 what have you done to my son he said in a menacing growl 
 
 nothing said harry knowing perfectly well that uncle vernon believe him 
 
 what did he do to you diddy aunt petunia said in a quavering voice now sponging sick from the front of leather jacket was itwas it darling did he usehis thing 
 
 slowly tremulously dudley nodded 
 
 i harry said sharply as aunt petunia let out a wail and uncle vernon raised his fists i do anything to him it me it was 
 
 but at that precise moment a screech owl swooped in through the kitchen window narrowly missing the top of uncle head it soared across the kitchen dropped the large parchment envelope it was carrying in its beak at feet turned gracefully the tips of its wings just brushing the top of the fridge then zoomed outside again and off across the garden 
 
 owls bellowed uncle vernon the vein in his temple pulsing angrily as he slammed the kitchen window shut owls again i will not have any more owls in my house 
 
 but harry was already ripping open the envelope and pulling out the letter inside his heart pounding somewhere in the region of his apple 
 
 dear mr potter 
 
 we have received intelligence that you performed the patronus charm at minutes past nine this evening in a area and in the presence of a muggle 
 
 the severity of this breach of the decree for the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery has resulted in your expulsion from hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry ministry representatives will be calling at your place of residence shortly to destroy your wand 
 
 as you have already received an official warning for a previous offence under section of the international confederation of warlocks statute of secrecy we regret to inform you that your presence is required at a disciplinary hearing at the ministry of magic at on the twelfth of august 
 
 hoping you are well 
 
 yours sincerely

 ministry of magic 
 
 harry read the letter through twice he was only vaguely aware of uncle vernon and aunt petunia talking inside his head all was icy and numb one fact had penetrated his consciousness like a paralysing dart he was expelled from hogwarts it was all over he was never going back 
 
 he looked up at the dursleys uncle vernon was shouting his fists still raised aunt petunia had her arms around dudley who was retching again 
 
 temporarily stupefied brain seemed to reawaken ministry representatives will be calling at your place of residence shortly to destroy your wand there was only one thing for it he would have to runnow where he was going to go harry know but he was certain of one thing at hogwarts or outside it he needed his wand in an almost dreamlike state he pulled his wand out and turned to leave the kitchen 
 
 where think going yelled uncle venon when harry reply he pounded across the kitchen to block the doorway into the hall i finished with you boy 
 
 get out of the way said harry quietly 
 
 going to stay here and explain how my son 
 
 if you get out of the way going to jinx you said harry raising the wand 
 
 you pull that one on me snarled uncle vernon i know not allowed to use it outside that madhouse you call a school 
 
 the madhouse has chucked me out said harry so i can do whatever i like got three seconds onetwo 
 
 a resounding crack filled the kitchen aunt petunia screamed uncle vernon yelled and ducked but for the third time that night harry was searching for the source of a disturbance he had not made he spotted it at once a dazed and barn owl was sitting outside on the kitchen sill having just collided with the closed window 
 
 ignoring uncle anguished yell of owls harry crossed the room at a run and wrenched the window open the owl stuck out its leg to which a small roll of parchment was tied shook its feathers and took off the moment harry had taken the letter hands shaking harry unfurled the second message which was written very hastily and blotchily in black ink 
 
 harry 
 
 just arrived at the ministry and trying to sort it all out do not leave your aunt and house do not do any more magic do not surrender your wand 
 
 arthur weasley 
 
 dumbledore was trying to sort it all out what did that mean how much power did dumbledore have to override the ministry of magic was there a chance that he might be allowed back to hogwarts then a small shoot of hope burgeoned in chest almost immediately strangled by panichow was he supposed to refuse to surrender his wand without doing magic have to duel with the ministry representatives and if he did that be lucky to escape azkaban let alone expulsion 
 
 his mind was racing he could run for it and risk being captured by the ministry or stay put and wait for them to find him here he was much more tempted by the former course but he knew mr weasley had his best interests at heart and after all dumbledore had sorted out much worse than this before 
 
 right harry said changed my mind staying 
 
 he flung himself down at the kitchen table and faced dudley and aunt petunia the dursleys appeared taken aback at his abrupt change of mind aunt petunia glanced despairingly at uncle vernon the vein in his purple temple was throbbing worse than ever 
 
 who are all these ruddy owls from he growled 
 
 the first one was from the ministry of magic expelling me said harry calmly he was straining his ears to catch any noises outside in case the ministry representatives were approaching and it was easier and quieter to answer uncle questions than to have him start raging and bellowing the second one was from my friend dad who works at the ministry 
 
 ministry of magic bellowed uncle vernon people like you in government oh this explains everything everything no wonder the going to the dogs 
 
 when harry did not respond uncle vernon glared at him then spat out and why have you been expelled 
 
 because i did magic 
 
 aha roared uncle vernon slamming his fist down on top of the fridge which sprang open several of snacks toppled out and burst on the floor so you admit it what did you do to dudley 
 
 nothing said harry slightly less calmly that me 
 
 was muttered dudley unexpectedly and uncle vernon and aunt petunia instantly made flapping gestures at harry to quieten him while they both bent low over dudley 
 
 go on son said uncle vernon what did he do 
 
 tell us darling whispered aunt petunia 
 
 pointed his wand at me dudley mumbled 
 
 yeah i did but i use harry began angrily but 
 
 shut up roared uncle vernon and aunt petunia in unison 
 
 go on son repeated uncle vernon moustache blowing about furiously 
 
 all dark dudley said hoarsely shuddering everything dark and then i things inside head 
 
 uncle vernon and aunt petunia exchanged looks of utter horror if their least favourite thing in the world was magic closely followed by neighbours who cheated more than they did on the hosepipe ban people who heard voices were definitely in the bottom ten they obviously thought dudley was losing his mind 
 
 what sort of things did you hear popkin breathed aunt petunia very and with tears in her eyes 
 
 but dudley seemed incapable of saying he shuddered again and shook his large blond head and despite the sense of numb dread that had settled on harry since the arrival of the first owl he felt a certain curiosity dementors caused a person to relive the worst moments of their life what would spoiled pampered bullying dudley have been forced to hear 
 
 how come you fell over son said uncle vernon in an unnaturally quiet voice the kind of voice he might adopt at the bedside of a very ill person 
 
 said dudley shakily and then 
 
 he gestured at his massive chest harry understood dudley was remembering the clammy cold that filled the lungs as hope and happiness were sucked out of you 
 
 horrible croaked dudley cold really cold 
 
 ok said uncle vernon in a voice of forced calm while aunt petunia laid an anxious hand on forehead to feel his temperature what happened then dudders 
 
 felt felt felt as if as if 
 
 as if never be happy again harry supplied dully 
 
 yes dudley whispered still trembling 
 
 so said uncle vernon voice restored to full and considerable volume as he straightened up you put some crackpot spell on my on so hear voices and believe he waswas doomed to misery or something did you 
 
 how many times do i have to tell you said harry temper and voice both rising it me it was a couple of dementors 
 
 a couple this codswallop 
 
 dementors said harry slowly and clearly two of them 
 
 and what the ruddy hell are dementors 
 
 they guard the wizard prison azkaban said aunt petunia 
 
 two seconds of ringing silence followed these words before aunt petunia clapped her hand over her mouth as though she had let slip a disgusting swear word uncle vernon was goggling at her brain reeled mrs figg was one thingbutaunt petunia 
 
 how know that he asked her astonished 
 
 aunt petunia looked quite appalled with herself she glanced at uncle vernon in fearful apology then lowered her hand slightly to reveal her horsy teeth 
 
 i heardthat awful boytelling her about themyears ago she said jerkily 
 
 if you mean my mum and dad why you use their names said harry loudly but aunt petunia ignored him she seemed horribly flustered 
 
 harry was stunned except for one outburst years ago in the course of which aunt petunia had screamed that mother had been a freak he had never heard her mention her sister he was astounded that she had remembered this scrap of information about the magical world for so long when she usually put all her energies into pretending it exist 
 
 uncle vernon opened his mouth closed it again opened it once more shut it then apparently struggling to remember how to talk opened it for a third time and croaked sosotheyertheyerthey actually exist do theyer 
 
 aunt petunia nodded 
 
 uncle vernon looked from aunt petunia to dudley to harry as if hoping somebody was going to shout april fool when nobody did he opened his mouth yet again but was spared the struggle to find more words by the arrival of the third owl of the evening it zoomed through the window like a feathery and landed with a clatter on the kitchen table causing all three of the dursleys to jump with fright harry tore a second envelope from the beak and ripped it open as the owl swooped back out into the night 
 
 enougheffingowls muttered uncle vernon distractedly stomping over to the window and slamming it shut again 
 
 dear mr potter 
 
 further to our letter of approximately minutes ago the ministry of magic has revised its decision to destroy your wand forthwith you may retain your wand until your disciplinary hearing on the twelfth of august at which time an official decision will be taken 
 
 following discussions with the headmaster of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry the ministry has agreed that the question of your expulsion will also be decided at that time you should therefore consider yourself suspended from school pending further enquiries 
 
 with best wishes 
 
 yours sincerely

 ministry of magic 
 
 harry read this letter through three times in quick succession the miserable knot in his chest loosened slightly with the relief of knowing he was not yet definitely expelled though his fears were by no means banished everything seemed to hang on this hearing on the twelfth of august 
 
 well said uncle vernon recalling harry to his surroundings what now have they sentenced you to anything do your lot have the death penalty he added as a hopeful afterthought 
 
 got to go to a hearing said harry 
 
 and sentence you there 
 
 i suppose so 
 
 i give up hope then said uncle vernon nastily 
 
 well if all said harry getting to his feet he was desperate to be alone to think perhaps to send a letter to ron hermione or sirius 
 
 no it ruddy well is not all bellowed uncle vernon sit back down 
 
 what now said harry impatiently 
 
 dudley roared uncle vernon i want to know exactly what happened to my son 
 
 fine yelled harry and in his temper red and gold sparks shot out of the end of his wand still clutched in his hand all three dursleys flinched looking terrified 
 
 dudley and i were in the alleyway between magnolia crescent and wisteria walk said harry speaking fast fighting to control his temper dudley thought be smart with me i pulled out my wand but use it then two dementors turned up 
 
 but what are dementoids asked uncle vernon furiously what do they do 
 
 i told youthey suck all the happiness out of you said harry and if they get the chance they kiss you 
 
 kiss you said uncle vernon his eyes popping slightly kiss you 
 
 what they call it when they suck the soul out of your mouth 
 
 aunt petunia uttered a soft scream 
 
 his soul they still got his 
 
 she seized dudley by the shoulders and shook him as though testing to see whether she could hear his soul rattling around inside him 
 
 of course they get his soul know if they had said harry exasperated 
 
 fought em off did you son said uncle vernon loudly with the appearance of a man struggling to bring the conversation back on to a plane he understood gave em the old did you 
 
 you give a dementor the old said harry through clenched teeth 
 
 he all right then blustered uncle vernon why he all empty then 
 
 because i used the patronus 
 
 whoosh with a clattering a whirring of wings and a soft fall of dust a fourth owl came shooting out of the kitchen fireplace 
 
 for sake roared uncle vernon pulling great clumps of hair out of his moustache something he been driven to do in a long time i will not have owls here i will not tolerate this i tell you 
 
 but harry was already pulling a roll of parchment from the leg he was so convinced that this letter had to be from dumbledore explaining everythingthe dementors mrs figg what the ministry was up to how he dumbledore intended to sort everything outthat for the first time in his life he was disappointed to see handwriting ignoring uncle vernons ongoing rant about owls and narrowing his eyes against a second cloud of dust as the most recent owl took off back up the chimney harry read message 
 
 arthur has just told us happened leave the house again whatever you do 
 
 harry found this such an inadequate response to everything that had happened tonight that he turned the piece of parchment over looking for the rest of the letter but there was nothing else 
 
 and now his temper was rising again anybody going to say well done for fighting off two dementors both mr weasley and sirius were acting as though misbehaved and were saving their until they could ascertain how much damage had been done 
 
 a peck i mean pack of owls shooting in and out of my house i have it boy i 
 
 i stop the owls coming harry snapped crushing letter in his fist 
 
 i want the truth about what happened tonight barked uncle vernon if it was demenders who hurt dudley how come been expelled you did admitted it 
 
 harry took a deep steadying breath his head was beginning to ache again he wanted more than anything to get out of the kitchen and away from the dursleys 
 
 i did the patronus charm to get rid of the dementors he said forcing himself to remain calm the only thing that works against them 
 
 but what were dementoids doing in little whinging said uncle vernon in an outraged tone 
 
 tell you said harry wearily no idea 
 
 his head was pounding in the glare of the now his anger was ebbing away he felt drained exhausted the dursleys were all staring at him 
 
 you said uncle vernon forcefully got something to do with you boy i know it why else would they turn up here why else would they be down that alleyway got to be the onlythe only evidently he bring himself to say the word wizard the only for miles 
 
 i know why they were here 
 
 but at uncle words exhausted brain had ground back into action why had the dementors come to little whinging how could it be coincidence that they had arrived in the alleyway where harry was had they been sent had the ministry of magic lost control of the dementors had they deserted azkaban and joined voldemort as dumbledore had predicted they would 
 
 these demembers guard some weirdo prison asked uncle vernon lumbering along in the wake of train of thought 
 
 yes said harry 
 
 if only his head would stop hurting if only he could just leave the kitchen and get to his dark bedroom and think 
 
 oho they were coming to arrest you said uncle vernon with the triumphant air of a man reaching an unassailable conclusion it it boy on the run from the law 
 
 of course not said harry shaking his head as though to scare off a fly his mind racing now 
 
 then why 
 
 he must have sent them said harry quietly more to himself than to uncle vernon 
 
 that who must have sent them 
 
 lord voldemort said harry 
 
 he registered dimly how strange it was that the dursleys who flinched winced and squawked if they heard words like wizard magic or wand could hear the name of the most evil wizard of all time without the slightest tremor 
 
 lordhang on said uncle vernon his face screwed up a look of dawning comprehension coming into his piggy eyes heard that name that was the one who 
 
 murdered my parents yes harry said dully 
 
 but gone said uncle vernon impatiently without the slightest sign that the murder of parents might be a painful topic that giant bloke said so gone 
 
 back said harry heavily 
 
 it felt very strange to be standing here in aunt surgically clean kitchen beside the fridge and the television talking calmly of lord voldemort to uncle vernon the arrival of the dementors in little whinging seemed to have breached the great invisible wall that divided the relentlessly world of privet drive and the world beyond two lives had somehow become fused and everything had been turned the dursleys were asking for details about the magical world and mrs figg knew albus dumbledore dementors were soaring around little whinging and he might never return to hogwarts head throbbed more painfully 
 
 back whispered aunt petunia 
 
 she was looking at harry as she had never looked at him before and all of a sudden for the very first time in his life harry fully appreciated that aunt petunia was his sister he could not have said why this hit him so very powerfully at this moment all he knew was that he was not the only person in the room who had an inkling of what lord voldemort being back might mean aunt petunia had never in her life looked at him like that before her large pale eyes so unlike her sisters were not narrowed in dislike or anger they were wide and fearful the furious pretence that aunt petunia had maintained all lifethat there was no magic and no world other than the world she inhabited with uncle vernonseemed to have fallen away 
 
 yes harry said talking directly to aunt petunia now he came back a month ago i saw him 
 
 her hands found massive shoulders and clutched them 
 
 hang on said uncle vernon looking from his wife to harry and back again apparently dazed and confused by the unprecedented understanding that seemed to have sprung up between them hang on this lord back you say 
 
 yes 
 
 the one who murdered your parents 
 
 yes 
 
 and now sending dismembers after you 
 
 looks like it said harry 
 
 i see said uncle vernon looking from his wife to harry and hitching up his trousers he seemed to be swelling his great purple face stretching before eyes well that settles it he said his shirt front straining as he inflated himself you can get out of this house boy 
 
 what said harry 
 
 you heard meout uncle vernon bellowed and even aunt petunia and dudley jumped out out i done this years ago owls treating the place like a rest home puddings exploding half the lounge destroyed tail marge bobbing around on the ceiling and that flying ford angliaout out had it history not staying here if some after you not endangering my wife and son not bringing trouble down on us if going the same way as your useless parents had it out 
 
 harry stood rooted to the spot the letters from the ministry mr weasley and sirius were all crushed in his left hand leave the house again whatever you do do not leave your aunt and house 
 
 you heard me said uncle vernon bending forwards now his massive purple face coming so close to he actually felt flecks of spit hit his face get going you were all keen to leave half an hour ago right behind you get out and never darken our doorstep again why we ever kept you in the first place i know marge was right it should have been the orphanage we were too damn soft for our own good thought we could squash it out of you thought we could turn you normal but been rotten from the beginning and had enoughowls 
 
 the fifth owl zoomed down the chimney so fast it actually hit the floor before zooming into the air again with a loud screech harry raised his hand to seize the letter which was in a scarlet envelope but it soared straight over his head flying directly at aunt petunia who let out a scream and ducked her arms over her face the owl dropped the red envelope on her head turned and flew straight back up the chimney 
 
 harry darted forwards to pick up the letter but aunt petunia beat him to it 
 
 you can open it if you like said harry but hear what it says anyway a howler 
 
 let go of it petunia roared uncle vernon touch it it could be dangerous 
 
 addressed to me said aunt petunia in a shaking voice addressed to me vernon look mrs petunia dursley the kitchen number four privet drive 
 
 she caught her breath horrified the red envelope had begun to smoke 
 
 open it harry urged her get it over with happen anyway 
 
 no 
 
 aunt hand was trembling she looked wildly around the kitchen as though looking for an escape route but too latethe envelope burst into flames aunt petunia screamed and dropped it 
 
 an awful voice filled the kitchen echoing in the confined space issuing from the burning letter on the table 
 
 remember my last petunia 
 
 aunt petunia looked as though she might faint she sank into the chair beside dudley her face in her hands the remains of the envelope smouldered into ash in the silence 
 
 what is this uncle vernon said hoarsely whati 
 
 aunt petunia said nothing dudley was staring stupidly at his mother his mouth hanging open the silence spiralled horribly harry was watching his aunt utterly bewildered his head throbbing fit to burst 
 
 petunia dear said uncle vernon timidly 
 
 she raised her head she was still trembling she swallowed 
 
 the boythe boy will have to stay vernon she said weakly 
 
 
 
 he stays she said she was not looking at harry she got to her feet again 
 
 he but petunia 
 
 if we throw him out the neighbours will talk she said she was rapidly regaining her usual brisk snappish manner though she was still very pale ask awkward questions want to know where gone have to keep him 
 
 uncle vernon was deflating like an old tyre 
 
 but petunia dear 
 
 aunt petunia ignored him she turned to harry 
 
 to stay in your room she said not to leave the house now get to bed 
 
 harry move 
 
 who was that howler from 
 
 ask questions aunt petunia snapped 
 
 are you in touch with wizards 
 
 i told you to get to bed 
 
 what did it mean remember the last what 
 
 go to bed 
 
 how come 
 
 you heard your aunt now go up to bed

lionfish nov chapter two a peck of owlscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 what said harry blankly 
 
 he left said mrs figg wringing her hands left to see someone about a batch of cauldrons that fell off the back of a broom i told him flay him alive if he went and now look dementors just lucky i put mr tibbles on the case but we got time to stand around hurry now got to get you back oh the trouble this is going to cause i will kill him 
 
 but 
 
 the revelation that his batty old neighbour knew what dementors were was almost as big a shock to harry as meeting two of them down the alleyway a witch 
 
 a squib as mundungus knows full well so how on earth was i supposed to help you fight off dementors he left you completely without cover when warned him 
 
 this mundungus has been following me hang onit was him he disapparated from the front of my house 
 
 yes yes yes but luckily stationed mr tibbles under a car just in case and mr tibbles came and warned me but by the time i got to your house gone and nowoh dumbledore going to say you she shrieked at dudley still supine on the alley floor get your fat bottom off the ground quick 
 
 you know dumbledore said harry staring at her 
 
 of course i know dumbledore who know dumbledore but come on be no help if they come back never so much as transfigured a teabag 
 
 she stooped down seized one of massive arms in her wizened hands and tugged 
 
 get up you useless lump get up 
 
 but dudley either could not or would not move he remained on the ground trembling and his mouth shut very tight 
 
 do it harry took hold of arm and heaved with an enormous effort he managed to hoist him to his feet dudley seemed to be on the point of fainting his small eyes were rolling in their sockets and sweat was beading his face the moment harry let go of him he swayed dangerously 
 
 hurry up said mrs figg hysterically 
 
 harry pulled one of massive arms around his own shoulders and dragged him towards the road sagging slightly under the weight mrs figg tottered along in front of them peering anxiously around the corner 
 
 keep your wand out she told harry as they entered wisteria walk never mind the statute of secrecy now going to be hell to pay anyway we might as well be hanged for a dragon as an egg talk about the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery this was exactly what dumbledore was afraid that at the end of the street oh just mr prentice put your wand away boy i keep telling you no use 
 
 it was not easy to hold a wand steady and haul dudley along at the same time harry gave his cousin an impatient dig in the ribs but dudley seemed to have lost all desire for independent movement he was slumped on shoulder his large feet dragging along the ground 
 
 why you tell me a squib mrs figg asked harry panting with the effort to keep walking all those times i came round your housewhy you say anything 
 
 orders i was to keep an eye on you but not say anything you were too young sorry i gave you such a miserable time harry but the dursleys would never have let you come if thought you enjoyed it it easy you know but oh my word she said tragically wringing her hands once more when dumbledore hears about thishow could mundungus have left he was supposed to be on duty until midnightwhere is he how am i going to tell dumbledore happened i apparate 
 
 got an owl you can borrow her harry groaned wondering whether his spine was going to snap under weight 
 
 harry you understand dumbledore will need to act as quickly as possible the ministry have their own ways of detecting underage magic know already you mark my words 
 
 but i was getting rid of dementors i had to use going to be more worried about what dementors were doing floating around wisteria walk surely 
 
 oh my dear i wish it were so but afraid mundungus fletcher i am going to kill you 
 
 there was a loud crack and a strong smell of drink mingled with stale tobacco filled the air as a squat unshaven man in a tattered overcoat materialised right in front of them he had short bandy legs long straggly ginger hair and bloodshot baggy eyes that gave him the doleful look of a basset hound he was also clutching a silvery bundle that harry recognised at once as an invisibility cloak 
 
 s up figgy he said staring from mrs figg to harry and dudley what appened to staying undercover 
 
 give you undercover cried mrs figg dementors you useless skiving sneak thief 
 
 dementors repeated mundungus aghast dementors here 
 
 yes here you worthless pile of bat droppings here shrieked mrs figg dementors attacking the boy on your watch 
 
 blimey said mundungus weakly looking from mrs figg to harry and back again blimey i 
 
 and you off buying stolen cauldrons i tell you not to go i 
 
 iwell i mundungus looked deeply uncomfortable it it was a very good business opportunity see 
 
 mrs figg raised the arm from which her string bag dangled and whacked mundungus around the face and neck with it judging by the clanking noise it made it was full of cat food 
 
 ouchgerroff gerroff you mad old bat gotta tell dumbledore 
 
 yesthey have yelled mrs figg swinging the bag of cat food at every bit of mundungus she could reach andithadbetterbeyouandyoucantell 
 
 keep your airnet on said mundungus his arms over his head cowering going going 
 
 and with another loud crack he vanished 
 
 i hope dumbledore murders him said mrs figg furiously now come on harry what are you waiting for 
 
 harry decided not to waste his remaining breath on pointing out that he could barely walk under bulk he gave the dudley a heave and staggered onwards 
 
 take you to the door said mrs figg as they turned into privet drive just in case there are more of them around oh my word what a catastrophe and you had to fight them off yourself and dumbledore said we were to keep you from doing magic at all costs well no good crying over spilt potion i suppose but the among the pixies now 
 
 so harry panted been having me followed 
 
 of course he has said mrs figg impatiently did you expect him to let you wander around on your own after what happened in june good lord boy they told me you were intelligent right get inside and stay there she said as they reached number four i expect someone will be in touch with you soon enough 
 
 what are you going to do asked harry quickly 
 
 going straight home said mrs figg staring around the dark street and shuddering need to wait for more instructions just stay in the house goodnight 
 
 hang on go yet i want to know 
 
 but mrs figg had already set off at a trot carpet slippers flopping string bag clanking 
 
 wait harry shouted after her he had a million questions to ask anyone who was in contact with dumbledore but within seconds mrs figg was swallowed by the darkness scowling harry readjusted dudley on his shoulder and made his slow painful way up number garden path 
 
 the hall light was on harry stuck his wand back inside the waistband of his jeans rang the bell and watched aunt outline grow larger and larger oddly distorted by the rippling glass in the front door 
 
 diddy about time too i was getting quitequite diddy the matter 
 
 harry looked sideways at dudley and ducked out from under his arm just in time dudley swayed on the spot for a moment his face pale green then he opened his mouth and vomited all over the doormat 
 
 diddy diddy the matter with you vernon vernon 
 
 uncle came galumphing out of the living room walrus moustache blowing hither and thither as it always did when he was agitated he hurried forwards to help aunt petunia negotiate a dudley over the threshold while avoiding stepping in the pool of sick 
 
 ill vernon 
 
 what is it son happened did mrs polkiss give you something foreign for tea 
 
 why are you all covered in dirt darling have you been lying on the ground 
 
 hang onyou been mugged have you son 
 
 aunt petunia screamed 
 
 phone the police vernon phone the police diddy darling speak to mummy what did they do to you 
 
 in all the kerfuffle nobody seemed to have noticed harry which suited him perfectly he managed to slip inside just before uncle vernon slammed the door and while the dursleys made their noisy progress down the hall towards the kitchen harry moved carefully and quietly towards the stairs 
 
 who did it son give us names get them worry 
 
 shh trying to say something vernon what is it diddy tell mummy 
 
 foot was on the stair when dudley found his voice 
 
 him 
 
 harry froze foot on the stair face screwed up braced for the explosion 
 
 boy come here 
 
 with a feeling of mingled dread and anger harry removed his foot slowly from the stair and turned to follow the dursleys 
 
 the scrupulously clean kitchen had an oddly unreal glitter after the darkness outside aunt petunia was ushering dudley into a chair he was still very green and uncle vernon was standing in front of the draining board glaring at harry through tiny narrowed eyes 
 
 what have you done to my son he said in a menacing growl 
 
 nothing said harry knowing perfectly well that uncle vernon believe him 
 
 what did he do to you diddy aunt petunia said in a quavering voice now sponging sick from the front of leather jacket was itwas it darling did he usehis thing 
 
 slowly tremulously dudley nodded 
 
 i harry said sharply as aunt petunia let out a wail and uncle vernon raised his fists i do anything to him it me it was 
 
 but at that precise moment a screech owl swooped in through the kitchen window narrowly missing the top of uncle head it soared across the kitchen dropped the large parchment envelope it was carrying in its beak at feet turned gracefully the tips of its wings just brushing the top of the fridge then zoomed outside again and off across the garden 
 
 owls bellowed uncle vernon the vein in his temple pulsing angrily as he slammed the kitchen window shut owls again i will not have any more owls in my house 
 
 but harry was already ripping open the envelope and pulling out the letter inside his heart pounding somewhere in the region of his apple 
 
 dear mr potter 
 
 we have received intelligence that you performed the patronus charm at minutes past nine this evening in a area and in the presence of a muggle 
 
 the severity of this breach of the decree for the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery has resulted in your expulsion from hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry ministry representatives will be calling at your place of residence shortly to destroy your wand 
 
 as you have already received an official warning for a previous offence under section of the international confederation of warlocks statute of secrecy we regret to inform you that your presence is required at a disciplinary hearing at the ministry of magic at on the twelfth of august 
 
 hoping you are well 
 
 yours sincerely

 harry read the letter through twice he was only vaguely aware of uncle vernon and aunt petunia talking inside his head all was icy and numb one fact had penetrated his consciousness like a paralysing dart he was expelled from hogwarts it was all over he was never going back 
 
 he looked up at the dursleys uncle vernon was shouting his fists still raised aunt petunia had her arms around dudley who was retching again 
 
 temporarily stupefied brain seemed to reawaken ministry representatives will be calling at your place of residence shortly to destroy your wand there was only one thing for it he would have to runnow where he was going to go harry know but he was certain of one thing at hogwarts or outside it he needed his wand in an almost dreamlike state he pulled his wand out and turned to leave the kitchen 
 
 where think going yelled uncle venon when harry reply he pounded across the kitchen to block the doorway into the hall i finished with you boy 
 
 get out of the way said harry quietly 
 
 going to stay here and explain how my son 
 
 if you get out of the way going to jinx you said harry raising the wand 
 
 you pull that one on me snarled uncle vernon i know not allowed to use it outside that madhouse you call a school 
 
 the madhouse has chucked me out said harry so i can do whatever i like got three seconds onetwo 
 
 a resounding crack filled the kitchen aunt petunia screamed uncle vernon yelled and ducked but for the third time that night harry was searching for the source of a disturbance he had not made he spotted it at once a dazed and barn owl was sitting outside on the kitchen sill having just collided with the closed window 
 
 ignoring uncle anguished yell of owls harry crossed the room at a run and wrenched the window open the owl stuck out its leg to which a small roll of parchment was tied shook its feathers and took off the moment harry had taken the letter hands shaking harry unfurled the second message which was written very hastily and blotchily in black ink 
 
 harry 
 
 just arrived at the ministry and trying to sort it all out do not leave your aunt and house do not do any more magic do not surrender your wand 
 
 arthur weasley 
 
 dumbledore was trying to sort it all out what did that mean how much power did dumbledore have to override the ministry of magic was there a chance that he might be allowed back to hogwarts then a small shoot of hope burgeoned in chest almost immediately strangled by panichow was he supposed to refuse to surrender his wand without doing magic have to duel with the ministry representatives and if he did that be lucky to escape azkaban let alone expulsion 
 
 his mind was racing he could run for it and risk being captured by the ministry or stay put and wait for them to find him here he was much more tempted by the former course but he knew mr weasley had his best interests at heart and after all dumbledore had sorted out much worse than this before 
 
 right harry said changed my mind staying 
 
 he flung himself down at the kitchen table and faced dudley and aunt petunia the dursleys appeared taken aback at his abrupt change of mind aunt petunia glanced despairingly at uncle vernon the vein in his purple temple was throbbing worse than ever 
 
 who are all these ruddy owls from he growled 
 
 the first one was from the ministry of magic expelling me said harry calmly he was straining his ears to catch any noises outside in case the ministry representatives were approaching and it was easier and quieter to answer uncle questions than to have him start raging and bellowing the second one was from my friend dad who works at the ministry 
 
 ministry of magic bellowed uncle vernon people like you in government oh this explains everything everything no wonder the going to the dogs 
 
 when harry did not respond uncle vernon glared at him then spat out and why have you been expelled 
 
 because i did magic 
 
 aha roared uncle vernon slamming his fist down on top of the fridge which sprang open several of snacks toppled out and burst on the floor so you admit it what did you do to dudley 
 
 nothing said harry slightly less calmly that me 
 
 was muttered dudley unexpectedly and uncle vernon and aunt petunia instantly made flapping gestures at harry to quieten him while they both bent low over dudley 
 
 go on son said uncle vernon what did he do 
 
 tell us darling whispered aunt petunia 
 
 pointed his wand at me dudley mumbled 
 
 yeah i did but i use harry began angrily but 
 
 shut up roared uncle vernon and aunt petunia in unison 
 
 go on son repeated uncle vernon moustache blowing about furiously 
 
 all dark dudley said hoarsely shuddering everything dark and then i things inside head 
 
 uncle vernon and aunt petunia exchanged looks of utter horror if their least favourite thing in the world was magic closely followed by neighbours who cheated more than they did on the hosepipe ban people who heard voices were definitely in the bottom ten they obviously thought dudley was losing his mind 
 
 what sort of things did you hear popkin breathed aunt petunia very and with tears in her eyes 
 
 but dudley seemed incapable of saying he shuddered again and shook his large blond head and despite the sense of numb dread that had settled on harry since the arrival of the first owl he felt a certain curiosity dementors caused a person to relive the worst moments of their life what would spoiled pampered bullying dudley have been forced to hear 
 
 how come you fell over son said uncle vernon in an unnaturally quiet voice the kind of voice he might adopt at the bedside of a very ill person 
 
 said dudley shakily and then 
 
 he gestured at his massive chest harry understood dudley was remembering the clammy cold that filled the lungs as hope and happiness were sucked out of you 
 
 horrible croaked dudley cold really cold 
 
 ok said uncle vernon in a voice of forced calm while aunt petunia laid an anxious hand on forehead to feel his temperature what happened then dudders 
 
 felt felt felt as if as if 
 
 as if never be happy again harry supplied dully 
 
 yes dudley whispered still trembling 
 
 so said uncle vernon voice restored to full and considerable volume as he straightened up you put some crackpot spell on my on so hear voices and believe he waswas doomed to misery or something did you 
 
 how many times do i have to tell you said harry temper and voice both rising it me it was a couple of dementors 
 
 a couple this codswallop 
 
 dementors said harry slowly and clearly two of them 
 
 and what the ruddy hell are dementors 
 
 they guard the wizard prison azkaban said aunt petunia 
 
 two seconds of ringing silence followed these words before aunt petunia clapped her hand over her mouth as though she had let slip a disgusting swear word uncle vernon was goggling at her brain reeled mrs figg was one thingbutaunt petunia 
 
 how know that he asked her astonished 
 
 aunt petunia looked quite appalled with herself she glanced at uncle vernon in fearful apology then lowered her hand slightly to reveal her horsy teeth 
 
 i heardthat awful boytelling her about themyears ago she said jerkily 
 
 if you mean my mum and dad why you use their names said harry loudly but aunt petunia ignored him she seemed horribly flustered 
 
 harry was stunned except for one outburst years ago in the course of which aunt petunia had screamed that mother had been a freak he had never heard her mention her sister he was astounded that she had remembered this scrap of information about the magical world for so long when she usually put all her energies into pretending it exist 
 
 uncle vernon opened his mouth closed it again opened it once more shut it then apparently struggling to remember how to talk opened it for a third time and croaked sosotheyertheyerthey actually exist do theyer 
 
 aunt petunia nodded 
 
 uncle vernon looked from aunt petunia to dudley to harry as if hoping somebody was going to shout april fool when nobody did he opened his mouth yet again but was spared the struggle to find more words by the arrival of the third owl of the evening it zoomed through the window like a feathery and landed with a clatter on the kitchen table causing all three of the dursleys to jump with fright harry tore a second envelope from the beak and ripped it open as the owl swooped back out into the night 
 
 enougheffingowls muttered uncle vernon distractedly stomping over to the window and slamming it shut again 
 
 dear mr potter 
 
 further to our letter of approximately minutes ago the ministry of magic has revised its decision to destroy your wand forthwith you may retain your wand until your disciplinary hearing on the twelfth of august at which time an official decision will be taken 
 
 following discussions with the headmaster of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry the ministry has agreed that the question of your expulsion will also be decided at that time you should therefore consider yourself suspended from school pending further enquiries 
 
 with best wishes 
 
 yours sincerely

 harry read this letter through three times in quick succession the miserable knot in his chest loosened slightly with the relief of knowing he was not yet definitely expelled though his fears were by no means banished everything seemed to hang on this hearing on the twelfth of august 
 
 well said uncle vernon recalling harry to his surroundings what now have they sentenced you to anything do your lot have the death penalty he added as a hopeful afterthought 
 
 got to go to a hearing said harry 
 
 and sentence you there 
 
 i suppose so 
 
 i give up hope then said uncle vernon nastily 
 
 well if all said harry getting to his feet he was desperate to be alone to think perhaps to send a letter to ron hermione or sirius 
 
 no it ruddy well is not all bellowed uncle vernon sit back down 
 
 what now said harry impatiently 
 
 dudley roared uncle vernon i want to know exactly what happened to my son 
 
 fine yelled harry and in his temper red and gold sparks shot out of the end of his wand still clutched in his hand all three dursleys flinched looking terrified 
 
 dudley and i were in the alleyway between magnolia crescent and wisteria walk said harry speaking fast fighting to control his temper dudley thought be smart with me i pulled out my wand but use it then two dementors turned up 
 
 but what are dementoids asked uncle vernon furiously what do they do 
 
 i told youthey suck all the happiness out of you said harry and if they get the chance they kiss you 
 
 kiss you said uncle vernon his eyes popping slightly kiss you 
 
 what they call it when they suck the soul out of your mouth 
 
 aunt petunia uttered a soft scream 
 
 his soul they still got his 
 
 she seized dudley by the shoulders and shook him as though testing to see whether she could hear his soul rattling around inside him 
 
 of course they get his soul know if they had said harry exasperated 
 
 fought em off did you son said uncle vernon loudly with the appearance of a man struggling to bring the conversation back on to a plane he understood gave em the old did you 
 
 you give a dementor the old said harry through clenched teeth 
 
 he all right then blustered uncle vernon why he all empty then 
 
 because i used the patronus 
 
 whoosh with a clattering a whirring of wings and a soft fall of dust a fourth owl came shooting out of the kitchen fireplace 
 
 for sake roared uncle vernon pulling great clumps of hair out of his moustache something he been driven to do in a long time i will not have owls here i will not tolerate this i tell you 
 
 but harry was already pulling a roll of parchment from the leg he was so convinced that this letter had to be from dumbledore explaining everythingthe dementors mrs figg what the ministry was up to how he dumbledore intended to sort everything outthat for the first time in his life he was disappointed to see handwriting ignoring uncle vernons ongoing rant about owls and narrowing his eyes against a second cloud of dust as the most recent owl took off back up the chimney harry read message 
 
 arthur has just told us happened leave the house again whatever you do 
 
 harry found this such an inadequate response to everything that had happened tonight that he turned the piece of parchment over looking for the rest of the letter but there was nothing else 
 
 and now his temper was rising again anybody going to say well done for fighting off two dementors both mr weasley and sirius were acting as though misbehaved and were saving their until they could ascertain how much damage had been done 
 
 a peck i mean pack of owls shooting in and out of my house i have it boy i 
 
 i stop the owls coming harry snapped crushing letter in his fist 
 
 i want the truth about what happened tonight barked uncle vernon if it was demenders who hurt dudley how come been expelled you did admitted it 
 
 harry took a deep steadying breath his head was beginning to ache again he wanted more than anything to get out of the kitchen and away from the dursleys 
 
 i did the patronus charm to get rid of the dementors he said forcing himself to remain calm the only thing that works against them 
 
 but what were dementoids doing in little whinging said uncle vernon in an outraged tone 
 
 tell you said harry wearily no idea 
 
 his head was pounding in the glare of the now his anger was ebbing away he felt drained exhausted the dursleys were all staring at him 
 
 you said uncle vernon forcefully got something to do with you boy i know it why else would they turn up here why else would they be down that alleyway got to be the onlythe only evidently he bring himself to say the word wizard the only for miles 
 
 i know why they were here 
 
 but at uncle words exhausted brain had ground back into action why had the dementors come to little whinging how could it be coincidence that they had arrived in the alleyway where harry was had they been sent had the ministry of magic lost control of the dementors had they deserted azkaban and joined voldemort as dumbledore had predicted they would 
 
 these demembers guard some weirdo prison asked uncle vernon lumbering along in the wake of train of thought 
 
 yes said harry 
 
 if only his head would stop hurting if only he could just leave the kitchen and get to his dark bedroom and think 
 
 oho they were coming to arrest you said uncle vernon with the triumphant air of a man reaching an unassailable conclusion it it boy on the run from the law 
 
 of course not said harry shaking his head as though to scare off a fly his mind racing now 
 
 then why 
 
 he must have sent them said harry quietly more to himself than to uncle vernon 
 
 that who must have sent them 
 
 lord voldemort said harry 
 
 he registered dimly how strange it was that the dursleys who flinched winced and squawked if they heard words like wizard magic or wand could hear the name of the most evil wizard of all time without the slightest tremor 
 
 lordhang on said uncle vernon his face screwed up a look of dawning comprehension coming into his piggy eyes heard that name that was the one who 
 
 murdered my parents yes harry said dully 
 
 but gone said uncle vernon impatiently without the slightest sign that the murder of parents might be a painful topic that giant bloke said so gone 
 
 back said harry heavily 
 
 it felt very strange to be standing here in aunt surgically clean kitchen beside the fridge and the television talking calmly of lord voldemort to uncle vernon the arrival of the dementors in little whinging seemed to have breached the great invisible wall that divided the relentlessly world of privet drive and the world beyond two lives had somehow become fused and everything had been turned the dursleys were asking for details about the magical world and mrs figg knew albus dumbledore dementors were soaring around little whinging and he might never return to hogwarts head throbbed more painfully 
 
 back whispered aunt petunia 
 
 she was looking at harry as she had never looked at him before and all of a sudden for the very first time in his life harry fully appreciated that aunt petunia was his sister he could not have said why this hit him so very powerfully at this moment all he knew was that he was not the only person in the room who had an inkling of what lord voldemort being back might mean aunt petunia had never in her life looked at him like that before her large pale eyes so unlike her sisters were not narrowed in dislike or anger they were wide and fearful the furious pretence that aunt petunia had maintained all lifethat there was no magic and no world other than the world she inhabited with uncle vernonseemed to have fallen away 
 
 yes harry said talking directly to aunt petunia now he came back a month ago i saw him 
 
 her hands found massive shoulders and clutched them 
 
 hang on said uncle vernon looking from his wife to harry and back again apparently dazed and confused by the unprecedented understanding that seemed to have sprung up between them hang on this lord back you say 
 
 yes 
 
 the one who murdered your parents 
 
 yes 
 
 and now sending dismembers after you 
 
 looks like it said harry 
 
 i see said uncle vernon looking from his wife to harry and hitching up his trousers he seemed to be swelling his great purple face stretching before eyes well that settles it he said his shirt front straining as he inflated himself you can get out of this house boy 
 
 what said harry 
 
 you heard meout uncle vernon bellowed and even aunt petunia and dudley jumped out out i done this years ago owls treating the place like a rest home puddings exploding half the lounge destroyed tail marge bobbing around on the ceiling and that flying ford angliaout out had it history not staying here if some after you not endangering my wife and son not bringing trouble down on us if going the same way as your useless parents had it out 
 
 harry stood rooted to the spot the letters from the ministry mr weasley and sirius were all crushed in his left hand leave the house again whatever you do do not leave your aunt and house 
 
 you heard me said uncle vernon bending forwards now his massive purple face coming so close to he actually felt flecks of spit hit his face get going you were all keen to leave half an hour ago right behind you get out and never darken our doorstep again why we ever kept you in the first place i know marge was right it should have been the orphanage we were too damn soft for our own good thought we could squash it out of you thought we could turn you normal but been rotten from the beginning and had enoughowls 
 
 the fifth owl zoomed down the chimney so fast it actually hit the floor before zooming into the air again with a loud screech harry raised his hand to seize the letter which was in a scarlet envelope but it soared straight over his head flying directly at aunt petunia who let out a scream and ducked her arms over her face the owl dropped the red envelope on her head turned and flew straight back up the chimney 
 
 harry darted forwards to pick up the letter but aunt petunia beat him to it 
 
 you can open it if you like said harry but hear what it says anyway a howler 
 
 let go of it petunia roared uncle vernon touch it it could be dangerous 
 
 addressed to me said aunt petunia in a shaking voice addressed to me vernon look mrs petunia dursley the kitchen number four privet drive 
 
 she caught her breath horrified the red envelope had begun to smoke 
 
 open it harry urged her get it over with happen anyway 
 
 no 
 
 aunt hand was trembling she looked wildly around the kitchen as though looking for an escape route but too latethe envelope burst into flames aunt petunia screamed and dropped it 
 
 an awful voice filled the kitchen echoing in the confined space issuing from the burning letter on the table 
 
 remember my last petunia 
 
 aunt petunia looked as though she might faint she sank into the chair beside dudley her face in her hands the remains of the envelope smouldered into ash in the silence 
 
 what is this uncle vernon said hoarsely whati 
 
 aunt petunia said nothing dudley was staring stupidly at his mother his mouth hanging open the silence spiralled horribly harry was watching his aunt utterly bewildered his head throbbing fit to burst 
 
 petunia dear said uncle vernon timidly 
 
 she raised her head she was still trembling she swallowed 
 
 the boythe boy will have to stay vernon she said weakly 
 
 
 
 he stays she said she was not looking at harry she got to her feet again 
 
 he but petunia 
 
 if we throw him out the neighbours will talk she said she was rapidly regaining her usual brisk snappish manner though she was still very pale ask awkward questions want to know where gone have to keep him 
 
 uncle vernon was deflating like an old tyre 
 
 but petunia dear 
 
 aunt petunia ignored him she turned to harry 
 
 to stay in your room she said not to leave the house now get to bed 
 
 harry move 
 
 who was that howler from 
 
 ask questions aunt petunia snapped 
 
 are you in touch with wizards 
 
 i told you to get to bed 
 
 what did it mean remember the last what 
 
 go to bed 
 
 how come 
 
 you heard your aunt now go up to bed

lionfish nov chapter two endcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 many miles away the chilly mist that had pressed against the prime windows drifted over a dirty river that wound between overgrown banks an immense chimney relic of a disused mill reared up shadowy and ominous there was no sound apart from the whisper of the black water and no sign of life apart from a scrawny fox that had slunk down the bank to nose hopefully at some old wrappings in the tall grass 
 
 but then with a very faint pop a slim hooded figure appeared out of thin air on the edge of the river the fox froze wary eyes fixed upon this strange new phenomenon the figure seemed to take its bearings for a few moments then set off with light quick strides its long cloak rustling over the grass 
 
 with a second and louder pop another hooded figure materialized 
 
 wait 
 
 the harsh cry startled the fox now crouching almost flat in the undergrowth it leapt from its hiding place and up the bank there was a flash of green light a yelp and the fox fell back to the ground dead 
 
 the second figure turned over the animal with its toe 
 
 just a fox said a voice dismissively from under the hood i thought perhaps an aurorcissy wait 
 
 but her quarry who had paused and looked back at the flash of light was already scrambling up the bank the fox had just fallen down 
 
 cissynarcissalisten to me 
 
 the second woman caught the first and seized her arm but the other wrenched it away 
 
 go back bella 
 
 you must listen to me 
 
 listened already made my decision leave me alone 
 
 the woman named narcissa gained the top of the bank where a line of old railings separated the river from a narrow cobbled street the other woman bella followed at once side by side they stood looking across the road at the rows and rows of dilapidated brick houses their windows dull and blind in the darkness 
 
 he lives here asked bella in a voice of contempt here in this muggle dunghill we must be the first of our kind ever to set foot 
 
 but narcissa was not listening she had slipped through a gap in the rusty railings and was already hurrying across the road 
 
 cissy wait 
 
 bella followed her cloak streaming behind and saw narcissa darting through an alley between the houses into a second almost identical street some of the streetlamps were broken the two women were running between patches of light and deep darkness the pursuer caught up with her prey just as she turned another corner this time succeeding in catching hold of her arm and swinging her around so that they faced each other 
 
 cissy you must not do this you trust him 
 
 the dark lord trusts him he 
 
 the dark lord is i believe mistaken bella panted and her eyes gleamed momentarily under her hood as she looked around to check that they were indeed alone in any case we were told not to speak of the plan to anyone this is a betrayal of the dark 
 
 let go bella snarled narcissa and she drew a wand from beneath her cloak holding it threateningly in the face bella merely laughed 
 
 cissy your own sister you 
 
 there is nothing i do anymore narcissa breathed a note of hysteria in her voice and as she brought down the wand like a knife there was another flash of light bella let go of her arm as though burned 
 
 narcissa 
 
 but narcissa had rushed ahead rubbing her hand her pursuer followed again keeping her distance now as they moved deeper into the deserted labyrinth of brick houses at last narcissa hurried up a street named end over which the towering mill chimney seemed to hover like a giant admonitory finger her footsteps echoed on the cobbles as she passed boarded and broken windows until she reached the very last house where a dim light glimmered through the curtains in a downstairs room 
 
 she had knocked on the door before bella cursing under her breath had caught up together they stood waiting panting slightly breathing in the smell of the dirty river that was carried to them on the night breeze after a few seconds they heard movement behind the door and it opened a crack a sliver of a man could be seen looking out at them a man with long black hair parted in curtains around a sallow face and black eyes 
 
 narcissa threw back her hood she was so pale that she seemed to shine in the darkness the long blonde hair streaming down her back gave her the look of a drowned person 
 
 narcissa said the man opening the door a little wider so that the light fell upon her and her sister too what a pleasant surprise 
 
 severus she said in a strained whisper may i speak to you urgent 
 
 but of course 
 
 he stood back to allow her to pass him into the house her sister followed without invitation 
 
 snape she said curtly as she passed him 
 
 bellatrix he replied his thin mouth curling into a slightly mocking smile as he closed the door with a snap behind them 
 
 they had stepped directly into a tiny sitting room which had the feeling of a dark padded cell the walls were completely covered in books most of them bound in old black or brown leather a threadbare sofa an old armchair and a rickety table stood grouped together in a pool of dim light cast by a lamp hung from the ceiling the place had an air of neglect as though it was not usually inhabited 
 
 snape gestured narcissa to the sofa she threw off her cloak cast it aside and sat down staring at her white and trembling hands clasped in her lap bellatrix lowered her hood more slowly dark as her sister was fair with heavily lidded eyes and a strong jaw she did not take her gaze from snape as she moved to stand behind narcissa 
 
 so what can i do for you snape asked settling himself in the armchair opposite the two sisters 
 
 we we are alone we narcissa asked quietly 
 
 yes of course well here but not counting vermin are we 
 
 he pointed his wand at the wall of books behind him and with a bang a hidden door flew open revealing a narrow staircase upon which a small man stood frozen 
 
 as you have clearly realized wormtail we have guests said snape lazily 
 
 the man crept hunchbacked down the last few steps and moved into the room he had small watery eyes a pointed nose and wore an unpleasant simper his left hand was caressing his right which looked as though it was encased in a bright silver glove 
 
 narcissa he said in a squeaky voice and bellatrix how charming 
 
 wormtail will get us drinks if like them said snape and then he will return to his bedroom 
 
 wormtail winced as though snape had thrown something at him 
 
 i am not your servant he squeaked avoiding eye 
 
 really i was under the impression that the dark lord placed you here to assist me 
 
 to assist yesbut not to make you drinks andand clean your house 
 
 i had no idea wormtail that you were craving more dangerous assignments said snape silkily this can be easily arranged i shall speak to the dark lord 
 
 i can speak to him myself if i want to 
 
 of course you can said snape sneering but in the meantime bring us drinks some of the wine will do 
 
 wormtail hesitated for a moment looking as though he might argue but then turned and headed through a second hidden door they heard banging and a clinking of glasses within seconds he was back bearing a dusty bottle and three glasses upon a tray he dropped these on the rickety table and scurried from their presence slamming the door behind him 
 
 snape poured out three glasses of wine and handed two of them to the sisters narcissa murmured a word of thanks whilst bellatrix said nothing but continued to glower at snape this did not seem to discompose him on the contrary he looked rather amused 
 
 the dark lord he said raising his glass and draining it 
 
 the sisters copied him snape refilled their glasses 
 
 as narcissa took her second drink she said in a rush severus sorry to come here like this but i had to see you i think you are the only one who can help me 
 
 snape held up a hand to stop her then pointed his wand again at the concealed staircase door there was a loud bang and a squeal followed by the sound of wormtail scurrying back up the stairs 
 
 my apologies said snape he has lately taken to listening at doors i know what he means by it you were saying narcissa 
 
 she took a great shuddering breath and started again 
 
 severus i know i ought not to be here i have been told to say nothing to anyone but 
 
 then you ought to hold your tongue snarled bellatrix particularly in present company 
 
 present company repeated snape sardonically and what am i to understand by that bellatrix 
 
 that i trust you snape as you very well know 
 
 narcissa let out a noise that might have been a dry sob and covered her face with her hands snape set his glass down upon the table and sat back again his hands upon the arms of his chair smiling into glowering face 
 
 narcissa i think we ought to hear what bellatrix is bursting to say it will save tedious interruptions well continue bellatrix said snape why is it that you do not trust me 
 
 a hundred reasons she said loudly striding out from behind the sofa to slam her glass upon the table where to start where were you when the dark lord fell why did you never make any attempt to find him when he vanished what have you been doing all these years that lived in pocket why did you stop the dark lord procuring the stone why did you not return at once when the dark lord was reborn where were you a few weeks ago when we battled to retrieve the prophecy for the dark lord and why snape is harry potter still alive when you have had him at your mercy for five years 
 
 she paused her chest rising and falling rapidly the color high in her cheeks behind her narcissa sat motionless her face still hidden in her hands 
 
 snape smiled 
 
 before i answer youoh yes bellatrix i am going to answer you can carry my words back to the others who whisper behind my back and carry false tales of my treachery to the dark lord before i answer you i say let me ask a question in turn do you really think that the dark lord has not asked me each and every one of those questions and do you really think that had i not been able to give satisfactory answers i would be sitting here talking to you 
 
 she hesitated 
 
 i know he believes you but 
 
 you think he is mistaken or that i have somehow hoodwinked him fooled the dark lord the greatest wizard the most accomplished legilimens the world has ever seen 
 
 bellatrix said nothing but looked for the first time a little discomfited snape did not press the point he picked up his drink again sipped it and continued you ask where i was when the dark lord fell i was where he had ordered me to be at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry because he wished me to spy upon albus dumbledore you know i presume that it was on the dark orders that i took up the post 
 
 she nodded almost imperceptibly and then opened her mouth but snape forestalled her 
 
 you ask why i did not attempt to find him when he vanished for the same reason that avery yaxley the carrows greyback lucius he inclined his head slightly to narcissa and many others did not attempt to find him i believed him finished i am not proud of it i was wrong but there it is if he had not forgiven we who lost faith at that time he would have very few followers left 
 
 have me said bellatrix passionately i who spent many years in azkaban for him 
 
 yes indeed most admirable said snape in a bored voice of course you a lot of use to him in prison but the gesture was undoubtedly fine 
 
 gesture she shrieked in her fury she looked slightly mad while i endured the dementors you remained at hogwarts comfortably playing pet 
 
 not quite said snape calmly he give me the defense against the dark arts job you know seemed to think it might ah bring about a relapse tempt me into my old ways 
 
 this was your sacrifice for the dark lord not to teach your favorite subject she jeered why did you stay there all that time snape still spying on dumbledore for a master you believed dead 
 
 hardly said snape although the dark lord is pleased that i never deserted my post i had sixteen years of information on dumbledore to give him when he returned a rather more useful present than endless reminiscences of how unpleasant azkaban is 
 
 but you stayed 
 
 yes bellatrix i stayed said snape betraying a hint of impatience for the first time i had a comfortable job that i preferred to a stint in azkaban they were rounding up the death eaters you know protection kept me out of jail it was most convenient and i used it i repeat the dark lord does not complain that i stayed so i do not see why you do 
 
 i think you next wanted to know he pressed on a little more loudly for bellatrix showed every sign of interrupting why i stood between the dark lord and the stone that is easily answered he did not know whether he could trust me he thought like you that i had turned from faithful death eater to stooge he was in a pitiable condition very weak sharing the body of a mediocre wizard he did not dare reveal himself to a former ally if that ally might turn him over to dumbledore or the ministry i deeply regret that he did not trust me he would have returned to power three years sooner as it was i saw only greedy and unworthy quirrell attempting to steal the stone and i admit i did all i could to thwart him 
 
 mouth twisted as though she had taken an unpleasant dose of medicine 
 
 but you return when he came back you fly back to him at once when you felt the dark mark burn 
 
 correct i returned two hours later i returned on orders 
 
 on she began in tones of outrage 
 
 think said snape impatient again think by waiting two hours just two hours i ensured that i could remain at hogwarts as a spy by allowing dumbledore to think that i was only returning to the dark side because i was ordered to i have been able to pass information on dumbledore and the order of the phoenix ever since consider bellatrix the dark mark had been growing stronger for months i knew he must be about to return all the death eaters knew i had plenty of time to think about what i wanted to do to plan my next move to escape like karkaroff i 
 
 the dark initial displeasure at my lateness vanished entirely i assure you when i explained that i remained faithful although dumbledore thought i was his man yes the dark lord thought that i had left him forever but he was wrong 
 
 but what use have you been sneered bellatrix what useful information have we had from you 
 
 my information has been conveyed directly to the dark lord said snape if he chooses not to share it with you 
 
 he shares everything with me said bellatrix firing up at once he calls me his most loyal his most faithful 
 
 does he said snape his voice delicately inflected to suggest his disbelief does he still after the fiasco at the ministry 
 
 that was not my fault said bellatrix flushing the dark lord has in the past entrusted me with his most preciousif lucius 
 
 you you dare blame my husband said narcissa in a low and deadly voice looking up at her sister 
 
 there is no point apportioning blame said snape smoothly what is done is done 
 
 but not by you said bellatrix furiously no you were once again absent while the rest of us ran dangers were you not snape 
 
 my orders were to remain behind said snape perhaps you disagree with the dark lord perhaps you think that dumbledore would not have noticed if i had joined forces with the death eaters to fight the order of the phoenix andforgive meyou speak of dangers you were facing six teenagers were you not 
 
 they were joined as you very well know by half of the order before long snarled bellatrix and while we are on the subject of the order you still claim you cannot reveal the whereabouts of their headquarters you 
 
 i am not the i cannot speak the name of the place you understand how the enchantment works i think the dark lord is satisfied with the information i have passed him on the order it led as perhaps you have guessed to the recent capture and murder of emmeline vance and it certainly helped dispose of sirius black though i give you full credit for finishing him off 
 
 he inclined his head and toasted her her expression did nor soften 
 
 you are avoiding my last question snape harry potter you could have killed him at any point in the past five years you have not done it why 
 
 have you discussed this matter with the dark lord asked snape 
 
 he lately we i am asking you snape 
 
 if i had murdered harry potter the dark lord could not have used his blood to regenerate making him invincible 
 
 you claim you foresaw his use of the boy she jeered 
 
 i do not claim it i had no idea of his plans i have already confessed that i thought the dark lord dead i am merely trying to explain why the dark lord is not sorry that potter survived at least until a year ago 
 
 but why did you keep him alive 
 
 have you not understood me it was only protection that was keeping me out of azkaban do you disagree that murdering his favorite student might have turned him against me but there was more to it than that i should remind you that when potter first arrived at hogwarts there were still many stories circulating about him rumors that he himself was a great dark wizard which was how he had survived the dark attack indeed many of the dark old followers thought potter might be a standard around which we could all rally once more i was curious i admit it and not at all inclined to murder him the moment he set foot in the castle 
 
 of course it became apparent to me very quickly that he had no extraordinary talent at all he has fought his way out of a number of tight corners by a simple combination of sheer luck and more talented friends he is mediocre to the last degree though as obnoxious and as was his father before him i have done my utmost to have him thrown out of hogwarts where i believe he scarcely belongs but kill him or allow him to be killed in front of me i would have been a fool to risk it with dumbledore close at hand 
 
 and through all this we are supposed to believe dumbledore has never suspected you asked bellatrix he has no idea of your true allegiance he trusts you implicitly still 
 
 i have played my part well said snape and you overlook greatest weakness he has to believe the best of people i spun him a tale of deepest remorse when i joined his staff fresh from my death eater days and he embraced me with open armsthough as i say never allowing me nearer the dark arts than he could help dumbledore has been a great wizardoh yes he has for bellatrix had made a scathing noise the dark lord acknowledges it i am pleased to say however that dumbledore is growing old the duel with the dark lord last month shook him he has since sustained a serious injury because his reactions are slower than they once were but through all these years he has never stopped trusting severus snape and therein lies my great value to the dark lord 
 
 bellatrix still looked unhappy though she appeared unsure how best to attack snape next taking advantage of her silence snape turned to her sister 
 
 now you came to ask me for help narcissa 
 
 narcissa looked up at him her face eloquent with despair 
 
 yes severus think you are the only one who can help me i have nowhere else to turn lucius is in jail and 
 
 she closed her eyes and two large tears seeped from beneath her eyelids 
 
 the dark lord has forbidden me to speak of it narcissa continued her eyes still closed he wishes none to know of the plan it is very secret but 
 
 if he has forbidden it you ought not to speak said snape at once the dark word is law 
 
 narcissa gasped as though he had doused her with cold water bellatrix looked satisfied for the first time since she had entered the house 
 
 there she said triumphantly to her sister even snape says so you were told not to talk so hold your silence 
 
 but snape had gotten to his feet and strode to the small window peered through the curtains at the deserted street then closed them again with a jerk he turned around to face narcissa frowning 
 
 it so happens that i know of the plan he said in a low voice i am one of the few the dark lord has told nevertheless had i not been in on the secret narcissa you would have been guilty of great treachery to the dark lord 
 
 i thought you must know about it said narcissa breathing more freely he trusts you so severus 
 
 you know about the plan said bellatrix her fleeting expression of satisfaction replaced by a look of outrage you know 
 
 certainly said snape but what help do you require narcissa if you are imagining i can persuade the dark lord to change his mind i am afraid there is no hope none at all 
 
 severus she whispered tears sliding down her pale cheeks my son my only son 
 
 draco should be proud said bellatrix indifferently the dark lord is granting him a great honor and i will say this for draco he shrinking away from his duty he seems glad of a chance to prove himself excited at the prospect 
 
 narcissa began to cry in earnest gazing beseechingly all the while at snape 
 
 because he is sixteen and has no idea what lies in store why severus why my son it is too dangerous this is vengeance lor mistake i know it 
 
 snape said nothing he looked away from the sight of her tears as though they were indecent but he could not pretend not to hear her 
 
 why chosen draco it she persisted to punish lucius 
 
 if draco succeeds said snape still looking away from her he will be honored above all others 
 
 but he succeed sobbed narcissa how can he when the dark lord himself 
 
 bellatrix gasped narcissa seemed to lose her nerve 
 
 i only meant that nobody has yet succeeded severus please you are you have always been favorite teacher you are old friend i beg you you are the dark favorite his most trusted advisor will you speak to him persuade him 
 
 the dark lord will not be persuaded and i am not stupid enough to attempt it said snape flatly i cannot pretend that the dark lord is not angry with lucius lucius was supposed to be in charge he got himself captured along with how many others and failed to retrieve the prophecy into the bargain yes the dark lord is angry narcissa very angry indeed 
 
 then i am right he has chosen draco in revenge choked narcissa he does not mean him to succeed he wants him to be killed trying 
 
 when snape said nothing narcissa seemed to lose what little she still possessed standing up she staggered to snape and seized the front of his robes her face close to his her tears falling onto his chest she gasped you could do it you could do it instead of draco severus you would succeed of course you would and he would reward you beyond all of us 
 
 snape caught hold of her wrists and removed her clutching hands looking down into her tearstained face he said slowly he intends me to do it in the end i think but he is determined that draco should try first you see in the unlikely event that draco succeeds i shall be able to remain at hogwarts a little longer fulfilling my useful role as spy 
 
 in other words it matter to him if draco is killed 
 
 the dark lord is very angry repeated snape quietly he failed to hear the prophecy you know as well as i do narcissa that he does not forgive easily 
 
 she crumpled falling at his feet sobbing and moaning on the floor 
 
 my only son my only son 
 
 you should be proud said bellatrix ruthlessly if i had sons i would be glad to give them up to the service of the dark lord 
 
 narcissa gave a little scream of despair and clutched at her long blonde hair snape stooped seized her by the arms lifted her up and steered her back onto the sofa he then poured her more wine iind forced the glass into her hand 
 
 narcissa enough drink this listen to me 
 
 she quieted a little slopping wine down herself she took a shaky sip 
 
 it might be possible for me to help draco 
 
 she sat up her face her eyes huge 
 
 severusoh severusyou would help him would you look after him see he comes to no harm 
 
 i can try 
 
 she flung away her glass it skidded across the table as she slid off the sofa into a kneeling position at feet seized his hand in both of hers and pressed her lips to it 
 
 if you are there to protect him severus will you swear it will you make the unbreakable vow 
 
 the unbreakable vow 
 
 expression was blank unreadable bellatrix however let out a cackle of triumphant laughter 
 
 you listening narcissa oh try sure the usual empty words the usual slithering out of action oh on the dark orders of course 
 
 snape did not look at bellatrix his black eyes were fixed upon blue ones as she continued to clutch his hand 
 
 certainly narcissa i shall make the unbreakable vow he said quietly perhaps your sister will consent to be our bonder 
 
 mouth fell open snape lowered himself so that he was kneeling opposite narcissa beneath astonished gaze they grasped right hands 
 
 you will need your wand bellatrix said snape coldly 
 
 she drew it still looking astonished 
 
 and you will need to move a little closer he said 
 
 she stepped forward so that she stood over them and placed the tip of her wand on their linked hands 
 
 narcissa spoke 
 
 will you severus watch over my son draco as he attempts ta fulfill the dark wishes 
 
 i will said snape 
 
 a thin tongue of brilliant flame issued from the wand and wound its way around their hands like a wire 
 
 and will you to the best of your ability protect him from harm 
 
 i will said snape 
 
 a second tongue of flame shot from the wand and interlinked with the first making a fine glowing chain 
 
 and should it prove necessary if it seems draco will fail whispered narcissa hand twitched within hers but he did not draw away will you carry out the deed that the dark lord has ordered draco to perform 
 
 there was a silence bellatrix watched her wand upon their clasped hands her eyes wide 
 
 i will said snape 
 
 astounded face glowed red in the blaze of a third unique flame which shot from the wand twisted with the others and bound itself thickly around their clasped hands like a fiery snake

lionfish nov chapter two endcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 many miles away the chilly mist that had pressed against the prime windows drifted over a dirty river that wound between overgrown banks an immense chimney relic of a disused mill reared up shadowy and ominous there was no sound apart from the whisper of the black water and no sign of life apart from a scrawny fox that had slunk down the bank to nose hopefully at some old wrappings in the tall grass 
 
 but then with a very faint pop a slim hooded figure appeared out of thin air on the edge of the river the fox froze wary eyes fixed upon this strange new phenomenon the figure seemed to take its bearings for a few moments then set off with light quick strides its long cloak rustling over the grass 
 
 with a second and louder pop another hooded figure materialized 
 
 wait 
 
 the harsh cry startled the fox now crouching almost flat in the undergrowth it leapt from its hiding place and up the bank there was a flash of green light a yelp and the fox fell back to the ground dead 
 
 the second figure turned over the animal with its toe 
 
 just a fox said a voice dismissively from under the hood i thought perhaps an aurorcissy wait 
 
 but her quarry who had paused and looked back at the flash of light was already scrambling up the bank the fox had just fallen down 
 
 cissynarcissalisten to me 
 
 the second woman caught the first and seized her arm but the other wrenched it away 
 
 go back bella 
 
 you must listen to me 
 
 listened already made my decision leave me alone 
 
 the woman named narcissa gained the top of the bank where a line of old railings separated the river from a narrow cobbled street the other woman bella followed at once side by side they stood looking across the road at the rows and rows of dilapidated brick houses their windows dull and blind in the darkness 
 
 he lives here asked bella in a voice of contempt here in this muggle dunghill we must be the first of our kind ever to set foot 
 
 but narcissa was not listening she had slipped through a gap in the rusty railings and was already hurrying across the road 
 
 cissy wait 
 
 bella followed her cloak streaming behind and saw narcissa darting through an alley between the houses into a second almost identical street some of the streetlamps were broken the two women were running between patches of light and deep darkness the pursuer caught up with her prey just as she turned another corner this time succeeding in catching hold of her arm and swinging her around so that they faced each other 
 
 cissy you must not do this you trust him 
 
 the dark lord trusts him he 
 
 the dark lord is i believe mistaken bella panted and her eyes gleamed momentarily under her hood as she looked around to check that they were indeed alone in any case we were told not to speak of the plan to anyone this is a betrayal of the dark 
 
 let go bella snarled narcissa and she drew a wand from beneath her cloak holding it threateningly in the face bella merely laughed 
 
 cissy your own sister you 
 
 there is nothing i do anymore narcissa breathed a note of hysteria in her voice and as she brought down the wand like a knife there was another flash of light bella let go of her arm as though burned 
 
 narcissa 
 
 but narcissa had rushed ahead rubbing her hand her pursuer followed again keeping her distance now as they moved deeper into the deserted labyrinth of brick houses at last narcissa hurried up a street named end over which the towering mill chimney seemed to hover like a giant admonitory finger her footsteps echoed on the cobbles as she passed boarded and broken windows until she reached the very last house where a dim light glimmered through the curtains in a downstairs room 
 
 she had knocked on the door before bella cursing under her breath had caught up together they stood waiting panting slightly breathing in the smell of the dirty river that was carried to them on the night breeze after a few seconds they heard movement behind the door and it opened a crack a sliver of a man could be seen looking out at them a man with long black hair parted in curtains around a sallow face and black eyes 
 
 narcissa threw back her hood she was so pale that she seemed to shine in the darkness the long blonde hair streaming down her back gave her the look of a drowned person 
 
 narcissa said the man opening the door a little wider so that the light fell upon her and her sister too what a pleasant surprise 
 
 severus she said in a strained whisper may i speak to you urgent 
 
 but of course 
 
 he stood back to allow her to pass him into the house her sister followed without invitation 
 
 snape she said curtly as she passed him 
 
 bellatrix he replied his thin mouth curling into a slightly mocking smile as he closed the door with a snap behind them 
 
 they had stepped directly into a tiny sitting room which had the feeling of a dark padded cell the walls were completely covered in books most of them bound in old black or brown leather a threadbare sofa an old armchair and a rickety table stood grouped together in a pool of dim light cast by a lamp hung from the ceiling the place had an air of neglect as though it was not usually inhabited 
 
 snape gestured narcissa to the sofa she threw off her cloak cast it aside and sat down staring at her white and trembling hands clasped in her lap bellatrix lowered her hood more slowly dark as her sister was fair with heavily lidded eyes and a strong jaw she did not take her gaze from snape as she moved to stand behind narcissa 
 
 so what can i do for you snape asked settling himself in the armchair opposite the two sisters 
 
 we we are alone we narcissa asked quietly 
 
 yes of course well here but not counting vermin are we 
 
 he pointed his wand at the wall of books behind him and with a bang a hidden door flew open revealing a narrow staircase upon which a small man stood frozen 
 
 as you have clearly realized wormtail we have guests said snape lazily 
 
 the man crept hunchbacked down the last few steps and moved into the room he had small watery eyes a pointed nose and wore an unpleasant simper his left hand was caressing his right which looked as though it was encased in a bright silver glove 
 
 narcissa he said in a squeaky voice and bellatrix how charming 
 
 wormtail will get us drinks if like them said snape and then he will return to his bedroom 
 
 wormtail winced as though snape had thrown something at him 
 
 i am not your servant he squeaked avoiding eye 
 
 really i was under the impression that the dark lord placed you here to assist me 
 
 to assist yesbut not to make you drinks andand clean your house 
 
 i had no idea wormtail that you were craving more dangerous assignments said snape silkily this can be easily arranged i shall speak to the dark lord 
 
 i can speak to him myself if i want to 
 
 of course you can said snape sneering but in the meantime bring us drinks some of the wine will do 
 
 wormtail hesitated for a moment looking as though he might argue but then turned and headed through a second hidden door they heard banging and a clinking of glasses within seconds he was back bearing a dusty bottle and three glasses upon a tray he dropped these on the rickety table and scurried from their presence slamming the door behind him 
 
 snape poured out three glasses of wine and handed two of them to the sisters narcissa murmured a word of thanks whilst bellatrix said nothing but continued to glower at snape this did not seem to discompose him on the contrary he looked rather amused 
 
 the dark lord he said raising his glass and draining it 
 
 the sisters copied him snape refilled their glasses 
 
 as narcissa took her second drink she said in a rush severus sorry to come here like this but i had to see you i think you are the only one who can help me 
 
 snape held up a hand to stop her then pointed his wand again at the concealed staircase door there was a loud bang and a squeal followed by the sound of wormtail scurrying back up the stairs 
 
 my apologies said snape he has lately taken to listening at doors i know what he means by it you were saying narcissa 
 
 she took a great shuddering breath and started again 
 
 severus i know i ought not to be here i have been told to say nothing to anyone but 
 
 then you ought to hold your tongue snarled bellatrix particularly in present company 
 
 present company repeated snape sardonically and what am i to understand by that bellatrix 
 
 that i trust you snape as you very well know 
 
 narcissa let out a noise that might have been a dry sob and covered her face with her hands snape set his glass down upon the table and sat back again his hands upon the arms of his chair smiling into glowering face 
 
 narcissa i think we ought to hear what bellatrix is bursting to say it will save tedious interruptions well continue bellatrix said snape why is it that you do not trust me 
 
 a hundred reasons she said loudly striding out from behind the sofa to slam her glass upon the table where to start where were you when the dark lord fell why did you never make any attempt to find him when he vanished what have you been doing all these years that lived in pocket why did you stop the dark lord procuring the stone why did you not return at once when the dark lord was reborn where were you a few weeks ago when we battled to retrieve the prophecy for the dark lord and why snape is harry potter still alive when you have had him at your mercy for five years 
 
 she paused her chest rising and falling rapidly the color high in her cheeks behind her narcissa sat motionless her face still hidden in her hands 
 
 snape smiled 
 
 before i answer youoh yes bellatrix i am going to answer you can carry my words back to the others who whisper behind my back and carry false tales of my treachery to the dark lord before i answer you i say let me ask a question in turn do you really think that the dark lord has not asked me each and every one of those questions and do you really think that had i not been able to give satisfactory answers i would be sitting here talking to you 
 
 she hesitated 
 
 i know he believes you but 
 
 you think he is mistaken or that i have somehow hoodwinked him fooled the dark lord the greatest wizard the most accomplished legilimens the world has ever seen 
 
 bellatrix said nothing but looked for the first time a little discomfited snape did not press the point he picked up his drink again sipped it and continued you ask where i was when the dark lord fell i was where he had ordered me to be at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry because he wished me to spy upon albus dumbledore you know i presume that it was on the dark orders that i took up the post 
 
 she nodded almost imperceptibly and then opened her mouth but snape forestalled her 
 
 you ask why i did not attempt to find him when he vanished for the same reason that avery yaxley the carrows greyback lucius he inclined his head slightly to narcissa and many others did not attempt to find him i believed him finished i am not proud of it i was wrong but there it is if he had not forgiven we who lost faith at that time he would have very few followers left 
 
 have me said bellatrix passionately i who spent many years in azkaban for him 
 
 yes indeed most admirable said snape in a bored voice of course you a lot of use to him in prison but the gesture was undoubtedly fine 
 
 gesture she shrieked in her fury she looked slightly mad while i endured the dementors you remained at hogwarts comfortably playing pet 
 
 not quite said snape calmly he give me the defense against the dark arts job you know seemed to think it might ah bring about a relapse tempt me into my old ways 
 
 this was your sacrifice for the dark lord not to teach your favorite subject she jeered why did you stay there all that time snape still spying on dumbledore for a master you believed dead

 but you return when he came back you fly back to him at once when you felt the dark mark burn 
 
 correct i returned two hours later i returned on orders

 if he has forbidden it you ought not to speak said snape at once the dark word is law 
 
 narcissa gasped as though he had doused her with cold water bellatrix looked satisfied for the first time since she had entered the house 
 
 there she said triumphantly to her sister even snape says so you were told not to talk so hold your silence 
 
 but snape had gotten to his feet and strode to the small window peered through the curtains at the deserted street then closed them again with a jerk he turned around to face narcissa frowning 
 
 it so happens that i know of the plan he said in a low voice i am one of the few the dark lord has told nevertheless had i not been in on the secret narcissa you would have been guilty of great treachery to the dark lord 
 
 i thought you must know about it said narcissa breathing more freely he trusts you so severus 
 
 you know about the plan said bellatrix her fleeting expression of satisfaction replaced by a look of outrage you know 
 
 certainly said snape but what help do you require narcissa if you are imagining i can persuade the dark lord to change his mind i am afraid there is no hope none at all 
 
 severus she whispered tears sliding down her pale cheeks my son my only son 
 
 draco should be proud said bellatrix indifferently the dark lord is granting him a great honor and i will say this for draco he shrinking away from his duty he seems glad of a chance to prove himself excited at the prospect 
 
 narcissa began to cry in earnest gazing beseechingly all the while at snape 
 
 because he is sixteen and has no idea what lies in store why severus why my son it is too dangerous this is vengeance lor mistake i know it 
 
 snape said nothing he looked away from the sight of her tears as though they were indecent but he could not pretend not to hear her 
 
 why chosen draco it she persisted to punish lucius 
 
 if draco succeeds said snape still looking away from her he will be honored above all others 
 
 but he succeed sobbed narcissa how can he when the dark lord himself 
 
 bellatrix gasped narcissa seemed to lose her nerve 
 
 i only meant that nobody has yet succeeded severus please you are you have always been favorite teacher you are old friend i beg you you are the dark favorite his most trusted advisor will you speak to him persuade him 
 
 the dark lord will not be persuaded and i am not stupid enough to attempt it said snape flatly i cannot pretend that the dark lord is not angry with lucius lucius was supposed to be in charge he got himself captured along with how many others and failed to retrieve the prophecy into the bargain yes the dark lord is angry narcissa very angry indeed 
 
 then i am right he has chosen draco in revenge choked narcissa he does not mean him to succeed he wants him to be killed trying 
 
 when snape said nothing narcissa seemed to lose what little she still possessed standing up she staggered to snape and seized the front of his robes her face close to his her tears falling onto his chest she gasped you could do it you could do it instead of draco severus you would succeed of course you would and he would reward you beyond all of us 
 
 snape caught hold of her wrists and removed her clutching hands looking down into her tearstained face he said slowly he intends me to do it in the end i think but he is determined that draco should try first you see in the unlikely event that draco succeeds i shall be able to remain at hogwarts a little longer fulfilling my useful role as spy 
 
 in other words it matter to him if draco is killed 
 
 the dark lord is very angry repeated snape quietly he failed to hear the prophecy you know as well as i do narcissa that he does not forgive easily 
 
 she crumpled falling at his feet sobbing and moaning on the floor 
 
 my only son my only son 
 
 you should be proud said bellatrix ruthlessly if i had sons i would be glad to give them up to the service of the dark lord 
 
 narcissa gave a little scream of despair and clutched at her long blonde hair snape stooped seized her by the arms lifted her up and steered her back onto the sofa he then poured her more wine iind forced the glass into her hand 
 
 narcissa enough drink this listen to me 
 
 she quieted a little slopping wine down herself she took a shaky sip 
 
 it might be possible for me to help draco 
 
 she sat up her face her eyes huge 
 
 severusoh severusyou would help him would you look after him see he comes to no harm 
 
 i can try 
 
 she flung away her glass it skidded across the table as she slid off the sofa into a kneeling position at feet seized his hand in both of hers and pressed her lips to it 
 
 if you are there to protect him severus will you swear it will you make the unbreakable vow 
 
 the unbreakable vow 
 
 expression was blank unreadable bellatrix however let out a cackle of triumphant laughter 
 
 you listening narcissa oh try sure the usual empty words the usual slithering out of action oh on the dark orders of course 
 
 snape did not look at bellatrix his black eyes were fixed upon blue ones as she continued to clutch his hand 
 
 certainly narcissa i shall make the unbreakable vow he said quietly perhaps your sister will consent to be our bonder 
 
 mouth fell open snape lowered himself so that he was kneeling opposite narcissa beneath astonished gaze they grasped right hands 
 
 you will need your wand bellatrix said snape coldly 
 
 she drew it still looking astonished 
 
 and you will need to move a little closer he said 
 
 she stepped forward so that she stood over them and placed the tip of her wand on their linked hands 
 
 narcissa spoke 
 
 will you severus watch over my son draco as he attempts ta fulfill the dark wishes 
 
 i will said snape 
 
 a thin tongue of brilliant flame issued from the wand and wound its way around their hands like a wire 
 
 and will you to the best of your ability protect him from harm 
 
 i will said snape 
 
 a second tongue of flame shot from the wand and interlinked with the first making a fine glowing chain 
 
 and should it prove necessary if it seems draco will fail whispered narcissa hand twitched within hers but he did not draw away will you carry out the deed that the dark lord has ordered draco to perform 
 
 there was a silence bellatrix watched her wand upon their clasped hands her eyes wide 
 
 i will said snape 
 
 astounded face glowed red in the blaze of a third unique flame which shot from the wand twisted with the others and bound itself thickly around their clasped hands like a fiery snake

 harry potter 
 
 the half blood prince 
 

lionfish nov chapter two in memorandumcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 harry was bleeding clutching his right hand in his left and swearing under his breath he shouldered open his bedroom door there was a crunch of breaking china he had trodden on a cup of cold tea that had been sitting on the floor outside his bedroom door 
 
 what the c 
 
 he looked around the landing of number four privet drive was deserted possibly the cup of tea was dudleys idea of a clever booby trap keeping his bleeding hand elevated harry scraped the fragments of cup together with the other hand and threw them into the already crammed bin just visible inside his bedroom door then he tramped across to the bathroom to run his finger under the tap 
 
 it was stupid pointless irritating beyond belief that he still had four days left of being unable to perform magicbut he had to admit to himself that this jagged cut in his finger would have defeated him he had never learned how to repair wounds and now he came to think of it c particularly in light of his immediate plans c this seemed a serious flaw in his magical education making a mental note to ask hermione how it was done he used a large wad of toilet paper to mop up as much of the tea as he could before returning to his bedroom and slamming the door behind him 
 
 harry had spent the morning completely emptying his school trunk for the first time since he had packed it six years ago at the start of the intervening school years he had merely skimmed off the topmost three quarters of the contents and replaced or updated them leaving a layer of general debris at the bottom c old quills desiccated beetle eyes single socks that no longer fit minutes previously harry had plunged his hand into this mulch experienced a stabbing pain in the fourth finger of his right hand and withdrawn it to see a lot of blood 
 
 he now proceeded a little more cautiously kneeling down beside the trunk again he groped around in the bottom and after retrieving an old badge that flickered feebly between support cedric diggory and potter stinks a cracked and sneakoscope and a gold locket inside which a note signed had been hidden he finally discovered the sharp edge that had done the damage he recognized it at once it was a fragment of the enchanted mirror that his dead godfather sirius had given him harry laid it aside and felt cautiously around the trunk for the rest but nothing more remained of his godfathers last gift except powdered glass which clung to the deepest layer of debris like glittering grit 
 
 harry sat up and examined the jagged piece on which he had cut himself seeing nothing but his own bright green eye reflected back at him then he placed the fragment on top of that mornings daily prophet which lay unread on the bed and attempted to stem the sudden upsurge of bitter memories the stabs of regret and of longing the discovery of the broken mirror had occasioned by attacking the rest of the rubbish in the trunk 
 
 it took another hour to empty it completely throw away the useless items and sort the remainder in piles according to whether or not he would need them from now on his school and quidditch robes cauldron parchment quills and most of his textbooks were piled in a corner to be left behind he wondered what his aunt and uncle would do with them burn them in the dead of night probably as if they were evidence of some dreadful crime his muggle clothing invisibility cloak kit certain books the photograph album hagrid had once given him a stack of letters and his wand had been repacked into an old rucksack in a front pocket were the marauders map and the locket with the note signed inside it the locket was accorded this place of honor not because it was valuable c in all usual senses it was worthless c but because of what it had cost to attain it 
 
 this left a sizable stack of newspapers sitting on his desk beside his snowy owl hedwig one for each of the days harry had spent at privet drive this summer 
 
 he got up off the floor stretched and moved across to his desk hedwig made no movement as he began to flick through newspapers throwing them into the rubbish pile one by one the owl was asleep or else faking she was angry with harry about the limited amount of time she was allowed out of her cage at the moment 
 
 as he neared the bottom of the pile of newspapers harry slowed down searching for one particular issue that he knew had arrived shortly after he had returned to privet drive for the summer he remembered that there had been a small mention on the front about the resignation of charity burbage the muggle studies teacher at hogwarts at last he found it turning to page ten he sank into his desk chair and reread the article he had been looking for 
 
 albus dumbledore remembered 
 by elphias doge 
 i met albus dumbledore at the age of eleven on our first day at hogwarts our mutual attraction was undoubtedly due to the fact that we both felt ourselves to be outsiders i had contracted dragon pox shortly before arriving at school and while i was no longer contagious my visage and greenish hue did not encourage many to approach me for his part albus had arrived at hogwarts under the burden of unwanted notoriety scarcely a year previously his father percival had been convicted of a savage and attack upon three young muggles 
 
 albus never attempted to deny that his father who was to die in azkaban had committed this crime on the contrary when i plucked up courage to ask him he assured me that he knew his father to be guilty beyond that dumbledore refused to speak of the sad business though many attempted to make him do so some indeed were disposed to praise his fathers action and assumed that albus too was a they could not have been more mistaken as anybody who knew albus would attest he never revealed the remotest tendency indeed his determined support for muggle rights gained him many enemies in subsequent years 
 
 in a matter of months however albuss own fame had begun to eclipse that of his father by the end of his first year he would never again be known as the son of a but as nothing more or less than the most brilliant student ever seen at the school those of us who were privileged to be his friends benefited from his example not to mention his help and encouragement with which he was always generous he confessed to me later in life that he knew even then that his greatest pleasure lay in teaching 
 
 he not only won every prize of note that the school offered he was soon in regular correspondence with the most notable magical names of the day including nicolas flamel the celebrated alchemist bathilda bagshot the noted historian and adalbert waffling the magical theoretician several of his papers found their way into learned publications such as transfiguration today challenges in charming and the practical potioneer dumbledores future career seemed likely to be meteoric and the only question that remained was when he would become minister of magic though it was often predicted in later years that he was on the point of taking the job however he never had ministerial ambitions 
 
 three years after we had started at hogwarts albuss brother aberforth arrived at school they were not alike aberforth was never bookish and unlike albus preferred to settle arguments by dueling rather than through reasoned discussion however it is quite wrong to suggest as some have that the brothers were not friends they rubbed along as comfortably as two such different boys could do in fairness to aberforth it must be admitted that living in albuss shadow cannot have been an altogether comfortable experience being continually outshone was an occupational hazard of being his friend and cannot have been any more pleasurable as a brother when albus and i left hogwarts we intended to take the tour of the world together visiting and observing foreign wizards before pursuing our separate careers however tragedy intervened on the very eve of our trip albuss mother kendra died leaving albus the head and sole breadwinner of the family i postponed my departure long enough to pay my respects at kendras funeral then left for what was now to be a solitary journey with a younger brother and sister to care for and little gold left to them there could no longer be any question of albus accompanying me 
 
 that was the period of our lives when we had least contact i wrote to albus describing perhaps insensitively the wonders of my journey from narrow escapes from chimaeras in greece to the experiments of the egyptian alchemists his letters told me little of his life which i guessed to be frustratingly dull for such a brilliant wizard immersed in my own experiences it was with horror that i heard toward the end of my years travels that another tragedy had struck the dumbledores the death of his sister ariana 
 
 though ariana had been in poor health for a long time the blow coming so soon after the loss of their mother had a profound effect on both of her brothers all those closest to albus c and i count myself one of that lucky number c agree that arianas death and albuss feeling of personal responsibility for it though of course he was guiltless left their mark upon him forevermore 
 
 i returned home to find a young man who had experienced a much older persons suffering albus was more reserved than before and much less to add to his misery the loss of ariana had led not to a renewed closeness between albus and aberforth but to an estrangement in time this would lift c in later years they reestablished if not a close relationship then certainly a cordial one however he rarely spoke of his parents or of ariana from then on and his friends learned not to mention them 
 
 other quills will describe the triumphs of the following years dumbledores innumerable contributions to the store of wizarding knowledge including his discovery of the twelve uses of dragons blood will benefit generations to come as will the wisdom he displayed in the many judgments while chief warlock of the wizengamot they say still that no wizarding duel ever matched that between dumbledore and grindelwald in those who witnessed it have written of the terror and the awe they felt as they watched these two extraordinary wizards to battle dumbledores triumph and its consequences for the wizarding world are considered a turning point in magical history to match the introduction of the international statute of secrecy or the downfall of 
 
 albus dumbledore was never proud or vain he could find something to value in anyone however apparently insignificant or wretched and i believe that his early losses endowed him with great humanity and sympathy i shall miss his friendship more than i can say but my loss is nothing compared to the wizarding worlds that he was the most inspiring and best loved of all hogwarts headmasters cannot be in question he died as he lived working always for the greater good and to his last hour as willing to stretch out a hand to a small boy with dragon pox as he was on the day i met him 
 
 harry finished reading but continued to gaze at the picture accompanying the obituary dumbledore was wearing his familiar kindly smile but as he peered over the top of his spectacles he gave the impression even in newsprint of harry whose sadness mingled with a sense of humiliation 
 
 he had thought he knew dumbledore quite well but ever since reading this obituary he had been forced to recognize that he had barely known him at all never once had he imagined dumbledores childhood or youth it was as though he had sprung into being as harry had known him venerable and and old the idea of a teenage dumbledore was simply odd like trying to imagine a stupid hermione or a friendly skrewt 
 
 he had never thought to ask dumbledore about his past no doubt it would have felt strange impertinent even but after all it had been common knowledge that dumbledore had taken part in that legendary duel with grindelwald and harry had not thought to ask dumbledore what that had been like nor about any of his other famous achievements no they had always discussed harry harrys past harrys future harrys plans and it seemed to harry now despite the fact that his future was so dangerous and so uncertain that he had missed irreplaceable opportunities when he had failed to ask dumbledore more about himself even though the only personal question he had ever asked his headmaster was also the only one he suspected that dumbledore had not answered honestly 
 
 what do you see when you look in the mirror 
 
 i i see myself holding a pair of thick woolen socks 
 
 after several minutes thought harry tore the obituary out of the prophet folded it carefully and tucked it inside the first volume of practical defensive magic and its use against the dark arts then he threw the rest of the newspaper onto the rubbish pile and turned to face the room it was much tidier the only things left out of place were todays daily prophet still lying on the bed and on top of it the piece of broken mirror 
 
 harry moved across the room slid the mirror fragment off todays prophet and unfolded the newspaper he had merely glanced at the headline when he had taken the paper from the delivery owl early that morning and thrown it aside after noting that it said nothing about voldemort harry was sure that the ministry was leaning on the prophet to suppress news about voldemort it was only now therefore that he saw what he had missed 
 
 across the bottom half of the front page a smaller headline was set over a picture of dumbledore striding along looking harried 
 
 dumbledore c the truth at last 
 coming next week the shocking story of the flawed genius considered by many to be the greatest wizard of his generation striping away the popular image of serene wisdom rita skeeter reveals the disturbed childhood the lawless youth the feuds and the guilty secrets that dumbledore carried to his grave why was the man tipped to be the minister of magic content to remain a mere headmaster what was the real purpose of the secret organization known as the order of the phoenix how did dumbledore really meet his end 
 
 the answers to these and many more questions are explored in the explosive new biography the life and lies of albus dumbledore by rita skeeter exclusively interviewed by berry braithwaite page inside 
 
 harry ripped open the paper and found page thirteen the article was topped with a picture showing another familiar face a woman wearing jeweled glasses with elaborately curled blonde hair her teeth bared in what was clearly supposed to be a winning smile wiggling her fingers up at him doing his best to ignore this nauseating image harry read on 
 
 in person rita skeeter is much warmer and softer than her famously ferocious might suggest greeting me in the hallway of her cozy home she leads me straight into the kitchen for a cup of tea a slice of pound cake and it goes without saying a steaming vat of freshest gossip 
 
 well of course dumbledore is a biographers dream says skeeter such a long full life im sure my book will be the first of very very many 
 
 skeeter was certainly quick off the mark her book was completed in a mere four weeks after dumbledores mysterious death in june i ask her how she managed this superfast feat 
 
 oh when youve been a journalist as long as i have working to a deadline is second nature i knew that the wizarding world was clamoring for the full story and i wanted to be the first to meet that need 
 
 i mention the recent widely publicized remarks of elphias doge special advisor to the wizengamot and longstanding friend of albus dumbledores that skeeters book contains less fact than a chocolate frog card 
 
 skeeter throws back her head and laughs 
 
 darling dodgy i remember interviewing him a few years back about merpeople rights bless him completely gaga seemed to think we were sitting at the bottom of lake windermere kept telling me to watch out for trout 
 
 and yet elphias doges accusations of inaccuracy have been echoed in many places does skeeter really feel that four short weeks have been enough to gain a full picture of dumbledores long and extraordinary life 
 
 oh my dear beams skeeter rapping me affectionately across the knuckles you know as well as i do how much information can be generated by a fat bag of galleons a refusal to hear the word no and a nice sharp quill people were queuing to dish the dirt on dumbledore anyway not everyone thought he was so wonderful you know c he trod on an awful lot of important toes but old dodgy doge can get off his high hippogriff because ive had access to a source most journalists would swap their wands for one who has never spoken in public before and who was close to dumbledore during the most turbulent and disturbing phase of his youth 
 
 the advance publicity for skeeters biography has certainly suggested that there will be shocks in store for those who believe dumbledore to have led a blameless life what were the biggest surprises she uncovered i ask 
 
 now come off it betty im not giving away all the highlights before anybodys bought the book laughs skeeter but i can promise that anybody who still thinks dumbledore was white as his beard is in for a rude awakening lets just say that nobody hearing him rage against would have dreamed that he dabbled in the dark arts himself in his youth and for a wizard who spent his later years pleading for tolerance he wasnt exactly when he was younger yes albus dumbledore had an extremely murky past not to mention that very fishy family which he worked so hard to keep hushed up 
 
 i ask whether skeeter is referring to dumbledores brother aberforth whose conviction by the wizengamot for misuse of magic caused a minor scandal fifteen years ago 
 
 oh aberforth is just the tip of the dung heap laughs skeeter no no im talking about much worse than a brother with a fondness for fiddling about with goats worse even than the father c dumbledore couldnt keep either of them quiet anyway they were both charged by the wizengamot no its the mother and the sister that intrigued me and a little digging uncovered a positive nest of nastiness c but as i say youll have to wait for chapters nine to twelve for full details all i can say now is its no wonder dumbledore never talked about how his nose got broken 
 
 family skeletons notwithstanding does skeeter deny the brilliance that led to dumbledores many magical discoveries 
 
 he had brains she concedes although many now question whether he could really take full credit for all of his supposed achievements as i reveal in chapter sixteen ivor dillonsby claims he had already discovered eight uses of dragons blood when dumbledore borrowed his papers 
 
 but the importance of some of dumbledores achievements cannot i venture be denied what of his famous defeat of grindelwald 
 
 oh now im glad you mentioned grindelwald says skeeter with such a tantalizing smile im afraid those who go over dumbledores spectacular victory must brace themselves for a bombshell c or perhaps a dungbomb very dirty business indeed all ill say is dont be so sure that there really was a spectacular duel of legend after theyve read my book people may be forced to conclude that grindelwald simply conjured a white handkerchief from the end of his wand and came quietly 
 
 skeeter refuses to give any more away on this intriguing subject so we turn instead to the relationship that will undoubtedly fascinate her readers more than any other 
 
 oh yes says skeeter nodding briskly i devote an entire chapter to the whole relationship its been called unhealthy even sinister again your readers will have to buy my book for the whole story but there is no question that dumbledore took an unnatural interest in potter from the word go whether that was really in the boys best interests c well well see its certainly an open secret that potter has had a most troubled adolescence 
 
 i ask whether skeeter is still in touch with harry potter whom she so famously interviewed last year a breakthrough piece in which potter spoke exclusively of his conviction that had returned 
 
 oh yes weve developed a closer bond says skeeter poor potter has few real friends and we met at one of the most testing moments of his life c the triwizard tournament i am probably one of the only people alive who can say that they know the real harry potter 
 
 which leads us neatly to the many rumors still circulating about dumbledores final hours does skeeter believe that potter was there when dumbledore died 
 
 well i dont want to say too much c its all in the book c but eyewitnesses inside hogwarts castle saw potter running away from the scene moments after dumbledore fell jumped or was pushed potter later gave evidence against severus snape a man against whom he has a notorious grudge is everything as it seems that is for the wizarding community to decide c once theyve read my book 
 
 on that intriguing note i take my leave there can be no doubt that skeeter has quilled an instant bestseller dumbledores legion of admirers meanwhile may well be trembling at what is soon to emerge about their hero 
 
 
 
 
 harry reached the bottom of the article but continued to stare blankly at the page revulsion and fury rose in him like vomit he balled up the newspaper and threw it with all his force at the wall where it joined the rest of the rubbish heaped around his overflowing bin 
 
 he began to stride blindly around the room opening empty drawers and picking up books only to replace them on the same piles barely conscious of what he was doing as random phrases from ritas article echoed in his head an entire chapter to the whole relationship its been called unhealthy even sinister he dabbled in the dark arts himself in his youth ive had access to a source most journalists would swap their wands for 
 
 lies harry bellowed and through the window he saw the neighbor who had paused to restart his lawn mower look up nervously 
 
 harry sat down hard on the bed the broken bit of mirror danced away from him he picked it up and turned it over in his fingers thinking thinking of dumbledore and the lies with which rita skeeter was defaming him 
 
 a flash of brightest blue harry froze his cut finger slipping on the jagged edge of the mirror again he had imagined it he must have done he glanced over his shoulder but the wall was a sickly peach color of aunt petunias choosing there was nothing blue there for the mirror to reflect he peered into the mirror fragment again and saw nothing but his own bright green eye looking back at him 
 
 he had imagined it there was no other explanation imagined it because he had been thinking of his dead headmaster if anything was certain it was that the bright blue eyes of albus dumbledore would never pierce him again

 though ariana had been in poor health for a long time the blow coming so soon after the loss of their mother had a profound effect on both of her brothers all those closest to albus c and i count myself one of that lucky number c agree that arianas death and albuss feeling of personal responsibility for it though of course he was guiltless left their mark upon him forevermore 
 
 i returned home to find a young man who had experienced a much older persons suffering albus was more reserved than before and much less to add to his misery the loss of ariana had led not to a renewed closeness between albus and aberforth but to an estrangement in time this would lift c in later years they reestablished if not a close relationship then certainly a cordial one however he rarely spoke of his parents or of ariana from then on and his friends learned not to mention them 
 
 other quills will describe the triumphs of the following years dumbledores innumerable contributions to the store of wizarding knowledge including his discovery of the twelve uses of dragons blood will benefit generations to come as will the wisdom he displayed in the many judgments while chief warlock of the wizengamot they say still that no wizarding duel ever matched that between dumbledore and grindelwald in those who witnessed it have written of the terror and the awe they felt as they watched these two extraordinary wizards to battle dumbledores triumph and its consequences for the wizarding world are considered a turning point in magical history to match the introduction of the international statute of secrecy or the downfall of 
 
 albus dumbledore was never proud or vain he could find something to value in anyone however apparently insignificant or wretched and i believe that his early losses endowed him with great humanity and sympathy i shall miss his friendship more than i can say but my loss is nothing compared to the wizarding worlds that he was the most inspiring and best loved of all hogwarts headmasters cannot be in question he died as he lived working always for the greater good and to his last hour as willing to stretch out a hand to a small boy with dragon pox as he was on the day i met him 
 
 harry finished reading but continued to gaze at the picture accompanying the obituary dumbledore was wearing his familiar kindly smile but as he peered over the top of his spectacles he gave the impression even in newsprint of harry whose sadness mingled with a sense of humiliation 
 
 he had thought he knew dumbledore quite well but ever since reading this obituary he had been forced to recognize that he had barely known him at all never once had he imagined dumbledores childhood or youth it was as though he had sprung into being as harry had known him venerable and and old the idea of a teenage dumbledore was simply odd like trying to imagine a stupid hermione or a friendly skrewt 
 
 he had never thought to ask dumbledore about his past no doubt it would have felt strange impertinent even but after all it had been common knowledge that dumbledore had taken part in that legendary duel with grindelwald and harry had not thought to ask dumbledore what that had been like nor about any of his other famous achievements no they had always discussed harry harrys past harrys future harrys plans and it seemed to harry now despite the fact that his future was so dangerous and so uncertain that he had missed irreplaceable opportunities when he had failed to ask dumbledore more about himself even though the only personal question he had ever asked his headmaster was also the only one he suspected that dumbledore had not answered honestly 
 
 what do you see when you look in the mirror 
 
 i i see myself holding a pair of thick woolen socks 
 
 after several minutes thought harry tore the obituary out of the prophet folded it carefully and tucked it inside the first volume of practical defensive magic and its use against the dark arts then he threw the rest of the newspaper onto the rubbish pile and turned to face the room it was much tidier the only things left out of place were todays daily prophet still lying on the bed and on top of it the piece of broken mirror 
 
 harry moved across the room slid the mirror fragment off todays prophet and unfolded the newspaper he had merely glanced at the headline when he had taken the paper from the delivery owl early that morning and thrown it aside after noting that it said nothing about voldemort harry was sure that the ministry was leaning on the prophet to suppress news about voldemort it was only now therefore that he saw what he had missed 
 
 across the bottom half of the front page a smaller headline was set over a picture of dumbledore striding along looking harried 
 
 dumbledore c the truth at last 
 coming next week the shocking story of the flawed genius considered by many to be the greatest wizard of his generation striping away the popular image of serene wisdom rita skeeter reveals the disturbed childhood the lawless youth the feuds and the guilty secrets that dumbledore carried to his grave why was the man tipped to be the minister of magic content to remain a mere headmaster what was the real purpose of the secret organization known as the order of the phoenix how did dumbledore really meet his end 
 
 the answers to these and many more questions are explored in the explosive new biography the life and lies of albus dumbledore by rita skeeter exclusively interviewed by berry braithwaite page inside 
 
 harry ripped open the paper and found page thirteen the article was topped with a picture showing another familiar face a woman wearing jeweled glasses with elaborately curled blonde hair her teeth bared in what was clearly supposed to be a winning smile wiggling her fingers up at him doing his best to ignore this nauseating image harry read on 
 
 in person rita skeeter is much warmer and softer than her famously ferocious might suggest greeting me in the hallway of her cozy home she leads me straight into the kitchen for a cup of tea a slice of pound cake and it goes without saying a steaming vat of freshest gossip 
 
 well of course dumbledore is a biographers dream says skeeter such a long full life im sure my book will be the first of very very many 
 
 skeeter was certainly quick off the mark her book was completed in a mere four weeks after dumbledores mysterious death in june i ask her how she managed this superfast feat 
 
 oh when youve been a journalist as long as i have working to a deadline is second nature i knew that the wizarding world was clamoring for the full story and i wanted to be the first to meet that need 
 
 i mention the recent widely publicized remarks of elphias doge special advisor to the wizengamot and longstanding friend of albus dumbledores that skeeters book contains less fact than a chocolate frog card 
 
 skeeter throws back her head and laughs 
 
 darling dodgy i remember interviewing him a few years back about merpeople rights bless him completely gaga seemed to think we were sitting at the bottom of lake windermere kept telling me to watch out for trout 
 
 and yet elphias doges accusations of inaccuracy have been echoed in many places does skeeter really feel that four short weeks have been enough to gain a full picture of dumbledores long and extraordinary life 
 
 oh my dear beams skeeter rapping me affectionately across the knuckles you know as well as i do how much information can be generated by a fat bag of galleons a refusal to hear the word no and a nice sharp quill people were queuing to dish the dirt on dumbledore anyway not everyone thought he was so wonderful you know c he trod on an awful lot of important toes but old dodgy doge can get off his high hippogriff because ive had access to a source most journalists would swap their wands for one who has never spoken in public before and who was close to dumbledore during the most turbulent and disturbing phase of his youth 
 
 the advance publicity for skeeters biography has certainly suggested that there will be shocks in store for those who believe dumbledore to have led a blameless life what were the biggest surprises she uncovered i ask 
 
 now come off it betty im not giving away all the highlights before anybodys bought the book laughs skeeter but i can promise that anybody who still thinks dumbledore was white as his beard is in for a rude awakening lets just say that nobody hearing him rage against would have dreamed that he dabbled in the dark arts himself in his youth and for a wizard who spent his later years pleading for tolerance he wasnt exactly when he was younger yes albus dumbledore had an extremely murky past not to mention that very fishy family which he worked so hard to keep hushed up 
 
 i ask whether skeeter is referring to dumbledores brother aberforth whose conviction by the wizengamot for misuse of magic caused a minor scandal fifteen years ago 
 
 oh aberforth is just the tip of the dung heap laughs skeeter no no im talking about much worse than a brother with a fondness for fiddling about with goats worse even than the father c dumbledore couldnt keep either of them quiet anyway they were both charged by the wizengamot no its the mother and the sister that intrigued me and a little digging uncovered a positive nest of nastiness c but as i say youll have to wait for chapters nine to twelve for full details all i can say now is its no wonder dumbledore never talked about how his nose got broken 
 
 family skeletons notwithstanding does skeeter deny the brilliance that led to dumbledores many magical discoveries 
 
 he had brains she concedes although many now question whether he could really take full credit for all of his supposed achievements as i reveal in chapter sixteen ivor dillonsby claims he had already discovered eight uses of dragons blood when dumbledore borrowed his papers 
 
 but the importance of some of dumbledores achievements cannot i venture be denied what of his famous defeat of grindelwald 
 
 oh now im glad you mentioned grindelwald says skeeter with such a tantalizing smile im afraid those who go over dumbledores spectacular victory must brace themselves for a bombshell c or perhaps a dungbomb very dirty business indeed all ill say is dont be so sure that there really was a spectacular duel of legend after theyve read my book people may be forced to conclude that grindelwald simply conjured a white handkerchief from the end of his wand and came quietly 
 
 skeeter refuses to give any more away on this intriguing subject so we turn instead to the relationship that will undoubtedly fascinate her readers more than any other 
 
 oh yes says skeeter nodding briskly i devote an entire chapter to the whole relationship its been called unhealthy even sinister again your readers will have to buy my book for the whole story but there is no question that dumbledore took an unnatural interest in potter from the word go whether that was really in the boys best interests c well well see its certainly an open secret that potter has had a most troubled adolescence 
 
 i ask whether skeeter is still in touch with harry potter whom she so famously interviewed last year a breakthrough piece in which potter spoke exclusively of his conviction that had returned 
 
 oh yes weve developed a closer bond says skeeter poor potter has few real friends and we met at one of the most testing moments of his life c the triwizard tournament i am probably one of the only people alive who can say that they know the real harry potter 
 
 which leads us neatly to the many rumors still circulating about dumbledores final hours does skeeter believe that potter was there when dumbledore died 
 
 well i dont want to say too much c its all in the book c but eyewitnesses inside hogwarts castle saw potter running away from the scene moments after dumbledore fell jumped or was pushed potter later gave evidence against severus snape a man against whom he has a notorious grudge is everything as it seems that is for the wizarding community to decide c once theyve read my book 
 
 on that intriguing note i take my leave there can be no doubt that skeeter has quilled an instant bestseller dumbledores legion of admirers meanwhile may well be trembling at what is soon to emerge about their hero 
 
 
 
 
 harry reached the bottom of the article but continued to stare blankly at the page revulsion and fury rose in him like vomit he balled up the newspaper and threw it with all his force at the wall where it joined the rest of the rubbish heaped around his overflowing bin 
 
 he began to stride blindly around the room opening empty drawers and picking up books only to replace them on the same piles barely conscious of what he was doing as random phrases from ritas article echoed in his head an entire chapter to the whole relationship its been called unhealthy even sinister he dabbled in the dark arts himself in his youth ive had access to a source most journalists would swap their wands for 
 
 lies harry bellowed and through the window he saw the neighbor who had paused to restart his lawn mower look up nervously 
 
 harry sat down hard on the bed the broken bit of mirror danced away from him he picked it up and turned it over in his fingers thinking thinking of dumbledore and the lies with which rita skeeter was defaming him 
 
 a flash of brightest blue harry froze his cut finger slipping on the jagged edge of the mirror again he had imagined it he must have done he glanced over his shoulder but the wall was a sickly peach color of aunt petunias choosing there was nothing blue there for the mirror to reflect he peered into the mirror fragment again and saw nothing but his own bright green eye looking back at him 
 
 he had imagined it there was no other explanation imagined it because he had been thinking of his dead headmaster if anything was certain it was that the bright blue eyes of albus dumbledore would never pierce him again 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the deathly hallows
