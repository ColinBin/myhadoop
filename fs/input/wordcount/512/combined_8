 adeimantus socrates 
 here adeimantus interposed a question how would you answer socrates said he if a person were to say that you are making these people miserable and that they are the cause of their own unhappiness the city in fact belongs to them but they are none the better for it whereas other men acquire lands and build large and handsome houses and have everything handsome about them offering sacrifices to the gods on their own account and practising hospitality moreover as you were saying just now they have gold and silver and all that is usual among the favourites of fortune but our poor citizens are no better than mercenaries who are quartered in the city and are always mounting guard 
 yes i said and you may add that they are only fed and not paid in addition to their food like other men and therefore they cannot if they would take a journey of pleasure they have no money to spend on a mistress or any other luxurious fancy which as the world goes is thought to be happiness and many other accusations of the same nature might be added 
 but said he let us suppose all this to be included in the charge 
 you mean to ask i said what will be our answer 
 yes 
 if we proceed along the old path my belief i said is that we shall find the answer and our answer will be that even as they are our guardians may very likely be the happiest of men but that our aim in founding the state was not the disproportionate happiness of any one class but the greatest happiness of the whole we thought that in a state which is ordered with a view to the good of the whole we should be most likely to find justice and in the state injustice and having found them we might then decide which of the two is the happier at present i take it we are fashioning the happy state not piecemeal or with a view of making a few happy citizens but as a whole and we will proceed to view the opposite kind of state suppose that we were painting a statue and some one came up to us and said why do you not put the most beautiful colours on the most beautiful parts of the body the eyes ought to be purple but you have made them black to him we might fairly answer sir you would not surely have us beautify the eyes to such a degree that they are no longer eyes consider rather whether by giving this and the other features their due proportion we make the whole beautiful and so i say to you do not compel us to assign to the guardians a sort of happiness which will make them anything but guardians for we too can clothe our husbandmen in royal apparel and set crowns of gold on their heads and bid them till the ground as much as they like and no more our potters also might be allowed to repose on couches and feast by the fireside passing round the winecup while their wheel is conveniently at hand and working at pottery only as much as they like in this way we might make every class then as you imagine the whole state would be happy but do not put this idea into our heads for if we listen to you the husbandman will be no longer a husbandman the potter will cease to be a potter and no one will have the character of any distinct class in the state now this is not of much consequence where the corruption of society and pretension to be what you are not is confined to cobblers but when the guardians of the laws and of the government are only seemingly and not real guardians then see how they turn the state upside down and on the other hand they alone have the power of giving order and happiness to the state we mean our guardians to be true saviours and not the destroyers of the state whereas our opponent is thinking of peasants at a festival who are enjoying a life of revelry not of citizens who are doing their duty to the state but if so we mean different things and he is speaking of something which is not a state and therefore we must consider whether in appointing our guardians we would look to their greatest happiness individually or whether this principle of happiness does not rather reside in the state as a whole but the latter be the truth then the guardians and auxillaries and all others equally with them must be compelled or induced to do their own work in the best way and thus the whole state will grow up in a noble order and the several classes will receive the proportion of happiness which nature assigns to them 
 i think that you are quite right 
 i wonder whether you will agree with another remark which occurs to me 
 what may that be 
 there seem to be two causes of the deterioration of the arts 
 what are they 
 wealth i said and poverty 
 how do they act 
 the process is as follows when a potter becomes rich will he think you any longer take the same pains with his art 
 certainly not 
 he will grow more and more indolent and careless 
 very true 
 and the result will be that he becomes a worse potter 
 yes he greatly deteriorates 
 but on the other hand if he has no money and cannot provide himself tools or instruments he will not work equally well himself nor will he teach his sons or apprentices to work equally well 
 certainly not 
 then under the influence either of poverty or of wealth workmen and their work are equally liable to degenerate 
 that is evident 
 here then is a discovery of new evils i said against which the guardians will have to watch or they will creep into the city unobserved 
 what evils 
 wealth i said and poverty the one is the parent of luxury and indolence and the other of meanness and viciousness and both of discontent 
 that is very true he replied but still i should like to know socrates how our city will be able to go to war especially against an enemy who is rich and powerful if deprived of the sinews of war 
 there would certainly be a difficulty i replied in going to war with one such enemy but there is no difficulty where there are two of them 
 how so he asked 
 in the first place i said if we have to fight our side will be trained warriors fighting against an army of rich men 
 that is true he said 
 and do you not suppose adeimantus that a single boxer who was perfect in his art would easily be a match for two stout and gentlemen who were not boxers 
 hardly if they came upon him at once 
 what not i said if he were able to run away and then turn and strike at the one who first came up and supposing he were to do this several times under the heat of a scorching sun might he not being an expert overturn more than one stout personage 
 certainly he said there would be nothing wonderful in that 
 and yet rich men probably have a greater superiority in the science and practice of boxing than they have in military qualities 
 likely enough 
 then we may assume that our athletes will be able to fight with two or three times their own number 
 i agree with you for i think you right 
 and suppose that before engaging our citizens send an embassy to one of the two cities telling them what is the truth silver and gold we neither have nor are permitted to have but you may do you therefore come and help us in war of and take the spoils of the other city who on hearing these words would choose to fight against lean wiry dogs rather th than with the dogs on their side against fat and tender sheep 
 that is not likely and yet there might be a danger to the poor state if the wealth of many states were to be gathered into one 
 but how simple of you to use the term state at all of any but our own 
 why so 
 you ought to speak of other states in the plural number not one of them is a city but many cities as they say in the game for indeed any city however small is in fact divided into two one the city of the poor the other of the rich these are at war with one another and in either there are many smaller divisions and you would be altogether beside the mark if you treated them all as a single state but if you deal with them as many and give the wealth or power or persons of the one to the others you will always have a great many friends and not many enemies and your state while the wise order which has now been prescribed continues to prevail in her will be the greatest of states i do not mean to say in reputation or appearance but in deed and truth though she number not more than a thousand defenders a single state which is her equal you will hardly find either among hellenes or barbarians though many that appear to be as great and many times greater 
 that is most true he said 
 and what i said will be the best limit for our rulers to fix when they are considering the size of the state and the amount of territory which they are to include and beyond which they will not go 
 what limit would you propose 
 i would allow the state to increase so far as is consistent with unity that i think is the proper limit 
 very good he said 
 here then i said is another order which will have to be conveyed to our guardians let our city be accounted neither large nor small but one and 
 and surely said he this is not a very severe order which we impose upon them 
 and the other said i of which we were speaking before is lighter still i mean the duty of degrading the offspring of the guardians when inferior and of elevating into the rank of guardians the offspring of the lower classes when naturally superior the intention was that in the case of the citizens generally each individual should be put to the use for which nature which nature intended him one to one work and then every man would do his own business and be one and not many and so the whole city would be one and not many 
 yes he said that is not so difficult 
 the regulations which we are prescribing my good adeimantus are not as might be supposed a number of great principles but trifles all if care be taken as the saying is of the one great thing a thing however which i would rather call not great but sufficient for our purpose 
 what may that be he asked 
 education i said and nurture if our citizens are well educated and grow into sensible men they will easily see their way through all these as well as other matters which i omit such for example as marriage the possession of women and the procreation of children which will all follow the general principle that friends have all things in common as the proverb says 
 that will be the best way of settling them 
 also i said the state if once started well moves with accumulating force like a wheel for good nurture and education implant good constitutions and these good constitutions taking root in a good education improve more and more and this improvement affects the breed in man as in other animals 
 very possibly he said 
 then to sum up this is the point to which above all the attention of our rulers should be directed that music and gymnastic be preserved in their original form and no innovation made they must do their utmost to maintain them intact and when any one says that mankind most regard 
 the newest song which the singers have they will be afraid that he may be praising not new songs but a new kind of song and this ought not to be praised or conceived to be the meaning of the poet for any musical innovation is full of danger to the whole state and ought to be prohibited so damon tells me and i can quite believe says that when modes of music change of the state always change with them 
 yes said adeimantus and you may add my suffrage to and your own 
 then i said our guardians must lay the foundations of their fortress in music 
 yes he said the lawlessness of which you speak too easily steals in 
 yes i replied in the form of amusement and at first sight it appears harmless 
 why yes he said and there is no harm were it not that little by little this spirit of licence finding a home imperceptibly penetrates into manners and customs whence issuing with greater force it invades contracts between man and man and from contracts goes on to laws and constitutions in utter recklessness ending at last socrates by an overthrow of all rights private as well as public 
 is that true i said 
 that is my belief he replied 
 then as i was saying our youth should be trained from the first in a stricter system for if amusements become lawless and the youths themselves become lawless they can never grow up into and virtuous citizens 
 very true he said 
 and when they have made a good beginning in play and by the help of music have gained the habit of good order then this habit of order in a manner how unlike the lawless play of the others will accompany them in all their actions and be a principle of growth to them and if there be any fallen places a principle in the state will raise them up again 
 very true he said 
 thus educated they will invent for themselves any lesser rules which their predecessors have altogether neglected 
 what do you mean 
 i mean such things as these when the young are to be silent before their elders how they are to show respect to them by standing and making them sit what honour is due to parents what garments or shoes are to be worn the mode of dressing the hair deportment and manners in general you would agree with me 
 yes 
 but there is i think small wisdom in legislating about such matters i doubt if it is ever done nor are any precise written enactments about them likely to be lasting 
 impossible 
 it would seem adeimantus that the direction in which education starts a man will determine his future life does not like always attract like 
 to be sure 
 until some one rare and grand result is reached which may be good and may be the reverse of good 
 that is not to be denied 
 and for this reason i said i shall not attempt to legislate further about them 
 naturally enough he replied 
 well and about the business of the agora dealings and the ordinary dealings between man and man or again about agreements with the commencement with artisans about insult and injury of the commencement of actions and the appointment of juries what would you say there may also arise questions about any impositions and extractions of market and harbour dues which may be required and in general about the regulations of markets police harbours and the like but oh heavens shall we condescend to legislate on any of these particulars 
 i think he said that there is no need to impose laws about them on good men what regulations are necessary they will find out soon enough for themselves 
 yes i said my friend if god will only preserve to them the laws which we have given them 
 and without divine help said adeimantus they will go on for ever making and mending their laws and their lives in the hope of attaining perfection 
 you would compare them i said to those invalids who having no will not leave off their habits of intemperance 
 exactly 
 yes i said and what a delightful life they lead they are always doctoring and increasing and complicating their disorders and always fancying that they will be cured by any nostrum which anybody advises them to try 
 such cases are very common he said with invalids of this sort 
 yes i replied and the charming thing is that they deem him their worst enemy who tells them the truth which is simply that unless they give up eating and drinking and wenching and idling neither drug nor cautery nor spell nor amulet nor any other remedy will avail 
 charming he replied i see nothing charming in going into a passion with a man who tells you what is right 
 these gentlemen i said do not seem to be in your good graces 
 assuredly not 
 nor would you praise the behaviour of states which act like the men whom i was just now describing for are there not states in which the citizens are forbidden under pain of death to alter the constitution and yet he who most sweetly courts those who live under this regime and indulges them and fawns upon them and is skilful in anticipating and gratifying their humours is held to be a great and good statesman do not these states resemble the persons whom i was describing 
 yes he said the states are as bad as the men and i am very far from praising them 
 but do you not admire i said the coolness and dexterity of these ready ministers of political corruption 
 yes he said i do but not of all of them for there are some whom the applause of the multitude has deluded into the belief that they are really statesmen and these are not much to be admired 
 what do you mean i said you should have more feeling for them when a man cannot measure and a great many others who cannot measure declare that he is four cubits high can he help believing what they say 
 nay he said certainly not in that case 
 well then do not be angry with them for are they not as good as a play trying their hand at paltry reforms such as i was describing they are always fancying that by legislation they will make an end of frauds in contracts and the other rascalities which i was mentioning not knowing that they are in reality cutting off the heads of a hydra 
 yes he said that is just what they are doing 
 i conceive i said that the true legislator will not trouble himself with this class of enactments whether concerning laws or the constitution either in an or in a state for in the former they are quite useless and in the latter there will be no difficulty in devising them and many of them will naturally flow out of our previous regulations 
 what then he said is still remaining to us of the work of legislation 
 nothing to us i replied but to apollo the god of delphi there remains the ordering of the greatest and noblest and chiefest things of all 
 which are they he said 
 the institution of temples and sacrifices and the entire service of gods demigods and heroes also the ordering of the repositories of the dead and the rites which have to be observed by him who would propitiate the inhabitants of the world below these are matters of which we are ignorant ourselves and as founders of a city we should be unwise in trusting them to any interpreter but our ancestral deity he is the god who sits in the center on the navel of the earth and he is the interpreter of religion to all mankind 
 you are right and we will do as you propose 
 but where amid all this is justice son of ariston tell me where now that our city has been made habitable light a candle and search and get your brother and polemarchus and the rest of our friends to help and let us see where in it we can discover justice and where injustice and in what they differ from one another and which of them the man who would be happy should have for his portion whether seen or unseen by gods and men 
 socrates glaucon 
 nonsense said glaucon did you not promise to search yourself saying that for you not to help justice in her need would be an impiety 
 i do not deny that i said so and as you remind me i will be as good as my word but you must join 
 we will he replied 
 well then i hope to make the discovery in this way i mean to begin with the assumption that our state if rightly ordered is perfect 
 that is most certain 
 and being perfect is therefore wise and valiant and temperate and just 
 that is likewise clear 
 and whichever of these qualities we find in the state the one which is not found will be the residue 
 very good 
 if there were four things and we were searching for one of them wherever it might be the one sought for might be known to us from the first and there would be no further trouble or we might know the other three first and then the fourth would clearly be the one left 
 very true he said 
 and is not a similar method to be pursued about the virtues which are also four in number 
 clearly 
 first among the virtues found in the state wisdom comes into view and in this i detect a certain peculiarity 
 what is that 
 the state which we have been describing is said to be wise as being good in counsel 
 very true 
 and good counsel is clearly a kind of knowledge for not by ignorance but by knowledge do men counsel well 
 clearly 
 and the kinds of knowledge in a state are many and diverse 
 of course 
 there is the knowledge of the carpenter but is that the sort of knowledge which gives a city the title of wise and good in counsel 
 certainly not that would only give a city the reputation of skill in carpentering 
 then a city is not to be called wise because possessing a knowledge which counsels for the best about wooden implements 
 certainly not 
 nor by reason of a knowledge which advises about brazen pots i said nor as possessing any other similar knowledge 
 not by reason of any of them he said 
 nor yet by reason of a knowledge which cultivates the earth that would give the city the name of agricultural 
 yes 
 well i said and is there any knowledge in our recently founded state among any of the citizens which advises not about any particular thing in the state but about the whole and considers how a state can best deal with itself and with other states 
 there certainly is 
 and what is knowledge and among whom is it found i asked 
 it is the knowledge of the guardians he replied and found among those whom we were just now describing as perfect guardians 
 and what is the name which the city derives from the possession of this sort of knowledge 
 the name of good in counsel and truly wise 
 and will there be in our city more of these true guardians or more smiths 
 the smiths he replied will be far more numerous 
 will not the guardians be the smallest of all the classes who receive a name from the profession of some kind of knowledge 
 much the smallest 
 and so by reason of the smallest part or class and of the knowledge which resides in this presiding and ruling part of itself the whole state being thus constituted according to nature will be wise and this which has the only knowledge worthy to be called wisdom has been ordained by nature to be of all classes the least 
 most true 
 thus then i said the nature and place in the state of one of the four virtues has somehow or other been discovered 
 and in my humble opinion very satisfactorily discovered he replied 
 again i said there is no difficulty in seeing the nature of courage and in what part that quality resides which gives the name of courageous to the state 
 how do you mean 
 why i said every one who calls any state courageous or cowardly will be thinking of the part which fights and goes out to war on the behalf 
 no one he replied would ever think of any other 
 certainly not 
 the rest of the citizens may be courageous or may be cowardly but their courage or cowardice will not as i conceive have the effect of making the city either the one or the other 
 the city will be courageous in virtue of a portion of herself which preserves under all circumstances that opinion about the nature of things to be feared and not to be feared in which our legislator educated them and this is what you term courage 
 i should like to hear what you are saying once more for i do not think that i perfectly understand you 
 i mean that courage is a kind of salvation 
 salvation of what 
 of the opinion respecting things to be feared what they are and of what nature which the law implants through education and i mean by the words under all circumstances to intimate that in pleasure or in pain or under the influence of desire or fear a man preserves and does not lose this opinion shall i give you an illustration 
 if you please 
 you know i said that dyers when they want to dye wool for making the true begin by selecting their white colour first this they prepare and dress with much care and pains in order that the white ground may take the purple hue in full perfection the dyeing then proceeds and whatever is dyed in this manner becomes a fast colour and no washing either with lyes or without them can take away the bloom but when the ground has not been duly prepared you will have noticed how poor is the look either of purple or of any other colour 
 yes he said i know that they have a and ridiculous appearance 
 then now i said you will understand what our object was in selecting our soldiers and educating them in music and gymnastic we were contriving influences which would prepare them to take the dye of the laws in perfection and the colour of their opinion about dangers and of every other opinion was to be indelibly fixed by their nurture and training not to be washed away by such potent lyes as pleasure mightier agent far in washing the soul than any soda or lye or by sorrow fear and desire the mightiest of all other solvents and this sort of universal saving power of true opinion in conformity with law about real and false dangers i call and maintain to be courage unless you disagree 
 but i agree he replied for i suppose that you mean to exclude mere uninstructed courage such as that of a wild beast or of a slave this in your opinion is not the courage which the law ordains and ought to have another name 
 most certainly 
 then i may infer courage to be such as you describe 
 why yes said i you may and if you add the words of a citizen you will not be far wrong hereafter if you like we will carry the examination further but at present we are we w seeking not for courage but justice and for the purpose of our enquiry we have said enough 
 you are right he replied 
 two virtues remain to be discovered in the temperance and then justice which is the end of our search 
 very true 
 now can we find justice without troubling ourselves about temperance 
 i do not know how that can be accomplished he said nor do i desire that justice should be brought to light and temperance lost sight of and therefore i wish that you would do me the favour of considering temperance first 
 certainly i replied i should not be justified in refusing your request 
 then consider he said 
 yes i replied i will and as far as i can at present see the virtue of temperance has more of the nature of harmony and symphony than the preceding 
 how so he asked 
 temperance i replied is the ordering or controlling of certain pleasures and desires this is curiously enough implied in the saying of a man being his own master and other traces of the same notion may be found in language 
 no doubt he said 
 there is something ridiculous in the expression master of himself for the master is also the servant and the servant the master and in all these modes of speaking the same person is denoted 
 certainly 
 the meaning is i believe that in the human soul there is a better and also a worse principle and when the better has the worse under control then a man is said to be master of himself and this is a term of praise but when owing to evil education or association the better principle which is also the smaller is overwhelmed by the greater mass of the worse in this case he is blamed and is called the slave of self and unprincipled 
 yes there is reason in that 
 and now i said look at our newly created state and there you will find one of these two conditions realised for the state as you will acknowledge may be justly called master of itself if the words temperance and truly express the rule of the better part over the worse 
 yes he said i see that what you say is true 
 let me further note that the manifold and complex pleasures and desires and pains are generally found in children and women and servants and in the freemen so called who are of the lowest and more numerous class 
 certainly he said 
 whereas the simple and moderate desires which follow reason and are under the guidance of mind and true opinion are to be found only in a few and those the best born and best educated 
 very true these two as you may perceive have a place in our state and the meaner desires of the are held down by the virtuous desires and wisdom of the few 
 that i perceive he said 
 then if there be any city which may be described as master of its own pleasures and desires and master of itself ours may claim such a designation 
 certainly he replied 
 it may also be called temperate and for the same reasons 
 yes 
 and if there be any state in which rulers and subjects will be agreed as to the question who are to rule that again will be our state 
 undoubtedly 
 and the citizens being thus agreed among themselves in which class will temperance be found in the rulers or in the subjects 
 in both as i should imagine he replied 
 do you observe that we were not far wrong in our guess that temperance was a sort of harmony 
 why so 
 why because temperance is unlike courage and wisdom each of which resides in a part only the one making the state wise and the other valiant not so temperance which extends to the whole and runs through all the notes of the scale and produces a harmony of the weaker and the stronger and the middle class whether you suppose them to be stronger or weaker in wisdom or power or numbers or wealth or anything else most truly then may we deem temperance to be the agreement of the naturally superior and inferior as to the right to rule of either both in states and individuals 
 i entirely agree with you 
 and so i said we may consider three out of the four virtues to have been discovered in our state the last of those qualities which make a state virtuous must be justice if we only knew what that was 
 the inference is obvious 
 the time then has arrived glaucon when like huntsmen we should surround the cover and look sharp that justice does not steal away and pass out of sight and escape us for beyond a doubt she is somewhere in this country watch therefore and strive to catch a sight of her and if you see her first let me know 
 would that i could but you should regard me rather as a follower who has just eyes enough to see what you show him that is about as much as i am good for 
 offer up a prayer with me and follow 
 i will but you must show me the way 
 here is no path i said and the wood is dark and perplexing still we must push on 
 let us push on 
 here i saw something halloo i said i begin to perceive a track and i believe that the quarry will not escape 
 good news he said 
 truly i said we are stupid fellows 
 why so 
 why my good sir at the beginning of our enquiry ages ago there was justice tumbling out at our feet and we never saw her nothing could be more ridiculous like people who go about looking for what they have in their hands that was the way with us we looked not at what we were seeking but at what was far off in the distance and therefore i suppose we missed her 
 what do you mean 
 i mean to say that in reality for a long time past we have been talking of justice and have failed to recognise her 
 i grow impatient at the length of your exordium 
 well then tell me i said whether i am right or not you remember the original principle which we were always laying down at the foundation of the state that one man should practise one thing only the thing to which his nature was best adapted now justice is this principle or a part of it 
 yes we often said that one man should do one thing only 
 further we affirmed that justice was doing own business and not being a busybody we said so again and again and many others have said the same to us 
 yes we said so 
 then to do own business in a certain way may be assumed to be justice can you tell me whence i derive this inference 
 i cannot but i should like to be told 
 because i think that this is the only virtue which remains in the state when the other virtues of temperance and courage and wisdom are abstracted and that this is the ultimate cause and condition of the existence of all of them and while remaining in them is also their preservative and we were saying that if the three were discovered by us justice would be the fourth or remaining one 
 that follows of necessity 
 if we are asked to determine which of these four qualities by its presence contributes most to the excellence of the state whether the agreement of rulers and subjects or the preservation in the soldiers of the opinion which the law ordains about the true nature of dangers or wisdom and watchfulness in the rulers or whether this other which i am mentioning and which is found in children and women slave and freeman artisan ruler subject the quality i mean of every one doing his own work and not being a busybody would claim the palm the question is not so easily answered 
 certainly he replied there would be a difficulty in saying which 
 then the power of each individual in the state to do his own work appears to compete with the other political virtues wisdom temperance courage 
 yes he said 
 and the virtue which enters into this competition is justice 
 exactly 
 let us look at the question from another point of view are not the rulers in a state those to whom you would entrust the office of determining suits at law 
 certainly 
 and are suits decided on any other ground but that a man may neither take what is nor be deprived of what is his own 
 yes that is their principle 
 which is a just principle 
 yes 
 then on this view also justice will be admitted to be the having and doing what is a own and belongs to him 
 very true 
 think now and say whether you agree with me or not suppose a carpenter to be doing the business of a cobbler or a cobbler of a carpenter and suppose them to exchange their implements or their duties or the same person to be doing the work of both or whatever be the change do you think that any great harm would result to the state 
 not much 
 but when the cobbler or any other man whom nature designed to be a trader having his heart lifted up by wealth or strength or the number of his followers or any like advantage attempts to force his way into the class of warriors or a warrior into that of legislators and guardians for which he is unfitted and either to take the implements or the duties of the other or when one man is trader legislator and warrior all in one then i think you will agree with me in saying that this interchange and this meddling of one with another is the ruin of the state 
 most true 
 seeing then i said that there are three distinct classes any meddling of one with another or the change of one into another is the greatest harm to the state and may be most justly termed 
 precisely 
 and the greatest degree of to own city would be termed by you injustice 
 certainly 
 this then is injustice and on the other hand when the trader the auxiliary and the guardian each do their own business that is justice and will make the city just 
 i agree with you 
 we will not i said be as yet but if on trial this conception of justice be verified in the individual as well as in the state there will be no longer any room for doubt if it be not verified we must have a fresh enquiry first let us complete the old investigation which we began as you remember under the impression that if we could previously examine justice on the larger scale there would be less difficulty in discerning her in the individual that larger example appeared to be the state and accordingly we constructed as good a one as we could knowing well that in the good state justice would be found let the discovery which we made be now applied to the individual if they agree we shall be satisfied or if there be a difference in the individual we will come back to the state and have another trial of the theory the friction of the two when rubbed together may possibly strike a light in which justice will shine forth and the vision which is then revealed we will fix in our souls 
 that will be in regular course let us do as you say 
 i proceeded to ask when two things a greater and less are called by the same name are they like or unlike in so far as they are called the same 
 like he replied 
 the just man then if we regard the idea of justice only will be like the just state 
 he will 
 and a state was thought by us to be just when the three classes in the state severally did their own business and also thought to be temperate and valiant and wise by reason of certain other affections and qualities of these same classes 
 true he said 
 and so of the individual we may assume that he has the same three principles in his own soul which are found in the state and he may be rightly described in the same terms because he is affected in the same manner 
 certainly he said 
 once more then o my friend we have alighted upon an easy question whether the soul has these three principles or not 
 an easy question nay rather socrates the proverb holds that hard is the good 
 very true i said and i do not think that the method which we are employing is at all adequate to the accurate solution of this question the true method is another and a longer one still we may arrive at a solution not below the level of the previous enquiry 
 may we not be satisfied with that he said under the circumstances i am quite content 
 i too i replied shall be extremely well satisfied 
 then faint not in pursuing the speculation he said 
 must we not acknowledge i said that in each of us there are the same principles and habits which there are in the state and that from the individual they pass into the state how else can they come there take the quality of passion or spirit it would be ridiculous to imagine that this quality when found in states is not derived from the individuals who are supposed to possess it the thracians scythians and in general the northern nations and the same may be said of the love of knowledge which is the special characteristic of our part of the world or of the love of money which may with equal truth be attributed to the phoenicians and egyptians 
 exactly so he said 
 there is no difficulty in understanding this 
 none whatever 
 but the question is not quite so easy when we proceed to ask whether these principles are three or one whether that is to say we learn with one part of our nature are angry with another and with a third part desire the satisfaction of our natural appetites or whether the whole soul comes into play in each sort of action to determine that is the difficulty 
 yes he said there lies the difficulty 
 then let us now try and determine whether they are the same or different 
 how can we he asked 
 i replied as follows the same thing clearly cannot act or be acted upon in the same part or in relation to the same thing at the same time in contrary ways and therefore whenever this contradiction occurs in things apparently the same we know that they are really not the same but different 
 good 
 for example i said can the same thing be at rest and in motion at the same time in the same part 
 impossible 
 still i said let us have a more precise statement of terms lest we should hereafter fall out by the way imagine the case of a man who is standing and also moving his hands and his head and suppose a person to say that one and the same person is in motion and at rest at the same such a mode of speech we should object and should rather say that one part of him is in motion while another is at rest 
 very true 
 and suppose the objector to refine still further and to draw the nice distinction that not only parts of tops but whole tops when they spin round with their pegs fixed on the spot are at rest and in motion at the same time and he may say the same of anything which revolves in the same spot his objection would not be admitted by us because in such cases things are not at rest and in motion in the same parts of themselves we should rather say that they have both an axis and a circumference and that the axis stands still for there is no deviation from the perpendicular and that the circumference goes round but if while revolving the axis inclines either to the right or left forwards or backwards then in no point of view can they be at rest 
 that is the correct mode of describing them he replied 
 then none of these objections will confuse us or incline us to believe that the same thing at the same time in the same part or in relation to the same thing can act or be acted upon in contrary ways 
 certainly not according to my way of thinking 
 yet i said that we may not be compelled to examine all such objections and prove at length that they are untrue let us assume their absurdity and go forward on the understanding that hereafter if this assumption turn out to be untrue all the consequences which follow shall be withdrawn 
 yes he said that will be the best way 
 well i said would you not allow that assent and dissent desire and aversion attraction and repulsion are all of them opposites whether they are regarded as active or passive for that makes no difference in the fact of their opposition 
 yes he said they are opposites 
 well i said and hunger and thirst and the desires in general and again willing and wishing all these you would refer to the classes already mentioned you would say would you not that the soul of him who desires is seeking after the object of his desires or that he is drawing to himself the thing which he wishes to possess or again when a person wants anything to be given him his mind longing for the realisation of his desires intimates his wish to have it by a nod of assent as if he had been asked a question 
 very true 
 and what would you say of unwillingness and dislike and the absence of desire should not these be referred to the opposite class of repulsion and rejection 
 certainly 
 admitting this to be true of desire generally let us suppose a particular class of desires and out of these we will select hunger and thirst as they are termed which are the most obvious of them 
 let us take that class he said 
 the object of one is food and of the other drink 
 yes 
 and here comes the point is not thirst the desire which the soul has of drink and of drink only not of drink qualified by anything else for example warm or cold or much or little or in a word drink of any particular sort but if the thirst be accompanied by heat then the desire is of cold drink or if accompanied by cold then of warm drink or if the thirst be excessive then the drink which is desired will be excessive or if not great the quantity of drink will also be small but thirst pure and simple will desire drink pure and simple which is the natural satisfaction of thirst as food is of hunger 
 yes he said the simple desire is as you say in every case of the simple object and the qualified desire of the qualified object 
 but here a confusion may arise and i should wish to guard against an opponent starting up and saying that no man desires drink only but good drink or food only but good food for good is the universal object of desire and thirst being a desire will necessarily be thirst after good drink and the same is true of every other desire 
 yes he replied the opponent might have something to say 
 nevertheless i should still maintain that of relatives some have a quality attached to either term of the relation others are simple and have their correlatives simple 
 i do not know what you mean 
 well you know of course that the greater is relative to the less 
 certainly 
 and the much greater to the much less 
 yes 
 and the sometime greater to the sometime less and the greater that is to be to the less that is to be 
 certainly he said 
 and so of more and less and of other correlative terms such as the double and the half or again the heavier and the lighter the swifter and the slower and of hot and cold and of any other relatives is not this true of all of them 
 yes 
 and does not the same principle hold in the sciences the object of science is knowledge assuming that to be the true definition but the object of a particular science is a particular kind of knowledge i mean for example that the science of is a kind of knowledge which is defined and distinguished from other kinds and is therefore termed architecture 
 certainly 
 because it has a particular quality which no other has 
 yes 
 and it has this particular quality because it has an object of a particular kind and this is true of the other arts and sciences 
 yes 
 now then if i have made myself clear you will understand my original meaning in what i said about relatives my meaning was that if one term of a relation is taken alone the other is taken alone if one term is qualified the other is also qualified i do not mean to say that relatives may not be disparate or that the science of health is healthy or of disease necessarily diseased or that the sciences of good and evil are therefore good and evil but only that when the term science is no longer used absolutely but has a qualified object which in this case is the nature of health and disease it becomes defined and is hence called not merely science but the science of medicine 
 i quite understand and i think as you do 
 would you not say that thirst is one of these essentially relative terms having clearly a relation 
 yes thirst is relative to drink 
 and a certain kind of thirst is relative to a certain kind of drink but thirst taken alone is neither of much nor little nor of good nor bad nor of any particular kind of drink but of drink only 
 certainly 
 then the soul of the thirsty one in so far as he is thirsty desires only drink for this he yearns and tries to obtain it 
 that is plain 
 and if you suppose something which pulls a thirsty soul away from drink that must be different from the thirsty principle which draws him like a beast to drink for as we were saying the same thing cannot at the same time with the same part of itself act in contrary ways about the same 
 impossible 
 no more than you can say that the hands of the archer push and pull the bow at the same time but what you say is that one hand pushes and the other pulls 
 exactly so he replied 
 and might a man be thirsty and yet unwilling to drink 
 yes he said it constantly happens 
 and in such a case what is one to say would you not say that there was something in the soul bidding a man to drink and something else forbidding him which is other and stronger than the principle which bids him 
 i should say so 
 and the forbidding principle is derived from reason and that which bids and attracts proceeds from passion and disease 
 clearly 
 then we may fairly assume that they are two and that they differ from one another the one with which man reasons we may call the rational principle of the soul the other with which he loves and hungers and thirsts and feels the flutterings of any other desire may be termed the irrational or appetitive the ally of sundry pleasures and satisfactions 
 yes he said we may fairly assume them to be different 
 then let us finally determine that there are two principles existing in the soul and what of passion or spirit is it a third or akin to one of the preceding 
 i should be inclined to say akin to desire 
 well i said there is a story which i remember to have heard and in which i put faith the story is that leontius the son of aglaion coming up one day from the piraeus under the north wall on the outside observed some dead bodies lying on the ground at the place of execution he felt a desire to see them and also a dread and abhorrence of them for a time he struggled and covered his eyes but at length the desire got the better of him and forcing them open he ran up to the dead bodies saying look ye wretches take your fill of the fair sight 
 i have heard the story myself he said 
 the moral of the tale is that anger at times goes to war with desire as though they were two distinct things 
 yes that is the meaning he said 
 and are there not many other cases in which we observe that when a desires violently prevail over his reason he reviles himself and is angry at the violence within him and that in this struggle which is like the struggle of factions in a state his spirit is on the side of his reason but for the passionate or spirited element to take part with the desires when reason that she should not be opposed is a sort of thing which thing which i believe that you never observed occurring in yourself nor as i should imagine in any one else 
 certainly not 
 suppose that a man thinks he has done a wrong to another the nobler he is the less able is he to feel indignant at any suffering such as hunger or cold or any other pain which the injured person may inflict upon him these he deems to be just and as i say his anger refuses to be excited by them 
 true he said 
 but when he thinks that he is the sufferer of the wrong then he boils and chafes and is on the side of what he believes to be justice and because he suffers hunger or cold or other pain he is only the more determined to persevere and conquer his noble spirit will not be quelled until he either slays or is slain or until he hears the voice of the shepherd that is reason bidding his dog bark no more 
 the illustration is perfect he replied and in our state as we were saying the auxiliaries were to be dogs and to hear the voice of the rulers who are their shepherds 
 i perceive i said that you quite understand me there is however a further point which i wish you to consider 
 what point 
 you remember that passion or spirit appeared at first sight to be a kind of desire but now we should say quite the contrary for in the conflict of the soul spirit is arrayed on the side of the rational principle 
 most assuredly 
 but a further question arises is passion different from reason also or only a kind of reason in which latter case instead of three principles in the soul there will only be two the rational and the concupiscent or rather as the state was composed of three classes traders auxiliaries counsellors so may there not be in the individual soul a third element which is passion or spirit and when not corrupted by bad education is the natural auxiliary of reason 
 yes he said there must be a third 
 yes i replied if passion which has already been shown to be different from desire turn out also to be different from reason 
 but that is easily proved we may observe even in young children that they are full of spirit almost as soon as they are born whereas some of them never seem to attain to the use of reason and most of them late enough 
 excellent i said and you may see passion equally in brute animals which is a further proof of the truth of what you are saying and we may once more appeal to the words of homer which have been already quoted by us 
 he smote his breast and thus rebuked his soul for in this verse homer has clearly supposed the power which reasons about the better and worse to be different from the unreasoning anger which is rebuked by it 
 very true he said 
 and so after much tossing we have reached land and are fairly agreed that the same principles which exist in the state exist also in the individual and that they are three in number 
 exactly 
 must we not then infer that the individual is wise in the same way and in virtue of the same quality which makes the state wise 
 certainly 
 also that the same quality which constitutes courage in the state constitutes courage in the individual and that both the state and the individual bear the same relation to all the other virtues 
 assuredly 
 and the individual will be acknowledged by us to be just in the same way in which the state is just 
 that follows of course 
 we cannot but remember that the justice of the state consisted in each of the three classes doing the work of its own class 
 we are not very likely to have forgotten he said 
 we must recollect that the individual in whom the several qualities of his nature do their own work will be just and will do his own work 
 yes he said we must remember that too 
 and ought not the rational principle which is wise and has the care of the whole soul to rule and the passionate or spirited principle to be the subject and ally 
 certainly 
 and as we were saying the united influence of music and gymnastic will bring them into accord nerving and sustaining the reason with noble words and lessons and moderating and soothing and civilizing the wildness of passion by harmony and rhythm 
 quite true he said 
 and these two thus nurtured and educated and having learned truly to know their own functions will rule over the concupiscent which in each of us is the largest part of the soul and by nature most insatiable of gain over this they will keep guard lest waxing great and strong with the fulness of bodily pleasures as they are termed the concupiscent soul no longer confined to her own sphere should attempt to enslave and rule those who are not her subjects and overturn the whole life of man 
 very true he said 
 both together will they not be the best defenders of the whole soul and the whole body against attacks from without the one counselling and the other fighting under his leader and courageously executing his commands and counsels 
 true 
 and he is to be deemed courageous whose spirit retains in pleasure and in pain the commands of reason about what he ought or ought not to fear 
 right he replied 
 and him we call wise who has in him that little part which rules and which proclaims these commands that part too being supposed to have a knowledge of what is for the interest of each of the three parts and of the whole 
 assuredly 
 and would you not say that he is temperate who has these same elements in friendly harmony in whom the one ruling principle of reason and the two subject ones of spirit and desire are equally agreed that reason ought to rule and do not rebel 
 certainly he said that is the true account of temperance whether in the state or individual 
 and surely i said we have explained again and again how and by virtue of what quality a man will be just 
 that is very certain 
 and is justice dimmer in the individual and is her form different or is she the same which we found her to be in the state 
 there is no difference in my opinion he said 
 because if any doubt is still lingering in our minds a few commonplace instances will satisfy us of the truth of what i am saying 
 what sort of instances do you mean 
 if the case is put to us must we not admit that the just state or the man who is trained in the principles of such a state will be less likely than the unjust to make away with a deposit of gold or silver would any one deny this 
 no one he replied 
 will the just man or citizen ever be guilty of sacrilege or theft or treachery either to his friends or to his country 
 never 
 neither will he ever break faith where there have been oaths or agreements 
 impossible 
 no one will be less likely to commit adultery or to dishonour his father and mother or to fall in his religious duties 
 no one 
 and the reason is that each part of him is doing its own business whether in ruling or being ruled 
 exactly so 
 are you satisfied then that the quality which makes such men and such states is justice or do you hope to discover some other 
 not i indeed 
 then our dream has been realised and the suspicion which we entertained at the beginning of our work of construction that some divine power must have conducted us to a primary form of justice has now been verified 
 yes certainly 
 and the division of labour which required the carpenter and the shoemaker and the rest of the citizens to be doing each his own business and not was a shadow of justice and for that reason it was of use 
 clearly 
 but in reality justice was such as we were describing being concerned however not with the outward man but with the inward which is the true self and concernment of man for the just man does not permit the several elements within him to interfere with one another or any of them to do the work of others he sets in order his own inner life and is his own master and his own law and at peace with himself and when he has bound together the three principles within him which may be compared to the higher lower and middle notes of the scale and the intermediate intervals when he has bound all these together and is no longer many but has become one entirely temperate and perfectly adjusted nature then he proceeds to act if he has to act whether in a matter of property or in the treatment of the body or in some affair of politics or private business always thinking and calling that which preserves and with this harmonious condition just and good action and the knowledge which presides over it wisdom and that which at any time impairs this condition he will call unjust action and the opinion which presides over it ignorance 
 you have said the exact truth socrates 
 very good and if we were to affirm that we had discovered the just man and the just state and the nature of justice in each of them we should not be telling a falsehood 
 most certainly not 
 may we say so then 
 let us say so 
 and now i said injustice has to be considered 
 clearly 
 must not injustice be a strife which arises among the three principles a meddlesomeness and interference and rising up of a part of the soul against the whole an assertion of unlawful authority which is made by a rebellious subject against a true prince of whom he is the natural vassal what is all this confusion and delusion but injustice and intemperance and cowardice and ignorance and every form of vice 
 exactly so 
 and if the nature of justice and injustice be known then the meaning of acting unjustly and being unjust or again of acting justly will also be perfectly clear 
 what do you mean he said 
 why i said they are like disease and health being in the soul just what disease and health are in the body 
 how so he said 
 why i said that which is healthy causes health and that which is unhealthy causes disease 
 yes 
 and just actions cause justice and unjust actions cause injustice 
 that is certain 
 and the creation of health is the institution of a natural order and government of one by another in the parts of the body and the creation of disease is the production of a state of things at variance with this natural order 
 true 
 and is not the creation of justice the institution of a natural order and government of one by another in the parts of the soul and the creation of injustice the production of a state of things at variance with the natural order 
 exactly so he said 
 then virtue is the health and beauty and of the soul and vice the disease and weakness and deformity of the same 
 true 
 and do not good practices lead to virtue and evil practices to vice 
 assuredly 
 still our old question of the comparative advantage of justice and injustice has not been answered which is the more profitable to be just and act justly and practise virtue whether seen or unseen of gods and men or to be unjust and act unjustly if only unpunished and unreformed 
 in my judgment socrates the question has now become ridiculous we know that when the bodily constitution is gone life is no longer endurable though pampered with all kinds of meats and drinks and having all wealth and all power and shall we be told that when the very essence of the vital principle is undermined and corrupted life is still worth having to a man if only he be allowed to do whatever he likes with the single exception that he is not to acquire justice and virtue or to escape from injustice and vice assuming them both to be such as we have described 
 yes i said the question is as you say ridiculous still as we are near the spot at which we may see the truth in the clearest manner with our own eyes let us not faint by the way 
 certainly not he replied 
 come up hither i said and behold the various forms of vice those of them i mean which are worth looking at 
 i am following you he replied proceed 
 i said the argument seems to have reached a height from which as from some tower of speculation a man may look down and see that virtue is one but that the forms of vice are innumerable there being four special ones which are deserving of note 
 what do you mean he said 
 i mean i replied that there appear to be as many forms of the soul as there are distinct forms of the state 
 how many 
 there are five of the state and five of the soul i said 
 what are they 
 the first i said is that which we have been describing and which may be said to have two names monarchy and aristocracy accordingly as rule is exercised by one distinguished man or by many 
 true he replied 
 but i regard the two names as describing one form only for whether the government is in the hands of one or many if the governors have been trained in the manner which we have supposed the fundamental laws of the state will be maintained 
 that is true he replied

 book v 
 
 socrates glaucon adeimantus 
 such is the good and true city or state and the good and man is of the same pattern and if this is right every other is wrong and the evil is one which affects not only the ordering of the state but also the regulation of the individual soul and is exhibited in four forms 
 what are they he said 
 i was proceeding to tell the order in which the four evil forms appeared to me to succeed one another when pole marchus who was sitting a little way off just beyond adeimantus began to whisper to him stretching forth his hand he took hold of the upper part of his coat by the shoulder and drew him towards him leaning forward himself so as to be quite close and saying something in his ear of which i only caught the words shall we let him off or what shall we do 
 certainly not said adeimantus raising his voice 
 who is it i said whom you are refusing to let off 
 you he said 
 i repeated why am i especially not to be let off 
 why he said we think that you are lazy and mean to cheat us out of a whole chapter which is a very important part of the story and you fancy that we shall not notice your airy way of proceeding as if it were to everybody that in the matter of women and children friends have all things in common 
 and was i not right adeimantus 
 yes he said but what is right in this particular case like everything else requires to be explained for community may be of many kinds please therefore to say what sort of community you mean we have been long expecting that you would tell us something about the family life of your citizens how they will bring children into the world and rear them when they have arrived and in general what is the nature of this community of women and we are of opinion that the right or wrong management of such matters will have a great and paramount influence on the state for good or for evil and now since the question is still undetermined and you are taking in hand another state we have resolved as you heard not to let you go until you give an account of all this 
 to that resolution said glaucon you may regard me as saying agreed 
 socrates adeimantus glaucon thrasymachus 
 and without more ado said thrasymachus you may consider us all to be equally agreed 
 i said you know not what you are doing in thus assailing me what an argument are you raising about the state just as i thought that i had finished and was only too glad that i had laid this question to sleep and was reflecting how fortunate i was in your acceptance of what i then said you ask me to begin again at the very foundation ignorant of what a nest of words you are stirring now i foresaw this gathering trouble and avoided it 
 for what purpose do you conceive that we have come here said thrasymachus to look for gold or to hear discourse 
 yes but discourse should have a limit 
 yes socrates said glaucon and the whole of life is the only limit which wise men assign to the hearing of such discourses but never mind about us take heart yourself and answer the question in your own way what sort of community of women and children is this which is to prevail among our guardians and how shall we manage the period between birth and education which seems to require the greatest care tell us how these things will be 
 yes my simple friend but the answer is the reverse of easy many more doubts arise about this than about our previous conclusions for the practicability of what is said may be doubted and looked at in another point of view whether the scheme if ever so practicable would be for the best is also doubtful hence i feel a reluctance to approach the subject lest our aspiration my dear friend should turn out to be a dream only 
 fear not he replied for your audience will not be hard upon you they are not sceptical or hostile 
 i said my good friend i suppose that you mean to encourage me by these words 
 yes he said 
 then let me tell you that you are doing just the reverse the encouragement which you offer would have been all very well had i myself believed that i knew what i was talking about to declare the truth about matters of high interest which a man honours and loves among wise men who love him need occasion no fear or faltering in his mind but to carry on an argument when you are yourself only a hesitating enquirer which is my condition is a dangerous and slippery thing and the danger is not that i shall be laughed at of which the fear would be childish but that i shall miss the truth where i have most need to be sure of my footing and drag my friends after me in my fall and i pray nemesis not to visit upon me the words which i am going to utter for i do indeed believe that to be an involuntary homicide is a less crime than to be a deceiver about beauty or goodness or justice in the matter of laws and that is a risk which i would rather run among enemies than among friends and therefore you do well to encourage me 
 glaucon laughed and said well then socrates in case you and your argument do us any serious injury you shall be acquitted beforehand of the and shall not be held to be a deceiver take courage then and speak 
 well i said the law says that when a man is acquitted he is free from guilt and what holds at law may hold in argument 
 then why should you mind 
 well i replied i suppose that i must retrace my steps and say what i perhaps ought to have said before in the proper place the part of the men has been played out and now properly enough comes the turn of the women of them i will proceed to speak and the more readily since i am invited by you 
 for men born and educated like our citizens the only way in my opinion of arriving at a right conclusion about the possession and use of women and children is to follow the path on which we originally started when we said that the men were to be the guardians and watchdogs of the herd 
 true 
 let us further suppose the birth and education of our women to be subject to similar or nearly similar regulations then we shall see whether the result accords with our design 
 what do you mean 
 what i mean may be put into the form of a question i said are dogs divided into hes and shes or do they both share equally in hunting and in keeping watch and in the other duties of dogs or do we entrust to the males the entire and exclusive care of the flocks while we leave the females at home under the idea that the bearing and suckling their puppies is labour enough for them 
 no he said they share alike the only difference between them is that the males are stronger and the females weaker 
 but can you use different animals for the same purpose unless they are bred and fed in the same way 
 you cannot 
 then if women are to have the same duties as men they must have the same nurture and education 
 yes 
 the education which was assigned to the men was music and gymnastic yes 
 then women must be taught music and gymnastic and also the art of war which they must practise like the men 
 that is the inference i suppose 
 i should rather expect i said that several of our proposals if they are carried out being unusual may appear ridiculous 
 no doubt of it 
 yes and the most ridiculous thing of all will be the sight of women naked in the palaestra exercising with the men especially when they are no longer young they certainly will not be a vision of beauty any more than the enthusiastic old men who in spite of wrinkles and ugliness continue to frequent the gymnasia 
 yes indeed he said according to present notions the proposal would be thought ridiculous 
 but then i said as we have determined to speak our minds we must not fear the jests of the wits which will be directed against this sort of innovation how they will talk of attainments both in music and gymnastic and above all about their wearing armour and riding upon horseback 
 very true he replied 
 yet having begun we must go forward to the rough places of the law at the same time begging of these gentlemen for once in their life to be serious not long ago as we shall remind them the hellenes were of the opinion which is still generally received among the barbarians that the sight of a naked man was ridiculous and improper and when first the cretans and then the lacedaemonians introduced the custom the wits of that day might equally have ridiculed the innovation 
 no doubt 
 but when experience showed that to let all things be uncovered was far better than to cover them up and the ludicrous effect to the outward eye vanished before the better principle which reason asserted then the man was perceived to be a fool who directs the shafts of his ridicule at any other sight but that of folly and vice or seriously inclines to weigh the beautiful by any other standard but that of the good 
 very true he replied 
 first then whether the question is to be put in jest or in earnest let us come to an understanding about the nature of woman is she capable of sharing either wholly or partially in the actions of men or not at all and is the art of war one of those arts in which she can or can not share that will be the best way of commencing the enquiry and will probably lead to the fairest conclusion 
 that will be much the best way 
 shall we take the other side first and begin by arguing against ourselves in this manner the position will not be undefended 
 why not he said 
 then let us put a speech into the mouths of our opponents they will say socrates and glaucon no adversary need convict you for you yourselves at the first foundation of the state admitted the principle that everybody was to do the one work suited to his own nature and certainly if i am not mistaken such an admission was made by us and do not the natures of men and women differ very much indeed and we shall reply of course they do then we shall be asked whether the tasks assigned to men and to women should not be different and such as are agreeable to their different natures certainly they should but if so have you not fallen into a serious inconsistency in saying that men and women whose natures are so entirely different ought to perform the same actions what defence will you make for us my good sir against any one who offers these objections 
 that is not an easy question to answer when asked suddenly and i shall and i do beg of you to draw out the case on our side 
 these are the objections glaucon and there are many others of a like kind which i foresaw long ago they made me afraid and reluctant to take in hand any law about the possession and nurture of women and children 
 by zeus he said the problem to be solved is anything but easy 
 why yes i said but the fact is that when a man is out of his depth whether he has fallen into a little swimming bath or into he has to swim all the same 
 very true 
 and must not we swim and try to reach the shore we will hope that dolphin or some other miraculous help may save us 
 i suppose so he said 
 well then let us see if any way of escape can be found we acknowledged did we not that different natures ought to have different pursuits and that and natures are different and now what are we saying that different natures ought to have the same pursuits this is the inconsistency which is charged upon us 
 precisely 
 verily glaucon i said glorious is the power of the art of contradiction 
 why do you say so 
 because i think that many a man falls into the practice against his will when he thinks that he is reasoning he is really disputing just because he cannot define and divide and so know that of which he is speaking and he will pursue a merely verbal opposition in the spirit of contention and not of fair discussion 
 yes he replied such is very often the case but what has that to do with us and our argument 
 a great deal for there is certainly a danger of our getting unintentionally into a verbal opposition 
 in what way 
 why we valiantly and pugnaciously insist upon the verbal truth that different natures ought to have different pursuits but we never considered at all what was the meaning of sameness or difference of nature or why we distinguished them when we assigned different pursuits to different natures and the same to the same natures 
 why no he said that was never considered by us 
 i said suppose that by way of illustration we were to ask the question whether there is not an opposition in nature between bald men and hairy men and if this is admitted by us then if bald men are cobblers we should forbid the hairy men to be cobblers and conversely 
 that would be a jest he said 
 yes i said a jest and why because we never meant when we constructed the state that the opposition of natures should extend to every difference but only to those differences which affected the pursuit in which the individual is engaged we should have argued for example that a physician and one who is in mind a physician may be said to have the same nature 
 true 
 whereas the physician and the carpenter have different natures 
 certainly 
 and if i said the male and female sex appear to differ in their fitness for any art or pursuit we should say that such pursuit or art ought to be assigned to one or the other of them but if the difference consists only in women bearing and men begetting children this does not amount to a proof that a woman differs from a man in respect of the sort of education she should receive and we shall therefore continue to maintain that our guardians and their wives ought to have the same pursuits 
 very true he said 
 next we shall ask our opponent how in reference to any of the pursuits or arts of civic life the nature of a woman differs from that of a man 
 that will be quite fair 
 and perhaps he like yourself will reply that to give a sufficient answer on the instant is not easy but after a little reflection there is no difficulty 
 yes perhaps 
 suppose then that we invite him to accompany us in the argument and then we may hope to show him that there is nothing peculiar in the constitution of women which would affect them in the administration of the state 
 by all means 
 let us say to him come now and we will ask you a question when you spoke of a nature gifted or not gifted in any respect did you mean to say that one man will acquire a thing easily another with difficulty a little learning will lead the one to discover a great deal whereas the other after much study and application no sooner learns than he forgets or again did you mean that the one has a body which is a good servant to his mind while the body of the other is a hindrance to not these be the sort of differences which distinguish the man gifted by nature from the one who is ungifted 
 no one will deny that 
 and can you mention any pursuit of mankind in which the male sex has not all these gifts and qualities in a higher degree than the female need i waste time in speaking of the art of weaving and the management of pancakes and preserves in which womankind does really appear to be great and in which for her to be beaten by a man is of all things the most absurd 
 you are quite right he replied in maintaining the general inferiority of the female sex although many women are in many things superior to many men yet on the whole what you say is true 
 and if so my friend i said there is no special faculty of administration in a state which a woman has because she is a woman or which a man has by virtue of his sex but the gifts of nature are alike diffused in both all the pursuits of men are the pursuits of women also but in all of them a woman is inferior to a man 
 very true 
 then are we to impose all our enactments on men and none of them on women 
 that will never do 
 one woman has a gift of healing another not one is a musician and another has no music in her nature 
 very true 
 and one woman has a turn for gymnastic and military exercises and another is unwarlike and hates gymnastics 
 certainly 
 and one woman is a philosopher and another is an enemy of philosophy one has spirit and another is without spirit 
 that is also true 
 then one woman will have the temper of a guardian and another not was not the selection of the male guardians determined by differences of this sort 
 yes 
 men and women alike possess the qualities which make a guardian they differ only in their comparative strength or weakness 
 obviously 
 and those women who have such qualities are to be selected as the companions and colleagues of men who have similar qualities and whom they resemble in capacity and in character 
 very true 
 and ought not the same natures to have the same pursuits 
 they ought 
 then as we were saying before there is nothing unnatural in assigning music and gymnastic to the wives of the guardians to that point we come round again 
 certainly not 
 the law which we then enacted was agreeable to nature and therefore not an impossibility or mere aspiration and the contrary practice which prevails at present is in reality a violation of nature 
 that appears to be true 
 we had to consider first whether our proposals were possible and secondly whether they were the most beneficial 
 yes 
 and the possibility has been acknowledged 
 yes 
 the very great benefit has next to be established 
 quite so 
 you will admit that the same education which makes a man a good guardian will make a woman a good guardian for their original nature is the same 
 yes 
 i should like to ask you a question 
 what is it 
 would you say that all men are equal in excellence or is one man better than another 
 the latter 
 and in the commonwealth which we were founding do you conceive the guardians who have been brought up on our model system to be more perfect men or the cobblers whose education has been cobbling 
 what a ridiculous question 
 you have answered me i replied well and may we not further say that our guardians are the best of our citizens 
 by far the best 
 and will not their wives be the best women 
 yes by far the best 
 and can there be anything better for the interests of the state than that the men and women of a state should be as good as possible 
 there can be nothing better 
 and this is what the arts of music and gymnastic when present in such manner as we have described will accomplish 
 certainly 
 then we have made an enactment not only possible but in the highest degree beneficial to the state 
 true 
 then let the wives of our guardians strip for their virtue will be their robe and let them share in the toils of war and the defence of their country only in the distribution of labours the lighter are to be assigned to the women who are the weaker natures but in other respects their duties are to be the same and as for the man who laughs at naked women exercising their bodies from the best of motives in his laughter he is plucking 
 a fruit of unripe wisdom and he himself is ignorant of what he is laughing at or what he is about for that is and ever will be the best of sayings that the useful is the noble and the hurtful is the base 
 very true 
 here then is one difficulty in our law about women which we may say that we have now escaped the wave has not swallowed us up alive for enacting that the guardians of either sex should have all their pursuits in common to the utility and also to the possibility of this arrangement the consistency of the argument with itself bears witness 
 yes that was a mighty wave which you have escaped 
 yes i said but a greater is coming you will of this when you see the next 
 go on let me see 
 the law i said which is the sequel of this and of all that has preceded is to the following effect that the wives of our guardians are to be common and their children are to be common and no parent is to know his own child nor any child his parent 
 yes he said that is a much greater wave than the other and the possibility as well as the utility of such a law are far more questionable 
 i do not think i said that there can be any dispute about the very great utility of having wives and children in common the possibility is quite another matter and will be very much disputed 
 i think that a good many doubts may be raised about both 
 you imply that the two questions must be combined i replied now i meant that you should admit the utility and in this way as i thought i should escape from one of them and then there would remain only the possibility 
 but that little attempt is detected and therefore you will please to give a defence of both 
 well i said i submit to my fate yet grant me a little favour let me feast my mind with the dream as day dreamers are in the habit of feasting themselves when they are walking alone for before they have discovered any means of effecting their wishes that is a matter which never troubles them they would rather not tire themselves by thinking about possibilities but assuming that what they desire is already granted to them they proceed with their plan and delight in detailing what they mean to do when their wish has come true that is a way which they have of not doing much good to a capacity which was never good for much now i myself am beginning to lose heart and i should like with your permission to pass over the question of possibility at present assuming therefore the possibility of the proposal i shall now proceed to enquire how the rulers will carry out these arrangements and i shall demonstrate that our plan if executed will be of the greatest benefit to the state and to the guardians first of all then if you have no objection i will endeavour with your help to consider the advantages of the measure and hereafter the question of possibility 
 i have no objection proceed 
 first i think that if our rulers and their auxiliaries are to be worthy of the name which they bear there must be willingness to obey in the one and the power of command in the other the guardians must themselves obey the laws and they must also imitate the spirit of them in any details which are entrusted to their care 
 that is right he said 
 you i said who are their legislator having selected the men will now select the women and give them to them they must be as far as possible of like natures with them and they must live in common houses and meet at common meals none of them will have anything specially his or her own they will be together and will be brought up together and will associate at gymnastic exercises and so they will be drawn by a necessity of their natures to have intercourse with each other necessity is not too strong a word i think 
 yes he said necessity not geometrical but another sort of necessity which lovers know and which is far more convincing and constraining to the mass of mankind 
 true i said and this glaucon like all the rest must proceed after an orderly fashion in a city of the blessed licentiousness is an unholy thing which the rulers will forbid 
 yes he said and it ought not to be permitted 
 then clearly the next thing will be to make matrimony sacred in the highest degree and what is most beneficial will be deemed sacred 
 exactly 
 and how can marriages be made most beneficial that is a question which i put to you because i see in your house dogs for hunting and of the nobler sort of birds not a few now i beseech you do tell me have you ever attended to their pairing and breeding 
 in what particulars 
 why in the first place although they are all of a good sort are not some better than others 
 true 
 and do you breed from them all indifferently or do you take care to breed from the best only 
 from the best 
 and do you take the oldest or the youngest or only those of ripe age 
 i choose only those of ripe age 
 and if care was not taken in the breeding your dogs and birds would greatly deteriorate 
 certainly 
 and the same of horses and animals in general 
 undoubtedly 
 good heavens my dear friend i said what consummate skill will our rulers need if the same principle holds of the human species 
 certainly the same principle holds but why does this involve any particular skill 
 because i said our rulers will often have to practise upon the body corporate with medicines now you know that when patients do not require medicines but have only to be put under a regimen the inferior sort of practitioner is deemed to be good enough but when medicine has to be given then the doctor should be more of a man 
 that is quite true he said but to what are you alluding 
 i mean i replied that our rulers will find a considerable dose of falsehood and deceit necessary for the good of their subjects we were saying that the use of all these things regarded as medicines might be of advantage 
 and we were very right 
 and this lawful use of them seems likely to be often needed in the regulations of marriages and births 
 how so 
 why i said the principle has been already laid down that the best of either sex should be united with the best as often and the inferior with the inferior as seldom as possible and that they should rear the offspring of the one sort of union but not of the other if the flock is to be maintained in condition now these goings on must be a secret which the rulers only know or there will be a further danger of our herd as the guardians may be termed breaking out into rebellion 
 very true 
 had we not better appoint certain festivals at which we will bring together the brides and bridegrooms and sacrifices will be offered and suitable hymeneal songs composed by our poets the number of weddings is a matter which must be left to the discretion of the rulers whose aim will be to preserve the average of population there are many other things which they will have to consider such as the effects of wars and diseases and any similar agencies in order as far as this is possible to prevent the state from becoming either too large or too small 
 certainly he replied 
 we shall have to invent some ingenious kind of lots which the less worthy may draw on each occasion of our bringing them together and then they will accuse their own and not the rulers 
 to be sure he said 
 and i think that our braver and better youth besides their other honours and rewards might have greater facilities of intercourse with women given them their bravery will be a reason and such fathers ought to have as many sons as possible 
 true 
 and the proper officers whether male or female or both for offices are to be held by women as well as by men 
 yes 
 the proper officers will take the offspring of the good parents to the pen or fold and there they will deposit them with certain nurses who dwell in a separate quarter but the offspring of the inferior or of the better when they chance to be deformed will be put away in some mysterious unknown place as they should be 
 yes he said that must be done if the breed of the guardians is to be kept pure 
 they will provide for their nurture and will bring the mothers to the fold when they are full of milk taking the greatest possible care that no mother recognizes her own child and other may be engaged if more are required care will also be taken that the process of suckling shall not be protracted too long and the mothers will have no getting up at night or other trouble but will hand over all this sort of thing to the nurses and attendants 
 you suppose the wives of our guardians to have a fine easy time of it when they are having children 
 why said i and so they ought let us however proceed with our scheme we were saying that the parents should be in the prime of life 
 very true 
 and what is the prime of life may it not be defined as a period of about twenty years in a life and thirty in a 
 which years do you mean to include 
 a woman i said at twenty years of age may begin to bear children to the state and continue to bear them until forty a man may begin at when he has passed the point at which the pulse of life beats quickest and continue to beget children until he be 
 certainly he said both in men and women those years are the prime of physical as well as of intellectual vigour 
 any one above or below the prescribed ages who takes part in the public hymeneals shall be said to have done an unholy and unrighteous thing the child of which he is the father if it steals into life will have been conceived under auspices very unlike the sacrifices and prayers which at each hymeneal priestesses and priest and the whole city will offer that the new generation may be better and more useful than their good and useful parents whereas his child will be the offspring of darkness and strange lust 
 very true he replied 
 and the same law will apply to any one of those within the prescribed age who forms a connection with any woman in the prime of life without the sanction of the rulers for we shall say that he is raising up a bastard to the state uncertified and unconsecrated 
 very true he replied 
 this applies however only to those who are within the specified age after that we allow them to range at will except that a man may not marry his daughter or his daughter or his mother or his mother and women on the other hand are prohibited from marrying their sons or fathers or son or father and so on in either direction and we grant all this accompanying the permission with strict orders to prevent any embryo which may come into being from seeing the light and if any force a way to the birth the parents must understand that the offspring of such an union cannot be maintained and arrange accordingly 
 that also he said is a reasonable proposition but how will they know who are fathers and daughters and so on 
 they will never know the way will be this dating from the day of the hymeneal the bridegroom who was then married will call all the male children who are born in the seventh and tenth month afterwards his sons and the female children his daughters and they will call him father and he will call their children his grandchildren and they will call the elder generation grandfathers and grandmothers all who were begotten at the time when their fathers and mothers came together will be called their brothers and sisters and these as i was saying will be forbidden to this however is not to be understood as an absolute prohibition of the marriage of brothers and sisters if the lot favours them and they receive the sanction of the pythian oracle the law will allow them 
 quite right he replied 
 such is the scheme glaucon according to which the guardians of our state are to have their wives and families in common and now you would have the argument show that this community is consistent with the rest of our polity and also that nothing can be better would you not 
 yes certainly 
 shall we try to find a common basis by asking of ourselves what ought to be the chief aim of the legislator in making laws and in the organization of a state what is the greatest i good and what is the greatest evil and then consider whether our previous description has the stamp of the good or of the evil 
 by all means 
 can there be any greater evil than discord and distraction and plurality where unity ought to reign or any greater good than the bond of unity 
 there cannot 
 and there is unity where there is community of pleasures and pains where all the citizens are glad or grieved on the same occasions of joy and sorrow 
 no doubt 
 yes and where there is no common but only private feeling a state is disorganized when you have one half of the world triumphing and the other plunged in grief at the same events happening to the city or the citizens 
 certainly 
 such differences commonly originate in a disagreement about the use of the terms mine and not mine his and not his 
 exactly so 
 and is not that the state in which the greatest number of persons apply the terms mine and not mine in the same way to the same thing 
 quite true 
 or that again which most nearly approaches to the condition of the individual as in the body when but a finger of one of us is hurt the whole frame drawn towards the soul as a center and forming one kingdom under the ruling power therein feels the hurt and sympathizes all together with the part affected and we say that the man has a pain in his finger and the same expression is used about any other part of the body which has a sensation of pain at suffering or of pleasure at the alleviation of suffering 
 very true he replied and i agree with you that in the state there is the nearest approach to this common feeling which you describe 
 then when any one of the citizens experiences any good or evil the whole state will make his case their own and will either rejoice or sorrow with him 
 yes he said that is what will happen in a state 
 it will now be time i said for us to return to our state and see whether this or some other form is most in accordance with these fundamental principles 
 very good 
 our state like every other has rulers and subjects 
 true 
 all of whom will call one another citizens 
 of course 
 but is there not another name which people give to their rulers in other states 
 generally they call them masters but in democratic states they simply call them rulers 
 and in our state what other name besides that of citizens do the people give the rulers 
 they are called saviours and helpers he replied 
 and what do the rulers call the people 
 their maintainers and 
 and what do they call them in other states 
 slaves 
 and what do the rulers call one another in other states 
 
 and what in ours 
 
 did you ever know an example in any other state of a ruler who would speak of one of his colleagues as his friend and of another as not being his friend 
 yes very often 
 and the friend he regards and describes as one in whom he has an interest and the other as a stranger in whom he has no interest 
 exactly 
 but would any of your guardians think or speak of any other guardian as a stranger 
 certainly he would not for every one whom they meet will be regarded by them either as a brother or sister or father or mother or son or daughter or as the child or parent of those who are thus connected with him 
 capital i said but let me ask you once more shall they be a family in name only or shall they in all their actions be true to the name for example in the use of the word father would the care of a father be implied and the filial reverence and duty and obedience to him which the law commands and is the violator of these duties to be regarded as an impious and unrighteous person who is not likely to receive much good either at the hands of god or of man are these to be or not to be the strains which the children will hear repeated in their ears by all the citizens about those who are intimated to them to be their parents and the rest of their kinsfolk 
 these he said and none other for what can be more ridiculous than for them to utter the names of family ties with the lips only and not to act in the spirit of them 
 then in our city the language of harmony and concord will be more often beard than in any other as i was describing before when any one is well or ill the universal word will be with me it is well or it is ill 
 most true 
 and agreeably to this mode of thinking and speaking were we not saying that they will have their pleasures and pains in common 
 yes and so they will 
 and they will have a common interest in the same thing which they will alike call my own and having this common interest they will have a common feeling of pleasure and pain 
 yes far more so than in other states 
 and the reason of this over and above the general constitution of the state will be that the guardians will have a community of women and children 
 that will be the chief reason 
 and this unity of feeling we admitted to be the greatest good as was implied in our own comparison of a state to the relation of the body and the members when affected by pleasure or pain 
 that we acknowledged and very rightly 
 then the community of wives and children among our citizens is clearly the source of the greatest good to the state 
 certainly 
 and this agrees with the other principle which we were affirming that the guardians were not to have houses or lands or any other property their pay was to be their food which they were to receive from the other citizens and they were to have no private expenses for we intended them to preserve their true character of guardians 
 right he replied 
 both the community of property and the community of families as i am saying tend to make them more truly guardians they will not tear the city in pieces by differing about mine and not mine each man dragging any acquisition which he has made into a separate house of his own where he has a separate wife and children and private pleasures and pains but all will be affected as far as may be by the same pleasures and pains because they are all of one opinion about what is near and dear to them and therefore they all tend towards a common end 
 certainly he replied 
 and as they have nothing but their persons which they can call their own suits and complaints will have no existence among them they will be delivered from all those quarrels of which money or children or relations are the occasion 
 of course they will 
 neither will trials for assault or insult ever be likely to occur among them for that equals should defend themselves against equals we shall maintain to be honourable and right we shall make the protection of the person a matter of necessity 
 that is good he said 
 yes and there is a further good in the law viz that if a man has a quarrel with another he will satisfy his resentment then and there and not proceed to more dangerous lengths 
 certainly 
 to the elder shall be assigned the duty of ruling and chastising the younger 
 clearly 
 nor can there be a doubt that the younger will not strike or do any other violence to an elder unless the magistrates command him nor will he slight him in any way for there are two guardians shame and fear mighty to prevent him shame which makes men refrain from laying hands on those who are to them in the relation of parents fear that the injured one will be succoured by the others who are his brothers sons one wi fathers 
 that is true he replied 
 then in every way the laws will help the citizens to keep the peace with one another 
 yes there will be no want of peace 
 and as the guardians will never quarrel among themselves there will be no danger of the rest of the city being divided either against them or against one another 
 none whatever 
 i hardly like even to mention the little meannesses of which they will be rid for they are beneath notice such for example as the flattery of the rich by the poor and all the pains and pangs which men experience in bringing up a family and in finding money to buy necessaries for their household borrowing and then repudiating getting how they can and giving the money into the hands of women and slaves to keep the many evils of so many kinds which people suffer in this way are mean enough and obvious enough and not worth speaking of 
 yes he said a man has no need of eyes in order to perceive that 
 and from all these evils they will be delivered and their life will be blessed as the life of olympic victors and yet more blessed 
 how so 
 the olympic victor i said is deemed happy in receiving a part only of the blessedness which is secured to our citizens who have won a more glorious victory and have a more complete maintenance at the public cost for the victory which they have won is the salvation of the whole state and the crown with which they and their children are crowned is the fulness of all that life needs they receive rewards from the hands of their country while living and after death have an honourable burial 
 yes he said and glorious rewards they are 
 do you remember i said how in the course of the previous discussion some one who shall be nameless accused us of making our guardians unhappy they had nothing and might have possessed all whom we replied that if an occasion offered we might perhaps hereafter consider this question but that as at present advised we would make our guardians truly guardians and that we were fashioning the state with a view to the greatest happiness not of any particular class but of the whole 
 yes i remember 
 and what do you say now that the life of our protectors is made out to be far better and nobler than that of olympic victors is the life of shoemakers or any other artisans or of husbandmen to be compared with it 
 certainly not 
 at the same time i ought here to repeat what i have said elsewhere that if any of our guardians shall try to be happy in such a manner that he will cease to be a guardian and is not content with this safe and harmonious life which in our judgment is of all lives the best but infatuated by some youthful conceit of happiness which gets up into his head shall seek to appropriate the whole state to himself then he will have to learn how wisely hesiod spoke when he said half is more than the whole 
 if he were to consult me i should say to him stay where you are when you have the offer of such a life 
 you agree then i said that men and women are to have a common way of life such as we have described common education common children and they are to watch over the citizens in common whether abiding in the city or going out to war they are to keep watch together and to hunt together like dogs and always and in all things as far as they are able women are to share with the men and in so doing they will do what is best and will not violate but preserve the natural relation of the sexes 
 i agree with you he replied 
 the enquiry i said has yet to be made whether such a community be found possible as among other animals so also among men and if possible in what way possible 
 you have anticipated the question which i was about to suggest 
 there is no difficulty i said in seeing how war will be carried on by them 
 how 
 why of course they will go on expeditions together and will take with them any of their children who are strong enough that after the manner of the child they may look on at the work which they will have to do when they are grown up and besides looking on they will have to help and be of use in war and to wait upon their fathers and mothers did you never observe in the arts how the potters boys look on and help long before they touch the wheel 
 yes i have 
 and shall potters be more careful in educating their children and in giving them the opportunity of seeing and practising their duties than our guardians will be 
 the idea is ridiculous he said 
 there is also the effect on the parents with whom as with other animals the presence of their young ones will be the greatest incentive to valour 
 that is quite true socrates and yet if they are defeated which may often happen in war how great the danger is the children will be lost as well as their parents and the state will never recover 
 true i said but would you never allow them to run any risk 
 i am far from saying that 
 well but if they are ever to run a risk should they not do so on some occasion when if they escape disaster they will be the better for it 
 clearly 
 whether the future soldiers do or do not see war in the days of their youth is a very important matter for the sake of which some risk may fairly be incurred 
 yes very important 
 this then must be our first step to make our children spectators of war but we must also contrive that they shall be secured against danger then all will be well 
 true 
 their parents may be supposed not to be blind to the risks of war but to know as far as human foresight can what expeditions are safe and what dangerous 
 that may be assumed 
 and they will take them on the safe expeditions and be cautious about the dangerous ones 
 true 
 and they will place them under the command of experienced veterans who will be their leaders and teachers 
 very properly 
 still the dangers of war cannot be always foreseen there is a good deal of chance about them 
 true 
 then against such chances the children must be at once furnished with wings in order that in the hour of need they may fly away and escape 
 what do you mean he said 
 i mean that we must mount them on horses in their earliest youth and when they have learnt to ride take them on horseback to see war the horses must be spirited and warlike but the most tractable and yet the swiftest that can be had in this way they will get an excellent view of what is hereafter to be their own business and if there is danger they have only to follow their elder leaders and escape 
 i believe that you are right he said 
 next as to war what are to be the relations of your soldiers to one another and to their enemies i should be inclined to propose that the soldier who leaves his rank or throws away his arms or is guilty of any other act of cowardice should be degraded into the rank of a husbandman or artisan what do you think 
 by all means i should say 
 and he who allows himself to be taken prisoner may as well be made a present of to his enemies he is their lawful prey and let them do what they like with him 
 certainly 
 but the hero who has distinguished himself what shall be done to him in the first place he shall receive honour in the army from his youthful comrades every one of them in succession shall crown him what do you say 
 i approve 
 and what do you say to his receiving the right hand of fellowship 
 to that too i agree 
 but you will hardly agree to my next proposal 
 what is your proposal 
 that he should kiss and be kissed by them 
 most certainly and i should be disposed to go further and say let no one whom he has a mind to kiss refuse to be kissed by him while the expedition lasts so that if there be a lover in the army whether his love be youth or maiden he may be more eager to win the prize of valour 
 capital i said that the brave man is to have more wives than others has been already determined and he is to have first choices in such matters more than others in order that he may have as many children as possible 
 agreed 
 again there is another manner in which according to homer brave youths should be honoured for he tells how ajax after he had distinguished himself in battle was rewarded with long chines which seems to be a compliment appropriate to a hero in the flower of his age being not only a tribute of honour but also a very strengthening thing 
 most true he said 
 then in this i said homer shall be our teacher and we too at sacrifices and on the like occasions will honour the brave according to the measure of their valour whether men or women with hymns and those other distinctions which we were mentioning also with 
 seats of precedence and meats and full cups and in honouring them we shall be at the same time training them 
 that he replied is excellent 
 yes i said and when a man dies gloriously in war shall we not say in the first place that he is of the golden race 
 to be sure 
 nay have we not the authority of hesiod for affirming that when they are dead 
 they are holy angels upon the earth authors of good averters of evil the guardians of men 
 yes and we accept his authority 
 we must learn of the god how we are to order the sepulture of divine and heroic personages and what is to be their special distinction and we must do as he bids 
 by all means 
 and in ages to come we will reverence them and knee before their sepulchres as at the graves of heroes and not only they but any who are deemed good whether they die from age or in any other way shall be admitted to the same honours 
 that is very right he said 
 next how shall our soldiers treat their enemies what about this 
 in what respect do you mean 
 first of all in regard to slavery do you think it right that hellenes should enslave hellenic states or allow others to enslave them if they can help should not their custom be to spare them considering the danger which there is that the whole race may one day fall under the yoke of the barbarians 
 to spare them is infinitely better 
 then no hellene should be owned by them as a slave that is a rule which they will observe and advise the other hellenes to observe 
 certainly he said they will in this way be united against the barbarians and will keep their hands off one another 
 next as to the slain ought the conquerors i said to take anything but their armour does not the practice of despoiling an enemy afford an excuse for not facing the battle cowards skulk about the dead pretending that they are fulfilling a duty and many an army before now has been lost from this love of plunder 
 very true 
 and is there not illiberality and avarice in robbing a corpse and also a degree of meanness and womanishness in making an enemy of the dead body when the real enemy has flown away and left only his fighting gear behind him is not this rather like a dog who cannot get at his assailant quarrelling with the stones which strike him instead 
 very like a dog he said 
 then we must abstain from spoiling the dead or hindering their burial 
 yes he replied we most certainly must 
 neither shall we offer up arms at the temples of the gods least of all the arms of hellenes if we care to maintain good feeling with other hellenes and indeed we have reason to fear that the offering of spoils taken from kinsmen may be a pollution unless commanded by the god himself 
 very true 
 again as to the devastation of hellenic territory or the burning of houses what is to be the practice 
 may i have the pleasure he said of hearing your opinion 
 both should be forbidden in my judgment i would take the annual produce and no more shall i tell you why 
 pray do 
 why you see there is a difference in the names discord and war and i imagine that there is also a difference in their natures the one is expressive of what is internal and domestic the other of what is external and foreign and the first of the two is termed discord and only the second war 
 that is a very proper distinction he replied 
 and may i not observe with equal propriety that the hellenic race is all united together by ties of blood and friendship and alien and strange to the barbarians 
 very good he said 
 and therefore when hellenes fight with barbarians and barbarians with hellenes they will be described by us as being at war when they fight and by nature enemies and this kind of antagonism should be called war but when hellenes fight with one another we shall say that hellas is then in a state of disorder and discord they being by nature friends and such enmity is to be called discord 
 i agree 
 consider then i said when that which we have acknowledged to be discord occurs and a city is divided if both parties destroy the lands and burn the houses of one another how wicked does the strife appear no true lover of his country would bring himself to tear in pieces his own nurse and mother there might be reason in the conqueror depriving the conquered of their harvest but still they would have the idea of peace in their hearts and would not mean to go on fighting for ever 
 yes he said that is a better temper than the other 
 and will not the city which you are founding be an hellenic city 
 it ought to be he replied 
 then will not the citizens be good and civilized 
 yes very civilized 
 and will they not be lovers of hellas and think of hellas as their own land and share in the common temples 
 most certainly 
 and any difference which arises among them will be regarded by them as discord only a quarrel among friends which is not to be called a war 
 certainly not 
 then they will quarrel as those who intend some day to be reconciled certainly 
 they will use friendly correction but will not enslave or destroy their opponents they will be correctors not enemies 
 just so 
 and as they are hellenes themselves they will not devastate hellas nor will they burn houses not even suppose that the whole population of a city men women and children are equally their enemies for they know that the guilt of war is always confined to a few persons and that the many are their friends and for all these reasons they will be unwilling to waste their lands and raze their houses their enmity to them will only last until the many innocent sufferers have compelled the guilty few to give satisfaction 
 i agree he said that our citizens should thus deal with their hellenic enemies and with barbarians as the hellenes now deal with one another 
 then let us enact this law also for our they are neither to devastate the lands of hellenes nor to burn their houses 
 agreed and we may agree also in thinking that these all our previous enactments are very good 
 but still i must say socrates that if you are allowed to go on in this way you will entirely forget the other question which at the commencement of this discussion you thrust aside is such an order of things possible and how if at all for i am quite ready to acknowledge that the plan which you propose if only feasible would do all sorts of good to the state i will add what you have omitted that your citizens will be the bravest of warriors and will never leave their ranks for they will all know one another and each will call the other father brother son and if you suppose the women to join their armies whether in the same rank or in the rear either as a terror to the enemy or as auxiliaries in case of need i know that they will then be absolutely invincible and there are many domestic tic advantages which might also be mentioned and which i also fully acknowledge but as i admit all these advantages and as many more as you please if only this state of yours were to come into existence we need say no more about them assuming then the existence of the state let us now turn to the question of possibility and ways and means the rest may be left 
 if i loiter for a moment you instantly make a raid upon me i said and have no mercy i have hardly escaped the first and second waves and you seem not to be aware that you are now bringing upon me the third which is the greatest and heaviest when you have seen and heard the third wave i think you be more considerate and will acknowledge that some fear and hesitation was natural respecting a proposal so extraordinary as that which i have now to state and investigate 
 the more appeals of this sort which you make he said the more determined are we that you shall tell us how such a state is possible speak out and at once 
 let me begin by reminding you that we found our way hither in the search after justice and injustice 
 true he replied but what of that 
 i was only going to ask whether if we have discovered them we are to require that the just man should in nothing fail of absolute justice or may we be satisfied with an approximation and the attainment in him of a higher degree of justice than is to be found in other men 
 the approximation will be enough 
 we are enquiring into the nature of absolute justice and into the character of the perfectly just and into injustice and the perfectly unjust that we might have an ideal we were to look at these in order that we might judge of our own happiness and unhappiness according to the standard which they exhibited and the degree in which we resembled them but not with any view of showing that they could exist in fact 
 true he said 
 would a painter be any the worse because after having delineated with consummate art an ideal of a perfectly beautiful man he was unable to show that any such man could ever have existed 
 he would be none the worse 
 well and were we not creating an ideal of a perfect state 
 to be sure 
 and is our theory a worse theory because we are unable to prove the possibility of a city being ordered in the manner described 
 surely not he replied 
 that is the truth i said but if at your request i am to try and show how and under what conditions the possibility is highest i must ask you having this in view to repeat your former admissions 
 what admissions 
 i want to know whether ideals are ever fully realised in language does not the word express more than the fact and must not the actual whatever a man may think always in the nature of things fall short of the truth what do you say 
 i agree 
 then you must not insist on my proving that the actual state will in every respect coincide with the ideal if we are only able to discover how a city may be governed nearly as we proposed you will admit that we have discovered the possibility which you demand and will be contented i am sure that i should be contented will not you 
 yes i will 
 let me next endeavour to show what is that fault in states which is the cause of their present maladministration and what is the least change which will enable a state to pass into the truer form and let the change if possible be of one thing only or if not of two at any rate let the changes be as few and slight as possible 
 certainly he replied 
 i think i said that there might be a reform of the state if only one change were made which is not a slight or easy though still a possible one 
 what is it he said 
 now then i said i go to meet that which i liken to the greatest of the waves yet shall the word be spoken even though the wave break and drown me in laughter and dishonour and do you mark my words 
 proceed 
 i said until philosophers are kings or the kings and princes of this world have the spirit and power of philosophy and political greatness and wisdom meet in one and those commoner natures who pursue either to the exclusion of the other are compelled to stand aside cities will never have rest from their evils nor the human race as i believe and then only will this our state have a possibility of life and behold the light of day such was the thought my dear glaucon which i would fain have uttered if it had not seemed too extravagant for to be convinced that in no other state can there be happiness private or public is indeed a hard thing 
 socrates what do you mean i would have you consider that the word which you have uttered is one at which numerous persons and very respectable persons too in a figure pulling off their coats all in a moment and seizing any weapon that comes to hand will run at you might and main before you know where you are intending to do heaven knows what and if you prepare an answer and put yourself in motion you will be prepared by their fine wits and no mistake 
 you got me into the scrape i said 
 and i was quite right however i will do all i can to get you out of it but i can only give you and good advice and perhaps i may be able to fit answers to your questions better than another that is all and now having such an auxiliary you must do your best to show the unbelievers that you are right 
 i ought to try i said since you offer me such invaluable assistance and i think that if there is to be a chance of our escaping we must explain to them whom we mean when we say that philosophers are to rule in the state then we shall be able to defend ourselves there will be discovered to be some natures who ought to study philosophy and to be leaders in the state and others who are not born to be philosophers and are meant to be followers rather than leaders 
 then now for a definition he said 
 follow me i said and i hope that i may in some way or other be able to give you a satisfactory explanation 
 proceed 
 i dare say that you remember and therefore i need not remind you that a lover if lie is worthy of the name ought to show his love not to some one part of that which he loves but to the whole 
 i really do not understand and therefore beg of you to assist my memory 
 another person i said might fairly reply as you do but a man of pleasure like yourself ought to know that all who are in the flower of youth do somehow or other raise a pang or emotion in a breast and are thought by him to be worthy of his affectionate regards is not this a way which you have with the fair one has a snub nose and you praise his charming face the of another has you say a royal look while he who is neither snub nor hooked has the grace of regularity the dark visage is manly the fair are children of the gods and as to the sweet honey pale as they are called what is the very name but the invention of a lover who talks in diminutives and is not adverse to paleness if appearing on the cheek of youth in a word there is no excuse which you will not make and nothing which you will not say in order not to lose a single flower that blooms in the of youth 
 if you make me an authority in matters of love for the sake of the argument i assent 
 and what do you say of lovers of wine do you not see them doing the same they are glad of any pretext of drinking any wine 
 very good 
 and the same is true of ambitious men if they cannot command an army they are willing to command a file and if they cannot be honoured by really great and important persons they are glad to be honoured by lesser and meaner people but honour of some kind they must have 
 exactly 
 once more let me ask does he who desires any class of goods desire the whole class or a part only 
 the whole 
 and may we not say of the philosopher that he is a lover not of a part of wisdom only but of the whole 
 yes of the whole 
 and he who dislikes learnings especially in youth when he has no power of judging what is good and what is not such an one we maintain not to be a philosopher or a lover of knowledge just as he who refuses his food is not hungry and may be said to have a bad appetite and not a good one 
 very true he said 
 whereas he who has a taste for every sort of knowledge and who is curious to learn and is never satisfied may be justly termed a philosopher am i not right 
 glaucon said if curiosity makes a philosopher you will find many a strange being will have a title to the name all the lovers of sights have a delight in learning and must therefore be included musical amateurs too are a folk strangely out of place among philosophers for they are the last persons in the world who would come to anything like a philosophical discussion if they could help while they run about at the dionysiac festivals as if they had let out their ears to hear every chorus whether the performance is in town or country that makes no difference they are there now are we to maintain that all these and any who have similar tastes as well as the professors of quite minor arts are philosophers 
 certainly not i replied they are only an imitation 
 he said who then are the true philosophers 
 those i said who are lovers of the vision of truth 
 that is also good he said but i should like to know what you mean 
 to another i replied i might have a difficulty in explaining but i am sure that you will admit a proposition which i am about to make 
 what is the proposition 
 that since beauty is the opposite of ugliness they are two 
 certainly 
 and inasmuch as they are two each of them is one 
 true again 
 and of just and unjust good and evil and of every other class the same remark holds taken singly each of them one but from the various combinations of them with actions and things and with one another they are seen in all sorts of lights and appear many very true 
 and this is the distinction which i draw between the practical class and those of whom i am speaking and who are alone worthy of the name of philosophers 
 how do you distinguish them he said 
 the lovers of sounds and sights i replied are as i conceive fond of fine tones and colours and forms and all the artificial products that are made out of them but their mind is incapable of seeing or loving absolute beauty 
 true he replied 
 few are they who are able to attain to the sight of this 
 very true 
 and he who having a sense of beautiful things has no sense of absolute beauty or who if another lead him to a knowledge of that beauty is unable to follow of such an one i ask is he awake or in a dream only reflect is not the dreamer sleeping or waking one who likens dissimilar things who puts the copy in the place of the real object 
 i should certainly say that such an one was dreaming 
 but take the case of the other who recognises the existence of absolute beauty and is able to distinguish the idea from the objects which participate in the idea neither putting the objects in the place of the idea nor the idea in the place of the objects is he a dreamer or is he awake 
 he is wide awake 
 and may we not say that the mind of the one who knows has knowledge and that the mind of the other who opines only has opinion 
 certainly 
 but suppose that the latter should quarrel with us and dispute our statement can we administer any soothing cordial or advice to him without revealing to him that there is sad disorder in his wits 
 we must certainly offer him some good advice he replied 
 come then and let us think of something to say to him shall we begin by assuring him that he is welcome to any knowledge which he may have and that we are rejoiced at his having it but we should like to ask him a question does he who has knowledge know something or nothing you must answer for him 
 i answer that he knows something 
 something that is or is not 
 something that is for how can that which is not ever be known 
 and are we assured after looking at the matter from many points of view that absolute being is or may be absolutely known but that the utterly is utterly unknown 
 nothing can be more certain 
 good but if there be anything which is of such a nature as to be and not to be that will have a place intermediate between pure being and the absolute negation of being 
 yes between them 
 and as knowledge corresponded to being and ignorance of necessity to for that intermediate between being and there has to be discovered a corresponding intermediate between ignorance and knowledge if there be such 
 certainly 
 do we admit the existence of opinion 
 undoubtedly 
 as being the same with knowledge or another faculty 
 another faculty 
 then opinion and knowledge have to do with different kinds of matter corresponding to this difference of faculties 
 yes 
 and knowledge is relative to being and knows being but before i proceed further i will make a division 
 what division 
 i will begin by placing faculties in a class by themselves they are powers in us and in all other things by which we do as we do sight and hearing for example i should call faculties have i clearly explained the class which i mean 
 yes i quite understand 
 then let me tell you my view about them i do not see them and therefore the distinctions of fire colour and the like which enable me to discern the differences of some things do not apply to them in speaking of a faculty i think only of its sphere and its result and that which has the same sphere and the same result i call the same faculty but that which has another sphere and another result i call different would that be your way of speaking 
 yes 
 and will you be so very good as to answer one more question would you say that knowledge is a faculty or in what class would you place it 
 certainly knowledge is a faculty and the mightiest of all faculties 
 and is opinion also a faculty 
 certainly he said for opinion is that with which we are able to form an opinion 
 and yet you were acknowledging a little while ago that knowledge is not the same as opinion 
 why yes he said how can any reasonable being ever identify that which is infallible with that which errs 
 an excellent answer proving i said that we are quite conscious of a distinction between them 
 yes 
 then knowledge and opinion having distinct powers have also distinct spheres or 
 that is certain 
 being is the sphere or of knowledge and knowledge is to know the nature of being 
 yes 
 and opinion is to have an opinion 
 yes 
 and do we know what we opine or is the of opinion the same as the of knowledge 
 nay he replied that has been already disproven if difference in faculty implies difference in the sphere or subject matter and if as we were saying opinion and knowledge are distinct faculties then the sphere of knowledge and of opinion cannot be the same 
 then if being is the of knowledge something else must be the of opinion 
 yes something else 
 well then is the of opinion or rather how can there be an opinion at all about reflect when a man has an opinion has he not an opinion about something can he have an opinion which is an opinion about nothing 
 impossible 
 he who has an opinion has an opinion about some one thing 
 yes 
 and is not one thing but properly speaking nothing 
 true 
 of ignorance was assumed to be the necessary correlative of being knowledge 
 true he said 
 then opinion is not concerned either with being or with 
 not with either 
 and can therefore neither be ignorance nor knowledge 
 that seems to be true 
 but is opinion to be sought without and beyond either of them in a greater clearness than knowledge or in a greater darkness than ignorance 
 in neither 
 then i suppose that opinion appears to you to be darker than knowledge but lighter than ignorance 
 both and in no small degree 
 and also to be within and between them 
 yes 
 then you would infer that opinion is intermediate 
 no question 
 but were we not saying before that if anything appeared to be of a sort which is and is not at the same time that sort of thing would appear also to lie in the interval between pure being and absolute and that the corresponding faculty is neither knowledge nor ignorance but will be found in the interval between them 
 true 
 and in that interval there has now been discovered something which we call opinion 
 there has 
 then what remains to be discovered is the object which partakes equally of the nature of being and and cannot rightly be termed either pure and simple this unknown term when discovered we may truly call the subject of opinion and assign each to its proper faculty the extremes to the faculties of the extremes and the mean to the faculty of the mean 
 true 
 this being premised i would ask the gentleman who is of opinion that there is no absolute or unchangeable idea of beauty in whose opinion the beautiful is the manifold he i say your lover of beautiful sights who cannot bear to be told that the beautiful is one and the just is one or that anything is one to him i would appeal saying will you be so very kind sir as to tell us whether of all these beautiful things there is one which will not be found ugly or of the just which will not be found unjust or of the holy which will not also be unholy 
 no he replied the beautiful will in some point of view be found ugly and the same is true of the rest 
 and may not the many which are doubles be also halves doubles that is of one thing and halves of another 
 quite true 
 and things great and small heavy and light as they are termed will not be denoted by these any more than by the opposite names 
 true both these and the opposite names will always attach to all of them 
 and can any one of those many things which are called by particular names be said to be this rather than not to be this 
 he replied they are like the punning riddles which are asked at feasts or the puzzle about the eunuch aiming at the bat with what he hit him as they say in the puzzle and upon what the bat was sitting the individual objects of which i am speaking are also a riddle and have a double sense nor can you fix them in your mind either as being or or both or neither 
 then what will you do with them i said can they have a better place than between being and for they are clearly not in greater darkness or negation than or more full of light and existence than being 
 that is quite true he said 
 thus then we seem to have discovered that the many ideas which the multitude entertain about the beautiful and about all other things are tossing about in some region which is halfway between pure being and pure 
 we have 
 yes and we had before agreed that anything of this kind which we might find was to be described as matter of opinion and not as matter of knowledge being the intermediate flux which is caught and detained by the intermediate faculty 
 quite true 
 then those who see the many beautiful and who yet neither see absolute beauty nor can follow any guide who points the way thither who see the many just and not absolute justice and the like such persons may be said to have opinion but not knowledge 
 that is certain 
 but those who see the absolute and eternal and immutable may be said to know and not to have opinion only 
 neither can that be denied 
 the one loves and embraces the subjects of knowledge the other those of opinion the latter are the same as i dare say will remember who listened to sweet sounds and gazed upon fair colours but would not tolerate the existence of absolute beauty 
 yes i remember 
 shall we then be guilty of any impropriety in calling them lovers of opinion rather than lovers of wisdom and will they be very angry with us for thus describing them 
 i shall tell them not to be angry no man should be angry at what is true 
 but those who love the truth in each thing are to be called lovers of wisdom and not lovers of opinion 
 assuredly

 book v 
 
 socrates glaucon adeimantus 
 such is the good and true city or state and the good and man is of the same pattern and if this is right every other is wrong and the evil is one which affects not only the ordering of the state but also the regulation of the individual soul and is exhibited in four forms 
 what are they he said 
 i was proceeding to tell the order in which the four evil forms appeared to me to succeed one another when pole marchus who was sitting a little way off just beyond adeimantus began to whisper to him stretching forth his hand he took hold of the upper part of his coat by the shoulder and drew him towards him leaning forward himself so as to be quite close and saying something in his ear of which i only caught the words shall we let him off or what shall we do 
 certainly not said adeimantus raising his voice 
 who is it i said whom you are refusing to let off 
 you he said 
 i repeated why am i especially not to be let off 
 why he said we think that you are lazy and mean to cheat us out of a whole chapter which is a very important part of the story and you fancy that we shall not notice your airy way of proceeding as if it were to everybody that in the matter of women and children friends have all things in common 
 and was i not right adeimantus 
 yes he said but what is right in this particular case like everything else requires to be explained for community may be of many kinds please therefore to say what sort of community you mean we have been long expecting that you would tell us something about the family life of your citizens how they will bring children into the world and rear them when they have arrived and in general what is the nature of this community of women and we are of opinion that the right or wrong management of such matters will have a great and paramount influence on the state for good or for evil and now since the question is still undetermined and you are taking in hand another state we have resolved as you heard not to let you go until you give an account of all this 
 to that resolution said glaucon you may regard me as saying agreed 
 socrates adeimantus glaucon thrasymachus 
 and without more ado said thrasymachus you may consider us all to be equally agreed 
 i said you know not what you are doing in thus assailing me what an argument are you raising about the state just as i thought that i had finished and was only too glad that i had laid this question to sleep and was reflecting how fortunate i was in your acceptance of what i then said you ask me to begin again at the very foundation ignorant of what a nest of words you are stirring now i foresaw this gathering trouble and avoided it 
 for what purpose do you conceive that we have come here said thrasymachus to look for gold or to hear discourse 
 yes but discourse should have a limit 
 yes socrates said glaucon and the whole of life is the only limit which wise men assign to the hearing of such discourses but never mind about us take heart yourself and answer the question in your own way what sort of community of women and children is this which is to prevail among our guardians and how shall we manage the period between birth and education which seems to require the greatest care tell us how these things will be 
 yes my simple friend but the answer is the reverse of easy many more doubts arise about this than about our previous conclusions for the practicability of what is said may be doubted and looked at in another point of view whether the scheme if ever so practicable would be for the best is also doubtful hence i feel a reluctance to approach the subject lest our aspiration my dear friend should turn out to be a dream only 
 fear not he replied for your audience will not be hard upon you they are not sceptical or hostile 
 i said my good friend i suppose that you mean to encourage me by these words 
 yes he said 
 then let me tell you that you are doing just the reverse the encouragement which you offer would have been all very well had i myself believed that i knew what i was talking about to declare the truth about matters of high interest which a man honours and loves among wise men who love him need occasion no fear or faltering in his mind but to carry on an argument when you are yourself only a hesitating enquirer which is my condition is a dangerous and slippery thing and the danger is not that i shall be laughed at of which the fear would be childish but that i shall miss the truth where i have most need to be sure of my footing and drag my friends after me in my fall and i pray nemesis not to visit upon me the words which i am going to utter for i do indeed believe that to be an involuntary homicide is a less crime than to be a deceiver about beauty or goodness or justice in the matter of laws and that is a risk which i would rather run among enemies than among friends and therefore you do well to encourage me 
 glaucon laughed and said well then socrates in case you and your argument do us any serious injury you shall be acquitted beforehand of the and shall not be held to be a deceiver take courage then and speak 
 well i said the law says that when a man is acquitted he is free from guilt and what holds at law may hold in argument 
 then why should you mind 
 well i replied i suppose that i must retrace my steps and say what i perhaps ought to have said before in the proper place the part of the men has been played out and now properly enough comes the turn of the women of them i will proceed to speak and the more readily since i am invited by you 
 for men born and educated like our citizens the only way in my opinion of arriving at a right conclusion about the possession and use of women and children is to follow the path on which we originally started when we said that the men were to be the guardians and watchdogs of the herd 
 true 
 let us further suppose the birth and education of our women to be subject to similar or nearly similar regulations then we shall see whether the result accords with our design 
 what do you mean 
 what i mean may be put into the form of a question i said are dogs divided into hes and shes or do they both share equally in hunting and in keeping watch and in the other duties of dogs or do we entrust to the males the entire and exclusive care of the flocks while we leave the females at home under the idea that the bearing and suckling their puppies is labour enough for them 
 no he said they share alike the only difference between them is that the males are stronger and the females weaker 
 but can you use different animals for the same purpose unless they are bred and fed in the same way 
 you cannot 
 then if women are to have the same duties as men they must have the same nurture and education 
 yes 
 the education which was assigned to the men was music and gymnastic yes 
 then women must be taught music and gymnastic and also the art of war which they must practise like the men 
 that is the inference i suppose 
 i should rather expect i said that several of our proposals if they are carried out being unusual may appear ridiculous 
 no doubt of it 
 yes and the most ridiculous thing of all will be the sight of women naked in the palaestra exercising with the men especially when they are no longer young they certainly will not be a vision of beauty any more than the enthusiastic old men who in spite of wrinkles and ugliness continue to frequent the gymnasia 
 yes indeed he said according to present notions the proposal would be thought ridiculous 
 but then i said as we have determined to speak our minds we must not fear the jests of the wits which will be directed against this sort of innovation how they will talk of attainments both in music and gymnastic and above all about their wearing armour and riding upon horseback 
 very true he replied 
 yet having begun we must go forward to the rough places of the law at the same time begging of these gentlemen for once in their life to be serious not long ago as we shall remind them the hellenes were of the opinion which is still generally received among the barbarians that the sight of a naked man was ridiculous and improper and when first the cretans and then the lacedaemonians introduced the custom the wits of that day might equally have ridiculed the innovation 
 no doubt 
 but when experience showed that to let all things be uncovered was far better than to cover them up and the ludicrous effect to the outward eye vanished before the better principle which reason asserted then the man was perceived to be a fool who directs the shafts of his ridicule at any other sight but that of folly and vice or seriously inclines to weigh the beautiful by any other standard but that of the good 
 very true he replied 
 first then whether the question is to be put in jest or in earnest let us come to an understanding about the nature of woman is she capable of sharing either wholly or partially in the actions of men or not at all and is the art of war one of those arts in which she can or can not share that will be the best way of commencing the enquiry and will probably lead to the fairest conclusion 
 that will be much the best way 
 shall we take the other side first and begin by arguing against ourselves in this manner the position will not be undefended 
 why not he said 
 then let us put a speech into the mouths of our opponents they will say socrates and glaucon no adversary need convict you for you yourselves at the first foundation of the state admitted the principle that everybody was to do the one work suited to his own nature and certainly if i am not mistaken such an admission was made by us and do not the natures of men and women differ very much indeed and we shall reply of course they do then we shall be asked whether the tasks assigned to men and to women should not be different and such as are agreeable to their different natures certainly they should but if so have you not fallen into a serious inconsistency in saying that men and women whose natures are so entirely different ought to perform the same actions what defence will you make for us my good sir against any one who offers these objections 
 that is not an easy question to answer when asked suddenly and i shall and i do beg of you to draw out the case on our side 
 these are the objections glaucon and there are many others of a like kind which i foresaw long ago they made me afraid and reluctant to take in hand any law about the possession and nurture of women and children 
 by zeus he said the problem to be solved is anything but easy 
 why yes i said but the fact is that when a man is out of his depth whether he has fallen into a little swimming bath or into he has to swim all the same 
 very true 
 and must not we swim and try to reach the shore we will hope that dolphin or some other miraculous help may save us 
 i suppose so he said 
 well then let us see if any way of escape can be found we acknowledged did we not that different natures ought to have different pursuits and that and natures are different and now what are we saying that different natures ought to have the same pursuits this is the inconsistency which is charged upon us 
 precisely 
 verily glaucon i said glorious is the power of the art of contradiction 
 why do you say so 
 because i think that many a man falls into the practice against his will when he thinks that he is reasoning he is really disputing just because he cannot define and divide and so know that of which he is speaking and he will pursue a merely verbal opposition in the spirit of contention and not of fair discussion 
 yes he replied such is very often the case but what has that to do with us and our argument 
 a great deal for there is certainly a danger of our getting unintentionally into a verbal opposition 
 in what way 
 why we valiantly and pugnaciously insist upon the verbal truth that different natures ought to have different pursuits but we never considered at all what was the meaning of sameness or difference of nature or why we distinguished them when we assigned different pursuits to different natures and the same to the same natures 
 why no he said that was never considered by us 
 i said suppose that by way of illustration we were to ask the question whether there is not an opposition in nature between bald men and hairy men and if this is admitted by us then if bald men are cobblers we should forbid the hairy men to be cobblers and conversely 
 that would be a jest he said 
 yes i said a jest and why because we never meant when we constructed the state that the opposition of natures should extend to every difference but only to those differences which affected the pursuit in which the individual is engaged we should have argued for example that a physician and one who is in mind a physician may be said to have the same nature 
 true 
 whereas the physician and the carpenter have different natures 
 certainly 
 and if i said the male and female sex appear to differ in their fitness for any art or pursuit we should say that such pursuit or art ought to be assigned to one or the other of them but if the difference consists only in women bearing and men begetting children this does not amount to a proof that a woman differs from a man in respect of the sort of education she should receive and we shall therefore continue to maintain that our guardians and their wives ought to have the same pursuits 
 very true he said 
 next we shall ask our opponent how in reference to any of the pursuits or arts of civic life the nature of a woman differs from that of a man 
 that will be quite fair 
 and perhaps he like yourself will reply that to give a sufficient answer on the instant is not easy but after a little reflection there is no difficulty 
 yes perhaps 
 suppose then that we invite him to accompany us in the argument and then we may hope to show him that there is nothing peculiar in the constitution of women which would affect them in the administration of the state 
 by all means 
 let us say to him come now and we will ask you a question when you spoke of a nature gifted or not gifted in any respect did you mean to say that one man will acquire a thing easily another with difficulty a little learning will lead the one to discover a great deal whereas the other after much study and application no sooner learns than he forgets or again did you mean that the one has a body which is a good servant to his mind while the body of the other is a hindrance to not these be the sort of differences which distinguish the man gifted by nature from the one who is ungifted 
 no one will deny that 
 and can you mention any pursuit of mankind in which the male sex has not all these gifts and qualities in a higher degree than the female need i waste time in speaking of the art of weaving and the management of pancakes and preserves in which womankind does really appear to be great and in which for her to be beaten by a man is of all things the most absurd 
 you are quite right he replied in maintaining the general inferiority of the female sex although many women are in many things superior to many men yet on the whole what you say is true 
 and if so my friend i said there is no special faculty of administration in a state which a woman has because she is a woman or which a man has by virtue of his sex but the gifts of nature are alike diffused in both all the pursuits of men are the pursuits of women also but in all of them a woman is inferior to a man 
 very true 
 then are we to impose all our enactments on men and none of them on women 
 that will never do 
 one woman has a gift of healing another not one is a musician and another has no music in her nature 
 very true 
 and one woman has a turn for gymnastic and military exercises and another is unwarlike and hates gymnastics 
 certainly 
 and one woman is a philosopher and another is an enemy of philosophy one has spirit and another is without spirit 
 that is also true 
 then one woman will have the temper of a guardian and another not was not the selection of the male guardians determined by differences of this sort 
 yes 
 men and women alike possess the qualities which make a guardian they differ only in their comparative strength or weakness 
 obviously 
 and those women who have such qualities are to be selected as the companions and colleagues of men who have similar qualities and whom they resemble in capacity and in character 
 very true 
 and ought not the same natures to have the same pursuits 
 they ought 
 then as we were saying before there is nothing unnatural in assigning music and gymnastic to the wives of the guardians to that point we come round again 
 certainly not 
 the law which we then enacted was agreeable to nature and therefore not an impossibility or mere aspiration and the contrary practice which prevails at present is in reality a violation of nature 
 that appears to be true 
 we had to consider first whether our proposals were possible and secondly whether they were the most beneficial 
 yes 
 and the possibility has been acknowledged 
 yes 
 the very great benefit has next to be established 
 quite so 
 you will admit that the same education which makes a man a good guardian will make a woman a good guardian for their original nature is the same 
 yes 
 i should like to ask you a question 
 what is it 
 would you say that all men are equal in excellence or is one man better than another 
 the latter 
 and in the commonwealth which we were founding do you conceive the guardians who have been brought up on our model system to be more perfect men or the cobblers whose education has been cobbling 
 what a ridiculous question 
 you have answered me i replied well and may we not further say that our guardians are the best of our citizens 
 by far the best 
 and will not their wives be the best women 
 yes by far the best 
 and can there be anything better for the interests of the state than that the men and women of a state should be as good as possible 
 there can be nothing better 
 and this is what the arts of music and gymnastic when present in such manner as we have described will accomplish 
 certainly 
 then we have made an enactment not only possible but in the highest degree beneficial to the state 
 true 
 then let the wives of our guardians strip for their virtue will be their robe and let them share in the toils of war and the defence of their country only in the distribution of labours the lighter are to be assigned to the women who are the weaker natures but in other respects their duties are to be the same and as for the man who laughs at naked women exercising their bodies from the best of motives in his laughter he is plucking 
 a fruit of unripe wisdom and he himself is ignorant of what he is laughing at or what he is about for that is and ever will be the best of sayings that the useful is the noble and the hurtful is the base 
 very true 
 here then is one difficulty in our law about women which we may say that we have now escaped the wave has not swallowed us up alive for enacting that the guardians of either sex should have all their pursuits in common to the utility and also to the possibility of this arrangement the consistency of the argument with itself bears witness 
 yes that was a mighty wave which you have escaped 
 yes i said but a greater is coming you will of this when you see the next 
 go on let me see 
 the law i said which is the sequel of this and of all that has preceded is to the following effect that the wives of our guardians are to be common and their children are to be common and no parent is to know his own child nor any child his parent 
 yes he said that is a much greater wave than the other and the possibility as well as the utility of such a law are far more questionable 
 i do not think i said that there can be any dispute about the very great utility of having wives and children in common the possibility is quite another matter and will be very much disputed 
 i think that a good many doubts may be raised about both 
 you imply that the two questions must be combined i replied now i meant that you should admit the utility and in this way as i thought i should escape from one of them and then there would remain only the possibility 
 but that little attempt is detected and therefore you will please to give a defence of both 
 well i said i submit to my fate yet grant me a little favour let me feast my mind with the dream as day dreamers are in the habit of feasting themselves when they are walking alone for before they have discovered any means of effecting their wishes that is a matter which never troubles them they would rather not tire themselves by thinking about possibilities but assuming that what they desire is already granted to them they proceed with their plan and delight in detailing what they mean to do when their wish has come true that is a way which they have of not doing much good to a capacity which was never good for much now i myself am beginning to lose heart and i should like with your permission to pass over the question of possibility at present assuming therefore the possibility of the proposal i shall now proceed to enquire how the rulers will carry out these arrangements and i shall demonstrate that our plan if executed will be of the greatest benefit to the state and to the guardians first of all then if you have no objection i will endeavour with your help to consider the advantages of the measure and hereafter the question of possibility 
 i have no objection proceed 
 first i think that if our rulers and their auxiliaries are to be worthy of the name which they bear there must be willingness to obey in the one and the power of command in the other the guardians must themselves obey the laws and they must also imitate the spirit of them in any details which are entrusted to their care 
 that is right he said 
 you i said who are their legislator having selected the men will now select the women and give them to them they must be as far as possible of like natures with them and they must live in common houses and meet at common meals none of them will have anything specially his or her own they will be together and will be brought up together and will associate at gymnastic exercises and so they will be drawn by a necessity of their natures to have intercourse with each other necessity is not too strong a word i think 
 yes he said necessity not geometrical but another sort of necessity which lovers know and which is far more convincing and constraining to the mass of mankind 
 true i said and this glaucon like all the rest must proceed after an orderly fashion in a city of the blessed licentiousness is an unholy thing which the rulers will forbid 
 yes he said and it ought not to be permitted 
 then clearly the next thing will be to make matrimony sacred in the highest degree and what is most beneficial will be deemed sacred 
 exactly 
 and how can marriages be made most beneficial that is a question which i put to you because i see in your house dogs for hunting and of the nobler sort of birds not a few now i beseech you do tell me have you ever attended to their pairing and breeding 
 in what particulars 
 why in the first place although they are all of a good sort are not some better than others 
 true 
 and do you breed from them all indifferently or do you take care to breed from the best only 
 from the best 
 and do you take the oldest or the youngest or only those of ripe age 
 i choose only those of ripe age 
 and if care was not taken in the breeding your dogs and birds would greatly deteriorate 
 certainly 
 and the same of horses and animals in general 
 undoubtedly 
 good heavens my dear friend i said what consummate skill will our rulers need if the same principle holds of the human species 
 certainly the same principle holds but why does this involve any particular skill 
 because i said our rulers will often have to practise upon the body corporate with medicines now you know that when patients do not require medicines but have only to be put under a regimen the inferior sort of practitioner is deemed to be good enough but when medicine has to be given then the doctor should be more of a man 
 that is quite true he said but to what are you alluding 
 i mean i replied that our rulers will find a considerable dose of falsehood and deceit necessary for the good of their subjects we were saying that the use of all these things regarded as medicines might be of advantage 
 and we were very right 
 and this lawful use of them seems likely to be often needed in the regulations of marriages and births 
 how so 
 why i said the principle has been already laid down that the best of either sex should be united with the best as often and the inferior with the inferior as seldom as possible and that they should rear the offspring of the one sort of union but not of the other if the flock is to be maintained in condition now these goings on must be a secret which the rulers only know or there will be a further danger of our herd as the guardians may be termed breaking out into rebellion 
 very true 
 had we not better appoint certain festivals at which we will bring together the brides and bridegrooms and sacrifices will be offered and suitable hymeneal songs composed by our poets the number of weddings is a matter which must be left to the discretion of the rulers whose aim will be to preserve the average of population there are many other things which they will have to consider such as the effects of wars and diseases and any similar agencies in order as far as this is possible to prevent the state from becoming either too large or too small 
 certainly he replied 
 we shall have to invent some ingenious kind of lots which the less worthy may draw on each occasion of our bringing them together and then they will accuse their own and not the rulers 
 to be sure he said 
 and i think that our braver and better youth besides their other honours and rewards might have greater facilities of intercourse with women given them their bravery will be a reason and such fathers ought to have as many sons as possible 
 true 
 and the proper officers whether male or female or both for offices are to be held by women as well as by men 
 yes 
 the proper officers will take the offspring of the good parents to the pen or fold and there they will deposit them with certain nurses who dwell in a separate quarter but the offspring of the inferior or of the better when they chance to be deformed will be put away in some mysterious unknown place as they should be 
 yes he said that must be done if the breed of the guardians is to be kept pure 
 they will provide for their nurture and will bring the mothers to the fold when they are full of milk taking the greatest possible care that no mother recognizes her own child and other may be engaged if more are required care will also be taken that the process of suckling shall not be protracted too long and the mothers will have no getting up at night or other trouble but will hand over all this sort of thing to the nurses and attendants 
 you suppose the wives of our guardians to have a fine easy time of it when they are having children 
 why said i and so they ought let us however proceed with our scheme we were saying that the parents should be in the prime of life 
 very true 
 and what is the prime of life may it not be defined as a period of about twenty years in a life and thirty in a 
 which years do you mean to include 
 a woman i said at twenty years of age may begin to bear children to the state and continue to bear them until forty a man may begin at when he has passed the point at which the pulse of life beats quickest and continue to beget children until he be 
 certainly he said both in men and women those years are the prime of physical as well as of intellectual vigour 
 any one above or below the prescribed ages who takes part in the public hymeneals shall be said to have done an unholy and unrighteous thing the child of which he is the father if it steals into life will have been conceived under auspices very unlike the sacrifices and prayers which at each hymeneal priestesses and priest and the whole city will offer that the new generation may be better and more useful than their good and useful parents whereas his child will be the offspring of darkness and strange lust 
 very true he replied 
 and the same law will apply to any one of those within the prescribed age who forms a connection with any woman in the prime of life without the sanction of the rulers for we shall say that he is raising up a bastard to the state uncertified and unconsecrated 
 very true he replied 
 this applies however only to those who are within the specified age after that we allow them to range at will except that a man may not marry his daughter or his daughter or his mother or his mother and women on the other hand are prohibited from marrying their sons or fathers or son or father and so on in either direction and we grant all this accompanying the permission with strict orders to prevent any embryo which may come into being from seeing the light and if any force a way to the birth the parents must understand that the offspring of such an union cannot be maintained and arrange accordingly 
 that also he said is a reasonable proposition but how will they know who are fathers and daughters and so on 
 they will never know the way will be this dating from the day of the hymeneal the bridegroom who was then married will call all the male children who are born in the seventh and tenth month afterwards his sons and the female children his daughters and they will call him father and he will call their children his grandchildren and they will call the elder generation grandfathers and grandmothers all who were begotten at the time when their fathers and mothers came together will be called their brothers and sisters and these as i was saying will be forbidden to this however is not to be understood as an absolute prohibition of the marriage of brothers and sisters if the lot favours them and they receive the sanction of the pythian oracle the law will allow them 
 quite right he replied 
 such is the scheme glaucon according to which the guardians of our state are to have their wives and families in common and now you would have the argument show that this community is consistent with the rest of our polity and also that nothing can be better would you not 
 yes certainly 
 shall we try to find a common basis by asking of ourselves what ought to be the chief aim of the legislator in making laws and in the organization of a state what is the greatest i good and what is the greatest evil and then consider whether our previous description has the stamp of the good or of the evil 
 by all means 
 can there be any greater evil than discord and distraction and plurality where unity ought to reign or any greater good than the bond of unity 
 there cannot 
 and there is unity where there is community of pleasures and pains where all the citizens are glad or grieved on the same occasions of joy and sorrow 
 no doubt 
 yes and where there is no common but only private feeling a state is disorganized when you have one half of the world triumphing and the other plunged in grief at the same events happening to the city or the citizens 
 certainly 
 such differences commonly originate in a disagreement about the use of the terms mine and not mine his and not his 
 exactly so 
 and is not that the state in which the greatest number of persons apply the terms mine and not mine in the same way to the same thing 
 quite true 
 or that again which most nearly approaches to the condition of the individual as in the body when but a finger of one of us is hurt the whole frame drawn towards the soul as a center and forming one kingdom under the ruling power therein feels the hurt and sympathizes all together with the part affected and we say that the man has a pain in his finger and the same expression is used about any other part of the body which has a sensation of pain at suffering or of pleasure at the alleviation of suffering 
 very true he replied and i agree with you that in the state there is the nearest approach to this common feeling which you describe 
 then when any one of the citizens experiences any good or evil the whole state will make his case their own and will either rejoice or sorrow with him 
 yes he said that is what will happen in a state 
 it will now be time i said for us to return to our state and see whether this or some other form is most in accordance with these fundamental principles 
 very good 
 our state like every other has rulers and subjects 
 true 
 all of whom will call one another citizens 
 of course 
 but is there not another name which people give to their rulers in other states 
 generally they call them masters but in democratic states they simply call them rulers 
 and in our state what other name besides that of citizens do the people give the rulers 
 they are called saviours and helpers he replied 
 and what do the rulers call the people 
 their maintainers and 
 and what do they call them in other states 
 slaves 
 and what do the rulers call one another in other states 
 
 and what in ours 
 
 did you ever know an example in any other state of a ruler who would speak of one of his colleagues as his friend and of another as not being his friend 
 yes very often 
 and the friend he regards and describes as one in whom he has an interest and the other as a stranger in whom he has no interest 
 exactly 
 but would any of your guardians think or speak of any other guardian as a stranger 
 certainly he would not for every one whom they meet will be regarded by them either as a brother or sister or father or mother or son or daughter or as the child or parent of those who are thus connected with him 
 capital i said but let me ask you once more shall they be a family in name only or shall they in all their actions be true to the name for example in the use of the word father would the care of a father be implied and the filial reverence and duty and obedience to him which the law commands and is the violator of these duties to be regarded as an impious and unrighteous person who is not likely to receive much good either at the hands of god or of man are these to be or not to be the strains which the children will hear repeated in their ears by all the citizens about those who are intimated to them to be their parents and the rest of their kinsfolk 
 these he said and none other for what can be more ridiculous than for them to utter the names of family ties with the lips only and not to act in the spirit of them 
 then in our city the language of harmony and concord will be more often beard than in any other as i was describing before when any one is well or ill the universal word will be with me it is well or it is ill 
 most true 
 and agreeably to this mode of thinking and speaking were we not saying that they will have their pleasures and pains in common 
 yes and so they will 
 and they will have a common interest in the same thing which they will alike call my own and having this common interest they will have a common feeling of pleasure and pain 
 yes far more so than in other states 
 and the reason of this over and above the general constitution of the state will be that the guardians will have a community of women and children 
 that will be the chief reason 
 and this unity of feeling we admitted to be the greatest good as was implied in our own comparison of a state to the relation of the body and the members when affected by pleasure or pain 
 that we acknowledged and very rightly 
 then the community of wives and children among our citizens is clearly the source of the greatest good to the state 
 certainly 
 and this agrees with the other principle which we were affirming that the guardians were not to have houses or lands or any other property their pay was to be their food which they were to receive from the other citizens and they were to have no private expenses for we intended them to preserve their true character of guardians 
 right he replied 
 both the community of property and the community of families as i am saying tend to make them more truly guardians they will not tear the city in pieces by differing about mine and not mine each man dragging any acquisition which he has made into a separate house of his own where he has a separate wife and children and private pleasures and pains but all will be affected as far as may be by the same pleasures and pains because they are all of one opinion about what is near and dear to them and therefore they all tend towards a common end 
 certainly he replied 
 and as they have nothing but their persons which they can call their own suits and complaints will have no existence among them they will be delivered from all those quarrels of which money or children or relations are the occasion 
 of course they will 
 neither will trials for assault or insult ever be likely to occur among them for that equals should defend themselves against equals we shall maintain to be honourable and right we shall make the protection of the person a matter of necessity 
 that is good he said 
 yes and there is a further good in the law viz that if a man has a quarrel with another he will satisfy his resentment then and there and not proceed to more dangerous lengths 
 certainly 
 to the elder shall be assigned the duty of ruling and chastising the younger 
 clearly 
 nor can there be a doubt that the younger will not strike or do any other violence to an elder unless the magistrates command him nor will he slight him in any way for there are two guardians shame and fear mighty to prevent him shame which makes men refrain from laying hands on those who are to them in the relation of parents fear that the injured one will be succoured by the others who are his brothers sons one wi fathers 
 that is true he replied 
 then in every way the laws will help the citizens to keep the peace with one another 
 yes there will be no want of peace 
 and as the guardians will never quarrel among themselves there will be no danger of the rest of the city being divided either against them or against one another 
 none whatever 
 i hardly like even to mention the little meannesses of which they will be rid for they are beneath notice such for example as the flattery of the rich by the poor and all the pains and pangs which men experience in bringing up a family and in finding money to buy necessaries for their household borrowing and then repudiating getting how they can and giving the money into the hands of women and slaves to keep the many evils of so many kinds which people suffer in this way are mean enough and obvious enough and not worth speaking of 
 yes he said a man has no need of eyes in order to perceive that 
 and from all these evils they will be delivered and their life will be blessed as the life of olympic victors and yet more blessed 
 how so 
 the olympic victor i said is deemed happy in receiving a part only of the blessedness which is secured to our citizens who have won a more glorious victory and have a more complete maintenance at the public cost for the victory which they have won is the salvation of the whole state and the crown with which they and their children are crowned is the fulness of all that life needs they receive rewards from the hands of their country while living and after death have an honourable burial 
 yes he said and glorious rewards they are 
 do you remember i said how in the course of the previous discussion some one who shall be nameless accused us of making our guardians unhappy they had nothing and might have possessed all whom we replied that if an occasion offered we might perhaps hereafter consider this question but that as at present advised we would make our guardians truly guardians and that we were fashioning the state with a view to the greatest happiness not of any particular class but of the whole 
 yes i remember 
 and what do you say now that the life of our protectors is made out to be far better and nobler than that of olympic victors is the life of shoemakers or any other artisans or of husbandmen to be compared with it 
 certainly not 
 at the same time i ought here to repeat what i have said elsewhere that if any of our guardians shall try to be happy in such a manner that he will cease to be a guardian and is not content with this safe and harmonious life which in our judgment is of all lives the best but infatuated by some youthful conceit of happiness which gets up into his head shall seek to appropriate the whole state to himself then he will have to learn how wisely hesiod spoke when he said half is more than the whole 
 if he were to consult me i should say to him stay where you are when you have the offer of such a life 
 you agree then i said that men and women are to have a common way of life such as we have described common education common children and they are to watch over the citizens in common whether abiding in the city or going out to war they are to keep watch together and to hunt together like dogs and always and in all things as far as they are able women are to share with the men and in so doing they will do what is best and will not violate but preserve the natural relation of the sexes 
 i agree with you he replied 
 the enquiry i said has yet to be made whether such a community be found possible as among other animals so also among men and if possible in what way possible 
 you have anticipated the question which i was about to suggest 
 there is no difficulty i said in seeing how war will be carried on by them 
 how 
 why of course they will go on expeditions together and will take with them any of their children who are strong enough that after the manner of the child they may look on at the work which they will have to do when they are grown up and besides looking on they will have to help and be of use in war and to wait upon their fathers and mothers did you never observe in the arts how the potters boys look on and help long before they touch the wheel 
 yes i have 
 and shall potters be more careful in educating their children and in giving them the opportunity of seeing and practising their duties than our guardians will be 
 the idea is ridiculous he said 
 there is also the effect on the parents with whom as with other animals the presence of their young ones will be the greatest incentive to valour 
 that is quite true socrates and yet if they are defeated which may often happen in war how great the danger is the children will be lost as well as their parents and the state will never recover 
 true i said but would you never allow them to run any risk 
 i am far from saying that 
 well but if they are ever to run a risk should they not do so on some occasion when if they escape disaster they will be the better for it 
 clearly 
 whether the future soldiers do or do not see war in the days of their youth is a very important matter for the sake of which some risk may fairly be incurred 
 yes very important 
 this then must be our first step to make our children spectators of war but we must also contrive that they shall be secured against danger then all will be well 
 true 
 their parents may be supposed not to be blind to the risks of war but to know as far as human foresight can what expeditions are safe and what dangerous 
 that may be assumed 
 and they will take them on the safe expeditions and be cautious about the dangerous ones 
 true 
 and they will place them under the command of experienced veterans who will be their leaders and teachers 
 very properly 
 still the dangers of war cannot be always foreseen there is a good deal of chance about them 
 true 
 then against such chances the children must be at once furnished with wings in order that in the hour of need they may fly away and escape 
 what do you mean he said 
 i mean that we must mount them on horses in their earliest youth and when they have learnt to ride take them on horseback to see war the horses must be spirited and warlike but the most tractable and yet the swiftest that can be had in this way they will get an excellent view of what is hereafter to be their own business and if there is danger they have only to follow their elder leaders and escape 
 i believe that you are right he said 
 next as to war what are to be the relations of your soldiers to one another and to their enemies i should be inclined to propose that the soldier who leaves his rank or throws away his arms or is guilty of any other act of cowardice should be degraded into the rank of a husbandman or artisan what do you think 
 by all means i should say 
 and he who allows himself to be taken prisoner may as well be made a present of to his enemies he is their lawful prey and let them do what they like with him 
 certainly 
 but the hero who has distinguished himself what shall be done to him in the first place he shall receive honour in the army from his youthful comrades every one of them in succession shall crown him what do you say 
 i approve 
 and what do you say to his receiving the right hand of fellowship 
 to that too i agree 
 but you will hardly agree to my next proposal 
 what is your proposal 
 that he should kiss and be kissed by them 
 most certainly and i should be disposed to go further and say let no one whom he has a mind to kiss refuse to be kissed by him while the expedition lasts so that if there be a lover in the army whether his love be youth or maiden he may be more eager to win the prize of valour 
 capital i said that the brave man is to have more wives than others has been already determined and he is to have first choices in such matters more than others in order that he may have as many children as possible 
 agreed 
 again there is another manner in which according to homer brave youths should be honoured for he tells how ajax after he had distinguished himself in battle was rewarded with long chines which seems to be a compliment appropriate to a hero in the flower of his age being not only a tribute of honour but also a very strengthening thing 
 most true he said 
 then in this i said homer shall be our teacher and we too at sacrifices and on the like occasions will honour the brave according to the measure of their valour whether men or women with hymns and those other distinctions which we were mentioning also with 
 seats of precedence and meats and full cups and in honouring them we shall be at the same time training them 
 that he replied is excellent 
 yes i said and when a man dies gloriously in war shall we not say in the first place that he is of the golden race 
 to be sure 
 nay have we not the authority of hesiod for affirming that when they are dead 
 they are holy angels upon the earth authors of good averters of evil the guardians of men 
 yes and we accept his authority 
 we must learn of the god how we are to order the sepulture of divine and heroic personages and what is to be their special distinction and we must do as he bids 
 by all means 
 and in ages to come we will reverence them and knee before their sepulchres as at the graves of heroes and not only they but any who are deemed good whether they die from age or in any other way shall be admitted to the same honours 
 that is very right he said 
 next how shall our soldiers treat their enemies what about this 
 in what respect do you mean 
 first of all in regard to slavery do you think it right that hellenes should enslave hellenic states or allow others to enslave them if they can help should not their custom be to spare them considering the danger which there is that the whole race may one day fall under the yoke of the barbarians 
 to spare them is infinitely better 
 then no hellene should be owned by them as a slave that is a rule which they will observe and advise the other hellenes to observe 
 certainly he said they will in this way be united against the barbarians and will keep their hands off one another 
 next as to the slain ought the conquerors i said to take anything but their armour does not the practice of despoiling an enemy afford an excuse for not facing the battle cowards skulk about the dead pretending that they are fulfilling a duty and many an army before now has been lost from this love of plunder 
 very true 
 and is there not illiberality and avarice in robbing a corpse and also a degree of meanness and womanishness in making an enemy of the dead body when the real enemy has flown away and left only his fighting gear behind him is not this rather like a dog who cannot get at his assailant quarrelling with the stones which strike him instead 
 very like a dog he said 
 then we must abstain from spoiling the dead or hindering their burial 
 yes he replied we most certainly must 
 neither shall we offer up arms at the temples of the gods least of all the arms of hellenes if we care to maintain good feeling with other hellenes and indeed we have reason to fear that the offering of spoils taken from kinsmen may be a pollution unless commanded by the god himself 
 very true 
 again as to the devastation of hellenic territory or the burning of houses what is to be the practice 
 may i have the pleasure he said of hearing your opinion 
 both should be forbidden in my judgment i would take the annual produce and no more shall i tell you why 
 pray do 
 why you see there is a difference in the names discord and war and i imagine that there is also a difference in their natures the one is expressive of what is internal and domestic the other of what is external and foreign and the first of the two is termed discord and only the second war 
 that is a very proper distinction he replied 
 and may i not observe with equal propriety that the hellenic race is all united together by ties of blood and friendship and alien and strange to the barbarians 
 very good he said 
 and therefore when hellenes fight with barbarians and barbarians with hellenes they will be described by us as being at war when they fight and by nature enemies and this kind of antagonism should be called war but when hellenes fight with one another we shall say that hellas is then in a state of disorder and discord they being by nature friends and such enmity is to be called discord 
 i agree 
 consider then i said when that which we have acknowledged to be discord occurs and a city is divided if both parties destroy the lands and burn the houses of one another how wicked does the strife appear no true lover of his country would bring himself to tear in pieces his own nurse and mother there might be reason in the conqueror depriving the conquered of their harvest but still they would have the idea of peace in their hearts and would not mean to go on fighting for ever 
 yes he said that is a better temper than the other 
 and will not the city which you are founding be an hellenic city 
 it ought to be he replied 
 then will not the citizens be good and civilized 
 yes very civilized 
 and will they not be lovers of hellas and think of hellas as their own land and share in the common temples 
 most certainly 
 and any difference which arises among them will be regarded by them as discord only a quarrel among friends which is not to be called a war 
 certainly not 
 then they will quarrel as those who intend some day to be reconciled certainly 
 they will use friendly correction but will not enslave or destroy their opponents they will be correctors not enemies 
 just so 
 and as they are hellenes themselves they will not devastate hellas nor will they burn houses not even suppose that the whole population of a city men women and children are equally their enemies for they know that the guilt of war is always confined to a few persons and that the many are their friends and for all these reasons they will be unwilling to waste their lands and raze their houses their enmity to them will only last until the many innocent sufferers have compelled the guilty few to give satisfaction 
 i agree he said that our citizens should thus deal with their hellenic enemies and with barbarians as the hellenes now deal with one another 
 then let us enact this law also for our they are neither to devastate the lands of hellenes nor to burn their houses 
 agreed and we may agree also in thinking that these all our previous enactments are very good 
 but still i must say socrates that if you are allowed to go on in this way you will entirely forget the other question which at the commencement of this discussion you thrust aside is such an order of things possible and how if at all for i am quite ready to acknowledge that the plan which you propose if only feasible would do all sorts of good to the state i will add what you have omitted that your citizens will be the bravest of warriors and will never leave their ranks for they will all know one another and each will call the other father brother son and if you suppose the women to join their armies whether in the same rank or in the rear either as a terror to the enemy or as auxiliaries in case of need i know that they will then be absolutely invincible and there are many domestic tic advantages which might also be mentioned and which i also fully acknowledge but as i admit all these advantages and as many more as you please if only this state of yours were to come into existence we need say no more about them assuming then the existence of the state let us now turn to the question of possibility and ways and means the rest may be left 
 if i loiter for a moment you instantly make a raid upon me i said and have no mercy i have hardly escaped the first and second waves and you seem not to be aware that you are now bringing upon me the third which is the greatest and heaviest when you have seen and heard the third wave i think you be more considerate and will acknowledge that some fear and hesitation was natural respecting a proposal so extraordinary as that which i have now to state and investigate 
 the more appeals of this sort which you make he said the more determined are we that you shall tell us how such a state is possible speak out and at once 
 let me begin by reminding you that we found our way hither in the search after justice and injustice 
 true he replied but what of that 
 i was only going to ask whether if we have discovered them we are to require that the just man should in nothing fail of absolute justice or may we be satisfied with an approximation and the attainment in him of a higher degree of justice than is to be found in other men 
 the approximation will be enough 
 we are enquiring into the nature of absolute justice and into the character of the perfectly just and into injustice and the perfectly unjust that we might have an ideal we were to look at these in order that we might judge of our own happiness and unhappiness according to the standard which they exhibited and the degree in which we resembled them but not with any view of showing that they could exist in fact 
 true he said 
 would a painter be any the worse because after having delineated with consummate art an ideal of a perfectly beautiful man he was unable to show that any such man could ever have existed 
 he would be none the worse 
 well and were we not creating an ideal of a perfect state 
 to be sure 
 and is our theory a worse theory because we are unable to prove the possibility of a city being ordered in the manner described 
 surely not he replied 
 that is the truth i said but if at your request i am to try and show how and under what conditions the possibility is highest i must ask you having this in view to repeat your former admissions 
 what admissions 
 i want to know whether ideals are ever fully realised in language does not the word express more than the fact and must not the actual whatever a man may think always in the nature of things fall short of the truth what do you say 
 i agree 
 then you must not insist on my proving that the actual state will in every respect coincide with the ideal if we are only able to discover how a city may be governed nearly as we proposed you will admit that we have discovered the possibility which you demand and will be contented i am sure that i should be contented will not you 
 yes i will 
 let me next endeavour to show what is that fault in states which is the cause of their present maladministration and what is the least change which will enable a state to pass into the truer form and let the change if possible be of one thing only or if not of two at any rate let the changes be as few and slight as possible 
 certainly he replied 
 i think i said that there might be a reform of the state if only one change were made which is not a slight or easy though still a possible one 
 what is it he said 
 now then i said i go to meet that which i liken to the greatest of the waves yet shall the word be spoken even though the wave break and drown me in laughter and dishonour and do you mark my words 
 proceed 
 i said until philosophers are kings or the kings and princes of this world have the spirit and power of philosophy and political greatness and wisdom meet in one and those commoner natures who pursue either to the exclusion of the other are compelled to stand aside cities will never have rest from their evils nor the human race as i believe and then only will this our state have a possibility of life and behold the light of day such was the thought my dear glaucon which i would fain have uttered if it had not seemed too extravagant for to be convinced that in no other state can there be happiness private or public is indeed a hard thing 
 socrates what do you mean i would have you consider that the word which you have uttered is one at which numerous persons and very respectable persons too in a figure pulling off their coats all in a moment and seizing any weapon that comes to hand will run at you might and main before you know where you are intending to do heaven knows what and if you prepare an answer and put yourself in motion you will be prepared by their fine wits and no mistake 
 you got me into the scrape i said 
 and i was quite right however i will do all i can to get you out of it but i can only give you and good advice and perhaps i may be able to fit answers to your questions better than another that is all and now having such an auxiliary you must do your best to show the unbelievers that you are right 
 i ought to try i said since you offer me such invaluable assistance and i think that if there is to be a chance of our escaping we must explain to them whom we mean when we say that philosophers are to rule in the state then we shall be able to defend ourselves there will be discovered to be some natures who ought to study philosophy and to be leaders in the state and others who are not born to be philosophers and are meant to be followers rather than leaders 
 then now for a definition he said 
 follow me i said and i hope that i may in some way or other be able to give you a satisfactory explanation 
 proceed 
 i dare say that you remember and therefore i need not remind you that a lover if lie is worthy of the name ought to show his love not to some one part of that which he loves but to the whole 
 i really do not understand and therefore beg of you to assist my memory 
 another person i said might fairly reply as you do but a man of pleasure like yourself ought to know that all who are in the flower of youth do somehow or other raise a pang or emotion in a breast and are thought by him to be worthy of his affectionate regards is not this a way which you have with the fair one has a snub nose and you praise his charming face the of another has you say a royal look while he who is neither snub nor hooked has the grace of regularity the dark visage is manly the fair are children of the gods and as to the sweet honey pale as they are called what is the very name but the invention of a lover who talks in diminutives and is not adverse to paleness if appearing on the cheek of youth in a word there is no excuse which you will not make and nothing which you will not say in order not to lose a single flower that blooms in the of youth 
 if you make me an authority in matters of love for the sake of the argument i assent 
 and what do you say of lovers of wine do you not see them doing the same they are glad of any pretext of drinking any wine 
 very good 
 and the same is true of ambitious men if they cannot command an army they are willing to command a file and if they cannot be honoured by really great and important persons they are glad to be honoured by lesser and meaner people but honour of some kind they must have 
 exactly 
 once more let me ask does he who desires any class of goods desire the whole class or a part only 
 the whole 
 and may we not say of the philosopher that he is a lover not of a part of wisdom only but of the whole 
 yes of the whole 
 and he who dislikes learnings especially in youth when he has no power of judging what is good and what is not such an one we maintain not to be a philosopher or a lover of knowledge just as he who refuses his food is not hungry and may be said to have a bad appetite and not a good one 
 very true he said 
 whereas he who has a taste for every sort of knowledge and who is curious to learn and is never satisfied may be justly termed a philosopher am i not right 
 glaucon said if curiosity makes a philosopher you will find many a strange being will have a title to the name all the lovers of sights have a delight in learning and must therefore be included musical amateurs too are a folk strangely out of place among philosophers for they are the last persons in the world who would come to anything like a philosophical discussion if they could help while they run about at the dionysiac festivals as if they had let out their ears to hear every chorus whether the performance is in town or country that makes no difference they are there now are we to maintain that all these and any who have similar tastes as well as the professors of quite minor arts are philosophers 
 certainly not i replied they are only an imitation 
 he said who then are the true philosophers 
 those i said who are lovers of the vision of truth 
 that is also good he said but i should like to know what you mean 
 to another i replied i might have a difficulty in explaining but i am sure that you will admit a proposition which i am about to make 
 what is the proposition 
 that since beauty is the opposite of ugliness they are two 
 certainly 
 and inasmuch as they are two each of them is one 
 true again 
 and of just and unjust good and evil and of every other class the same remark holds taken singly each of them one but from the various combinations of them with actions and things and with one another they are seen in all sorts of lights and appear many very true 
 and this is the distinction which i draw between the practical class and those of whom i am speaking and who are alone worthy of the name of philosophers 
 how do you distinguish them he said 
 the lovers of sounds and sights i replied are as i conceive fond of fine tones and colours and forms and all the artificial products that are made out of them but their mind is incapable of seeing or loving absolute beauty 
 true he replied 
 few are they who are able to attain to the sight of this 
 very true 
 and he who having a sense of beautiful things has no sense of absolute beauty or who if another lead him to a knowledge of that beauty is unable to follow of such an one i ask is he awake or in a dream only reflect is not the dreamer sleeping or waking one who likens dissimilar things who puts the copy in the place of the real object 
 i should certainly say that such an one was dreaming 
 but take the case of the other who recognises the existence of absolute beauty and is able to distinguish the idea from the objects which participate in the idea neither putting the objects in the place of the idea nor the idea in the place of the objects is he a dreamer or is he awake 
 he is wide awake 
 and may we not say that the mind of the one who knows has knowledge and that the mind of the other who opines only has opinion 
 certainly 
 but suppose that the latter should quarrel with us and dispute our statement can we administer any soothing cordial or advice to him without revealing to him that there is sad disorder in his wits 
 we must certainly offer him some good advice he replied 
 come then and let us think of something to say to him shall we begin by assuring him that he is welcome to any knowledge which he may have and that we are rejoiced at his having it but we should like to ask him a question does he who has knowledge know something or nothing you must answer for him 
 i answer that he knows something 
 something that is or is not 
 something that is for how can that which is not ever be known 
 and are we assured after looking at the matter from many points of view that absolute being is or may be absolutely known but that the utterly is utterly unknown 
 nothing can be more certain 
 good but if there be anything which is of such a nature as to be and not to be that will have a place intermediate between pure being and the absolute negation of being 
 yes between them 
 and as knowledge corresponded to being and ignorance of necessity to for that intermediate between being and there has to be discovered a corresponding intermediate between ignorance and knowledge if there be such 
 certainly 
 do we admit the existence of opinion 
 undoubtedly 
 as being the same with knowledge or another faculty 
 another faculty 
 then opinion and knowledge have to do with different kinds of matter corresponding to this difference of faculties 
 yes 
 and knowledge is relative to being and knows being but before i proceed further i will make a division 
 what division 
 i will begin by placing faculties in a class by themselves they are powers in us and in all other things by which we do as we do sight and hearing for example i should call faculties have i clearly explained the class which i mean 
 yes i quite understand 
 then let me tell you my view about them i do not see them and therefore the distinctions of fire colour and the like which enable me to discern the differences of some things do not apply to them in speaking of a faculty i think only of its sphere and its result and that which has the same sphere and the same result i call the same faculty but that which has another sphere and another result i call different would that be your way of speaking 
 yes 
 and will you be so very good as to answer one more question would you say that knowledge is a faculty or in what class would you place it 
 certainly knowledge is a faculty and the mightiest of all faculties 
 and is opinion also a faculty 
 certainly he said for opinion is that with which we are able to form an opinion 
 and yet you were acknowledging a little while ago that knowledge is not the same as opinion 
 why yes he said how can any reasonable being ever identify that which is infallible with that which errs 
 an excellent answer proving i said that we are quite conscious of a distinction between them 
 yes 
 then knowledge and opinion having distinct powers have also distinct spheres or 
 that is certain 
 being is the sphere or of knowledge and knowledge is to know the nature of being 
 yes 
 and opinion is to have an opinion 
 yes 
 and do we know what we opine or is the of opinion the same as the of knowledge 
 nay he replied that has been already disproven if difference in faculty implies difference in the sphere or subject matter and if as we were saying opinion and knowledge are distinct faculties then the sphere of knowledge and of opinion cannot be the same 
 then if being is the of knowledge something else must be the of opinion 
 yes something else 
 well then is the of opinion or rather how can there be an opinion at all about reflect when a man has an opinion has he not an opinion about something can he have an opinion which is an opinion about nothing 
 impossible 
 he who has an opinion has an opinion about some one thing 
 yes 
 and is not one thing but properly speaking nothing 
 true 
 of ignorance was assumed to be the necessary correlative of being knowledge 
 true he said 
 then opinion is not concerned either with being or with 
 not with either 
 and can therefore neither be ignorance nor knowledge 
 that seems to be true 
 but is opinion to be sought without and beyond either of them in a greater clearness than knowledge or in a greater darkness than ignorance 
 in neither 
 then i suppose that opinion appears to you to be darker than knowledge but lighter than ignorance 
 both and in no small degree 
 and also to be within and between them 
 yes 
 then you would infer that opinion is intermediate 
 no question 
 but were we not saying before that if anything appeared to be of a sort which is and is not at the same time that sort of thing would appear also to lie in the interval between pure being and absolute and that the corresponding faculty is neither knowledge nor ignorance but will be found in the interval between them 
 true 
 and in that interval there has now been discovered something which we call opinion 
 there has 
 then what remains to be discovered is the object which partakes equally of the nature of being and and cannot rightly be termed either pure and simple this unknown term when discovered we may truly call the subject of opinion and assign each to its proper faculty the extremes to the faculties of the extremes and the mean to the faculty of the mean 
 true 
 this being premised i would ask the gentleman who is of opinion that there is no absolute or unchangeable idea of beauty in whose opinion the beautiful is the manifold he i say your lover of beautiful sights who cannot bear to be told that the beautiful is one and the just is one or that anything is one to him i would appeal saying will you be so very kind sir as to tell us whether of all these beautiful things there is one which will not be found ugly or of the just which will not be found unjust or of the holy which will not also be unholy 
 no he replied the beautiful will in some point of view be found ugly and the same is true of the rest 
 and may not the many which are doubles be also halves doubles that is of one thing and halves of another 
 quite true 
 and things great and small heavy and light as they are termed will not be denoted by these any more than by the opposite names 
 true both these and the opposite names will always attach to all of them 
 and can any one of those many things which are called by particular names be said to be this rather than not to be this 
 he replied they are like the punning riddles which are asked at feasts or the puzzle about the eunuch aiming at the bat with what he hit him as they say in the puzzle and upon what the bat was sitting the individual objects of which i am speaking are also a riddle and have a double sense nor can you fix them in your mind either as being or or both or neither 
 then what will you do with them i said can they have a better place than between being and for they are clearly not in greater darkness or negation than or more full of light and existence than being 
 that is quite true he said 
 thus then we seem to have discovered that the many ideas which the multitude entertain about the beautiful and about all other things are tossing about in some region which is halfway between pure being and pure 
 we have 
 yes and we had before agreed that anything of this kind which we might find was to be described as matter of opinion and not as matter of knowledge being the intermediate flux which is caught and detained by the intermediate faculty 
 quite true 
 then those who see the many beautiful and who yet neither see absolute beauty nor can follow any guide who points the way thither who see the many just and not absolute justice and the like such persons may be said to have opinion but not knowledge 
 that is certain 
 but those who see the absolute and eternal and immutable may be said to know and not to have opinion only 
 neither can that be denied 
 the one loves and embraces the subjects of knowledge the other those of opinion the latter are the same as i dare say will remember who listened to sweet sounds and gazed upon fair colours but would not tolerate the existence of absolute beauty 
 yes i remember 
 shall we then be guilty of any impropriety in calling them lovers of opinion rather than lovers of wisdom and will they be very angry with us for thus describing them 
 i shall tell them not to be angry no man should be angry at what is true 
 but those who love the truth in each thing are to be called lovers of wisdom and not lovers of opinion 
 assuredly

 book vi 
 
 socrates glaucon 
 and thus glaucon after the argument has gone a weary way the true and the false philosophers have at length appeared in view 
 i do not think he said that the way could have been shortened 
 i suppose not i said and yet i believe that we might have had a better view of both of them if the discussion could have been confined to this one subject and if there were not many other questions awaiting us which he who desires to see in what respect the life of the just differs from that of the unjust must consider 
 and what is the next question he asked 
 surely i said the one which follows next in order inasmuch as philosophers only are able to grasp the eternal and unchangeable and those who wander in the region of the many and variable are not philosophers i must ask you which of the two classes should be the rulers of our state 
 and how can we rightly answer that question 
 whichever of the two are best able to guard the laws and institutions of our state let them be our guardians 
 very good 
 neither i said can there be any question that the guardian who is to keep anything should have eyes rather than no eyes 
 there can be no question of that 
 and are not those who are verily and indeed wanting in the knowledge of the true being of each thing and who have in their souls no clear pattern and are unable as with a eye to look at the absolute truth and to that original to repair and having perfect vision of the other world to order the laws about beauty goodness justice in this if not already ordered and to guard and preserve the order of them are not such persons i ask simply blind 
 truly he replied they are much in that condition 
 and shall they be our guardians when there are others who besides being their equals in experience and falling short of them in no particular of virtue also know the very truth of each thing 
 there can be no reason he said for rejecting those who have this greatest of all great qualities they must always have the first place unless they fail in some other respect 
 suppose then i said that we determine how far they can unite this and the other excellences 
 by all means 
 in the first place as we began by observing the nature of the philosopher has to be ascertained we must come to an understanding about him and when we have done so then if i am not mistaken we shall also acknowledge that such an union of qualities is possible and that those in whom they are united and those only should be rulers in the state 
 what do you mean 
 let us suppose that philosophical minds always love knowledge of a sort which shows them the eternal nature not varying from generation and corruption 
 agreed 
 and further i said let us agree that they are lovers of all true being there is no part whether greater or less or more or less honourable which they are willing to renounce as we said before of the lover and the man of ambition 
 true 
 and if they are to be what we were describing is there not another quality which they should also possess 
 what quality 
 truthfulness they will never intentionally receive into their mind falsehood which is their detestation and they will love the truth 
 yes that may be safely affirmed of them 
 may be my friend i replied is not the word say rather must be affirmed for he whose nature is amorous of anything cannot help loving all that belongs or is akin to the object of his affections 
 right he said 
 and is there anything more akin to wisdom than truth 
 how can there be 
 can the same nature be a lover of wisdom and a lover of falsehood 
 never 
 the true lover of learning then must from his earliest youth as far as in him lies desire all truth 
 assuredly 
 but then again as we know by experience he whose desires are strong in one direction will have them weaker in others they will be like a stream which has been drawn off into another channel 
 true 
 he whose desires are drawn towards knowledge in every form will be absorbed in the pleasures of the soul and will hardly feel bodily pleasure i mean if he be a true philosopher and not a sham one 
 that is most certain 
 such an one is sure to be temperate and the reverse of covetous for the motives which make another man desirous of having and spending have no place in his character 
 very true 
 another criterion of the philosophical nature has also to be considered 
 what is that 
 there should be no secret corner of illiberality nothing can more antagonistic than meanness to a soul which is ever longing after the whole of things both divine and human 
 most true he replied 
 then how can he who has magnificence of mind and is the spectator of all time and all existence think much of human life 
 he cannot 
 or can such an one account death fearful 
 no indeed 
 then the cowardly and mean nature has no part in true philosophy 
 certainly not 
 or again can he who is harmoniously constituted who is not covetous or mean or a boaster or a he i say ever be unjust or hard in his dealings 
 impossible 
 then you will soon observe whether a man is just and gentle or rude and unsociable these are the signs which distinguish even in youth the philosophical nature from the unphilosophical 
 true 
 there is another point which should be remarked 
 what point 
 whether he has or has not a pleasure in learning for no one will love that which gives him pain and in which after much toil he makes little progress 
 certainly not 
 and again if he is forgetful and retains nothing of what he learns will he not be an empty vessel 
 that is certain 
 labouring in vain he must end in hating himself and his fruitless occupation yes 
 then a soul which forgets cannot be ranked among genuine philosophic natures we must insist that the philosopher should have a good memory 
 certainly 
 and once more the inharmonious and unseemly nature can only tend to disproportion 
 undoubtedly 
 and do you consider truth to be akin to proportion or to disproportion 
 to proportion 
 then besides other qualities we must try to find a naturally and gracious mind which will move spontaneously towards the true being of everything 
 certainly 
 well and do not all these qualities which we have been enumerating go together and are they not in a manner necessary to a soul which is to have a full and perfect participation of being 
 they are absolutely necessary he replied 
 and must not that be a blameless study which he only can pursue who has the gift of a good memory and is quick to learn noble gracious the friend of truth justice courage temperance who are his kindred 
 the god of jealousy himself he said could find no fault with such a study 
 and to men like him i said when perfected by years and education and to these only you will entrust the state 
 socrates adeimantus 
 here adeimantus interposed and said to these statements socrates no one can offer a reply but when you talk in this way a strange feeling passes over the minds of your hearers they fancy that they are led astray a little at each step in the argument owing to their own want of skill in asking and answering questions these littles accumulate and at the end of the discussion they are found to have sustained a mighty overthrow and all their former notions appear to be turned upside down and as unskilful players of draughts are at last shut up by their more skilful adversaries and have no piece to move so they too find themselves shut up at last for they have nothing to say in this new game of which words are the counters and yet all the time they are in the right the observation is suggested to me by what is now occurring for any one of us might say that although in words he is not able to meet you at each step of the argument he sees as a fact that the votaries of philosophy when they carry on the study not only in youth as a part of education but as the pursuit of their maturer years most of them become strange monsters not to say utter rogues and that those who may be considered the best of them are made useless to the world by the very study which you extol 
 well and do you think that those who say so are wrong 
 i cannot tell he replied but i should like to know what is your opinion 
 hear my answer i am of opinion that they are quite right 
 then how can you be justified in saying that cities will not cease from evil until philosophers rule in them when philosophers are acknowledged by us to be of no use to them 
 you ask a question i said to which a reply can only be given in a parable 
 yes socrates and that is a way of speaking to which you are not at all accustomed i suppose 
 i perceive i said that you are vastly amused at having plunged me into such a hopeless discussion but now hear the parable and then you will be still more amused at the meagreness of my imagination for the manner in which the best men are treated in their own states is so grievous that no single thing on earth is comparable to it and therefore if i am to plead their cause i must have recourse to fiction and put together a figure made up of many things like the fabulous unions of goats and stags which are found in pictures imagine then a fleet or a ship in which there is a captain who is taller and stronger than any of the crew but he is a little deaf and has a similar infirmity in sight and his knowledge of navigation is not much better the sailors are quarrelling with one another about the steering every one is of opinion that he has a right to steer though he has never learned the art of navigation and cannot tell who taught him or when he learned and will further assert that it cannot be taught and they are ready to cut in pieces any one who says the contrary they throng about the captain begging and praying him to commit the helm to them and if at any time they do not prevail but others are preferred to them they kill the others or throw them overboard and having first chained up the noble senses with drink or some narcotic drug they mutiny and take possession of the ship and make free with the stores thus eating and drinking they proceed on their voyage in such a manner as might be expected of them him who is their partisan and cleverly aids them in their plot for getting the ship out of the hands into their own whether by force or persuasion they compliment with the name of sailor pilot able seaman and abuse the other sort of man whom they call a but that the true pilot must pay attention to the year and seasons and sky and stars and winds and whatever else belongs to his art if he intends to be really qualified for the command of a ship and that he must and will be the steerer whether other people like or possibility of this union of authority with the art has never seriously entered into their thoughts or been made part of their calling now in vessels which are in a state of mutiny and by sailors who are mutineers how will the true pilot be regarded will he not be called by them a prater a a 
 of course said adeimantus 
 then you will hardly need i said to hear the interpretation of the figure which describes the true philosopher in his relation to the state for you understand already 
 certainly 
 then suppose you now take this parable to the gentleman who is surprised at finding that philosophers have no honour in their cities explain it to him and try to convince him that their having honour would be far more extraordinary 
 i will 
 say to him that in deeming the best votaries of philosophy to be useless to the rest of the world he is right but also tell him to attribute their uselessness to the fault of those who will not use them and not to themselves the pilot should not humbly beg the sailors to be commanded by him that is not the order of nature neither are the wise to go to the doors of the rich the ingenious author of this saying told a lie but the truth is that when a man is ill whether he be rich or poor to the physician he must go and he who wants to be governed to him who is able to govern the ruler who is good for anything ought not to beg his subjects to be ruled by him although the present governors of mankind are of a different stamp they may be justly compared to the mutinous sailors and the true helmsmen to those who are called by them and 
 precisely so he said 
 for these reasons and among men like these philosophy the noblest pursuit of all is not likely to be much esteemed by those of the opposite faction not that the greatest and most lasting injury is done to her by her opponents but by her own professing followers the same of whom you suppose the accuser to say that the greater number of them are arrant rogues and the best are useless in which opinion i agreed 
 yes 
 and the reason why the good are useless has now been explained 
 true 
 then shall we proceed to show that the corruption of the majority is also unavoidable and that this is not to be laid to the charge of philosophy any more than the other 
 by all means 
 and let us ask and answer in turn first going back to the description of the gentle and noble nature truth as you will remember was his leader whom he followed always and in all things failing in this he was an impostor and had no part or lot in true philosophy 
 yes that was said 
 well and is not this one quality to mention no others greatly at variance with present notions of him 
 certainly he said 
 and have we not a right to say in his defence that the true lover of knowledge is always striving after being that is his nature he will not rest in the multiplicity of individuals which is an appearance only but will go on the keen edge will not be blunted nor the force of his desire abate until he have attained the knowledge of the true nature of every essence by a sympathetic and kindred power in the soul and by that power drawing near and mingling and becoming incorporate with very being having begotten mind and truth he will have knowledge and will live and grow truly and then and not till then will he cease from his travail 
 nothing he said can be more just than such a description of him 
 and will the love of a lie be any part of a nature will he not utterly hate a lie 
 he will 
 and when truth is the captain we cannot suspect any evil of the band which he leads 
 impossible 
 justice and health of mind will be of the company and temperance will follow after 
 true he replied 
 neither is there any reason why i should again set in array the virtues as you will doubtless remember that courage magnificence apprehension memory were his natural gifts and you objected that although no one could deny what i then said still if you leave words and look at facts the persons who are thus described are some of them manifestly useless and the greater number utterly depraved we were then led to enquire into the grounds of these accusations and have now arrived at the point of asking why are the majority bad which question of necessity brought us back to the examination and definition of the true philosopher 
 exactly 
 and we have next to consider the of the philosophic nature why so many are spoiled and so few escape spoiling i am speaking of those who were said to be useless but not wicked and when we have done with them we will speak of the imitators of philosophy what manner of men are they who aspire after a profession which is above them and of which they are unworthy and then by their manifold inconsistencies bring upon philosophy and upon all philosophers that universal reprobation of which we speak 
 what are these corruptions he said 
 i will see if i can explain them to you every one will admit that a nature having in perfection all the qualities which we required in a philosopher is a rare plant which is seldom seen among men 
 rare indeed 
 and what numberless and powerful causes tend to destroy these rare natures 
 what causes 
 in the first place there are their own virtues their courage temperance and the rest of them every one of which praise worthy qualities and this is a most singular circumstance destroys and distracts from philosophy the soul which is the possessor of them 
 that is very singular he replied 
 then there are all the ordinary goods of life beauty wealth strength rank and great connections in the state you understand the sort of things these also have a corrupting and distracting effect 
 i understand but i should like to know more precisely what you mean about them 
 grasp the truth as a whole i said and in the right way you will then have no difficulty in apprehending the preceding remarks and they will no longer appear strange to you 
 and how am i to do so he asked 
 why i said we know that all germs or seeds whether vegetable or animal when they fail to meet with proper nutriment or climate or soil in proportion to their vigour are all the more sensitive to the want of a suitable environment for evil is a greater enemy to what is good than what is not 
 very true 
 there is reason in supposing that the finest natures when under alien conditions receive more injury than the inferior because the contrast is greater 
 certainly 
 and may we not say adeimantus that the most gifted minds when they are become bad do not great crimes and the spirit of pure evil spring out of a fulness of nature ruined by education rather than from any inferiority whereas weak natures are scarcely capable of any very great good or very great evil 
 there i think that you are right 
 and our philosopher follows the same is like a plant which having proper nurture must necessarily grow and mature into all virtue but if sown and planted in an alien soil becomes the most noxious of all weeds unless he be preserved by some divine power do you really think as people so often say that our youth are corrupted by sophists or that private teachers of the art corrupt them in any degree worth speaking of are not the public who say these things the greatest of all sophists and do they not educate to perfection young and old men and women alike and fashion them after their own hearts 
 when is this accomplished he said 
 when they meet together and the world sits down at an assembly or in a court of law or a theatre or a camp or in any other popular resort and there is a great uproar and they praise some things which are being said or done and blame other things equally exaggerating both shouting and clapping their hands and the echo of the rocks and the place in which they are assembled redoubles the sound of the praise or blame at such a time will not a young heart as they say leap within him will any private training enable him to stand firm against the overwhelming flood of popular opinion or will he be carried away by the stream will he not have the notions of good and evil which the public in general have he will do as they do and as they are such will he be 
 yes socrates necessity will compel him 
 and yet i said there is a still greater necessity which has not been mentioned 
 what is that 
 the gentle force of attainder or confiscation or death which as you are aware these new sophists and educators who are the public apply when their words are powerless 
 indeed they do and in right good earnest 
 now what opinion of any other sophist or of any private person can be expected to overcome in such an unequal contest 
 none he replied 
 no indeed i said even to make the attempt is a great piece of folly there neither is nor has been nor is ever likely to be any different type of character which has had no other training in virtue but that which is supplied by public opinion i speak my friend of human virtue only what is more than human as the proverb says is not included for i would not have you ignorant that in the present evil state of governments whatever is saved and comes to good is saved by the power of god as we may truly say 
 i quite assent he replied 
 then let me crave your assent also to a further observation 
 what are you going to say 
 why that all those mercenary individuals whom the many call sophists and whom they deem to be their adversaries do in fact teach nothing but the opinion of the many that is to say the opinions of their assemblies and this is their wisdom i might compare them to a man who should study the tempers and desires of a mighty strong beast who is fed by would learn how to approach and handle him also at what times and from what causes he is dangerous or the reverse and what is the meaning of his several cries and by what sounds when another utters them he is soothed or infuriated and you may suppose further that when by continually attending upon him he has become perfect in all this he calls his knowledge wisdom and makes of it a system or art which he proceeds to teach although he has no real notion of what he means by the principles or passions of which he is speaking but calls this honourable and that dishonourable or good or evil or just or unjust all in accordance with the tastes and tempers of the great brute good he pronounces to be that in which the beast delights and evil to be that which he dislikes and he can give no other account of them except that the just and noble are the necessary having never himself seen and having no power of explaining to others the nature of either or the difference between them which is immense by heaven would not such an one be a rare educator 
 indeed he would 
 and in what way does he who thinks that wisdom is the discernment of the tempers and tastes of the motley multitude whether in painting or music or finally in politics differ from him whom i have been describing for when a man consorts with the many and exhibits to them his poem or other work of art or the service which he has done the state making them his judges when he is not obliged the necessity of diomede will oblige him to produce whatever they praise and yet the reasons are utterly ludicrous which they give in confirmation of their own notions about the honourable and good did you ever hear any of them which were not 
 no nor am i likely to hear 
 you recognise the truth of what i have been saying then let me ask you to consider further whether the world will ever be induced to believe in the existence of absolute beauty rather than of the many beautiful or of the absolute in each kind rather than of the many in each kind 
 certainly not 
 then the world cannot possibly be a philosopher 
 impossible 
 and therefore philosophers must inevitably fall under the censure of the world 
 they must 
 and of individuals who consort with the mob and seek to please them 
 that is evident 
 then do you see any way in which the philosopher can be preserved in his calling to the end and remember what we were saying of him that he was to have quickness and memory and courage and magnificence these were admitted by us to be the true gifts 
 yes 
 will not such an one from his early childhood be in all things first among all especially if his bodily endowments are like his mental ones 
 certainly he said 
 and his friends and will want to use him as he gets older for their own purposes 
 no question 
 falling at his feet they will make requests to him and do him honour and flatter him because they want to get into their hands now the power which he will one day possess 
 that often happens he said 
 and what will a man such as he be likely to do under such circumstances especially if he be a citizen of a great city rich and noble and a tall proper youth will he not be full of boundless aspirations and fancy himself able to manage the affairs of hellenes and of barbarians and having got such notions into his head will he not dilate and elevate himself in the fulness of vain pomp and senseless pride 
 to be sure he will 
 now when he is in this state of mind if some one gently comes to him and tells him that he is a fool and must get understanding which can only be got by slaving for it do you think that under such adverse circumstances he will be easily induced to listen 
 far otherwise 
 and even if there be some one who through inherent goodness or natural reasonableness has had his eyes opened a little and is humbled and taken captive by philosophy how will his friends behave when they think that they are likely to lose the advantage which they were hoping to reap from his companionship will they not do and say anything to prevent him from yielding to his better nature and to render his teacher powerless using to this end private intrigues as well as public prosecutions 
 there can be no doubt of it 
 and how can one who is thus circumstanced ever become a philosopher 
 impossible 
 then were we not right in saying that even the very qualities which make a man a philosopher may if he be divert him from philosophy no less than riches and their accompaniments and the other goods of life 
 we were quite right 
 thus my excellent friend is brought about all that ruin and failure which i have been describing of the natures best adapted to the best of all pursuits they are natures which we maintain to be rare at any time this being the class out of which come the men who are the authors of the greatest evil to states and individuals and also of the greatest good when the tide carries them in that direction but a small man never was the doer of any great thing either to individuals or to states 
 that is most true he said 
 and so philosophy is left desolate with her marriage rite incomplete for her own have fallen away and forsaken her and while they are leading a false and unbecoming life other unworthy persons seeing that she has no kinsmen to be her protectors enter in and dishonour her and fasten upon her the reproaches which as you say her reprovers utter who affirm of her votaries that some are good for nothing and that the greater number deserve the severest punishment 
 that is certainly what people say 
 yes and what else would you expect i said when you think of the puny creatures who seeing this land open to them a land well stocked with fair names and showy titles like prisoners running out of prison into a sanctuary take a leap out of their trades into philosophy those who do so being probably the cleverest hands at their own miserable crafts for although philosophy be in this evil case still there remains a dignity about her which is not to be found in the arts and many are thus attracted by her whose natures are imperfect and whose souls are maimed and disfigured by their meannesses as their bodies are by their trades and crafts is not this unavoidable 
 yes 
 are they not exactly like a bald little tinker who has just got out of durance and come into a fortune he takes a bath and puts on a new coat and is decked out as a bridegroom going to marry his daughter who is left poor and desolate 
 a most exact parallel 
 what will be the issue of such marriages will they not be vile and bastard 
 there can be no question of it 
 and when persons who are unworthy of education approach philosophy and make an alliance with her who is a rank above them what sort of ideas and opinions are likely to be generated will they not be sophisms captivating to the ear having nothing in them genuine or worthy of or akin to true wisdom 
 no doubt he said 
 then adeimantus i said the worthy disciples of philosophy will be but a small remnant perchance some noble and person detained by exile in her service who in the absence of corrupting influences remains devoted to her or some lofty soul born in a mean city the politics of which he contemns and neglects and there may be a gifted few who leave the arts which they justly despise and come to her or peradventure there are some who are restrained by our friend theages bridle for everything in the life of theages conspired to divert him from philosophy but kept him away from politics my own case of the internal sign is hardly worth mentioning for rarely if ever has such a monitor been given to any other man those who belong to this small class have tasted how sweet and blessed a possession philosophy is and have also seen enough of the madness of the multitude and they know that no politician is honest nor is there any champion of justice at whose side they may fight and be saved such an one may be compared to a man who has fallen among wild beasts he will not join in the wickedness of his fellows but neither is he able singly to resist all their fierce natures and therefore seeing that he would be of no use to the state or to his friends and reflecting that he would have to throw away his life without doing any good either to himself or others he holds his peace and goes his own way he is like one who in the storm of dust and sleet which the driving wind hurries along retires under the shelter of a wall and seeing the rest of mankind full of wickedness he is content if only he can live his own life and be pure from evil or unrighteousness and depart in peace and with bright hopes 
 yes he said and he will have done a great work before he departs 
 a great work yes but not the greatest unless he find a state suitable to him for in a state which is suitable to him he will have a larger growth and be the saviour of his country as well as of himself 
 the causes why philosophy is in such an evil name have now been sufficiently explained the injustice of the charges against her has been there anything more which you wish to say 
 nothing more on that subject he replied but i should like to know which of the governments now existing is in your opinion the one adapted to her 
 not any of them i said and that is precisely the accusation which i bring against them not one of them is worthy of the philosophic nature and hence that nature is warped and estranged as the exotic seed which is sown in a foreign land becomes denaturalized and is wont to be overpowered and to lose itself in the new soil even so this growth of philosophy instead of persisting degenerates and receives another character but if philosophy ever finds in the state that perfection which she herself is then will be seen that she is in truth divine and that all other things whether natures of men or institutions are but human and now i know that you are going to ask what that state is 
 no he said there you are wrong for i was going to ask another question whether it is the state of which we are the founders and inventors or some other 
 yes i replied ours in most respects but you may remember my saying before that some living authority would always be required in the state having the same idea of the constitution which guided you when as legislator you were laying down the laws 
 that was said he replied 
 yes but not in a satisfactory manner you frightened us by interposing objections which certainly showed that the discussion would be long and difficult and what still remains is the reverse of easy 
 what is there remaining 
 the question how the study of philosophy may be so ordered as not to be the ruin of the state all great attempts are attended with risk hard is the good as men say 
 still he said let the point be cleared up and the enquiry will then be complete 
 i shall not be hindered i said by any want of will but if at all by a want of power my zeal you may see for yourselves and please to remark in what i am about to say how boldly and unhesitatingly i declare that states should pursue philosophy not as they do now but in a different spirit 
 in what manner 
 at present i said the students of philosophy are quite young beginning when they are hardly past childhood they devote only the time saved from moneymaking and housekeeping to such pursuits and even those of them who are reputed to have most of the philosophic spirit when they come within sight of the great difficulty of the subject i mean dialectic take themselves off in after life when invited by some one else they may perhaps go and hear a lecture and about this they make much ado for philosophy is not considered by them to be their proper business at last when they grow old in most cases they are extinguished more truly than heracleitus sun inasmuch as they never light up again 
 but what ought to be their course 
 just the opposite in childhood and youth their study and what philosophy they learn should be suited to their tender years during this period while they are growing up towards manhood the chief and special care should be given to their bodies that they may have them to use in the service of philosophy as life advances and the intellect begins to mature let them increase the gymnastics of the soul but when the strength of our citizens fails and is past civil and military duties then let them range at will and engage in no serious labour as we intend them to live happily here and to crown this life with a similar happiness in another 
 how truly in earnest you are socrates he said i am sure of that and yet most of your hearers if i am not mistaken are likely to be still more earnest in their opposition to you and will never be convinced thrasymachus least of all 
 do not make a quarrel i said between thrasymachus and me who have recently become friends although indeed we were never enemies for i shall go on striving to the utmost until i either convert him and other men or do something which may profit them against the day when they live again and hold the like discourse in another state of existence 
 you are speaking of a time which is not very near 
 rather i replied of a time which is as nothing in comparison with eternity nevertheless i do not wonder that the many refuse to believe for they have never seen that of which we are now speaking realised they have seen only a conventional imitation of philosophy consisting of words artificially brought together not like these of ours having a natural unity but a human being who in word and work is perfectly moulded as far as he can be into the proportion and likeness of virtue such a man ruling in a city which bears the same image they have never yet seen neither one nor many of them do you think that they ever did 
 no indeed 
 no my friend and they have seldom if ever heard free and noble sentiments such as men utter when they are earnestly and by every means in their power seeking after truth for the sake of knowledge while they look coldly on the subtleties of controversy of which the end is opinion and strife whether they meet with them in the courts of law or in society 
 they are strangers he said to the words of which you speak 
 and this was what we foresaw and this was the reason why truth forced us to admit not without fear and hesitation that neither cities nor states nor individuals will ever attain perfection until the small class of philosophers whom we termed useless but not corrupt are providentially compelled whether they will or not to take care of the state and until a like necessity be laid on the state to obey them or until kings or if not kings the sons of kings or princes are divinely inspired d with a true love of true philosophy that either or both of these alternatives are impossible i see no reason to affirm if they were so we might indeed be justly ridiculed as dreamers and visionaries am i not right 
 quite right 
 if then in the countless ages of the past or at the present hour in some foreign clime which is far away and beyond our ken the perfected philosopher is or has been or hereafter shall be compelled by a superior power to have the charge of the state we are ready to assert to the death that this our constitution has been and is yea and will be whenever the muse of philosophy is queen there is no impossibility in all this that there is a difficulty we acknowledge ourselves 
 my opinion agrees with yours he said 
 but do you mean to say that this is not the opinion of the multitude 
 i should imagine not he replied 
 o my friend i said do not attack the multitude they will change their minds if not in an aggressive spirit but gently and with the view of soothing them and removing their dislike of you show them your philosophers as they really are and describe as you were just now doing their character and profession and then mankind will see that he of whom you are speaking is not such as they supposed if they view him in this new light they will surely change their notion of him and answer in another strain who can be at enmity with one who loves them who that is himself gentle and free from envy will be jealous of one in whom there is no jealousy nay let me answer for you that in a few this harsh temper may be found but not in the majority of mankind 
 i quite agree with you he said 
 and do you not also think as i do that the harsh feeling which the many entertain towards philosophy originates in the pretenders who rush in uninvited and are always abusing them and finding fault with them who make persons instead of things the theme of their conversation and nothing can be more unbecoming in philosophers than this 
 it is most unbecoming 
 for he adeimantus whose mind is fixed upon true being has surely no time to look down upon the affairs of earth or to be filled with malice and envy contending against men his eye is ever directed towards things fixed and immutable which he sees neither injuring nor injured by one another but all in order moving according to reason these he imitates and to these he will as far as he can conform himself can a man help imitating that with which he holds reverential converse 
 impossible 
 and the philosopher holding converse with the divine order becomes orderly and divine as far as the nature of man allows but like every one else he will suffer from detraction 
 of course 
 and if a necessity be laid upon him of fashioning not only himself but human nature generally whether in states or individuals into that which he beholds elsewhere will he think you be an unskilful artificer of justice temperance and every civil virtue 
 anything but unskilful 
 and if the world perceives that what we are saying about him is the truth will they be angry with philosophy will they disbelieve us when we tell them that no state can be happy which is not designed by artists who imitate the heavenly pattern 
 they will not be angry if they understand he said but how will they draw out the plan of which you are speaking 
 they will begin by taking the state and the manners of men from which as from a tablet they will rub out the picture and leave a clean surface this is no easy task but whether easy or not herein will lie the difference between them and every other legislator they will have nothing to do either with individual or state and will inscribe no laws until they have either found or themselves made a clean surface 
 they will be very right he said 
 having effected this they will proceed to trace an outline of the constitution 
 no doubt 
 and when they are filling in the work as i conceive they will often turn their eyes upwards and downwards i mean that they will first look at absolute justice and beauty and temperance and again at the human copy and will mingle and temper the various elements of life into the image of a man and thus they will conceive according to that other image which when existing among men homer calls the form and likeness of god 
 very true he said 
 and one feature they will erase and another they will put in they have made the ways of men as far as possible agreeable to the ways of god 
 indeed he said in no way could they make a fairer picture 
 and now i said are we beginning to persuade those whom you described as rushing at us with might and main that the painter of constitutions is such an one as we are praising at whom they were so very indignant because to his hands we committed the state and are they growing a little calmer at what they have just heard 
 much calmer if there is any sense in them 
 why where can they still find any ground for objection will they doubt that the philosopher is a lover of truth and being 
 they would not be so unreasonable 
 or that his nature being such as we have delineated is akin to the highest good 
 neither can they doubt this 
 but again will they tell us that such a nature placed under favourable circumstances will not be perfectly good and wise if any ever was or will they prefer those whom we have rejected 
 surely not 
 then will they still be angry at our saying that until philosophers bear rule states and individuals will have no rest from evil nor will this our imaginary state ever be realised 
 i think that they will be less angry 
 shall we assume that they are not only less angry but quite gentle and that they have been converted and for very shame if for no other reason cannot refuse to come to terms 
 by all means he said 
 then let us suppose that the reconciliation has been effected will any one deny the other point that there may be sons of kings or princes who are by nature philosophers 
 surely no man he said 
 and when they have come into being will any one say that they must of necessity be destroyed that they can hardly be saved is not denied even by us but that in the whole course of ages no single one of them can escape who will venture to affirm this 
 who indeed 
 but said i one is enough let there be one man who has a city obedient to his will and he might bring into existence the ideal polity about which the world is so incredulous 
 yes one is enough 
 the ruler may impose the laws and institutions which we have been describing and the citizens may possibly be willing to obey them 
 certainly 
 and that others should approve of what we approve is no miracle or impossibility 
 i think not 
 but we have sufficiently shown in what has preceded that all this if only possible is assuredly for the best 
 we have 
 and now we say not only that our laws if they could be enacted would be for the best but also that the enactment of them though difficult is not impossible 
 very good 
 and so with pain and toil we have reached the end of one subject but more remains to be discussed how and by what studies and pursuits will the saviours of the constitution be created and at what ages are they to apply themselves to their several studies 
 certainly 
 i omitted the troublesome business of the possession of women and the procreation of children and the appointment of the rulers because i knew that the perfect state would be eyed with jealousy and was difficult of attainment but that piece of cleverness was not of much service to me for i had to discuss them all the same the women and children are now disposed of but the other question of the rulers must be investigated from the very beginning we were saying as you will remember that they were to be lovers of their country tried by the test of pleasures and pains and neither in hardships nor in dangers nor at any other critical moment were to lose their patriotism he was to be rejected who failed but he who always came forth pure like gold tried in the fire was to be made a ruler and to receive honours and rewards in life and after death this was the sort of thing which was being said and then the argument turned aside and veiled her face not liking to stir the question which has now arisen 
 i perfectly remember he said 
 yes my friend i said and i then shrank from hazarding the bold word but now let me dare to say that the perfect guardian must be a philosopher 
 yes he said let that be affirmed 
 and do not suppose that there will be many of them for the gifts which were deemed by us to be essential rarely grow together they are mostly found in shreds and patches 
 what do you mean he said 
 you are aware i replied that quick intelligence memory sagacity cleverness and similar qualities do not often grow together and that persons who possess them and are at the same time and magnanimous are not so constituted by nature as to live orderly and in a peaceful and settled manner they are driven any way by their impulses and all solid principle goes out of them 
 very true he said 
 on the other hand those steadfast natures which can better be depended upon which in a battle are impregnable to fear and immovable are equally immovable when there is anything to be learned they are always in a torpid state and are apt to yawn and go to sleep over any intellectual toil 
 quite true 
 and yet we were saying that both qualities were necessary in those to whom the higher education is to be imparted and who are to share in any office or command 
 certainly he said 
 and will they be a class which is rarely found 
 yes indeed 
 then the aspirant must not only be tested in those labours and dangers and pleasures which we mentioned before but there is another kind of probation which we did not mention he must be exercised also in many kinds of knowledge to see whether the soul will be able to endure the highest of all will faint under them as in any other studies and exercises 
 yes he said you are quite right in testing him but what do you mean by the highest of all knowledge 
 you may remember i said that we divided the soul into three parts and distinguished the several natures of justice temperance courage and wisdom 
 indeed he said if i had forgotten i should not deserve to hear more 
 and do you remember the word of caution which preceded the discussion of them 
 to what do you refer 
 we were saying if i am not mistaken that he who wanted to see them in their perfect beauty must take a longer and more circuitous way at the end of which they would appear but that we could add on a popular exposition of them on a level with the discussion which had preceded and you replied that such an exposition would be enough for you and so the enquiry was continued in what to me seemed to be a very inaccurate manner whether you were satisfied or not it is for you to say 
 yes he said i thought and the others thought that you gave us a fair measure of truth 
 but my friend i said a measure of such things which in any degree falls short of the whole truth is not fair measure for nothing imperfect is the measure of anything although persons are too apt to be contented and think that they need search no further 
 not an uncommon case when people are indolent 
 yes i said and there cannot be any worse fault in a guardian of the state and of the laws 
 true 
 the guardian then i said must be required to take the longer circuit and toll at learning as well as at gymnastics or he will never reach the highest knowledge of all which as we were just now saying is his proper calling 
 what he said is there a knowledge still higher than this higher than justice and the other virtues 
 yes i said there is and of the virtues too we must behold not the outline merely as at present nothing short of the most finished picture should satisfy us when little things are elaborated with an infinity of pains in order that they may appear in their full beauty and utmost clearness how ridiculous that we should not think the highest truths worthy of attaining the highest accuracy 
 a right noble thought but do you suppose that we shall refrain from asking you what is this highest knowledge 
 nay i said ask if you will but i am certain that you have heard the answer many times and now you either do not understand me or as i rather think you are disposed to be troublesome for you have of been told that the idea of good is the highest knowledge and that all other things become useful and advantageous only by their use of this you can hardly be ignorant that of this i was about to speak concerning which as you have often heard me say we know so little and without which any other knowledge or possession of any kind will profit us nothing do you think that the possession of all other things is of any value if we do not possess the good or the knowledge of all other things if we have no knowledge of beauty and goodness 
 assuredly not 
 you are further aware that most people affirm pleasure to be the good but the finer sort of wits say it is knowledge 
 yes 
 and you are aware too that the latter cannot explain what they mean by knowledge but are obliged after all to say knowledge of the good 
 how ridiculous 
 yes i said that they should begin by reproaching us with our ignorance of the good and then presume our knowledge of it for the good they define to be knowledge of the good just as if we understood them when they use the term good this is of course ridiculous 
 most true he said 
 and those who make pleasure their good are in equal perplexity for they are compelled to admit that there are bad pleasures as well as good 
 certainly 
 and therefore to acknowledge that bad and good are the same 
 true 
 there can be no doubt about the numerous difficulties in which this question is involved 
 there can be none 
 further do we not see that many are willing to do or to have or to seem to be what is just and honourable without the reality but no one is satisfied with the appearance of good the reality is what they seek in the case of the good appearance is despised by every one 
 very true he said 
 of this then which every soul of man pursues and makes the end of all his actions having a presentiment that there is such an end and yet hesitating because neither knowing the nature nor having the same assurance of this as of other things and therefore losing whatever good there is in other things of a principle such and so great as this ought the best men in our state to whom everything is entrusted to be in the darkness of ignorance 
 certainly not he said 
 i am sure i said that he who does not know now the beautiful and the just are likewise good will be but a sorry guardian of them and i suspect that no one who is ignorant of the good will have a true knowledge of them 
 that he said is a shrewd suspicion of yours 
 and if we only have a guardian who has this knowledge our state will be perfectly ordered 
 of course he replied but i wish that you would tell me whether you conceive this supreme principle of the good to be knowledge or pleasure or different from either 
 aye i said i knew all along that a fastidious gentleman like you would not be contented with the thoughts of other people about these matters 
 true socrates but i must say that one who like you has passed a lifetime in the study of philosophy should not be always repeating the opinions of others and never telling his own 
 well but has any one a right to say positively what he does not know 
 not he said with the assurance of positive certainty he has no right to do that but he may say what he thinks as a matter of opinion 
 and do you not know i said that all mere opinions are bad and the best of them blind you would not deny that those who have any true notion without intelligence are only like blind men who feel their way along the road 
 very true 
 and do you wish to behold what is blind and crooked and base when others will tell you of brightness and beauty 
 glaucon socrates 
 still i must implore you socrates said glaucon not to turn away just as you are reaching the goal if you will only give such an explanation of the good as you have already given of justice and temperance and the other virtues we shall be satisfied 
 yes my friend and i shall be at least equally satisfied but i cannot help fearing that i shall fall and that my indiscreet zeal will bring ridicule upon me no sweet sirs let us not at present ask what is the actual nature of the good for to reach what is now in my thoughts would be an effort too great for me but of the child of the good who is likest him i would fain speak if i could be sure that you wished to hear otherwise not 
 by all means he said tell us about the child and you shall remain in our debt for the account of the parent 
 i do indeed wish i replied that i could pay and you receive the account of the parent and not as now of the offspring only take however this latter by way of interest and at the same time have a care that i do not render a false account although i have no intention of deceiving you 
 yes we will take all the care that we can proceed 
 yes i said but i must first come to an understanding with you and remind you of what i have mentioned in the course of this discussion and at many other times 
 what 
 the old story that there is a many beautiful and a many good and so of other things which we describe and define to all of them many is applied 
 true he said 
 and there is an absolute beauty and an absolute good and of other things to which the term many is applied there is an absolute for they may be brought under a single idea which is called the essence of each 
 very true 
 the many as we say are seen but not known and the ideas are known but not seen 
 exactly 
 and what is the organ with which we see the visible things 
 the sight he said 
 and with the hearing i said we hear and with the other senses perceive the other objects of sense 
 true 
 but have you remarked that sight is by far the most costly and complex piece of workmanship which the artificer of the senses ever contrived 
 no i never have he said 
 then reflect has the ear or voice need of any third or additional nature in order that the one may be able to hear and the other to be heard 
 nothing of the sort 
 no indeed i replied and the same is true of most if not all the other senses you would not say that any of them requires such an addition 
 certainly not 
 but you see that without the addition of some other nature there is no seeing or being seen 
 how do you mean 
 sight being as i conceive in the eyes and he who has eyes wanting to see colour being also present in them still unless there be a third nature specially adapted to the purpose the owner of the eyes will see nothing and the colours will be invisible 
 of what nature are you speaking 
 of that which you term light i replied 
 true he said 
 noble then is the bond which links together sight and visibility and great beyond other bonds by no small difference of nature for light is their bond and light is no ignoble thing 
 nay he said the reverse of ignoble 
 and which i said of the gods in heaven would you say was the lord of this element whose is that light which makes the eye to see perfectly and the visible to appear 
 you mean the sun as you and all mankind say 
 may not the relation of sight to this deity be described as follows 
 how 
 neither sight nor the eye in which sight resides is the sun 
 no 
 yet of all the organs of sense the eye is the most like the sun 
 by far the most like 
 and the power which the eye possesses is a sort of effluence which is dispensed from the sun 
 exactly 
 then the sun is not sight but the author of sight who is recognised by sight 
 true he said 
 and this is he whom i call the child of the good whom the good begat in his own likeness to be in the visible world in relation to sight and the things of sight what the good is in the intellectual world in relation to mind and the things of mind 
 will you be a little more explicit he said 
 why you know i said that the eyes when a person directs them towards objects on which the light of day is no longer shining but the moon and stars only see dimly and are nearly blind they seem to have no clearness of vision in them 
 very true 
 but when they are directed towards objects on which the sun shines they see clearly and there is sight in them 
 certainly 
 and the soul is like the eye when resting upon that on which truth and being shine the soul perceives and understands and is radiant with intelligence but when turned towards the twilight of becoming and perishing then she has opinion only and goes blinking about and is first of one opinion and then of another and seems to have no intelligence 
 just so 
 now that which imparts truth to the known and the power of knowing to the knower is what i would have you term the idea of good and this you will deem to be the cause of science and of truth in so far as the latter becomes the subject of knowledge beautiful too as are both truth and knowledge you will be right in esteeming this other nature as more beautiful than either and as in the previous instance light and sight may be truly said to be like the sun and yet not to be the sun so in this other sphere science and truth may be deemed to be like the good but not the good the good has a place of honour yet higher 
 what a wonder of beauty that must be he said which is the author of science and truth and yet surpasses them in beauty for you surely cannot mean to say that pleasure is the good 
 god forbid i replied but may i ask you to consider the image in another point of view 
 in what point of view 
 you would say would you not that the sun is only the author of visibility in all visible things but of generation and nourishment and growth though he himself is not generation 
 certainly 
 in like manner the good may be said to be not only the author of knowledge to all things known but of their being and essence and yet the good is not essence but far exceeds essence in dignity and power 
 glaucon said with a ludicrous earnestness by the light of heaven how amazing 
 yes i said and the exaggeration may be set down to you for you made me utter my fancies 
 and pray continue to utter them at any rate let us hear if there is anything more to be said about the similitude of the sun 
 yes i said there is a great deal more 
 then omit nothing however slight 
 i will do my best i said but i should think that a great deal will have to be omitted 
 you have to imagine then that there are two ruling powers and that one of them is set over the intellectual world the other over the visible i do not say heaven lest you should fancy that i am playing upon the name ourhanoz orhatoz may i suppose that you have this distinction of the visible and intelligible fixed in your mind 
 i have 
 now take a line which has been cut into two unequal parts and divide each of them again in the same proportion and suppose the two main divisions to answer one to the visible and the other to the intelligible and then compare the subdivisions in respect of their clearness and want of clearness and you will find that the first section in the sphere of the visible consists of images and by images i mean in the first place shadows and in the second place reflections in water and in solid smooth and polished bodies and the like do you understand 
 yes i understand 
 imagine now the other section of which this is only the resemblance to include the animals which we see and everything that grows or is made 
 very good 
 would you not admit that both the sections of this division have different degrees of truth and that the copy is to the original as the sphere of opinion is to the sphere of knowledge 
 most undoubtedly 
 next proceed to consider the manner in which the sphere of the intellectual is to be divided 
 in what manner 
 thus there are two subdivisions in the lower or which the soul uses the figures given by the former division as images the enquiry can only be hypothetical and instead of going upwards to a principle descends to the other end in the higher of the two the soul passes out of hypotheses and goes up to a principle which is above hypotheses making no use of images as in the former case but proceeding only in and through the ideas themselves 
 i do not quite understand your meaning he said 
 then i will try again you will understand me better when i have made some preliminary remarks you are aware that students of geometry arithmetic and the kindred sciences assume the odd and the even and the figures and three kinds of angles and the like in their several branches of science these are their hypotheses which they and everybody are supposed to know and therefore they do not deign to give any account of them either to themselves or others but they begin with them and go on until they arrive at last and in a consistent manner at their conclusion 
 yes he said i know 
 and do you not know also that although they make use of the visible forms and reason about them they are thinking not of these but of the ideals which they resemble not of the figures which they draw but of the absolute square and the absolute diameter and so on the forms which they draw or make and which have shadows and reflections in water of their own are converted by them into images but they are really seeking to behold the things themselves which can only be seen with the eye of the mind 
 that is true 
 and of this kind i spoke as the intelligible although in the search after it the soul is compelled to use hypotheses not ascending to a first principle because she is unable to rise above the region of hypothesis but employing the objects of which the shadows below are resemblances in their turn as images they having in relation to the shadows and reflections of them a greater distinctness and therefore a higher value 
 i understand he said that you are speaking of the province of geometry and the sister arts 
 and when i speak of the other division of the intelligible you will understand me to speak of that other sort of knowledge which reason herself attains by the power of dialectic using the hypotheses not as first principles but only as hypotheses that is to say as steps and points of departure into a world which is above hypotheses in order that she may soar beyond them to the first principle of the whole and clinging to this and then to that which depends on this by successive steps she descends again without the aid of any sensible object from ideas through ideas and in ideas she ends 
 i understand you he replied not perfectly for you seem to me to be describing a task which is really tremendous but at any rate i understand you to say that knowledge and being which the science of dialectic contemplates are clearer than the notions of the arts as they are termed which proceed from hypotheses only these are also contemplated by the understanding and not by the senses yet because they start from hypotheses and do not ascend to a principle those who contemplate them appear to you not to exercise the higher reason upon them although when a first principle is added to them they are cognizable by the higher reason and the habit which is concerned with geometry and the cognate sciences i suppose that you would term understanding and not reason as being intermediate between opinion and reason 
 you have quite conceived my meaning i said and now corresponding to these four divisions let there be four faculties in the answering to the highest understanding to the second faith or conviction to the third and perception of shadows to the let there be a scale of them and let us suppose that the several faculties have clearness in the same degree that their objects have truth 
 i understand he replied and give my assent and accept your arrangement
