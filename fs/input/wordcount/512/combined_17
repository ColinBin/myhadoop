 everything seemed fuzzy slow harry and hermione jumped to their feet and drew their wands many people were only just realizing that something strange had happened heads were still turning toward the silver cat as it vanished silence spread outward in cold ripples from the place where the patronus had landed then somebody screamed 
 
 harry and hermione threw themselves into the panicking crowd guests were sprinting in all directions many were disapparating the protective enchantments around the burrow had broken 
 
 ron hermione cried ron where are you 
 
 as they pushed their way across the dance floor harry saw cloaked and masked figures appearing in the crowd then he saw lupin and tonks their wands raised and heard both of them shout protego a cry that was echoed on all sides c 
 
 ron ron hermione called half sobbing as she and harry were buffered by terrified guests harry seized her hand to make sure they werent separated as a streak of light whizzed over their heads whether a protective charm or something more sinister he did not know c 
 
 and then ron was there he caught hold of hermiones free arm and harry felt her turn on the spot sight and sound were extinguished as darkness pressed in upon him all he could feel was hermiones hand as he was squeezed through space and time away from the burrow away from the descending death eaters away perhaps from voldemort himself 
 
 where are we said rons voice 
 
 harry opened his eyes for a moment he thought they had not left the wedding after all they still seemed to be surrounded by people 
 
 tottenham court road panted hermione walk just walk we need to find somewhere for you to change 
 
 harry did as she asked they half walked half ran up the wide dark street thronged with revelers and lined with closed shops stars twinkling above them a bus rumbled by and a group of merry ogled them as they passed harry and ron were still wearing dress robes 
 
 hermione we havent got anything to change into ron told her as a young woman burst into raucous giggles at the sight of him 
 
 why didnt i make sure i had the invisibility cloak with me said harry inwardly cursing his own stupidity all last year i kept it on me and c 
 
 its okay ive got the cloak ive got clothes for both of you said hermione just try and act naturally until c this will do 
 
 she led them down a side street then into the shelter of a shadowy alleyway 
 
 when you say youve got the cloak and clothes said harry frowning at hermione who was carrying nothing except her small beaded handbag in which she was now rummaging 
 
 yes theyre here said hermione and to harry and rons utter astonishment she pulled out a pair of jeans a sweatshirt some maroon socks and finally the silvery invisibility cloak 
 
 how the ruddy hell c 
 
 undetectable extension charm said hermione tricky but i think ive done it okay anyway i managed to fit everything we need in here she gave the bag a little shake and it echoed like a cargo hold as a number of heavy objects rolled around inside it oh damn thatll be the books she said peering into it and i had them all stacked by subject oh well harry youd better take the invisibility cloak ron hurry up and change 
 
 when did you do all this harry asked as ron stripped off his robes 
 
 i told you at the burrow ive had the essentials packed for days you know in case we needed to make a quick getaway i packed your rucksack this morning harry after you changed and put it in here i just had a feeling 
 
 youre amazing you are said ron handing her his robes 
 
 thank you said hermione managing a small smile as she pushed the robes into the bag please harry get that cloak on 
 
 harry threw his invisibility cloak around his shoulders and pulled it up over his head vanishing from sight he was only just beginning to appreciate what had happened 
 
 the others c everybody at the wedding c 
 
 we cant worry about that now whispered hermione its you theyre after harry and well just put everyone in even more danger by going back 
 
 shes right said ron who seemed to know that harry was about to argue even if he could not see his face most of the order was there theyll look after everyone 
 
 harry nodded then remembered that they could not see him and said yeah but he thought of ginny and fear bubbled like acid in his stomach 
 
 come on i think we ought to keep moving said hermione 
 
 they moved back up the side street and onto the main road again where a group of men on the opposite side was singing and weaving across the pavement 
 
 just as a matter of interest why tottenham court road ron asked hermione 
 
 ive no idea it just popped into my head but im sure were safer out in the muggle world its not where theyll expect us to be 
 
 true said ron looking around but dont you feel a bit c exposed 
 
 where else is there asked hermione cringing as the men on the other side of the road started at her we can hardly book rooms at the leaky cauldron can we and grimmauld place is out if snape can get in there i suppose we could try my parents home though i think theres a chance they might check there oh i wish theyd shut up 
 
 all right darling the drunkest of the men on the other pavement was yelling fancy a drink ditch ginger and come and have a pint 
 
 lets sit down somewhere hermione said hastily as ron opened his mouth to shout back across the road look this will do in here 
 
 it was a small and shabby caf a light layer of grease lay on all the tables but it was at least empty harry slipped into a booth first and ron sat next to him opposite hermione who had her back to the entrance and did not like it she glanced over her shoulder so frequently she appeared to have a twitch harry did not like being stationary walking had given the illusion that they had a goal beneath the cloak he could feel the last vestiges of polyjuice leaving him his hands returning to their usual length and shape he pulled his glasses out of his pocket and put them on again 
 
 after a minute or two ron said you know were not far from the leaky cauldron here its only in charing cross c 
 
 ron we cant said hermione at once 
 
 not to stay there but to find out whats going on 
 
 we know whats going on voldemorts taken over the ministry what else do we need to know 
 
 okay okay it was just an idea 
 
 they relapsed into a prickly silence the waitress shuffled over and hermione ordered two cappuccinos as harry was invisible it would have looked odd to order him one a pair of burly workmen entered the caf and squeezed into the next booth hermione dropped her voice to a whisper 
 
 i say we find a quiet place to disapparate and head for the countryside once were there we could send a message to the order 
 
 can you do that talking patronus thing then asked ron 
 
 ive been practicing and i think so said hermione 
 
 well as long as it doesnt get them into trouble though they mightve been arrested already god thats revolting ron added after one sip of the foamy grayish coffee the waitress had heard she shot ron a nasty look as she shuffled off to take the new customers orders the larger of the two workmen who was blond and quite huge now that harry came to look at him waved her away she stared affronted 
 
 lets get going then i dont want to drink this muck said ron hermione have you got muggle money to pay for this 
 
 yes i took out all my building society savings before i came to the burrow ill bet all the change is at the bottom sighed hermione reaching for her beaded bag 
 
 the two workmen made identical movements and harry mirrored them without conscious thought all three of them drew their wands ron a few seconds late in realizing what was going on lunged across the table pushing hermione sideways onto her bench the force of the death eaters spells shattered the tiled wall where rons head had just been as harry still invisible yelled stupefy 
 
 the great blond death eater was hit in the face by a jet of red light he slumped sideways unconscious his companion unable to see who had cast the spell fired another at ron shining black ropes flew from his and bound ron head to foot c the waitress screamed and ran for the door c harry sent another stunning spell at the death eater with the twisted face who had tied up ron but the spell missed rebounded on the window and hit the waitress who collapsed in front of the door 
 
 expulso bellowed the death eater and the table behind which harry was standing blew up the force of the explosion slammed him into the wall and he felt his wand leave his hand as the cloak slipped off him 
 
 petrificus totalus screamed hermione from out of sight and the death eater fell forward like a statue to land with a crunching thud on the mess of broken china table and coffee hermione crawled out from underneath the bench shaking bits of glass ashtray out of her hair and trembling all over 
 
 she said pointing her wand at ron who roared in pain as she slashed open the knee of his jeans leaving a deep cut oh im so sorry ron my hands shaking diffindo 
 
 the severed ropes fell away ron got to his feet shaking his arms to regain feeling in them harry picked up his wand and climbed over all the debris to where the large blond death eater was sprawled across the bench 
 
 i shouldve recognized him he was there the night dumbledore died he said he turned over the darker death eater with his foot the mans eyes moved rapidly between harry ron and hermione 
 
 thats dolohov said ron i recognize him from the old wanted posters i think the big ones thorfinn rowle 
 
 never mind what theyre called said hermione a little hysterically how did they find us what are we going to do 
 
 somehow her panic seemed to clear harrys head 
 
 lock the door he told her and ron turn out the lights 
 
 he looked down at the paralyzed dolohov thinking fast as the lock clicked and ron used the deluminator to plunge the caf into darkness harry could hear the men who had jeered at hermione earlier yelling at another girl in the distance 
 
 what are we going to do with them ron whispered to harry through the dark then even more quietly kill them theyd kill us they had a good go just now 
 
 hermione shuddered and took a step backward harry shook his head 
 
 we just need to wipe their memories said harry its better like that itll throw them off the scent if we killed them itd be obvious we were here 
 
 youre the boss said ron sounding profoundly relieved but ive never down a memory charm 
 
 nor have i said hermione but i know the theory 
 
 she took a deep calming breath then pointed her wand at dolohovs forehead and said obliviate 
 
 at once dolohovs eyes became unfocused and dreamy 
 
 brilliant said harry clapping her on the back take care of the other one and the waitress while ron and i clear up 
 
 clear up said ron looking around at the partly destroyed caf why 
 
 dont you think they might wonder whats happened if they wake up and find themselves in a place that looks like its just been bombed 
 
 oh right yeah 
 
 ron struggled for a moment before managing to extract his wand from his pocket 
 
 its no wonder i cant get it out hermione you packed my old jeans theyre tight 
 
 oh im so sorry hissed hermione and as she dragged the waitress out of sight of the windows harry heard her mutter a suggestion as to where ron could stick his wand instead 
 
 once the caf was restored to its previous condition they heaved the death eaters back into their booth and propped them up facing each other but how did they find us hermione asked looking from one inert man to the other how did they know where we were 
 
 she turned to harry 
 
 you c you dont think youve still got your trace on you do you harry 
 
 he cant have said ron the trace breaks at seventeen thats wizarding law you cant put it on an adult 
 
 as far as you know said hermione what if the death eaters have found a way to put it on a 
 
 but harry hasnt been near a death eater in the last hours whos supposed to have put a trace back on him 
 
 hermione did not reply harry felt contaminated tainted was that really how the death eaters had found them 
 
 if i cant use magic and you cant use magic near me without us giving away our position c he began 
 
 were not splitting up said hermione firmly 
 
 we need a safe place to hide said ron give us time to think things through 
 
 grimmauld place said harry 
 
 the other two gaped 
 
 dont be silly harry snape can get in there 
 
 rons dad said theyve put up jinxes against him c and even if they havent worked he pressed on as hermione began to argue so what i swear id like nothing better than to meet snape 
 
 but c 
 
 hermione where else is there its the best chance weve got snapes only one death eater if ive still got the trace on me well have whole crowds of them on us wherever else we go 
 
 she could not argue though she looked as if she would have liked to while she unlocked the caf door ron clicked the deluminator to release the cafs light then on harrys count of three they reversed the spells upon their three victims and before the waitress or either of the death eaters could do more than stir sleepily harry ron and hermione had turned on the spot and vanished into the compressing darkness once more 
 
 seconds later harrys lungs expanded gratefully and he opened his eyes they were now standing in the middle of a familiar small and shabby square tall dilapidated houses looked down on them from every side number twelve was visible to them for they had been told of its existence by dumbledore its and they rushed toward it checking every few yards that they were not being followed or observed they raced up the stone steps and harry tapped the front door once with his wand they heard a series of metallic clicks and the clatter of a chain then the door swung open with a creak and they hurried over the threshold 
 
 as harry closed the door behind them the gas lamps sprang into life casting flickering light along the length of the hallway it looked just as harry remembered it eerie cobwebbed the outlines of the heads on the wall throwing odd shadows up the staircase long dark curtains concealed the portrait of siriuss mother the only thing that was out of place was the trolls leg umbrella stand which was lying on its side as if tonks had just knocked it over again 
 
 i think somebodys been in here hermione whispered pointing toward it 
 
 that couldve happened as the order left ron murmured back 
 
 so where are these jinxes they put up against snape harry asked 
 
 maybe theyre only activated if he shows up suggested ron 
 
 yet they remained close together on the doormat backs against the door scared to move farther into the house 
 
 well we cant stay here forever said harry and he took a step forward 
 
 severus snape 
 
 moodys voice whispered out of the darkness making all three of them jump back in fright were not snape croaked harry before something whooshed over him like cold air and his tongue curled backward on itself making it impossible to speak before he had time to feel inside his mouth however his tongue had unraveled again 
 
 the other two seemed to have experienced the same unpleasant sensation ron was making retching noises hermione stammered that have the curse set up for snape 
 
 gingerly harry took another step forward something shifted in the shadows at the end of the hall and before any of them could say another word a figure had risen up out of the carpet tall and terrible hermione screamed and so did mrs black her curtains flying open the gray figure was gliding toward them faster and faster its hair and beard streaming behind it its face sunken fleshless with empty eye sockets horribly familiar dreadfully altered it raised a wasted arm pointing at harry 
 
 no harry shouted and though he had raised his wand no spell occurred to him no it wasnt us we didnt kill you c 
 
 on the word kill the figure exploded in a great cloud of dust coughing his eyes watering harry looked around to see hermione crouched on the floor by the door with her arms over her head and ron who was shaking from head to foot patting her clumsily on the shoulder and saying its all its 
 
 dust swirled around harry like mist catching the blue gaslight as mrs black continued to scream 
 
 mudbloods filth stains of dishonor taint of shame on the house of my fathers c 
 
 shut up harry bellowed directing his wand at her and with a bang and a burst of red sparks the curtains swung shut again silencing her 
 
 that that was hermione whimpered as ron helped her to her feet 
 
 yeah said harry but it wasnt really him was it just something to scare snape 
 
 had it worked harry wondered or had snape already blasted the aside as casually as he had killed the real dumbledore nerves still tingling he led the other two up the hall some new terror to reveal itself but nothing moved except for a mouse skittering along the skirting board 
 
 before we go any farther i think wed better check whispered hermione and she raised her wand and said homenum revelio 
 
 nothing happened 
 
 well youve just had a big shock said ron kindly what was that supposed to do 
 
 it did what i meant it to do said hermione rather crossly that was a spell to reveal human presence and theres nobody here except us 
 
 and old dusty said ron glancing at the patch of carpet from which the had risen 
 
 lets go up said hermione with a frightened look at the same spot and she led the way up the creaking stairs to the drawing room on the first floor 
 
 hermione waved her wand to ignite the old gas lamps then shivering slightly in the drafty room she perched on the sofa her arms wrapped tightly around her ron crossed to the window and moved the heavy velvet curtains aside an inch 
 
 cant see anyone out there he reported and youd think if harry still had a trace on him theyd have followed us here i know they cant get in the house but c whats up harry 
 
 harry had given a cry of pain his scar had burned against as something flashed across his mind like a bright light on water he saw a large shadow and felt a fury that was not his own pound through his body violent and brief as an electric shock 
 
 what did you see ron asked advancing on harry did you see him at my place 
 
 no i just felt anger c hes really angry c 
 
 but that could be at the burrow said ron loudly what else didnt you see anything was he cursing someone 
 
 no i just felt anger c i couldnt tell c 
 
 harry felt badgered confused and hermione did not help as she said in a frightened voice your scar again but whats going on i thought that connection had closed 
 
 it did for a while muttered harry his scar was still painful which made it hard to concentrate i c i think its started opening again whenever he loses control thats how it used to c 
 
 but then youve got to close your mind said hermione shrilly harry dumbledore didnt want you to use that connection he wanted you to shut it down thats why you were supposed to use occlumency otherwise voldemort can plant false images in your mind remember c 
 
 yeah i do remember thanks said harry through gritted teeth he did not need hermione to tell him that voldemort had once used this selfsame connection between them to lead him into a trap nor that it had resulted in siriuss death he wished that he had not told them what he had seen and felt it made voldemort more threatening as though he were pressing against the window of the room and still the pain in his scar was building and he fought it it was like resisting the urge to be sick 
 
 he turned his back on ron and hermione pretending to examine the old tapestry of the black family tree on the wall then hermione shrieked harry drew his wand again and spun around to see a silver patronus soar through the drawing room window and land upon the floor in front of them where it solidified into the weasel that spoke with the voice of rons father 
 
 family safe do not reply we are being watched 
 
 the patronus dissolved into nothingness ron let out a noise between a whimper and a groan and dropped onto the sofa hermione joined him gripping his arm 
 
 theyre all right theyre all right she whispered and ron half laughed and hugged her 
 
 harry he said over hermiones shoulder i c 
 
 its not a problem said harry sickened by the pain in his head its your family course you were worried id feel the same way he thought of ginny i do feel the same way 
 
 the pain in his scar was reaching a peak burning as it had back in the garden of the burrow faintly he heard hermione say i dont want to be on my own could we use the sleeping bags ive brought and camp in here tonight 
 
 he heard ron agree he could not fight the pain much longer he had to succumb 
 
 bathroom he muttered and he left the room as fast as he could without running 
 
 he barely made it bolting the door behind him with trembling hands he grasped his pounding head and fell to the floor then in an explosion of agony he felt the rage that did not belong to him possess his soul saw a long room lit only by firelight and the giant blond death eater on the floor screaming and writhing and a slighter figure standing over him wand outstretched while harry spoke in a high cold merciless voice 
 
 more rowle or shall we end it and feed you to nagini lord voldemort is not sure that he will forgive this time you called me back for this to tell me that harry potter has escaped again draco give rowle another taste of our displeasure do it or feel my wrath yourself 
 
 a log fell in the fire flames reared their light darting across a terrified pointed white face c with a sense of emerging from deep water harry drew heaving breaths and opened his eyes 
 
 he was on the cold black marble floor his nose inches from one of the silver serpent tails that supported the large bathtub he sat up malfoys gaunt petrified face seemed burned on the inside of his eyes harry felt sickened by what he had seen by the use to which draco was now being put by voldemort 
 
 there was a sharp rap on the door and harry jumped as hermiones voice rang out 
 
 harry do you want your toothbrush ive got it here 
 
 yeah great thanks he said fighting to keep his voice casual as he stood up to let her in 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the deathly hallows

 hermione where else is there its the best chance weve got snapes only one death eater if ive still got the trace on me well have whole crowds of them on us wherever else we go 
 
 she could not argue though she looked as if she would have liked to while she unlocked the caf door ron clicked the deluminator to release the cafs light then on harrys count of three they reversed the spells upon their three victims and before the waitress or either of the death eaters could do more than stir sleepily harry ron and hermione had turned on the spot and vanished into the compressing darkness once more 
 
 seconds later harrys lungs expanded gratefully and he opened his eyes they were now standing in the middle of a familiar small and shabby square tall dilapidated houses looked down on them from every side number twelve was visible to them for they had been told of its existence by dumbledore its and they rushed toward it checking every few yards that they were not being followed or observed they raced up the stone steps and harry tapped the front door once with his wand they heard a series of metallic clicks and the clatter of a chain then the door swung open with a creak and they hurried over the threshold 
 
 as harry closed the door behind them the gas lamps sprang into life casting flickering light along the length of the hallway it looked just as harry remembered it eerie cobwebbed the outlines of the heads on the wall throwing odd shadows up the staircase long dark curtains concealed the portrait of siriuss mother the only thing that was out of place was the trolls leg umbrella stand which was lying on its side as if tonks had just knocked it over again 
 
 i think somebodys been in here hermione whispered pointing toward it 
 
 that couldve happened as the order left ron murmured back 
 
 so where are these jinxes they put up against snape harry asked 
 
 maybe theyre only activated if he shows up suggested ron 
 
 yet they remained close together on the doormat backs against the door scared to move farther into the house 
 
 well we cant stay here forever said harry and he took a step forward 
 
 severus snape 
 
 moodys voice whispered out of the darkness making all three of them jump back in fright were not snape croaked harry before something whooshed over him like cold air and his tongue curled backward on itself making it impossible to speak before he had time to feel inside his mouth however his tongue had unraveled again 
 
 the other two seemed to have experienced the same unpleasant sensation ron was making retching noises hermione stammered that have the curse set up for snape 
 
 gingerly harry took another step forward something shifted in the shadows at the end of the hall and before any of them could say another word a figure had risen up out of the carpet tall and terrible hermione screamed and so did mrs black her curtains flying open the gray figure was gliding toward them faster and faster its hair and beard streaming behind it its face sunken fleshless with empty eye sockets horribly familiar dreadfully altered it raised a wasted arm pointing at harry 
 
 no harry shouted and though he had raised his wand no spell occurred to him no it wasnt us we didnt kill you c 
 
 on the word kill the figure exploded in a great cloud of dust coughing his eyes watering harry looked around to see hermione crouched on the floor by the door with her arms over her head and ron who was shaking from head to foot patting her clumsily on the shoulder and saying its all its 
 
 dust swirled around harry like mist catching the blue gaslight as mrs black continued to scream 
 
 mudbloods filth stains of dishonor taint of shame on the house of my fathers c 
 
 shut up harry bellowed directing his wand at her and with a bang and a burst of red sparks the curtains swung shut again silencing her 
 
 that that was hermione whimpered as ron helped her to her feet 
 
 yeah said harry but it wasnt really him was it just something to scare snape 
 
 had it worked harry wondered or had snape already blasted the aside as casually as he had killed the real dumbledore nerves still tingling he led the other two up the hall some new terror to reveal itself but nothing moved except for a mouse skittering along the skirting board 
 
 before we go any farther i think wed better check whispered hermione and she raised her wand and said homenum revelio 
 
 nothing happened 
 
 well youve just had a big shock said ron kindly what was that supposed to do 
 
 it did what i meant it to do said hermione rather crossly that was a spell to reveal human presence and theres nobody here except us 
 
 and old dusty said ron glancing at the patch of carpet from which the had risen 
 
 lets go up said hermione with a frightened look at the same spot and she led the way up the creaking stairs to the drawing room on the first floor 
 
 hermione waved her wand to ignite the old gas lamps then shivering slightly in the drafty room she perched on the sofa her arms wrapped tightly around her ron crossed to the window and moved the heavy velvet curtains aside an inch 
 
 cant see anyone out there he reported and youd think if harry still had a trace on him theyd have followed us here i know they cant get in the house but c whats up harry 
 
 harry had given a cry of pain his scar had burned against as something flashed across his mind like a bright light on water he saw a large shadow and felt a fury that was not his own pound through his body violent and brief as an electric shock 
 
 what did you see ron asked advancing on harry did you see him at my place 
 
 no i just felt anger c hes really angry c 
 
 but that could be at the burrow said ron loudly what else didnt you see anything was he cursing someone 
 
 no i just felt anger c i couldnt tell c 
 
 harry felt badgered confused and hermione did not help as she said in a frightened voice your scar again but whats going on i thought that connection had closed 
 
 it did for a while muttered harry his scar was still painful which made it hard to concentrate i c i think its started opening again whenever he loses control thats how it used to c 
 
 but then youve got to close your mind said hermione shrilly harry dumbledore didnt want you to use that connection he wanted you to shut it down thats why you were supposed to use occlumency otherwise voldemort can plant false images in your mind remember c 
 
 yeah i do remember thanks said harry through gritted teeth he did not need hermione to tell him that voldemort had once used this selfsame connection between them to lead him into a trap nor that it had resulted in siriuss death he wished that he had not told them what he had seen and felt it made voldemort more threatening as though he were pressing against the window of the room and still the pain in his scar was building and he fought it it was like resisting the urge to be sick 
 
 he turned his back on ron and hermione pretending to examine the old tapestry of the black family tree on the wall then hermione shrieked harry drew his wand again and spun around to see a silver patronus soar through the drawing room window and land upon the floor in front of them where it solidified into the weasel that spoke with the voice of rons father 
 
 family safe do not reply we are being watched 
 
 the patronus dissolved into nothingness ron let out a noise between a whimper and a groan and dropped onto the sofa hermione joined him gripping his arm 
 
 theyre all right theyre all right she whispered and ron half laughed and hugged her 
 
 harry he said over hermiones shoulder i c 
 
 its not a problem said harry sickened by the pain in his head its your family course you were worried id feel the same way he thought of ginny i do feel the same way 
 
 the pain in his scar was reaching a peak burning as it had back in the garden of the burrow faintly he heard hermione say i dont want to be on my own could we use the sleeping bags ive brought and camp in here tonight 
 
 he heard ron agree he could not fight the pain much longer he had to succumb 
 
 bathroom he muttered and he left the room as fast as he could without running 
 
 he barely made it bolting the door behind him with trembling hands he grasped his pounding head and fell to the floor then in an explosion of agony he felt the rage that did not belong to him possess his soul saw a long room lit only by firelight and the giant blond death eater on the floor screaming and writhing and a slighter figure standing over him wand outstretched while harry spoke in a high cold merciless voice 
 
 more rowle or shall we end it and feed you to nagini lord voldemort is not sure that he will forgive this time you called me back for this to tell me that harry potter has escaped again draco give rowle another taste of our displeasure do it or feel my wrath yourself 
 
 a log fell in the fire flames reared their light darting across a terrified pointed white face c with a sense of emerging from deep water harry drew heaving breaths and opened his eyes 
 
 he was on the cold black marble floor his nose inches from one of the silver serpent tails that supported the large bathtub he sat up malfoys gaunt petrified face seemed burned on the inside of his eyes harry felt sickened by what he had seen by the use to which draco was now being put by voldemort 
 
 there was a sharp rap on the door and harry jumped as hermiones voice rang out 
 
 harry do you want your toothbrush ive got it here 
 
 yeah great thanks he said fighting to keep his voice casual as he stood up to let her in 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the deathly hallows

 by hans christian andersen 
 
 near the rampart which encircles copenhagen lies a 
 great red house balsams and other flowers greet us from the long rows of windows in the house whose interior is sufficiently 
 and poor and old are the people who inhabit it 
 the building is the warton almshouse 
 
 look at the window there leans an old maid she plucks the 
 withered leaf from the balsam and looks at the rampart on which many children are playing what is the old maid thinking of a whole life drama is unfolding itself before her inward gaze the poor little children how happy they are how merrily they 
 play and romp together what red cheeks and what angels eyes but 
 they have no shoes nor stockings they dance on the green rampart 
 just on the place where according to the old story the ground always 
 sank in and where a sportive frolicsome child had been lured by 
 means of flowers toys and sweetmeats into an open grave ready dug for it and which was afterwards closed over the child and from that 
 moment the old story says the ground gave way no longer the mound remained firm and fast and was quickly covered with the green turf the little people who now play on that spot know nothing of the old tale else would they fancy they heard a child crying deep below the earth and the dewdrops on each blade of grass would be to them tears of woe nor do they know anything of the danish king who here in the face of the coming foe took an oath before all his trembling courtiers that he would hold out with the citizens of his capital and die here in his nest they know nothing of the men who have fought here or of the women who from here have drenched with boiling water the enemy clad in white and biding in the snow to surprise the city 
 
 no the poor little ones are playing with light childish 
 spirits play on play on thou little maiden soon the years will 
 come yes those glorious years the priestly hands have been laid 
 on the candidates for confirmation hand in hand they walk on the 
 green rampart thou hast a white frock on it has cost thy mother much labor and yet it is only cut down for thee out of an old larger 
 dress you will also wear a red shawl and what if it hang too far 
 down people will only see how large how very large it is you are 
 thinking of your dress and of the giver of all good so glorious is 
 it to wander on the green rampart 
 
 and the years roll by they have no lack of dark days but you 
 have your cheerful young spirit and you have gained a friend you 
 know not how you met oh how often you walk together on the rampart in the fresh spring on the high days and holidays when all the world come out to walk upon the ramparts and all the bells of the church steeples seem to be singing a song of praise for the coming spring 
 
 scarcely have the violets come forth but there on the rampart

 bright with the first green buds every year this tree sends forth 
 fresh green shoots alas it is not so with the human heart dark

 happy families are all alike every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way 
 everything was in confusion in the house the wife had discovered that the husband was carrying on an intrigue with a french girl who had been a governess in their family and she had announced to her husband that she could not go on living in the same house with him this position of affairs had now lasted two days and not only the husband and wife themselves but all the members of their family and the household were painfully conscious of it all the members of the family and the household felt that there was no sense in their living together and that even stray people brought together by chance in any inn had more in common with one another than they the members of the family and the household of the oblonskys the wife did not leave her own apartments the husband had not been home for two days the children ran wild all over the house the english governess quarreled with the housekeeper and wrote to a friend asking her to look out for a new employ for her the man cook had walked off the day before just at dinnertime the kitchenmaid and the coachman had given warning 
 two days after the quarrel prince stepan arkadyevich oblonsky stiva as he was called in the fashionable world woke up at his usual hour that is at eight in the morning not in his bedroom but on the sofa in his study he turned over his stout person on the springy sofa as though he would sink into a long sleep again he vigorously embraced the pillow on its other side and buried his face in it but all at once he jumped up sat up on the sofa and opened his eyes 
 yes yes how was it now he thought going over his dream yes how was it yes alabin was giving a dinner at darmstadt no not darmstadt but something american yes but then darmstadt was in america yes alabin was giving a dinner on glass tables and the tables sang il mio tesoro no not il mio tesoro but something better and there were some sort of little decanters on the table and at the same time these decanters were women he recalled

 oh awful oh dear oh dear awful stepan arkadyevich kept repeating to himself and he could think of nothing to be done and how well things were going up till now how well we got on she was contented and happy in her children i never interfered with her in anything i let her manage the children and the house just as she liked true bad her having been a governess in our house bad something common vulgar in flirting with governess but what a governess he vividly recalled the roguish black eyes of mlle roland and her smile but after all while she was in the house i kept myself in hand and the worst of it all is that already it seems as if ill luck would have it so oh oh but what what is to be done 
 there was no solution save that universal solution which life gives to all questions even the most complex and insolvable one must live in the needs of the day that is forget oneself to forget himself in sleep was impossible now at least till nighttime he could not go back now to the music sung by the decanter women so he must forget himself in the dream of daily life 
 then we shall see stepan arkadyevich said to himself and getting up he put on a gray dressing gown lined with blue silk tied the tassels in a knot and drawing a deep breath of air into his broad chest he walked to the window with his usual confident step turning out his feet that carried his full frame so easily he pulled up the blind and rang the bell loudly it was at once answered by the appearance of an old friend his valet matvei carrying his clothes his boots and a telegram matvei was followed by the barber with all the necessaries for shaving 
 are there any papers from the board asked stepan arkadyevich taking the telegram and seating himself at the looking glass 
 on the table replied matvei glancing with inquiring sympathy at his master and after a short pause he added with a sly smile 
 sent from the carriage jobber 
 stepan arkadyevich made no reply but merely glanced at matvei in the looking glass the glance in which their eyes met in the looking glass made it clear that they understood one another stepan eyes seemed to ask why do you tell me that you know 
 matvei put his hands in his jacket pockets thrust out one leg and gazed silently with a faint smile at his master 
 i told them to come on sunday and till then not to trouble you or themselves for nothing he said he had obviously prepared the sentence beforehand 
 stepan arkadyevich saw matvei wanted to make a joke and attract attention to himself tearing open the telegram he read it through guessing at the words misspelled as they always are in telegrams and his face brightened 
 matvei my sister anna arkadyevna will be here tomorrow he said checking for a minute the sleek plump hand of the barber cutting a pink path between his long curly side whiskers 
 thank god said matvei showing by this response that he like his master realized the significance of this arrival anna arkadyevna the sister his master was so fond of might bring about a reconciliation between husband and wife 
 alone or with her husband inquired matvei 
 stepan arkadyevich could not answer as the barber was at work on his upper lip and he raised one finger matvei nodded at the looking glass 
 alone is the room to be got ready upstairs 
 inform darya alexandrovna where she orders 
 darya alexandrovna matvei repeated as though in doubt 
 yes inform her here take the telegram give it to her and then do what she tells you 
 you want to try it out matvei guessed but only said yes sir 
 stepan arkadyevich was already washed and combed and ready to be dressed when matvei stepping slowly in his creaky boots came back into the room with the telegram in his hand the barber had gone 
 darya alexandrovna told me to inform you that she is going away let him that is you do as he likes he said laughing only with his eyes and putting his hands in his pockets he watched his master with his head on one side stepan arkadyevich was silent a minute then a and rather pitiful smile showed itself on his handsome face 
 eh matvei he said shaking his head 
 never mind sir everything will come round said matvei 
 come round 
 just so sir 
 do you think so there asked stepan arkadyevich hearing the rustle of a dress at the door 
 i said a firm pleasant feminine voice and the stern pockmarked face of matriona philimonovna the nurse was thrust in at the door 
 well the matter matriosha queried stepan arkadyevich meeting her in the doorway 
 although stepan arkadyevich was completely in the wrong as regards his wife and was conscious of this himself almost everyone in the house even the nurse darya chief ally was on his side 
 well what now he asked cheerlessly 
 go to her sir own your fault again maybe god will aid you she is suffering so pitiful to see her and besides everything in the house is you must have pity sir on the children beg her forgiveness sir no help for it one must pay the piper 
 but she see me 
 you do your part god is merciful pray to god sir pray to god 
 come do you can go said stepan arkadyevich blushing suddenly well now dress he turned to matvei and resolutely threw off his dressing gown

 stepan arkadyevich was a truthful man in his relations with himself he was incapable of and of persuading himself that he repented his conduct he could not at this date repent the fact that he handsome susceptible to love a man of was not in love with his wife the mother of five living and two dead children and only a year younger than himself all he repented was that he had not succeeded better in hiding this from his wife but he felt all the difficulty of his position and was sorry for his wife his children and himself possibly he might have managed to conceal his sins better from his wife if he had anticipated that the knowledge of them would have had such an effect upon her he had never clearly reflected on the subject but he had vaguely conceived that his wife must long ago have suspected him of being unfaithful to her and had shut her eyes to the fact he had even supposed that she a woman no longer young or and in no way remarkable or uncommon merely a good mother ought from a sense of fairness to take an indulgent view it had turned out quite the other way 
 oh awful oh dear oh dear awful stepan arkadyevich kept repeating to himself and he could think of nothing to be done and how well things were going up till now how well we got on she was contented and happy in her children i never interfered with her in anything i let her manage the children and the house just as she liked true bad her having been a governess in our house bad something common vulgar in flirting with governess but what a governess he vividly recalled the roguish black eyes of mlle roland and her smile but after all while she was in the house i kept myself in hand and the worst of it all is that already it seems as if ill luck would have it so oh oh but what what is to be done 
 there was no solution save that universal solution which life gives to all questions even the most complex and insolvable one must live in the needs of the day that is forget oneself to forget himself in sleep was impossible now at least till nighttime he could not go back now to the music sung by the decanter women so he must forget himself in the dream of daily life 
 then we shall see stepan arkadyevich said to himself and getting up he put on a gray dressing gown lined with blue silk tied the tassels in a knot and drawing a deep breath of air into his broad chest he walked to the window with his usual confident step turning out his feet that carried his full frame so easily he pulled up the blind and rang the bell loudly it was at once answered by the appearance of an old friend his valet matvei carrying his clothes his boots and a telegram matvei was followed by the barber with all the necessaries for shaving 
 are there any papers from the board asked stepan arkadyevich taking the telegram and seating himself at the looking glass 
 on the table replied matvei glancing with inquiring sympathy at his master and after a short pause he added with a sly smile 
 sent from the carriage jobber 
 stepan arkadyevich made no reply but merely glanced at matvei in the looking glass the glance in which their eyes met in the looking glass made it clear that they understood one another stepan eyes seemed to ask why do you tell me that you know 
 matvei put his hands in his jacket pockets thrust out one leg and gazed silently with a faint smile at his master 
 i told them to come on sunday and till then not to trouble you or themselves for nothing he said he had obviously prepared the sentence beforehand 
 stepan arkadyevich saw matvei wanted to make a joke and attract attention to himself tearing open the telegram he read it through guessing at the words misspelled as they always are in telegrams and his face brightened 
 matvei my sister anna arkadyevna will be here tomorrow he said checking for a minute the sleek plump hand of the barber cutting a pink path between his long curly side whiskers 
 thank god said matvei showing by this response that he like his master realized the significance of this arrival anna arkadyevna the sister his master was so fond of might bring about a reconciliation between husband and wife 
 alone or with her husband inquired matvei 
 stepan arkadyevich could not answer as the barber was at work on his upper lip and he raised one finger matvei nodded at the looking glass 
 alone is the room to be got ready upstairs 
 inform darya alexandrovna where she orders 
 darya alexandrovna matvei repeated as though in doubt 
 yes inform her here take the telegram give it to her and then do what she tells you 
 you want to try it out matvei guessed but only said yes sir 
 stepan arkadyevich was already washed and combed and ready to be dressed when matvei stepping slowly in his creaky boots came back into the room with the telegram in his hand the barber had gone 
 darya alexandrovna told me to inform you that she is going away let him that is you do as he likes he said laughing only with his eyes and putting his hands in his pockets he watched his master with his head on one side stepan arkadyevich was silent a minute then a and rather pitiful smile showed itself on his handsome face 
 eh matvei he said shaking his head 
 never mind sir everything will come round said matvei 
 come round 
 just so sir 
 do you think so there asked stepan arkadyevich hearing the rustle of a dress at the door 
 i said a firm pleasant feminine voice and the stern pockmarked face of matriona philimonovna the nurse was thrust in at the door 
 well the matter matriosha queried stepan arkadyevich meeting her in the doorway 
 although stepan arkadyevich was completely in the wrong as regards his wife and was conscious of this himself almost everyone in the house even the nurse darya chief ally was on his side 
 well what now he asked cheerlessly 
 go to her sir own your fault again maybe god will aid you she is suffering so pitiful to see her and besides everything in the house is you must have pity sir on the children beg her forgiveness sir no help for it one must pay the piper 
 but she see me 
 you do your part god is merciful pray to god sir pray to god 
 come do you can go said stepan arkadyevich blushing suddenly well now dress he turned to matvei and resolutely threw off his dressing gown 
 matvei was already holding up the shirt like a collar and blowing off some invisible speck he slipped it with obvious pleasure over the person of his master

 chapter 
 
 when he was dressed stepan arkadyevich sprinkled some scent on himself pulled down his shirt cuffs distributed into his pockets his cigarettes pocketbook matches and watch with its double chain and seals and shaking out his handkerchief feeling himself clean fragrant healthy and physically at ease in spite of his misfortune he walked with a slight swing of each leg into the dining room where coffee was already waiting for him and alongside of his cup the letters and papers from the office 
 he read the letters one was very unpleasant from a merchant who was buying a forest on his property to sell this forest was absolutely essential but at present until he was reconciled with his wife the subject could not be discussed the most unpleasant thing of all was that his pecuniary interests should in this way enter into the question of his reconciliation with his wife and the idea that he might be led on by his interests that he might seek a reconciliation with his wife on account of the sale of the forest that idea hurt him 
 when he had finished his letters stepan arkadyevich moved the office papers close to him rapidly looked through two cases made a few notes with a big pencil and pushing away the papers turned to his coffee sipping it he opened a still damp morning paper and began to read it 
 stepan arkadyevich took in and read a liberal paper not an extreme one but one advocating the views held by the majority and in spite of the fact that science art and politics had no special interest for him he firmly held those views on all these subjects which were held by the majority and by his paper and he only changed them when the majority changed them or more strictly speaking he did not change them but they imperceptibly changed of themselves within him 
 stepan arkadyevich had not chosen his political opinions or his views these political opinions and views had come to him of themselves just as he did not choose the shapes of his hat and coat but simply accepted those that were being worn and for him living in a certain society owing to the need ordinarily developed at years of discretion for some degree of mental activity to have views was just as indispensable as to have a hat if there was a reason for his preferring liberal to conservative views which were held also by many of his circle it arose not from his considering liberalism more rational but from its being in closer accordance with his manner of life the liberal party said that in russia everything was wrong and indeed stepan arkadyevich had many debts and was decidedly short of money the liberal party said that marriage was an institution quite out of date and that it stood in need of reconstruction and indeed family life afforded stepan arkadyevich little gratification and forced him into lying and hypocrisy which were so repulsive to his nature the liberal party said or rather allowed it to be understood that religion was only a curb to keep in check the barbarous classes of the people and indeed stepan arkadyevich could not stand through even a short service without his legs aching and could never make out what was the object of all the terrible and language about another world when life might be so very amusing in this world and with all this stepan arkadyevich who liked a merry joke was fond of embarrassing some plain man by saying that if one were to pride oneself on origin one ought not to stop at rurik and disown the founder of the line the monkey and so liberalism had become a habit of stepan arkadyevich and he liked his newspaper as he did his cigar after dinner for the slight fog it diffused in his brain he read the leading article which maintained that it was quite senseless in our day to raise an outcry that radicalism was threatening to swallow up all conservative elements and that the government ought to take measures to crush the revolutionary hydra that on the contrary in our opinion the danger lies not in that imaginary revolutionary hydra but in the obstinacy of traditionalism clogging progress etc etc he read another article too a financial one which alluded to bentham and mill and dropped some innuendoes reflecting on the ministry with his characteristic he caught the drift of each innuendo divined whence it came at whom and on what ground it was aimed and that afforded him as it always did a certain gratification but today that gratification was embittered by matriona advice and the unsatisfactory state of his household he read too that count beist was rumored to have left for wiesbaden and that one need have no more gray hair and of the sale of a light carriage and of a young person seeking a situation but these items of information did not give him as usual a quiet ironical gratification 
 having finished the paper a second cup of coffee and a roll and butter he got up shaking the crumbs off his waistcoat and squaring his broad chest he smiled joyously not because there was anything particularly agreeable in his mind the joyous smile was evoked by a good digestion 
 but this joyous smile at once recalled everything to him and he grew thoughtful 
 two childish voices stepan arkadyevich recognized the voices of grisha his youngest boy and tania his eldest girl were heard outside the door they were carrying something and dropped it 
 i told you not to sit passengers on the roof said the little girl in english there pick them up 
 in confusion thought stepan arkadyevich there are the children running about by themselves and going to the door he called them they left off the box that represented a train and came in to their father 
 the little girl her favorite ran up boldly embraced him and hung laughingly on his neck enjoying as she always did the smell of scent that came from his whiskers at last the little girl kissed his face which was flushed from his stooping posture and beaming with tenderness loosed her hands and was about to run away again but her father held her back 
 how is mamma he asked passing his hand over his smooth soft little neck good morning he said smiling to the boy who had come up to greet him 
 he was conscious that he loved the boy less and always tried to be fair but the boy felt it and did not smile responsively to his chilly smile 
 mamma she is up answered the girl 
 stepan arkadyevich sighed 
 that means she slept again all night he thought 
 well is she cheerful 
 the little girl knew that there was a quarrel between her father and mother and that her mother could not be cheerful and that her father must be aware of this and that he was pretending when he asked about it so lightly and she blushed for her father he at once perceived it and blushed too 
 i know she said she did not say we must do our lessons but she said we were to go for a walk with miss hoole to 
 well go tania my darling oh wait a minute though he said still holding her and stroking her soft little hand 
 he took off the mantelpiece where he had put it yesterday a little box of sweets and gave her two picking out her favorites a chocolate and a bonbon 
 for grisha said the little girl pointing to the chocolate 
 yes yes and still stroking her little shoulder he kissed the nape of her neck and let her go 
 the carriage is ready said matvei but someone to see you with a petition 
 been here long asked stepan arkadyevich 
 half an hour or so 
 how many times have i told you to tell me at once 
 one must let you drink your coffee in peace at least said matvei in the affectionately gruff tone with which it was impossible to be angry 
 well show the person up at once said oblonsky frowning with vexation 
 the petitioner the widow of a staff captain kalinin came with a request impossible and unreasonable but stepan arkadyevich as he generally did made her sit down heard her to the end attentively without interrupting her and gave her detailed advice as to how and to whom to apply and even wrote for her easily and clearly in his large sprawling calligraphic and legible hand a little note to a personage who might be of use to her having got rid of the staff widow stepan arkadyevich took his hat and stopped to recollect whether he had forgotten anything it appeared that he had forgotten nothing except what he wanted to forget his wife 
 ah yes he bowed his head and his handsome face assumed a melancholy expression to go or not to go he said to himself and an inner voice told him he must not go that nothing could come of it but falsity that to amend to set right their relations was impossible because it was impossible to make her attractive again and able to inspire love or to make him an old man not susceptible to love except deceit and lying nothing could come of it now and deceit and lying were opposed to his nature 
 it must be some day though it go on like this he said trying to give himself courage he set straight his chest took out a cigarette lighted it took two whiffs at it flung it into a ash tray and with rapid steps walked through the drawing room and opened the other door into his bedroom

 been here long asked stepan arkadyevich 
 half an hour or so

 well show the person up at once said oblonsky frowning with vexation 
 the petitioner the widow of a staff captain kalinin came with a request impossible and unreasonable but stepan arkadyevich as he generally did made her sit down heard her to the end attentively without interrupting her and gave her detailed advice as to how and to whom to apply and even wrote for her easily and clearly in his large sprawling calligraphic and legible hand a little note to a personage who might be of use to her having got rid of the staff widow stepan arkadyevich took his hat and stopped to recollect whether he had forgotten anything it appeared that he had forgotten nothing except what he wanted to forget his wife 
 ah yes he bowed his head and his handsome face assumed a melancholy expression to go or not to go he said to himself and an inner voice told him he must not go that nothing could come of it but falsity that to amend to set right their relations was impossible because it was impossible to make her attractive again and able to inspire love or to make him an old man not susceptible to love except deceit and lying nothing could come of it now and deceit and lying were opposed to his nature 
 it must be some day though it go on like this he said trying to give himself courage he set straight his chest took out a cigarette lighted it took two whiffs at it flung it into a ash tray and with rapid steps walked through the drawing room and opened the other door into his bedroom

 when he was dressed stepan arkadyevich sprinkled some scent on himself pulled down his shirt cuffs distributed into his pockets his cigarettes pocketbook matches and watch with its double chain and seals and shaking out his handkerchief feeling himself clean fragrant healthy and physically at ease in spite of his misfortune he walked with a slight swing of each leg into the dining room where coffee was already waiting for him and alongside of his cup the letters and papers from the office 
 he read the letters one was very unpleasant from a merchant who was buying a forest on his property to sell this forest was absolutely essential but at present until he was reconciled with his wife the subject could not be discussed the most unpleasant thing of all was that his pecuniary interests should in this way enter into the question of his reconciliation with his wife and the idea that he might be led on by his interests that he might seek a reconciliation with his wife on account of the sale of the forest that idea hurt him 
 when he had finished his letters stepan arkadyevich moved the office papers close to him rapidly looked through two cases made a few notes with a big pencil and pushing away the papers turned to his coffee sipping it he opened a still damp morning paper and began to read it 
 stepan arkadyevich took in and read a liberal paper not an extreme one but one advocating the views held by the majority and in spite of the fact that science art and politics had no special interest for him he firmly held those views on all these subjects which were held by the majority and by his paper and he only changed them when the majority changed them or more strictly speaking he did not change them but they imperceptibly changed of themselves within him 
 stepan arkadyevich had not chosen his political opinions or his views these political opinions and views had come to him of themselves just as he did not choose the shapes of his hat and coat but simply accepted those that were being worn and for him living in a certain society owing to the need ordinarily developed at years of discretion for some degree of mental activity to have views was just as indispensable as to have a hat if there was a reason for his preferring liberal to conservative views which were held also by many of his circle it arose not from his considering liberalism more rational but from its being in closer accordance with his manner of life the liberal party said that in russia everything was wrong and indeed stepan arkadyevich had many debts and was decidedly short of money the liberal party said that marriage was an institution quite out of date and that it stood in need of reconstruction and indeed family life afforded stepan arkadyevich little gratification and forced him into lying and hypocrisy which were so repulsive to his nature the liberal party said or rather allowed it to be understood that religion was only a curb to keep in check the barbarous classes of the people and indeed stepan arkadyevich could not stand through even a short service without his legs aching and could never make out what was the object of all the terrible and language about another world when life might be so very amusing in this world and with all this stepan arkadyevich who liked a merry joke was fond of embarrassing some plain man by saying that if one were to pride oneself on origin one ought not to stop at rurik and disown the founder of the line the monkey and so liberalism had become a habit of stepan arkadyevich and he liked his newspaper as he did his cigar after dinner for the slight fog it diffused in his brain he read the leading article which maintained that it was quite senseless in our day to raise an outcry that radicalism was threatening to swallow up all conservative elements and that the government ought to take measures to crush the revolutionary hydra that on the contrary in our opinion the danger lies not in that imaginary revolutionary hydra but in the obstinacy of traditionalism clogging progress etc etc he read another article too a financial one which alluded to bentham and mill and dropped some innuendoes reflecting on the ministry with his characteristic he caught the drift of each innuendo divined whence it came at whom and on what ground it was aimed and that afforded him as it always did a certain gratification but today that gratification was embittered by matriona advice and the unsatisfactory state of his household he read too that count beist was rumored to have left for wiesbaden and that one need have no more gray hair and of the sale of a light carriage and of a young person seeking a situation but these items of information did not give him as usual a quiet ironical gratification 
 having finished the paper a second cup of coffee and a roll and butter he got up shaking the crumbs off his waistcoat and squaring his broad chest he smiled joyously not because there was anything particularly agreeable in his mind the joyous smile was evoked by a good digestion 
 but this joyous smile at once recalled everything to him and he grew thoughtful 
 two childish voices stepan arkadyevich recognized the voices of grisha his youngest boy and tania his eldest girl were heard outside the door they were carrying something and dropped it 
 i told you not to sit passengers on the roof said the little girl in english there pick them up 
 in confusion thought stepan arkadyevich there are the children running about by themselves and going to the door he called them they left off the box that represented a train and came in to their father 
 the little girl her favorite ran up boldly embraced him and hung laughingly on his neck enjoying as she always did the smell of scent that came from his whiskers at last the little girl kissed his face which was flushed from his stooping posture and beaming with tenderness loosed her hands and was about to run away again but her father held her back 
 how is mamma he asked passing his hand over his smooth soft little neck good morning he said smiling to the boy who had come up to greet him 
 he was conscious that he loved the boy less and always tried to be fair but the boy felt it and did not smile responsively to his chilly smile 
 mamma she is up answered the girl 
 stepan arkadyevich sighed 
 that means she slept again all night he thought 
 well is she cheerful 
 the little girl knew that there was a quarrel between her father and mother and that her mother could not be cheerful and that her father must be aware of this and that he was pretending when he asked about it so lightly and she blushed for her father he at once perceived it and blushed too 
 i know she said she did not say we must do our lessons but she said we were to go for a walk with miss hoole to 
 well go tania my darling oh wait a minute though he said still holding her and stroking her soft little hand 
 he took off the mantelpiece where he had put it yesterday a little box of sweets and gave her two picking out her favorites a chocolate and a bonbon 
 for grisha said the little girl pointing to the chocolate 
 yes yes and still stroking her little shoulder he kissed the nape of her neck and let her go 
 the carriage is ready said matvei but someone to see you with a petition 
 been here long asked stepan arkadyevich

 darya alexandrovna in a dressing jacket and with her now scanty hair once luxuriant and beautiful fastened up with hairpins on the nape of her neck with a sunken thin face and large startled eyes which looked prominent from the thinness of her face was standing among a litter of all sorts of things scattered all over the room before an open bureau from which she was taking something hearing her steps she stopped looking toward the door and trying in vain to give her features a severe and contemptuous expression she felt she was afraid of him and afraid of the coming interview she was just attempting to do what she had attempted to do ten times already in these last three days to sort out the things and her own so as to take them to her and again she could not bring herself to do this but now again as each time before she kept saying to herself that things cannot go on like this that she must undertake something punish him put him to shame avenge on him some little part at least of the suffering he had caused her she still continued to tell herself that she should leave him but she was conscious that this was impossible it was impossible because she could not get out of the habit of regarding him as her husband and of loving him besides this she realized that if even here in her own house she could hardly manage to look after her five children properly they would be still worse off where she was going with all of them as it was even in the course of these three days the youngest was unwell from being given unwholesome soup and the others had almost gone without their dinner the day before she was conscious that it was impossible to go away but cheating herself she went on all the same sorting out her things and pretending she was going 
 seeing her husband she dropped her hands into the drawer of the bureau as though looking for something and only looked round at him when he had come quite up to her but her face to which she tried to give a severe and resolute expression expressed bewilderment and suffering 
 dolly he said in a subdued and timid voice he had hunched up his shoulders and tried to look pitiful and humble but for all that he was radiant with freshness and health in a rapid glance she scanned his figure beaming with freshness and health yes he is happy and content she thought while i and that disgusting good nature which everyone likes him for and praises i hate that good nature of his she thought her mouth stiffened the muscles of the cheek trembled on the right side of her pale nervous face 
 what do you want she said in a rapid deep unnatural voice 
 dolly he repeated with a quiver in his voice anna is coming today 
 well what is that to me i see her she cried 
 but you must really dolly 
 go away go away go away she shrieked without looking at him as though this shriek were called up by physical pain 
 stepan arkadyevich could be calm when he thought of his wife he could hope that everything would come round as matvei expressed it and had been able to go on reading his paper and drinking his coffee but when he saw her tortured suffering face heard the tone of her voice submissive to fate and full of despair his breath was cut short and a lump came to this throat and his eyes began to shine with tears 
 my god what have i done dolly for sake you know he could not go on there was a sob in his throat 
 she shut the bureau with a slam and glanced at him 
 dolly what can i say one thing forgive me remember cannot nine years of our life atone for an instant 
 she dropped her eyes and listened expecting what he would say as if beseeching him in some way or other to make her believe differently 
 instant of passion he said and would have gone on but at that word as at a pang of physical pain her lips stiffened again and again the muscles of her right cheek worked 
 go away go out of the room she shrieked still more shrilly and talk to me of your passions and your vilenesses 
 she tried to go out but tottered and clung to the back of a chair to support herself his face relaxed his lips became puffy tears welled up in his eyes 
 dolly he said sobbing now for sake think of the children they are not to blame i am to blame punish me then make me expiate my fault anything i can do i am ready to do i am to blame no words can express how much i am to blame but dolly forgive me 
 she sat down he listened to her hard heavy breathing and he was unutterably sorry for her she made several attempts to speak but could not he waited 
 you remember the children stiva to play with them but i remember and know that they go to ruin now she said obviously one of the phrases she had more than once repeated to herself in the course of the last three days 
 she had called him stiva and he glanced at her with gratitude and moved to take her hand but she drew back from him with aversion 
 i remember the children and for that reason i would do anything in the world to save them but i myself know the means by taking them away from their father or by leaving them with a vicious father yes a vicious father tell me after what has happened can we live together is that possible do tell me is it possible she repeated raising her voice after my husband the father of my children enters into a love affair with his own governess 
 but to be done to be done he kept saying in a pitiful voice not knowing what he was saying as his head sank lower and lower 
 you are loathsome to me repulsive she shrieked getting more and more heated your tears mean nothing you have never loved me you have neither a heart nor a sense of honor you are hateful to me disgusting a stranger yes a complete stranger with pain and wrath she uttered the word so terrible to herself stranger 
 he looked at her and the fury expressed in her face alarmed and amazed him he did not understand that it was his pity for her that exasperated her she saw in him compassion for her but not love no she hates me she will not forgive me he thought 
 it is awful awful he said 
 at that moment in the next room a child began to cry probably it had fallen down darya alexandrovna listened and her face suddenly softened 
 she seemed pulling herself together for a few seconds as though she did not know where she was nor what she was doing and getting up rapidly she moved toward the door 
 well she loves my child he thought noticing the change of her face at the cry my child how can she hate me then 
 dolly one word more he said following her 
 if you follow me i will call in the servants and the children let them all know you are a scoundrel i am going away at once and you may live here with your mistress 
 and she went out slamming the door 
 stepan arkadyevich sighed mopped his face and with a subdued tread walked out of the room matvei says everything will come round but how i see the least chance of it ah ah how horrible it is and how vulgarly she shouted he said to himself remembering her shrieks and the words scoundrel and mistress and very likely the maids were listening horribly vulgar horribly stepan arkadyevich stood a few seconds alone wiped his eyes thrust out his chest and walked out of the room 
 it was friday and in the dining room the watchmaker a german was winding up the clock stepan arkadyevich remembered his joke about this punctual bald watchmaker that the german was wound up for a whole lifetime himself to wind up watches and he smiled stepan arkadyevich was fond of a nice joke and maybe it will come round a good expression come round he thought i must tell that 
 matvei he shouted arrange everything with marya in the sitting room for anna arkadyevna he said to matvei when he came in 
 yes sir 
 stepan arkadyevich put on his fur coat and went out on the front steps 
 you dine at home said matvei seeing him off 
 it all depends but for the housekeeping he said taking ten roubles from his pocketbook will it be enough 
 enough or not enough we must make it do said matvei slamming the carriage door and going back to the steps 
 darya alexandrovna meanwhile having pacified the child and knowing from the sound of the carriage that he had gone off went back to her bedroom it was her only refuge from the household cares which crowded upon her directly she went out from it even now in the short time she had been in the nursery the english governess and matriona philimonovna had succeeded in putting several questions to her which did not admit of delay and which only she could answer what were the children to put on for their walk should they have any milk should not a new cook be sent for 
 ah let me alone let me alone she said and going back to her bedroom she sat down in the same place she had occupied when talking to her husband clasping tightly her thin hands her rings slipping down on her bony fingers and fell to going over her recollections of the entire interview he has gone but what has he finally arrived at with her she thought can it be he sees her why i ask him no no reconciliation is impossible even if we remain in the same house we are strangers strangers forever she repeated again with special significance the word so dreadful to her and how i loved him my god how i loved him how i loved him and now i love him i love him more than before the most horrible thing is she began but did not finish her thought because matriona philimonovna put her head in at the door 
 let us send for my brother she said he can get a dinner anyway or we shall have the children getting nothing to eat till six again like yesterday 
 very well i will come directly and see about it but did you send for some new milk 
 and darya alexandrovna plunged into the duties of the day and drowned her grief in them for a time

 darya alexandrovna in a dressing jacket and with her now scanty hair once luxuriant and beautiful fastened up with hairpins on the nape of her neck with a sunken thin face and large startled eyes which looked prominent from the thinness of her face was standing among a litter of all sorts of things scattered all over the room before an open bureau from which she was taking something hearing her steps she stopped looking toward the door and trying in vain to give her features a severe and contemptuous expression she felt she was afraid of him and afraid of the coming interview she was just attempting to do what she had attempted to do ten times already in these last three days to sort out the things and her own so as to take them to her and again she could not bring herself to do this but now again as each time before she kept saying to herself that things cannot go on like this that she must undertake something punish him put him to shame avenge on him some little part at least of the suffering he had caused her she still continued to tell herself that she should leave him but she was conscious that this was impossible it was impossible because she could not get out of the habit of regarding him as her husband and of loving him besides this she realized that if even here in her own house she could hardly manage to look after her five children properly they would be still worse off where she was going with all of them as it was even in the course of these three days the youngest was unwell from being given unwholesome soup and the others had almost gone without their dinner the day before she was conscious that it was impossible to go away but cheating herself she went on all the same sorting out her things and pretending she was going 
 seeing her husband she dropped her hands into the drawer of the bureau as though looking for something and only looked round at him when he had come quite up to her but her face to which she tried to give a severe and resolute expression expressed bewilderment and suffering 
 dolly he said in a subdued and timid voice he had hunched up his shoulders and tried to look pitiful and humble but for all that he was radiant with freshness and health in a rapid glance she scanned his figure beaming with freshness and health yes he is happy and content she thought while i and that disgusting good nature which everyone likes him for and praises i hate that good nature of his she thought her mouth stiffened the muscles of the cheek trembled on the right side of her pale nervous face 
 what do you want she said in a rapid deep unnatural voice 
 dolly he repeated with a quiver in his voice anna is coming today 
 well what is that to me i see her she cried 
 but you must really dolly 
 go away go away go away she shrieked without looking at him as though this shriek were called up by physical pain 
 stepan arkadyevich could be calm when he thought of his wife he could hope that everything would come round as matvei expressed it and had been able to go on reading his paper and drinking his coffee but when he saw her tortured suffering face heard the tone of her voice submissive to fate and full of despair his breath was cut short and a lump came to this throat and his eyes began to shine with tears 
 my god what have i done dolly for sake you know he could not go on there was a sob in his throat 
 she shut the bureau with a slam and glanced at him 
 dolly what can i say one thing forgive me remember cannot nine years of our life atone for an instant 
 she dropped her eyes and listened expecting what he would say as if beseeching him in some way or other to make her believe differently 
 instant of passion he said and would have gone on but at that word as at a pang of physical pain her lips stiffened again and again the muscles of her right cheek worked 
 go away go out of the room she shrieked still more shrilly and talk to me of your passions and your vilenesses 
 she tried to go out but tottered and clung to the back of a chair to support herself his face relaxed his lips became puffy tears welled up in his eyes 
 dolly he said sobbing now for sake think of the children they are not to blame i am to blame punish me then make me expiate my fault anything i can do i am ready to do i am to blame no words can express how much i am to blame but dolly forgive me 
 she sat down he listened to her hard heavy breathing and he was unutterably sorry for her she made several attempts to speak but could not he waited 
 you remember the children stiva to play with them but i remember and know that they go to ruin now she said obviously one of the phrases she had more than once repeated to herself in the course of the last three days 
 she had called him stiva and he glanced at her with gratitude and moved to take her hand but she drew back from him with aversion 
 i remember the children and for that reason i would do anything in the world to save them but i myself know the means by taking them away from their father or by leaving them with a vicious father yes a vicious father tell me after what has happened can we live together is that possible do tell me is it possible she repeated raising her voice after my husband the father of my children enters into a love affair with his own governess 
 but to be done to be done he kept saying in a pitiful voice not knowing what he was saying as his head sank lower and lower 
 you are loathsome to me repulsive she shrieked getting more and more heated your tears mean nothing you have never loved me you have neither a heart nor a sense of honor you are hateful to me disgusting a stranger yes a complete stranger with pain and wrath she uttered the word so terrible to herself stranger 
 he looked at her and the fury expressed in her face alarmed and amazed him he did not understand that it was his pity for her that exasperated her she saw in him compassion for her but not love no she hates me she will not forgive me he thought 
 it is awful awful he said 
 at that moment in the next room a child began to cry probably it had fallen down darya alexandrovna listened and her face suddenly softened 
 she seemed pulling herself together for a few seconds as though she did not know where she was nor what she was doing and getting up rapidly she moved toward the door 
 well she loves my child he thought noticing the change of her face at the cry my child how can she hate me then 
 dolly one word more he said following her 
 if you follow me i will call in the servants and the children let them all know you are a scoundrel i am going away at once and you may live here with your mistress 
 and she went out slamming the door 
 stepan arkadyevich sighed mopped his face and with a subdued tread walked out of the room matvei says everything will come round but how i see the least chance of it ah ah how horrible it is and how vulgarly she shouted he said to himself remembering her shrieks and the words scoundrel and mistress and very likely the maids were listening horribly vulgar horribly stepan arkadyevich stood a few seconds alone wiped his eyes thrust out his chest and walked out of the room 
 it was friday and in the dining room the watchmaker a german was winding up the clock stepan arkadyevich remembered his joke about this punctual bald watchmaker that the german was wound up for a whole lifetime himself to wind up watches and he smiled stepan arkadyevich was fond of a nice joke and maybe it will come round a good expression come round he thought i must tell that 
 matvei he shouted arrange everything with marya in the sitting room for anna arkadyevna he said to matvei when he came in 
 yes sir 
 stepan arkadyevich put on his fur coat and went out on the front steps 
 you dine at home said matvei seeing him off 
 it all depends but for the housekeeping he said taking ten roubles from his pocketbook will it be enough 
 enough or not enough we must make it do said matvei slamming the carriage door and going back to the steps 
 darya alexandrovna meanwhile having pacified the child and knowing from the sound of the carriage that he had gone off went back to her bedroom it was her only refuge from the household cares which crowded upon her directly she went out from it even now in the short time she had been in the nursery the english governess and matriona philimonovna had succeeded in putting several questions to her which did not admit of delay and which only she could answer what were the children to put on for their walk should they have any milk should not a new cook be sent for 
 ah let me alone let me alone she said and going back to her bedroom she sat down in the same place she had occupied when talking to her husband clasping tightly her thin hands her rings slipping down on her bony fingers and fell to going over her recollections of the entire interview he has gone but what has he finally arrived at with her she thought can it be he sees her why i ask him no no reconciliation is impossible even if we remain in the same house we are strangers strangers forever she repeated again with special significance the word so dreadful to her and how i loved him my god how i loved him how i loved him and now i love him i love him more than before the most horrible thing is she began but did not finish her thought because matriona philimonovna put her head in at the door

 chapter 
 
 stepan arkadyevich had learned easily at school thanks to his excellent abilities but he had been idle and mischievous and therefore was one of the lowest in his class but in spite of his habitually dissipated mode of life his inferior grade in the service and his comparative youth he occupied the honorable and lucrative position of president of one of the government boards at moscow this post he had received through his sister husband alexei alexandrovich karenin who held one of the most important positions in the ministry to which the moscow office belonged but if karenin had not got his this berth then through a hundred other personages brothers sisters cousins uncles and aunts stiva oblonsky would have received this post or some other like it together with the salary of six thousand absolutely needful for him as his affairs in spite of his considerable property were in a poor state 
 half moscow and peterburg were friends and relations of stepan arkadyevich he was born in the midst of those who had been and had become the powerful ones of this world of the men in the government the older men had been friends of his and had known him in pinafores another third were his intimate chums and the remainder were friendly acquaintances consequently the distributors of earthly blessings in the shape of posts rents concessions and such were all his friends and could not overlook one of their own set and oblonsky had no need to make any special exertion to get a lucrative post he had only not to refuse things not to show jealousy not to be quarrelsome or take offense all of which from his characteristic good nature he never did it would have struck him as absurd if he had been told that he would not get a position with the salary he required especially as he expected nothing out of the way he only wanted what the men of his own age and standing did get and he was no worse qualified for performing duties of this kind than any other man 
 stepan arkadyevich was not merely liked by all who knew him for his good humor his bright disposition and his unquestionable honesty in him in his handsome radiant figure his sparkling eyes black hair and eyebrows and his white and pink complexion there was something which produced a physical effect of kindliness and good humor on the people who met him aha stiva oblonsky the man himself was almost always said with a smile of delight on meeting him even though it happened at times that after a conversation with him it seemed that nothing particularly delightful had happened the next day and the next everyone was just as delighted to meet him again 
 after filling for two years the post of president of one of the government boards at moscow stepan arkadyevich had won the respect as well as the liking of his fellow officials subordinates and superiors and all who had had business with him the principal qualities in stepan arkadyevich which had gained him this universal respect in the service consisted in the first place of his extreme indulgence for others founded on a consciousness of his own shortcomings secondly of his perfect liberalism not the liberalism he read of in the papers but the liberalism that was in his blood in virtue of which he treated all men perfectly equally and exactly the same whatever their fortune or rank might be and thirdly the most important point of his complete indifference to the business in which he was engaged in consequence of which he was never carried away and made no mistakes 
 on reaching the offices of the board stepan arkadyevich escorted by a deferential porter with a portfolio went into his little private room put on his uniform and went into the board room the clerks and officials all rose greeting him with deference stepan arkadyevich moved quickly as always to his place shook hands with the members of the board and sat down he made a joke or two and talked just as much as was consistent with due decorum and began work no one knew better than stepan arkadyevich how to hit on that exact limit of freedom simplicity and official stiffness which is necessary for the agreeable conduct of business a secretary with the deference common to everyone in stepan office came up with papers and began to speak in the familiar and easy tone which had been introduced by stepan arkadyevich 
 we have succeeded in getting the information from the government department of penza here would you care 
 got it at last said stepan arkadyevich laying his finger on the paper now gentlemen 
 and the sitting of the board began 
 if they but knew he thought inclining his head with an important air and listening to the report what a guilty little boy their president was half an hour ago and his eyes were laughing during the reading of the report till two the sitting would go on without a break then there would be an interval and luncheon 
 it was not yet two when the large glass doors of the board room suddenly opened and someone came in 
 all the members of the board sitting at the table from below the portrait of the czar and from behind the mirror of justice delighted at any distraction looked round at the door but the doorkeeper standing there at once drove out the intruder and closed the glass door after him 
 when the case had been read through stepan arkadyevich got up and stretched and by way of tribute to the liberalism of the times took out a cigarette being in the board room and went into his private room two of his board fellows the old veteran in the service nikitin and the kammerjunker grinevich went in with him 
 we shall have time to finish after lunch said stepan arkadyevich 
 to be sure we shall said nikitin 
 a pretty sharp fellow this fomin must be said grinevich of one of the persons taking part in the case they were examining 
 stepan arkadyevich frowned at words giving him thereby to understand that it was improper to pass judgment prematurely and made him no reply 
 who was it who came in he asked the doorkeeper 
 some fellow your excellency sneaked in without permission directly my back was turned he was asking for you i told him when the members come out then 
 where is he 
 maybe gone into the passage he was strolling here till now he said the doorkeeper pointing to a strongly built broad shouldered man with a curly beard who without taking off his sheepskin cap was running lightly and rapidly up the worn steps of the stone staircase one of the officials going down a lean fellow with a portfolio stood out of his way looked disapprovingly at the legs of the running man and then glanced inquiringly at oblonsky 
 stepan arkadyevich was standing at the top of the stairs his beaming face above the embroidered collar of his uniform beamed more than ever when he recognized the man coming up 
 why actually you levin at last he said with a friendly mocking smile gazing on the approaching man how is it you have deigned to look me up in this den said stepan arkadyevich and not content with shaking hands he kissed his friend have you been here long 
 i have just come and very much wanted to see you said levin looking about him shyly and at the same time angrily and uneasily 
 well go into my room said stepan arkadyevich who knew his sensitive and irritable shyness and taking his arm he drew him along as though guiding him through dangers 
 stepan arkadyevich was on familiar terms with almost all his acquaintances and called almost all of them by their christian names old men of sixty boys of twenty actors ministers merchants and adjutant generals so that many of his intimate chums were to be found at the extreme ends of the social ladder and would have been very much surprised to learn that they had through the medium of oblonsky something in common he was the familiar friend of everyone with whom he took a glass of champagne and he took a glass of champagne with everyone and when in consequence he met any of his disreputable chums as he used in joke to call many of his friends in the presence of his subordinates he well knew how with his characteristic tact to diminish any possible disagreeable impression levin was not a disreputable chum but oblonsky with his ready tact felt that levin fancied oblonsky might not care to show his intimacy with him before subordinates and so stepan arkadyevich made haste to take him off into his room 
 levin was almost of the same age as oblonsky their intimacy did not rest merely on champagne levin had been the friend and companion of his early youth they were fond of one another in spite of the difference of their characters and tastes as friends are fond of one another who have been together in early youth but in spite of this each of them as is often the way with men who have selected careers of different kinds though in discussion he would even justify the career in his heart despised it it seemed to each of them that the life he led himself was the only real life and the life led by his friend was a mere phantasm oblonsky could not restrain a slight mocking smile at the sight of levin how often he had seen him come up to moscow from the country where he was doing something but what precisely stepan arkadyevich could never quite make out and indeed took no interest in the matter levin arrived in moscow always excited and in a hurry rather ill at ease and irritated by his own want of ease and for the most part with a perfectly new unexpected view of things stepan arkadyevich laughed at this and liked it in the same way levin in his heart despised the town mode of life of his friend and his official duties which he laughed at and regarded as trifling but the difference was that oblonsky since he was doing the same as everyone did laughed assuredly and while levin laughed without assuredness and sometimes angrily 
 we have long been expecting you said stepan arkadyevich going into his room and letting hand go as though to show that here all danger was over i am very very glad to see you he went on well what now how are you when did you come 
 
 levin was silent looking at the unfamiliar faces of two companions and especially at the elegant hands with such long white fingers such long yellow nails curved at their end and such huge shining studs on the shirt cuff that apparently these hands absorbed all his attention and allowed him no freedom of thought oblonsky noticed this at once and smiled 
 ah to be sure let me introduce you he said my colleagues philip ivanich nikitin mikhail stanislavich grinevich and turning to levin a zemstvo member a modern zemstvo man a gymnast who lifts five poods with one hand a cattle breeder and sportsman and my friend constantin dmitrievich levin the brother of sergei ivanovich koznishev 
 delighted said the veteran 
 i have the honor of knowing your brother sergei ivanovich said grinevich holding out his slender hand with its long nails 
 levin frowned shook hands coldly and at once turned to oblonsky though he had a great respect for his an author well known to all russia he could not endure it when people treated him not as constantin levin but as the brother of the celebrated koznishev 
 no i am no longer a zemstvo man i have quarreled with them all and go to the sessions any more he said turning to oblonsky 
 been quick about it said oblonsky with a smile but how why 
 a long story i will tell you some time said levin but began telling him at once well to put it shortly i was convinced that nothing was really done by the zemstvo councils or ever could be he began as though someone had just insulted him on one side a plaything they play at being a parliament and neither young enough nor old enough to find amusement in playthings and on the other side he stammered a means for the coterie of the district to feather their nests formerly they did this through wardships and courts of justice now they do it through the zemstvo instead of taking the bribes they take the unearned salary he said as hotly as though one of those present had opposed his opinion 
 aha in a new phase again i see a conservative said stepan arkadyevich however we can go into that later 
 yes later but i had to see you said levin looking with hatred at hand 
 stepan arkadyevich gave a scarcely perceptible smile 
 but you used to say never wear european dress again he said gazing on new suit obviously cut by a french tailor so i see a new phase 
 levin suddenly blushed not as grown men blush slightly without being themselves aware of it but as boys blush feeling that they are ridiculous through their shyness and consequently ashamed of it and blushing still more almost to the point of tears and it was so strange to see this sensible manly face in such a childish plight that oblonsky left off looking at him 
 oh where shall we meet you know i want very much to talk to you said levin 
 oblonsky seemed to ponder 
 tell you what go to to lunch and there we can talk i am free till three 
 no answered levin after an thought i have another visit to make 
 all right then dine together 
 dine together but i have nothing very particular just a word or two a question then a little chatting 
 well have your word or two right now and talk it over in the course of the dinner 
 well this said levin however of no importance 
 his face suddenly assumed an expression of anger from the effort he was making to surmount his shyness 
 what are the shcherbatskys doing everything as it used to be he said 
 stepan arkadyevich who had long known that levin was in love with his kitty gave a hardly perceptible smile and his eyes sparkled merrily 
 said your word or two but i answer in a few words because excuse me for just a minute 
 a secretary came in with respectful familiarity and the modest consciousness characteristic of every secretary of superiority to his chief in the knowledge of affairs he went up to oblonsky with some papers and began under pretense of asking a question to explain some objection stepan arkadyevich without hearing him out laid his hand genially on the sleeve 
 no you do as i told you he said smoothing his remark with a smile and with a brief explanation of his view of the matter he moved away the papers and said so do it that way if you please zakhar nikitich 
 the secretary retired in confusion during the consultation with the secretary levin had completely recovered from his embarrassment he was standing with elbows on the back of a chair and on his face was a look of ironical attention 
 i understand it i understand it he said 
 what you understand said oblonsky smiling just as cheerfully and picking up a cigarette he expected some queer outburst from levin 
 i understand what you are doing said levin shrugging his shoulders how can you be serious about it 
 why not 
 why because nothing in it 
 you think so yet overwhelmed with work 
 on paper but there a gift for it added levin 
 to say you think a lack of something in me 
 perhaps so said levin but all the same i admire your grandeur and am proud to have such a great person as a friend not answered my question though he went on with a desperate effort looking oblonsky straight in the face 
 oh all very well you wait a bit and come to this yourself very nice for you to have three thousand dessiatinas in the karazinsky district and such muscles and the freshness of a girl of twelve still be one of us one day yes as to your question there is no change but a pity been away so long 
 oh why so levin queried frightened 
 oh nothing responded oblonsky talk it over but brought you up to town 
 oh talk about that too later on said levin reddening again up to his ears 
 all right i see said stepan arkadyevich i should ask you to come to us you know but my not quite well but tell you what if you want to see them sure now to be at the zoological gardens from four to five kitty skates you drive along there and come and fetch you and go and dine somewhere together 
 capital so till then 
 now mind forget i know you or rush off home to the country stepan arkadyevich called out laughing 
 no truly 
 and levin went out of the room recalling only when he was in the doorway that he had forgotten to take leave of colleagues 
 that gentleman must be a man of great energy said grinevich when levin had gone away 
 yes my dear sir said stepan arkadyevich nodding his head a lucky fellow three thousand dessiatinas in the karazinsky district everything before him and what youth and vigor not like some of us 
 but why are you complaining stepan arkadyevich 
 why it goes hard with me very bad said stepan arkadyevich with a heavy sigh

 levin was almost of the same age as oblonsky their intimacy did not rest merely on champagne levin had been the friend and companion of his early youth they were fond of one another in spite of the difference of their characters and tastes as friends are fond of one another who have been together in early youth but in spite of this each of them as is often the way with men who have selected careers of different kinds though in discussion he would even justify the career in his heart despised it it seemed to each of them that the life he led himself was the only real life and the life led by his friend was a mere phantasm oblonsky could not restrain a slight mocking smile at the sight of levin how often he had seen him come up to moscow from the country where he was doing something but what precisely stepan arkadyevich could never quite make out and indeed took no interest in the matter levin arrived in moscow always excited and in a hurry rather ill at ease and irritated by his own want of ease and for the most part with a perfectly new unexpected view of things stepan arkadyevich laughed at this and liked it in the same way levin in his heart despised the town mode of life of his friend and his official duties which he laughed at and regarded as trifling but the difference was that oblonsky since he was doing the same as everyone did laughed assuredly and while levin laughed without assuredness and sometimes angrily 
 we have long been expecting you said stepan arkadyevich going into his room and letting hand go as though to show that here all danger was over i am very very glad to see you he went on well what now how are you when did you come 
 
 levin was silent looking at the unfamiliar faces of two companions and especially at the elegant hands with such long white fingers such long yellow nails curved at their end and such huge shining studs on the shirt cuff that apparently these hands absorbed all his attention and allowed him no freedom of thought oblonsky noticed this at once and smiled 
 ah to be sure let me introduce you he said my colleagues philip ivanich nikitin mikhail stanislavich grinevich and turning to levin a zemstvo member a modern zemstvo man a gymnast who lifts five poods with one hand a cattle breeder and sportsman and my friend constantin dmitrievich levin the brother of sergei ivanovich koznishev 
 delighted said the veteran 
 i have the honor of knowing your brother sergei ivanovich said grinevich holding out his slender hand with its long nails 
 levin frowned shook hands coldly and at once turned to oblonsky though he had a great respect for his an author well known to all russia he could not endure it when people treated him not as constantin levin but as the brother of the celebrated koznishev 
 no i am no longer a zemstvo man i have quarreled with them all and go to the sessions any more he said turning to oblonsky 
 been quick about it said oblonsky with a smile but how why 
 a long story i will tell you some time said levin but began telling him at once well to put it shortly i was convinced that nothing was really done by the zemstvo councils or ever could be he began as though someone had just insulted him on one side a plaything they play at being a parliament and neither young enough nor old enough to find amusement in playthings and on the other side he stammered a means for the coterie of the district to feather their nests formerly they did this through wardships and courts of justice now they do it through the zemstvo instead of taking the bribes they take the unearned salary he said as hotly as though one of those present had opposed his opinion 
 aha in a new phase again i see a conservative said stepan arkadyevich however we can go into that later 
 yes later but i had to see you said levin looking with hatred at hand 
 stepan arkadyevich gave a scarcely perceptible smile 
 but you used to say never wear european dress again he said gazing on new suit obviously cut by a french tailor so i see a new phase 
 levin suddenly blushed not as grown men blush slightly without being themselves aware of it but as boys blush feeling that they are ridiculous through their shyness and consequently ashamed of it and blushing still more almost to the point of tears and it was so strange to see this sensible manly face in such a childish plight that oblonsky left off looking at him 
 oh where shall we meet you know i want very much to talk to you said levin 
 oblonsky seemed to ponder 
 tell you what go to to lunch and there we can talk i am free till three 
 no answered levin after an thought i have another visit to make 
 all right then dine together 
 dine together but i have nothing very particular just a word or two a question then a little chatting 
 well have your word or two right now and talk it over in the course of the dinner 
 well this said levin however of no importance 
 his face suddenly assumed an expression of anger from the effort he was making to surmount his shyness 
 what are the shcherbatskys doing everything as it used to be he said 
 stepan arkadyevich who had long known that levin was in love with his kitty gave a hardly perceptible smile and his eyes sparkled merrily 
 said your word or two but i answer in a few words because excuse me for just a minute 
 a secretary came in with respectful familiarity and the modest consciousness characteristic of every secretary of superiority to his chief in the knowledge of affairs he went up to oblonsky with some papers and began under pretense of asking a question to explain some objection stepan arkadyevich without hearing him out laid his hand genially on the sleeve 
 no you do as i told you he said smoothing his remark with a smile and with a brief explanation of his view of the matter he moved away the papers and said so do it that way if you please zakhar nikitich 
 the secretary retired in confusion during the consultation with the secretary levin had completely recovered from his embarrassment he was standing with elbows on the back of a chair and on his face was a look of ironical attention 
 i understand it i understand it he said 
 what you understand said oblonsky smiling just as cheerfully and picking up a cigarette he expected some queer outburst from levin 
 i understand what you are doing said levin shrugging his shoulders how can you be serious about it 
 why not 
 why because nothing in it 
 you think so yet overwhelmed with work 
 on paper but there a gift for it added levin 
 to say you think a lack of something in me 
 perhaps so said levin but all the same i admire your grandeur and am proud to have such a great person as a friend not answered my question though he went on with a desperate effort looking oblonsky straight in the face 
 oh all very well you wait a bit and come to this yourself very nice for you to have three thousand dessiatinas in the karazinsky district and such muscles and the freshness of a girl of twelve still be one of us one day yes as to your question there is no change but a pity been away so long 
 oh why so levin queried frightened 
 oh nothing responded oblonsky talk it over but brought you up to town 
 oh talk about that too later on said levin reddening again up to his ears 
 all right i see said stepan arkadyevich i should ask you to come to us you know but my not quite well but tell you what if you want to see them sure now to be at the zoological gardens from four to five kitty skates you drive along there and come and fetch you and go and dine somewhere together 
 capital so till then 
 now mind forget i know you or rush off home to the country stepan arkadyevich called out laughing 
 no truly 
 and levin went out of the room recalling only when he was in the doorway that he had forgotten to take leave of colleagues 
 that gentleman must be a man of great energy said grinevich when levin had gone away 
 yes my dear sir said stepan arkadyevich nodding his head a lucky fellow three thousand dessiatinas in the karazinsky district everything before him and what youth and vigor not like some of us 
 but why are you complaining stepan arkadyevich 
 why it goes hard with me very bad said stepan arkadyevich with a heavy sigh

 stepan arkadyevich had learned easily at school thanks to his excellent abilities but he had been idle and mischievous and therefore was one of the lowest in his class but in spite of his habitually dissipated mode of life his inferior grade in the service and his comparative youth he occupied the honorable and lucrative position of president of one of the government boards at moscow this post he had received through his sister husband alexei alexandrovich karenin who held one of the most important positions in the ministry to which the moscow office belonged but if karenin had not got his this berth then through a hundred other personages brothers sisters cousins uncles and aunts stiva oblonsky would have received this post or some other like it together with the salary of six thousand absolutely needful for him as his affairs in spite of his considerable property were in a poor state 
 half moscow and peterburg were friends and relations of stepan arkadyevich he was born in the midst of those who had been and had become the powerful ones of this world of the men in the government the older men had been friends of his and had known him in pinafores another third were his intimate chums and the remainder were friendly acquaintances consequently the distributors of earthly blessings in the shape of posts rents concessions and such were all his friends and could not overlook one of their own set and oblonsky had no need to make any special exertion to get a lucrative post he had only not to refuse things not to show jealousy not to be quarrelsome or take offense all of which from his characteristic good nature he never did it would have struck him as absurd if he had been told that he would not get a position with the salary he required especially as he expected nothing out of the way he only wanted what the men of his own age and standing did get and he was no worse qualified for performing duties of this kind than any other man 
 stepan arkadyevich was not merely liked by all who knew him for his good humor his bright disposition and his unquestionable honesty in him in his handsome radiant figure his sparkling eyes black hair and eyebrows and his white and pink complexion there was something which produced a physical effect of kindliness and good humor on the people who met him aha stiva oblonsky the man himself was almost always said with a smile of delight on meeting him even though it happened at times that after a conversation with him it seemed that nothing particularly delightful had happened the next day and the next everyone was just as delighted to meet him again 
 after filling for two years the post of president of one of the government boards at moscow stepan arkadyevich had won the respect as well as the liking of his fellow officials subordinates and superiors and all who had had business with him the principal qualities in stepan arkadyevich which had gained him this universal respect in the service consisted in the first place of his extreme indulgence for others founded on a consciousness of his own shortcomings secondly of his perfect liberalism not the liberalism he read of in the papers but the liberalism that was in his blood in virtue of which he treated all men perfectly equally and exactly the same whatever their fortune or rank might be and thirdly the most important point of his complete indifference to the business in which he was engaged in consequence of which he was never carried away and made no mistakes 
 on reaching the offices of the board stepan arkadyevich escorted by a deferential porter with a portfolio went into his little private room put on his uniform and went into the board room the clerks and officials all rose greeting him with deference stepan arkadyevich moved quickly as always to his place shook hands with the members of the board and sat down he made a joke or two and talked just as much as was consistent with due decorum and began work no one knew better than stepan arkadyevich how to hit on that exact limit of freedom simplicity and official stiffness which is necessary for the agreeable conduct of business a secretary with the deference common to everyone in stepan office came up with papers and began to speak in the familiar and easy tone which had been introduced by stepan arkadyevich 
 we have succeeded in getting the information from the government department of penza here would you care 
 got it at last said stepan arkadyevich laying his finger on the paper now gentlemen 
 and the sitting of the board began 
 if they but knew he thought inclining his head with an important air and listening to the report what a guilty little boy their president was half an hour ago and his eyes were laughing during the reading of the report till two the sitting would go on without a break then there would be an interval and luncheon 
 it was not yet two when the large glass doors of the board room suddenly opened and someone came in 
 all the members of the board sitting at the table from below the portrait of the czar and from behind the mirror of justice delighted at any distraction looked round at the door but the doorkeeper standing there at once drove out the intruder and closed the glass door after him 
 when the case had been read through stepan arkadyevich got up and stretched and by way of tribute to the liberalism of the times took out a cigarette being in the board room and went into his private room two of his board fellows the old veteran in the service nikitin and the kammerjunker grinevich went in with him 
 we shall have time to finish after lunch said stepan arkadyevich 
 to be sure we shall said nikitin 
 a pretty sharp fellow this fomin must be said grinevich of one of the persons taking part in the case they were examining 
 stepan arkadyevich frowned at words giving him thereby to understand that it was improper to pass judgment prematurely and made him no reply 
 who was it who came in he asked the doorkeeper 
 some fellow your excellency sneaked in without permission directly my back was turned he was asking for you i told him when the members come out then 
 where is he 
 maybe gone into the passage he was strolling here till now he said the doorkeeper pointing to a strongly built broad shouldered man with a curly beard who without taking off his sheepskin cap was running lightly and rapidly up the worn steps of the stone staircase one of the officials going down a lean fellow with a portfolio stood out of his way looked disapprovingly at the legs of the running man and then glanced inquiringly at oblonsky 
 stepan arkadyevich was standing at the top of the stairs his beaming face above the embroidered collar of his uniform beamed more than ever when he recognized the man coming up 
 why actually you levin at last he said with a friendly mocking smile gazing on the approaching man how is it you have deigned to look me up in this den said stepan arkadyevich and not content with shaking hands he kissed his friend have you been here long 
 i have just come and very much wanted to see you said levin looking about him shyly and at the same time angrily and uneasily 
 well go into my room said stepan arkadyevich who knew his sensitive and irritable shyness and taking his arm he drew him along as though guiding him through dangers

 a long story i will tell you some time said levin but began telling him at once well to put it shortly i was convinced that nothing was really done by the zemstvo councils or ever could be he began as though someone had just insulted him on one side a plaything they play at being a parliament and neither young enough nor old enough to find amusement in playthings and on the other side he stammered a means for the coterie of the district to feather their nests formerly they did this through wardships and courts of justice now they do it through the zemstvo instead of taking the bribes they take the unearned salary he said as hotly as though one of those present had opposed his opinion 
 aha in a new phase again i see a conservative said stepan arkadyevich however we can go into that later 
 yes later but i had to see you said levin looking with hatred at hand 
 stepan arkadyevich gave a scarcely perceptible smile 
 but you used to say never wear european dress again he said gazing on new suit obviously cut by a french tailor so i see a new phase 
 levin suddenly blushed not as grown men blush slightly without being themselves aware of it but as boys blush feeling that they are ridiculous through their shyness and consequently ashamed of it and blushing still more almost to the point of tears and it was so strange to see this sensible manly face in such a childish plight that oblonsky left off looking at him 
 oh where shall we meet you know i want very much to talk to you said levin 
 oblonsky seemed to ponder 
 tell you what go to to lunch and there we can talk i am free till three 
 no answered levin after an thought i have another visit to make 
 all right then dine together 
 dine together but i have nothing very particular just a word or two a question then a little chatting 
 well have your word or two right now and talk it over in the course of the dinner 
 well this said levin however of no importance 
 his face suddenly assumed an expression of anger from the effort he was making to surmount his shyness 
 what are the shcherbatskys doing everything as it used to be he said 
 stepan arkadyevich who had long known that levin was in love with his kitty gave a hardly perceptible smile and his eyes sparkled merrily 
 said your word or two but i answer in a few words because excuse me for just a minute 
 a secretary came in with respectful familiarity and the modest consciousness characteristic of every secretary of superiority to his chief in the knowledge of affairs he went up to oblonsky with some papers and began under pretense of asking a question to explain some objection stepan arkadyevich without hearing him out laid his hand genially on the sleeve 
 no you do as i told you he said smoothing his remark with a smile and with a brief explanation of his view of the matter he moved away the papers and said so do it that way if you please zakhar nikitich 
 the secretary retired in confusion during the consultation with the secretary levin had completely recovered from his embarrassment he was standing with elbows on the back of a chair and on his face was a look of ironical attention 
 i understand it i understand it he said 
 what you understand said oblonsky smiling just as cheerfully and picking up a cigarette he expected some queer outburst from levin 
 i understand what you are doing said levin shrugging his shoulders how can you be serious about it 
 why not 
 why because nothing in it 
 you think so yet overwhelmed with work 
 on paper but there a gift for it added levin 
 to say you think a lack of something in me 
 perhaps so said levin but all the same i admire your grandeur and am proud to have such a great person as a friend not answered my question though he went on with a desperate effort looking oblonsky straight in the face 
 oh all very well you wait a bit and come to this yourself very nice for you to have three thousand dessiatinas in the karazinsky district and such muscles and the freshness of a girl of twelve still be one of us one day yes as to your question there is no change but a pity been away so long 
 oh why so levin queried frightened 
 oh nothing responded oblonsky talk it over but brought you up to town 
 oh talk about that too later on said levin reddening again up to his ears 
 all right i see said stepan arkadyevich i should ask you to come to us you know but my not quite well but tell you what if you want to see them sure now to be at the zoological gardens from four to five kitty skates you drive along there and come and fetch you and go and dine somewhere together 
 capital so till then 
 now mind forget i know you or rush off home to the country stepan arkadyevich called out laughing 
 no truly 
 and levin went out of the room recalling only when he was in the doorway that he had forgotten to take leave of colleagues 
 that gentleman must be a man of great energy said grinevich when levin had gone away 
 yes my dear sir said stepan arkadyevich nodding his head a lucky fellow three thousand dessiatinas in the karazinsky district everything before him and what youth and vigor not like some of us 
 but why are you complaining stepan arkadyevich 
 why it goes hard with me very bad said stepan arkadyevich with a heavy sigh

 when oblonsky asked levin what had brought him to town levin blushed and was furious with himself for blushing because he could not answer i have come to make your a proposal though that was solely what he had come for 
 the families of the levins and the shcherbatskys were old noble moscow families and had always been on intimate and friendly terms this intimacy had grown still closer during student days he had both prepared for the university with the young prince shcherbatsky the brother of kitty and dolly and had entered at the same time with him in those days levin was a frequent visitor at the house of the shcherbatskys and he was in love with the shcherbatsky household strange as it may appear it was with the household the family that constantin levin was in love especially with the feminine half of the household levin did not remember his own mother and his only sister was older than he was so that it was in the house that he saw for the first time that inner life of an old noble cultured and honorable family of which he had been deprived by the death of his father and mother all the members of that family especially the feminine half were pictured by him as it were wrapped about with a mysterious poetical veil and he not only perceived no defects whatever in them but under the poetical veil that shrouded them he assumed the existence of the loftiest sentiments and every possible perfection why it was the three young ladies had one day to speak french and the next english why it was that at certain hours they played by turns on the piano the sounds of which were audible in their room above where the students used to work why they were visited by those professors of french literature of music of drawing of dancing why at certain hours all the three young ladies with mademoiselle linon drove in the coach to the tverskoy boulevard dressed in their satin cloaks dolly in a long one natalie in a one and kitty in one so short that her shapely legs in red stockings were visible to all beholders why it was they had to walk about the tverskoy boulevard escorted by a footman with a gold cockade in his hat all this and much more that was done in their mysterious world he did not understand but he was sure that everything that was done there was very good and he was in love precisely with the mystery of the proceedings 
 in his student days he had all but been in love with the eldest dolly but she was soon married to oblonsky then he began being in love with the second he felt as it were that he had to be in love with one of the sisters only he could not quite make out which but natalie too had hardly made her appearance in the world when she married the diplomat lvov kitty was still a child when levin left the university young shcherbatsky went into the navy was drowned in the baltic and visits to the shcherbatskys despite his friendship with oblonsky became less frequent but when early in the winter of this year levin came to moscow after a year in the country and saw the shcherbatskys he realized which of the three sisters he was indeed destined to love 
 one would have thought that nothing could be simpler than for him a man of good family rather rich than poor and years old to make the young princess shcherbatskaia an offer of marriage in all likelihood he would at once have been looked upon as a good match but levin was in love and so it seemed to him that kitty was so perfect in every respect a creature so far above everything earthly while he was a creature so low and so earthly that it could not even be conceived that other people and she herself could regard him as worthy of her 
 after spending two months in moscow in a state of befuddlement seeing kitty almost every day in society into which he went so as to meet her he abruptly decided that it could not be and went back to the country 
 conviction that it could not be was founded on the idea that in the eyes of her family he was a disadvantageous and worthless match for the charming kitty and that kitty herself could not love him in her eyes he had no ordinary definite career and position in society while his comrades by this time when he was were already one a colonel and another a professor another director of a bank and railways or chairman of a board like oblonsky but he he knew very well how he must appear to others was a country gentleman occupied in breeding cattle shooting game and building barns in other words a fellow of no ability who had not turned out well and who was doing just what according to the ideas of the world is done by people fit for nothing else 
 the mysterious enchanting kitty herself could not love such an ugly person as he conceived himself to be and above all such an ordinary in no way striking person moreover his attitude to kitty in the past the attitude of a person to a child arising from his friendship with her brother seemed to him yet another obstacle to love an ugly man as he considered himself might he supposed be liked as a friend but to be loved with such a love as that with which he loved kitty one would need to be handsome and still more a distinguished man 
 he had heard that women often did care for ugly and ordinary men but he did not believe it for he judged by himself and he could not himself have loved any but beautiful mysterious and exceptional women 
 but after spending two months alone in the country he was convinced that this was not one of those passions of which he had had experience in his early youth that this feeling gave him not an rest that he could not live without deciding the question as to whether she would or would not be his wife that his despair had arisen only from his own imaginings and that he had no sort of proof that he would be rejected so he had now come to moscow with a firm determination to make a proposal and get married if he were accepted or he could not conceive what would become of him if he were rejected

 on arriving in moscow by a morning train levin had put up at the house of his elder koznishev after changing his clothes he went down to his study intending to talk to him at once about the object of his visit and to ask his advice but his brother was not alone with him there was a professor of philosophy who had come from charkov expressly to clear up a difference that had arisen between them on a very important philosophical question the professor was carrying on a hot crusade against materialists sergei koznishev had been following this crusade with interest and after reading the last article had written him a letter stating his objections he accused the professor of making too great concessions to the materialists and the professor had promptly appeared to argue the matter out the point in discussion was the question then in vogue is there a line to be drawn between psychical and physiological phenomena in man and if so where 
 sergei ivanovich met his brother with the smile of chilly friendliness he always had for everyone and introducing him to the professor went on with the conversation 
 a little man in spectacles with a narrow forehead tore himself from the discussion for an instant to greet levin and then went on talking without paying any further attention to him levin sat down to wait till the professor should go but he soon began to get interested in the subject under discussion 
 levin had come across the magazine articles about which they were disputing and had read them interested in them as a development of the first principles of science familiar to him when a natural science student at the university but he had never connected these scientific deductions as to the origin of man as an animal as to reflex action biology and sociology with those questions as to the meaning to himself of life and death which had of late been more and more often in his mind 
 as he listened to his argument with the professor he noticed that they connected these scientific questions with those spiritual problems that at times they almost touched on the latter but every time they were close upon what seemed to him the chief point they promptly beat a hasty retreat and plunged again into a sea of subtle distinctions reservations quotations allusions and appeals to authorities and it was with difficulty that he understood what they were talking about 
 i cannot admit it said sergei ivanovich with his habitual clearness and distinctness of expression and elegance of diction i cannot in any case agree with keiss that my whole conception of the external world has been derived from impressions the most fundamental idea the idea of existence has not been received by me through sensation indeed there is no special sense organ for the transmission of such an idea 
 yes but they wurst and knaust and pripassov would answer that your consciousness of existence is derived from the conjunction of all your sensations that that consciousness of existence is the result of your sensations wurst indeed says plainly that assuming there are no sensations it follows that there is no idea of existence 
 i maintain the contrary began sergei ivanovich 
 but here it seemed again to levin that just as they were close upon the real point of the matter they were again retreating and he made up his mind to put a question to the professor 
 according to that if my senses are annihilated if my body is dead i can have no existence of any sort he queried 
 the professor in annoyance and as it were mental suffering at the interruption looked round at the strange inquirer more like a hauler of a barge than a philosopher and turned his eyes upon sergei ivanovich as though to ask one to say to him but sergei ivanovich who had been talking with far less stress and than the professor and who had sufficient breadth of mind to answer the professor and at the same time to comprehend the simple and natural point of view from which the question was put smiled and said 
 that question we have no right to answer as yet 
 we have not the requisite data confirmed the professor and he went back to his argument no he said i would point out the fact that if as pripassov directly asserts sensation is based on impression then we are bound to distinguish sharply between these two conceptions 
 levin listened no more and simply waited for the professor to go

 on arriving in moscow by a morning train levin had put up at the house of his elder koznishev after changing his clothes he went down to his study intending to talk to him at once about the object of his visit and to ask his advice but his brother was not alone with him there was a professor of philosophy who had come from charkov expressly to clear up a difference that had arisen between them on a very important philosophical question the professor was carrying on a hot crusade against materialists sergei koznishev had been following this crusade with interest and after reading the last article had written him a letter stating his objections he accused the professor of making too great concessions to the materialists and the professor had promptly appeared to argue the matter out the point in discussion was the question then in vogue is there a line to be drawn between psychical and physiological phenomena in man and if so where 
 sergei ivanovich met his brother with the smile of chilly friendliness he always had for everyone and introducing him to the professor went on with the conversation 
 a little man in spectacles with a narrow forehead tore himself from the discussion for an instant to greet levin and then went on talking without paying any further attention to him levin sat down to wait till the professor should go but he soon began to get interested in the subject under discussion 
 levin had come across the magazine articles about which they were disputing and had read them interested in them as a development of the first principles of science familiar to him when a natural science student at the university but he had never connected these scientific deductions as to the origin of man as an animal as to reflex action biology and sociology with those questions as to the meaning to himself of life and death which had of late been more and more often in his mind 
 as he listened to his argument with the professor he noticed that they connected these scientific questions with those spiritual problems that at times they almost touched on the latter but every time they were close upon what seemed to him the chief point they promptly beat a hasty retreat and plunged again into a sea of subtle distinctions reservations quotations allusions and appeals to authorities and it was with difficulty that he understood what they were talking about 
 i cannot admit it said sergei ivanovich with his habitual clearness and distinctness of expression and elegance of diction i cannot in any case agree with keiss that my whole conception of the external world has been derived from impressions the most fundamental idea the idea of existence has not been received by me through sensation indeed there is no special sense organ for the transmission of such an idea 
 yes but they wurst and knaust and pripassov would answer that your consciousness of existence is derived from the conjunction of all your sensations that that consciousness of existence is the result of your sensations wurst indeed says plainly that assuming there are no sensations it follows that there is no idea of existence 
 i maintain the contrary began sergei ivanovich 
 but here it seemed again to levin that just as they were close upon the real point of the matter they were again retreating and he made up his mind to put a question to the professor 
 according to that if my senses are annihilated if my body is dead i can have no existence of any sort he queried 
 the professor in annoyance and as it were mental suffering at the interruption looked round at the strange inquirer more like a hauler of a barge than a philosopher and turned his eyes upon sergei ivanovich as though to ask one to say to him but sergei ivanovich who had been talking with far less stress and than the professor and who had sufficient breadth of mind to answer the professor and at the same time to comprehend the simple and natural point of view from which the question was put smiled and said 
 that question we have no right to answer as yet 
 we have not the requisite data confirmed the professor and he went back to his argument no he said i would point out the fact that if as pripassov directly asserts sensation is based on impression then we are bound to distinguish sharply between these two conceptions 
 levin listened no more and simply waited for the professor to go

 when the professor had gone sergei ivanovich turned to his brother 
 delighted that come for how long your farming getting on 
 levin knew that his elder brother took little interest in farming and only put the question in deference to him and therefore he told him only about the sale of his wheat and money matters 
 levin had meant to tell his brother of his determination to get married and to ask his advice he had indeed firmly resolved to do so but after seeing his brother listening to his conversation with the professor hearing afterward the unconsciously patronizing tone in which his brother questioned him about agricultural matters their property had not been divided and levin took charge of both their shares levin felt that he could not for some reason broach to him his intention of marrying he felt that his brother would not look on it as he would have wished him 
 well how is your zemstvo doing asked sergei ivanovich who was greatly interested in zemstvo establishments and attached great importance to them 
 i really know 
 what but surely a member of the board 
 no not a member now resigned answered levin and i no longer attend the sessions 
 what a pity commented sergei ivanovich frowning 
 levin in began to describe what took place at the sessions in his district 
 how it always is sergei ivanovich interrupted him we russians are always like that perhaps our strong point really this faculty of seeing our own shortcomings but we overdo it we comfort ourselves with irony which we always have on the tip of our tongues all i say is give such rights as our zemstvo establishments to any other european people and why the germans or the english would have worked their way to freedom with them while we simply turn them into ridicule 
 but how can it be helped said levin penitently it was my last trial and i did try with all my soul i no good at it 
 not that no good at it said sergei ivanovich it is that you look at it as you should 
 perhaps not levin answered dejectedly 
 oh do you know brother turned up again 
 this brother nikolai was the elder brother of constantin levin and of sergei ivanovich a man who was done for who had dissipated the greater part of his fortune was living in the strangest and lowest company and had quarreled with his brothers 
 what did you say levin cried with horror how do you know 
 procophii saw him in the street 
 here in moscow where is he do you know levin got up from his chair as though on the point of starting off at once 
 sorry i told you said sergei ivanovich shaking his head at his younger excitement i sent to find out where he is living and sent him his i o u to trubin which i paid this is the answer he sent me 
 and sergei ivanovich took a note from under a paperweight and handed it to his brother 
 levin read in the queer familiar handwriting i humbly beg you to leave me in peace the only favor i ask of my gracious brothers nikolai levin 
 levin read it and without raising his head stood with the note in his hands opposite sergei ivanovich 
 there was a struggle in his heart between the desire to forget his unhappy brother for the time and the consciousness that it would be base to do so 
 he obviously wants to offend me pursued sergei ivanovich but he cannot offend me and i should have wished with all my heart to assist him but i know impossible to do that 
 yes yes repeated levin i understand and appreciate your attitude to him but i shall go and see him 
 if you want to do but i advise it said sergei ivanovich as regards myself i have no fear of your doing so he will not make you quarrel with me but for your own sake i should say you would do better not to go you do him any good still do as you please 
 very likely i do any good but i feel especially at such a moment but another thing i feel i could not be at peace 
 well something i understand said sergei ivanovich one thing i do understand he added a lesson in humility i have come to look very differently and more indulgently on what is called infamy since brother nikolai has become what he is you know what he did 
 oh awful awful repeated levin 
 after obtaining his address from sergei footman levin was on the point of setting off at once to see him but on second thought he decided to put off his visit till the evening the thing to do to set his heart at rest was to accomplish what he had come to moscow for from his levin went to office and on getting news of the shcherbatskys from him he drove to the place where he had been told he might find kitty

 chapter 
 
 at four conscious of his throbbing heart levin stepped out of a hired sleigh at the zoological gardens and turned along the path to the frozen mounds and the skating ground knowing that he would certainly find her there as he had seen the carriage at the entrance 
 it was a bright frosty day rows of carriages sleighs drivers and gendarmes were standing in the approach crowds of people with hats bright in the sun swarmed about the entrance and along the paths between the little houses adorned with carving in the russian style the old curly birches of the gardens all their twigs laden with snow looked as though freshly decked in sacred vestments 
 he walked along the path toward the skating ground and kept saying to himself you be excited you must be calm the matter with you what do you want be still foolish one he conjured his heart and the more he tried to compose himself the more breathless he found himself an acquaintance met him and called him by his name but levin did not even recognize him he went toward the mounds whence came the clank of the chains of sleighs as they slipped down or were dragged up the rumble of the sliding sleighs and the sounds of merry voices he walked on a few steps and the skating ground lay open before him and at once amid all the skaters he recognized her 
 he knew she was there by the rapture and the terror that seized his heart she was standing talking to a lady at the opposite end of the ground there was apparently nothing striking either in her dress or her attitude but for levin she was as easy to find in that crowd as a rose among nettles everything was made bright by her she was the smile that shed light on all around her is it possible i can go over there on the ice approach her he thought the place where she stood seemed to him a holy shrine unapproachable and there was one moment when he was almost retreating so overwhelmed was he with terror he had to make an effort to master himself and to remind himself that people of all sorts were moving about her and that he too might have come there to skate he descended for a long while avoiding looking at her as at the sun yet seeing her as one does the sun without looking 
 on that day of the week and at that time of day people of one set all acquainted with one another used to meet on the ice there were skillful skaters there showing off their skill and beginners clinging to chairs with timid awkward movements and boys and elderly people skating with hygienic motives they seemed to levin an elect band of blissful beings because they were here near her all the skaters it seemed with perfect skated toward her skated by her even spoke to her and were happy quite apart from her enjoying the capital ice and the fine weather 
 nikolai shcherbatsky cousin in a short jacket and tight trousers was sitting on a bench with his skates on seeing levin he shouted to him 
 ah the first skater in russia been here long ice do put your skates on 
 i got my skates levin answered marveling at this boldness and ease in her presence and not for one second losing sight of her though he did not look at her he felt as though the sun were coming near him she was in a corner and turning out her slender feet in their high boots she with obvious timidity skated toward him a boy in russian dress desperately waving his arms and bending down to the ground overtook her she skated a little uncertainly taking her hands out of the little muff that hung on a cord she held them ready for emergency and looking toward levin whom she had recognized she smiled at him and at her own fears when she had got round the turn she got a start with one foot and skated straight up to shcherbatsky clutching at his arm she nodded with a smile to levin she was more beautiful than he had imagined her 
 when he thought of her he could call up a vivid picture of her to himself especially the charm of that little fair head so freely set on the shapely girlish shoulders and so full of childish brightness and kindness her childish countenance together with the delicate beauty of her figure made up that special charm of hers which he appreciated so well but what always struck him in her as something unlooked for was the expression of her eyes soft serene and truthful and above all her smile which always transported levin to an enchanted world where he felt moved and tender as he remembered himself during certain rare days of his early childhood 
 have you been here long she said giving him her hand thank you she added as he picked up the handkerchief that had fallen out of her muff 
 i not long ago yesterday i mean i arrived today answered levin in his emotion not comprehending her question immediately i meant to come and see you he said and then recollecting what his intention was in seeking her he was promptly overcome with confusion and blushed i know you could skate and skate so well 
 she looked at him attentively as though wishing to make out the cause of his confusion 
 your praise is worth having the tradition is kept up here that you are the best of skaters she said with her little hand brushing some needles of hoarfrost off her muff 
 yes i used to skate with passion once upon a time i wanted to attain perfection 
 you do everything with passion i think she said smiling i should so like to see how you skate do put on skates and skate together 
 skate together can that be possible thought levin gazing at her 
 put them on directly he said 
 and he went off to get skates 
 a long while since seen you here sir said the attendant supporting his foot and screwing on the heel of the skate except you none of the gentlemen skaters will that be all right said he tightening the strap 
 oh yes yes make haste please answered levin with difficulty restraining the smile of rapture which would overspread his face yes he thought this is life this is happiness together she said let us skate together speak to her now but just why afraid to speak because happy now happy even though only in hope and then but i must i must i must away faintheartedness 
 levin rose to his feet took off his overcoat and gaining speed over the rough ice round the pavilion came out on the smooth ice and skated without effort as it were by simple exercise of will increasing and slackening speed and turning his course he approached her with timidity but again her smile reassured him 
 she gave him her hand and they set off side by side going faster and faster and the more rapidly they moved the more tightly she grasped his hand 
 with you i should soon learn i somehow feel confidence in you she said to him 
 and i have confidence in myself when you are leaning on me he said but was at once frightened at what he had said and blushed and indeed no sooner had he uttered these words than all at once like the sun going behind a cloud her face lost all its tenderness and levin detected the familiar change in her expression that denoted mental concentration a tiny wrinkle came upon her smooth brow 
 is there anything troubling you however no right to ask such a question he said hurriedly 
 oh why so no i have nothing to trouble me she responded coldly and immediately added you seen mlle linon have you 
 not yet 
 go and speak to her she likes you so much 
 wrong i have offended her lord help me thought levin and he flew towards the old frenchwoman with the gray ringlets who was sitting on a bench smiling and showing her false teeth she greeted him as an old friend 
 yes you see growing up she said to him glancing toward kitty and growing old tiny bear has grown big now pursued the frenchwoman laughing and she reminded him of his joke about the three young ladies whom he had compared to the three bears in the english nursery tale do you remember what you used to call them 
 he remembered absolutely nothing but she had been laughing at the joke for ten years now and was fond of it 
 now go and skate go and skate our kitty has learned to skate nicely she 
 when levin darted up to kitty her face was no longer stern her eyes looked at him with the same sincerity and tenderness but levin fancied that in her tenderness there was a certain note of deliberate composure and he felt depressed after talking a little of her old governess and her peculiarities she questioned him about his life 
 surely you must feel dull in the country in the winter she said 
 no not dull i am very busy he said feeling that she was making him submit to her composed tone which he would not have the strength to break through just as had been the case at the beginning of the winter 
 are you going to stay in town long kitty questioned him 
 i know he answered not thinking of what he was saying the thought came into his mind that if he were held in submission by her tone of quiet friendliness he would end by going back again without deciding anything and he resolved to mutiny against it 
 how is it you know 
 i know it depends upon you he said and was immediately at his own words 
 whether it was that she did not hear his words or that she did not want to hear them she made a sort of stumble twice struck out and hurriedly skated away from him she skated up to mlle linon said something to her and went toward the pavilion where the ladies took off their skates 
 my god what have i done merciful god help me guide me said levin praying inwardly and at the same time feeling a need of violent exercise he skated about describing concentric and eccentric circles 
 at that moment one of the young men the best of the skaters of the day came out of the coffeehouse on his skates with a cigarette in his mouth taking a run he dashed down the steps on his skates crashing and leaping he flew down and without even changing the position of his hands skated away over the ice 
 ah a new trick said levin and he promptly ran up to the top to perform this new trick 
 break your neck this needs practice nikolai shcherbatsky shouted after him 
 levin went to the steps took a run from above as best he could and dashed down preserving his balance in this unwonted movement with his hands on the last step he stumbled but barely touching the ice with his hand with a violent effort recovered himself and skated off laughing 
 what a fine darling chap he is kitty was thinking at that moment as she came out of the pavilion with mlle linon and looked toward him with a smile of quiet kindness as though he were a favorite brother and can it be my fault can i have done anything wrong they talk of coquetry i know not he that i love but still i am happy with him and so nice only why did he say that she mused 
 catching sight of kitty going away and her mother meeting her at the steps levin flushed from his rapid exercise stood still and pondered a minute he took off his skates and overtook the mother and daughter at the entrance of the gardens 
 delighted to see you said princess shcherbatskaia on thursdays we are home as always 
 today then 
 we shall be pleased to see you the princess said stiffly 
 this stiffness hurt kitty and she could not resist the desire to smooth over her coldness she turned her head and with a smile said 
 till this evening 
 at that moment stepan arkadyevich his hat cocked on one side with beaming face and eyes strode into the garden like a buoyant conqueror but as he approached his he responded to her inquiries about health with a mournful and guilty countenance after a little subdued and dejected conversation with her he set straight his chest again and took levin by the arm 
 well shall we set off he asked been thinking about you all this time and very very glad come he said looking him in the face with a significant air 
 yes come along answered levin in ecstasy hearing unceasingly the sound of that voice saying till this evening and seeing the smile with which it was said 
 to england or the hermitage 
 all the same to me 
 well then england it is said stepan arkadyevich selecting that restaurant because he owed more there than at the hermitage and consequently considered it mean to avoid it have you got a sleigh fine for i sent my carriage home 
 the friends hardly spoke all the way levin was wondering what that change in expression had meant and alternately assuring himself that there was hope and falling into despair seeing clearly that his hopes were insane and yet all the while he felt himself quite another man utterly unlike what he had been before her smile and those words till this evening 
 stepan arkadyevich was absorbed during the drive in composing the menu of the dinner

 at four conscious of his throbbing heart levin stepped out of a hired sleigh at the zoological gardens and turned along the path to the frozen mounds and the skating ground knowing that he would certainly find her there as he had seen the carriage at the entrance 
 it was a bright frosty day rows of carriages sleighs drivers and gendarmes were standing in the approach crowds of people with hats bright in the sun swarmed about the entrance and along the paths between the little houses adorned with carving in the russian style the old curly birches of the gardens all their twigs laden with snow looked as though freshly decked in sacred vestments 
 he walked along the path toward the skating ground and kept saying to himself you be excited you must be calm the matter with you what do you want be still foolish one he conjured his heart and the more he tried to compose himself the more breathless he found himself an acquaintance met him and called him by his name but levin did not even recognize him he went toward the mounds whence came the clank of the chains of sleighs as they slipped down or were dragged up the rumble of the sliding sleighs and the sounds of merry voices he walked on a few steps and the skating ground lay open before him and at once amid all the skaters he recognized her 
 he knew she was there by the rapture and the terror that seized his heart she was standing talking to a lady at the opposite end of the ground there was apparently nothing striking either in her dress or her attitude but for levin she was as easy to find in that crowd as a rose among nettles everything was made bright by her she was the smile that shed light on all around her is it possible i can go over there on the ice approach her he thought the place where she stood seemed to him a holy shrine unapproachable and there was one moment when he was almost retreating so overwhelmed was he with terror he had to make an effort to master himself and to remind himself that people of all sorts were moving about her and that he too might have come there to skate he descended for a long while avoiding looking at her as at the sun yet seeing her as one does the sun without looking 
 on that day of the week and at that time of day people of one set all acquainted with one another used to meet on the ice there were skillful skaters there showing off their skill and beginners clinging to chairs with timid awkward movements and boys and elderly people skating with hygienic motives they seemed to levin an elect band of blissful beings because they were here near her all the skaters it seemed with perfect skated toward her skated by her even spoke to her and were happy quite apart from her enjoying the capital ice and the fine weather 
 nikolai shcherbatsky cousin in a short jacket and tight trousers was sitting on a bench with his skates on seeing levin he shouted to him 
 ah the first skater in russia been here long ice do put your skates on 
 i got my skates levin answered marveling at this boldness and ease in her presence and not for one second losing sight of her though he did not look at her he felt as though the sun were coming near him she was in a corner and turning out her slender feet in their high boots she with obvious timidity skated toward him a boy in russian dress desperately waving his arms and bending down to the ground overtook her she skated a little uncertainly taking her hands out of the little muff that hung on a cord she held them ready for emergency and looking toward levin whom she had recognized she smiled at him and at her own fears when she had got round the turn she got a start with one foot and skated straight up to shcherbatsky clutching at his arm she nodded with a smile to levin she was more beautiful than he had imagined her 
 when he thought of her he could call up a vivid picture of her to himself especially the charm of that little fair head so freely set on the shapely girlish shoulders and so full of childish brightness and kindness her childish countenance together with the delicate beauty of her figure made up that special charm of hers which he appreciated so well but what always struck him in her as something unlooked for was the expression of her eyes soft serene and truthful and above all her smile which always transported levin to an enchanted world where he felt moved and tender as he remembered himself during certain rare days of his early childhood 
 have you been here long she said giving him her hand thank you she added as he picked up the handkerchief that had fallen out of her muff 
 i not long ago yesterday i mean i arrived today answered levin in his emotion not comprehending her question immediately i meant to come and see you he said and then recollecting what his intention was in seeking her he was promptly overcome with confusion and blushed i know you could skate and skate so well 
 she looked at him attentively as though wishing to make out the cause of his confusion 
 your praise is worth having the tradition is kept up here that you are the best of skaters she said with her little hand brushing some needles of hoarfrost off her muff 
 yes i used to skate with passion once upon a time i wanted to attain perfection 
 you do everything with passion i think she said smiling i should so like to see how you skate do put on skates and skate together 
 skate together can that be possible thought levin gazing at her 
 put them on directly he said 
 and he went off to get skates 
 a long while since seen you here sir said the attendant supporting his foot and screwing on the heel of the skate except you none of the gentlemen skaters will that be all right said he tightening the strap 
 oh yes yes make haste please answered levin with difficulty restraining the smile of rapture which would overspread his face yes he thought this is life this is happiness together she said let us skate together speak to her now but just why afraid to speak because happy now happy even though only in hope and then but i must i must i must away faintheartedness 
 levin rose to his feet took off his overcoat and gaining speed over the rough ice round the pavilion came out on the smooth ice and skated without effort as it were by simple exercise of will increasing and slackening speed and turning his course he approached her with timidity but again her smile reassured him 
 she gave him her hand and they set off side by side going faster and faster and the more rapidly they moved the more tightly she grasped his hand 
 with you i should soon learn i somehow feel confidence in you she said to him 
 and i have confidence in myself when you are leaning on me he said but was at once frightened at what he had said and blushed and indeed no sooner had he uttered these words than all at once like the sun going behind a cloud her face lost all its tenderness and levin detected the familiar change in her expression that denoted mental concentration a tiny wrinkle came upon her smooth brow 
 is there anything troubling you however no right to ask such a question he said hurriedly 
 oh why so no i have nothing to trouble me she responded coldly and immediately added you seen mlle linon have you 
 not yet 
 go and speak to her she likes you so much 
 wrong i have offended her lord help me thought levin and he flew towards the old frenchwoman with the gray ringlets who was sitting on a bench smiling and showing her false teeth she greeted him as an old friend 
 yes you see growing up she said to him glancing toward kitty and growing old tiny bear has grown big now pursued the frenchwoman laughing and she reminded him of his joke about the three young ladies whom he had compared to the three bears in the english nursery tale do you remember what you used to call them 
 he remembered absolutely nothing but she had been laughing at the joke for ten years now and was fond of it 
 now go and skate go and skate our kitty has learned to skate nicely she 
 when levin darted up to kitty her face was no longer stern her eyes looked at him with the same sincerity and tenderness but levin fancied that in her tenderness there was a certain note of deliberate composure and he felt depressed after talking a little of her old governess and her peculiarities she questioned him about his life 
 surely you must feel dull in the country in the winter she said 
 no not dull i am very busy he said feeling that she was making him submit to her composed tone which he would not have the strength to break through just as had been the case at the beginning of the winter 
 are you going to stay in town long kitty questioned him 
 i know he answered not thinking of what he was saying the thought came into his mind that if he were held in submission by her tone of quiet friendliness he would end by going back again without deciding anything and he resolved to mutiny against it 
 how is it you know 
 i know it depends upon you he said and was immediately at his own words 
 whether it was that she did not hear his words or that she did not want to hear them she made a sort of stumble twice struck out and hurriedly skated away from him she skated up to mlle linon said something to her and went toward the pavilion where the ladies took off their skates 
 my god what have i done merciful god help me guide me said levin praying inwardly and at the same time feeling a need of violent exercise he skated about describing concentric and eccentric circles 
 at that moment one of the young men the best of the skaters of the day came out of the coffeehouse on his skates with a cigarette in his mouth taking a run he dashed down the steps on his skates crashing and leaping he flew down and without even changing the position of his hands skated away over the ice 
 ah a new trick said levin and he promptly ran up to the top to perform this new trick

 levin went to the steps took a run from above as best he could and dashed down preserving his balance in this unwonted movement with his hands on the last step he stumbled but barely touching the ice with his hand with a violent effort recovered himself and skated off laughing 
 what a fine darling chap he is kitty was thinking at that moment as she came out of the pavilion with mlle linon and looked toward him with a smile of quiet kindness as though he were a favorite brother and can it be my fault can i have done anything wrong they talk of coquetry i know not he that i love but still i am happy with him and so nice only why did he say that she mused 
 catching sight of kitty going away and her mother meeting her at the steps levin flushed from his rapid exercise stood still and pondered a minute he took off his skates and overtook the mother and daughter at the entrance of the gardens 
 delighted to see you said princess shcherbatskaia on thursdays we are home as always 
 today then 
 we shall be pleased to see you the princess said stiffly 
 this stiffness hurt kitty and she could not resist the desire to smooth over her coldness she turned her head and with a smile said 
 till this evening 
 at that moment stepan arkadyevich his hat cocked on one side with beaming face and eyes strode into the garden like a buoyant conqueror but as he approached his he responded to her inquiries about health with a mournful and guilty countenance after a little subdued and dejected conversation with her he set straight his chest again and took levin by the arm 
 well shall we set off he asked been thinking about you all this time and very very glad come he said looking him in the face with a significant air 
 yes come along answered levin in ecstasy hearing unceasingly the sound of that voice saying till this evening and seeing the smile with which it was said 
 to england or the hermitage 
 all the same to me 
 well then england it is said stepan arkadyevich selecting that restaurant because he owed more there than at the hermitage and consequently considered it mean to avoid it have you got a sleigh fine for i sent my carriage home 
 the friends hardly spoke all the way levin was wondering what that change in expression had meant and alternately assuring himself that there was hope and falling into despair seeing clearly that his hopes were insane and yet all the while he felt himself quite another man utterly unlike what he had been before her smile and those words till this evening 
 stepan arkadyevich was absorbed during the drive in composing the menu of the dinner 
 you like turbot you he said to levin as they were arriving 
 eh responded levin turbot yes awfully fond of turbot

 when levin went into the restaurant with oblonsky he could not help noticing a certain peculiarity of expression as it were a restrained radiance about the face and whole figure of stepan arkadyevich oblonsky took off his overcoat and with his hat over one ear walked into the dining room giving directions to the tatar waiters who were clustered about him in evening coats and with napkins under their arms bowing right and left to acquaintances who here as everywhere greeted him joyously he went up to the bar took a little wineglass of vodka and a snack of fish and said to the painted frenchwoman decked in ribbons lace and ringlets behind the desk something so amusing that even that frenchwoman was moved to genuine laughter levin for his part refrained from taking any vodka only because he found most offensive this frenchwoman all made up it seemed of false hair poudre de riz and vinaigre de toilette he made haste to move away from her as from a dirty place his whole soul was filled with memories of kitty and there was a smile of triumph and happiness shining in his eyes 
 this way your excellency please your excellency be disturbed here said a particularly pertinacious old tatar with immense hips and coattails gaping widely behind walk in your excellency he said to levin being attentive to his guest as well by way of showing his respect to stepan arkadyevich 
 instantly flinging a fresh cloth over the round table under the bronze sconce though it already had a tablecloth on it he pushed up velvet chairs and came to a standstill before stepan arkadyevich with a napkin and a bill of fare in his hands awaiting his commands 
 if you prefer it your excellency a private room will be free directly prince golitsin with a lady fresh oysters have come in 
 ah oysters stepan arkadyevich became thoughtful 
 how if we were to change our program levin he said keeping his finger on the bill of fare and his face expressed serious hesitation are the oysters good mind now 
 flensburg your excellency no ostend 
 flensburg will do but are they fresh 
 only arrived yesterday 
 well then how if we were to begin with oysters and so change the whole program eh 
 all the same to me i should like cabbage soup and porridge better than anything but of course nothing like that here 
 porridge la russe your honor would like said the tatar bending down to levin like a nurse speaking to a child 
 no joking apart whatever you choose is sure to be good been skating and hungry and imagine he added detecting a look of dissatisfaction on face that i appreciate your choice i object to a good dinner 
 i should hope so after all one of the pleasures of life said stepan arkadyevich well then my friend you give us two or better say three dozen oysters clear soup with vegetables 
 printaniere prompted the tatar but stepan arkadyevich apparently did not care to allow him the satisfaction of giving the french names of the dishes 
 with vegetables in it you know then turbot with thick sauce then roast beef and mind good yes and capons perhaps and then stewed fruit 
 the tatar recollecting that it was stepan way not to call the dishes by the names in the french bill of fare did not repeat them after him but could not resist rehearsing the whole menu to himself according to the bill soupe printaniere turbot sauce beaumarchais poulard macdoine de fruits and then instantly as though worked by springs laying down one bound bill of fare he took up another the list of wines and submitted it to stepan arkadyevich 
 what shall we drink 
 what you like only not too much champagne said levin 
 what to start with right though i dare say do you like the white seal 
 cachet blanc prompted the tatar 
 very well then give us that brand with the oysters and then see 
 yes sir and what table wine 
 you can give us nuits oh no better the classic chablis 
 yes sir and your cheese your excellency 
 oh yes parmesan or would you like another 
 no all the same to me said levin unable to suppress a smile 
 and the tatar ran off with flying coattails and in five minutes darted in with a dish of opened oysters in their nacreous shells and a bottle between his fingers 
 stepan arkadyevich crushed the starchy napkin tucked it into his waistcoat and settling his arms comfortably started on the oysters 
 not bad he said detaching the jellied oysters from their pearly shells with a small silver fork and swallowing them one after another not bad he repeated turning his dewy brilliant eyes now upon levin now upon the tatar 
 levin ate the oysters too though white bread and cheese pleased him better but he was admiring oblonsky even the tatar uncorking the bottle and pouring the sparkling wine into the delicate glasses and adjusting his white cravat kept on glancing at stepan arkadyevich with a perceptible smile of satisfaction 
 you care much for oysters do you said stepan arkadyevich emptying his wineglass or are you worried about something eh 
 he wanted levin to be in good spirits but it was not that levin was not in good spirits he was ill at ease with what he had in his soul he felt hard and awkward in the restaurant in the midst of private rooms where men were dining with ladies in all this fuss and bustle the surroundings of bronzes looking glasses gas and tatars all of this was offensive to him he was afraid of sullying what his soul was brimful of 
 i yes i am worried but besides that all this bothers me he said you conceive how queer it all seems to a countryman like me as queer as that nails i saw at your office 
 yes i saw how much interested you were in poor nails said stepan arkadyevich laughing 
 too much for me responded levin do try now to put yourself in my place take the point of view of a countryman we in the country try to bring our hands into such a state as will be most convenient for working with so we cut our nails sometimes we tuck up our sleeves and here people purposely let their nails grow as long as possible and link on small saucers by way of studs so that they can do nothing with their hands 
 stepan arkadyevich smiled gaily 
 oh yes just a sign that he has no need to do coarse work his work is with the mind 
 maybe but still queer to me just as at this moment it seems queer to me that we countryfolks try to satiate ourselves as soon as we can so as to be ready for work while here are we trying to delay satiety as long as possible and with that object are eating oysters 
 why of course objected stepan arkadyevich but just the aim of culture to make everything a source of enjoyment 
 well if its aim rather be a savage 
 you are a savage as it is all you levins are savages 
 levin sighed he remembered his brother nikolai and felt ashamed and pained and he scowled but oblonsky began speaking of a subject which at once drew his attention 
 oh i say are you going tonight to our people the i mean he said his eyes sparkling significantly as he pushed away the empty rough shells and drew the cheese toward him 
 yes i shall certainly go replied levin though i fancied the princess was not very warm in her invitation 
 what nonsense her manner come boy the soup her manner grande dame said stepan arkadyevich coming too but i have to go to the countess rehearsal come it true that a savage how do you explain the sudden way in which you vanished from moscow the shcherbatskys were continually asking me about you as though i ought to know the only thing i know is that you always do what no one else does 
 yes said levin slowly and with emotion right i am a savage only my savageness is not in having gone away but in coming now now i have come 
 oh what a lucky fellow you are broke in stepan arkadyevich looking into eyes 
 why 
 i can tell the gallant steeds by some i know what i can tell youths by their faces declaimed stepan arkadyevich everything is before you 
 why is it over for you already 
 no not over exactly but the future is yours and the present is mine and the present well only fair to middling 
 how so 
 oh things right but i want to talk of myself besides i explain it all said stepan arkadyevich well why have you come to moscow then hi clear the table he called to the tatar 
 are you trying to surmise responded levin his eyes gleaming in their depth fixed on stepan arkadyevich 
 i am but i be the first to talk about it you can see by that whether i surmise right or wrong said stepan arkadyevich gazing at levin with a subtle smile 
 well and what have you to say to me said levin in a quivering voice feeling that all the muscles of his face were quivering too how do you look at it 
 stepan arkadyevich slowly emptied his glass of chablis never taking his eyes off levin 
 i said stepan arkadyevich nothing i desire so much as that nothing it would be the best thing that could happen 
 but not making a mistake you know what speaking of said levin piercing him with his eyes you think possible 
 i think possible why not 
 no do you really think possible no tell me all you think oh but if if in store for me indeed i feel sure 
 what makes you think so said stepan arkadyevich smiling at his excitement 
 it seems so to me sometimes that will be awful for me and for her too 
 oh well anyway nothing awful in it for a girl every proud of a proposal 
 yes every girl but not she 
 stepan arkadyevich smiled he so well knew that feeling of that for him all the girls in the world were divided into two classes one class all the girls in the world except her and those girls with all sorts of human failings and very ordinary girls the other class she alone having no failings of any sort and higher than all humanity 
 stay take some sauce he said holding back hand who was pushing the sauce away 
 levin obediently helped himself to sauce but would not let stepan arkadyevich go on with his dinner 
 no stop a minute stop a minute he said you must understand that a question of life and death for me i have never spoken to anyone of this and no one to whom i could speak of it except yourself you know utterly unlike each other different in tastes and views and everything but i know fond of me and understand me and why i like you awfully but for sake be quite straightforward with me 
 i tell you what i think said stepan arkadyevich smiling but say more my wife is a wonderful woman stepan arkadyevich sighed recalling his relations with his wife and after a silence resumed she has a gift of foreseeing things she sees right through people but not all she knows what will come to pass especially in the way of marriages she foretold for instance that princess shahovskaia would marry brenteln no one would believe it but it came to pass and on your side 
 how do you mean 
 not only that she likes you she says that kitty is certain to be your wife 
 at these words face suddenly lighted up with a smile a smile not far from touching tears 
 she says that cried out levin i always said she was charming your wife there enough said about it he said getting up from his seat 
 well but do sit down 
 but levin could not sit down he walked with his firm tread twice up and down the little cage of a room blinked his eyelids that his tears might not fall and only then sat down to the table 
 you must understand said he not love been in love but not that not my feeling but a sort of force outside me that has taken possession of me i went away you see because i made up my mind that it could never be you understand like a happiness which is not of this earth but struggled with myself and i see no living without it and it must be settled 
 what did you go away for 
 ah stop a minute ah the thoughts that come crowding on one the questions one must ask oneself listen you imagine what done for me by what you said so happy that become positively hateful forgotten everything i heard today that my brother nikolai you know here i had forgotten even him it seems to me that happy too a sort of madness but one awful here been married you know the feeling awful that we fully mature with a past a past not of love but of sins are brought all at once so near to a creature pure and innocent loathsome and why one help feeling oneself unworthy 
 oh well you many sins on your conscience 
 ah still said levin when with loathing i go my life i shudder and i curse and bitterly regret yes 
 what would you have the way of the world said stepan arkadyevich 
 one comfort like that of the prayer which i always liked forgive me not according to my deeds but according to thy the only way she can forgive me

 no not over exactly but the future is yours and the present is mine and the present well only fair to middling 
 how so 
 oh things right but i want to talk of myself besides i explain it all said stepan arkadyevich well why have you come to moscow then hi clear the table he called to the tatar 
 are you trying to surmise responded levin his eyes gleaming in their depth fixed on stepan arkadyevich 
 i am but i be the first to talk about it you can see by that whether i surmise right or wrong said stepan arkadyevich gazing at levin with a subtle smile 
 well and what have you to say to me said levin in a quivering voice feeling that all the muscles of his face were quivering too how do you look at it 
 stepan arkadyevich slowly emptied his glass of chablis never taking his eyes off levin 
 i said stepan arkadyevich nothing i desire so much as that nothing it would be the best thing that could happen 
 but not making a mistake you know what speaking of said levin piercing him with his eyes you think possible 
 i think possible why not 
 no do you really think possible no tell me all you think oh but if if in store for me indeed i feel sure 
 what makes you think so said stepan arkadyevich smiling at his excitement 
 it seems so to me sometimes that will be awful for me and for her too 
 oh well anyway nothing awful in it for a girl every proud of a proposal 
 yes every girl but not she 
 stepan arkadyevich smiled he so well knew that feeling of that for him all the girls in the world were divided into two classes one class all the girls in the world except her and those girls with all sorts of human failings and very ordinary girls the other class she alone having no failings of any sort and higher than all humanity 
 stay take some sauce he said holding back hand who was pushing the sauce away 
 levin obediently helped himself to sauce but would not let stepan arkadyevich go on with his dinner 
 no stop a minute stop a minute he said you must understand that a question of life and death for me i have never spoken to anyone of this and no one to whom i could speak of it except yourself you know utterly unlike each other different in tastes and views and everything but i know fond of me and understand me and why i like you awfully but for sake be quite straightforward with me 
 i tell you what i think said stepan arkadyevich smiling but say more my wife is a wonderful woman stepan arkadyevich sighed recalling his relations with his wife and after a silence resumed she has a gift of foreseeing things she sees right through people but not all she knows what will come to pass especially in the way of marriages she foretold for instance that princess shahovskaia would marry brenteln no one would believe it but it came to pass and on your side 
 how do you mean 
 not only that she likes you she says that kitty is certain to be your wife 
 at these words face suddenly lighted up with a smile a smile not far from touching tears 
 she says that cried out levin i always said she was charming your wife there enough said about it he said getting up from his seat 
 well but do sit down 
 but levin could not sit down he walked with his firm tread twice up and down the little cage of a room blinked his eyelids that his tears might not fall and only then sat down to the table 
 you must understand said he not love been in love but not that not my feeling but a sort of force outside me that has taken possession of me i went away you see because i made up my mind that it could never be you understand like a happiness which is not of this earth but struggled with myself and i see no living without it and it must be settled 
 what did you go away for 
 ah stop a minute ah the thoughts that come crowding on one the questions one must ask oneself listen you imagine what done for me by what you said so happy that become positively hateful forgotten everything i heard today that my brother nikolai you know here i had forgotten even him it seems to me that happy too a sort of madness but one awful here been married you know the feeling awful that we fully mature with a past a past not of love but of sins are brought all at once so near to a creature pure and innocent loathsome and why one help feeling oneself unworthy 
 oh well you many sins on your conscience 
 ah still said levin when with loathing i go my life i shudder and i curse and bitterly regret yes 
 what would you have the way of the world said stepan arkadyevich 
 one comfort like that of the prayer which i always liked forgive me not according to my deeds but according to thy the only way she can forgive me

 chapter 
 
 when levin went into the restaurant with oblonsky he could not help noticing a certain peculiarity of expression as it were a restrained radiance about the face and whole figure of stepan arkadyevich oblonsky took off his overcoat and with his hat over one ear walked into the dining room giving directions to the tatar waiters who were clustered about him in evening coats and with napkins under their arms bowing right and left to acquaintances who here as everywhere greeted him joyously he went up to the bar took a little wineglass of vodka and a snack of fish and said to the painted frenchwoman decked in ribbons lace and ringlets behind the desk something so amusing that even that frenchwoman was moved to genuine laughter levin for his part refrained from taking any vodka only because he found most offensive this frenchwoman all made up it seemed of false hair poudre de riz and vinaigre de toilette he made haste to move away from her as from a dirty place his whole soul was filled with memories of kitty and there was a smile of triumph and happiness shining in his eyes 
 this way your excellency please your excellency be disturbed here said a particularly pertinacious old tatar with immense hips and coattails gaping widely behind walk in your excellency he said to levin being attentive to his guest as well by way of showing his respect to stepan arkadyevich 
 instantly flinging a fresh cloth over the round table under the bronze sconce though it already had a tablecloth on it he pushed up velvet chairs and came to a standstill before stepan arkadyevich with a napkin and a bill of fare in his hands awaiting his commands 
 if you prefer it your excellency a private room will be free directly prince golitsin with a lady fresh oysters have come in 
 ah oysters stepan arkadyevich became thoughtful 
 how if we were to change our program levin he said keeping his finger on the bill of fare and his face expressed serious hesitation are the oysters good mind now 
 flensburg your excellency no ostend 
 flensburg will do but are they fresh 
 only arrived yesterday 
 well then how if we were to begin with oysters and so change the whole program eh 
 all the same to me i should like cabbage soup and porridge better than anything but of course nothing like that here 
 porridge la russe your honor would like said the tatar bending down to levin like a nurse speaking to a child 
 no joking apart whatever you choose is sure to be good been skating and hungry and imagine he added detecting a look of dissatisfaction on face that i appreciate your choice i object to a good dinner 
 i should hope so after all one of the pleasures of life said stepan arkadyevich well then my friend you give us two or better say three dozen oysters clear soup with vegetables 
 printaniere prompted the tatar but stepan arkadyevich apparently did not care to allow him the satisfaction of giving the french names of the dishes 
 with vegetables in it you know then turbot with thick sauce then roast beef and mind good yes and capons perhaps and then stewed fruit 
 the tatar recollecting that it was stepan way not to call the dishes by the names in the french bill of fare did not repeat them after him but could not resist rehearsing the whole menu to himself according to the bill soupe printaniere turbot sauce beaumarchais poulard macdoine de fruits and then instantly as though worked by springs laying down one bound bill of fare he took up another the list of wines and submitted it to stepan arkadyevich 
 what shall we drink 
 what you like only not too much champagne said levin 
 what to start with right though i dare say do you like the white seal 
 cachet blanc prompted the tatar 
 very well then give us that brand with the oysters and then see 
 yes sir and what table wine 
 you can give us nuits oh no better the classic chablis 
 yes sir and your cheese your excellency 
 oh yes parmesan or would you like another 
 no all the same to me said levin unable to suppress a smile 
 and the tatar ran off with flying coattails and in five minutes darted in with a dish of opened oysters in their nacreous shells and a bottle between his fingers 
 stepan arkadyevich crushed the starchy napkin tucked it into his waistcoat and settling his arms comfortably started on the oysters 
 not bad he said detaching the jellied oysters from their pearly shells with a small silver fork and swallowing them one after another not bad he repeated turning his dewy brilliant eyes now upon levin now upon the tatar 
 levin ate the oysters too though white bread and cheese pleased him better but he was admiring oblonsky even the tatar uncorking the bottle and pouring the sparkling wine into the delicate glasses and adjusting his white cravat kept on glancing at stepan arkadyevich with a perceptible smile of satisfaction 
 you care much for oysters do you said stepan arkadyevich emptying his wineglass or are you worried about something eh 
 he wanted levin to be in good spirits but it was not that levin was not in good spirits he was ill at ease with what he had in his soul he felt hard and awkward in the restaurant in the midst of private rooms where men were dining with ladies in all this fuss and bustle the surroundings of bronzes looking glasses gas and tatars all of this was offensive to him he was afraid of sullying what his soul was brimful of 
 i yes i am worried but besides that all this bothers me he said you conceive how queer it all seems to a countryman like me as queer as that nails i saw at your office 
 yes i saw how much interested you were in poor nails said stepan arkadyevich laughing 
 too much for me responded levin do try now to put yourself in my place take the point of view of a countryman we in the country try to bring our hands into such a state as will be most convenient for working with so we cut our nails sometimes we tuck up our sleeves and here people purposely let their nails grow as long as possible and link on small saucers by way of studs so that they can do nothing with their hands 
 stepan arkadyevich smiled gaily 
 oh yes just a sign that he has no need to do coarse work his work is with the mind 
 maybe but still queer to me just as at this moment it seems queer to me that we countryfolks try to satiate ourselves as soon as we can so as to be ready for work while here are we trying to delay satiety as long as possible and with that object are eating oysters 
 why of course objected stepan arkadyevich but just the aim of culture to make everything a source of enjoyment 
 well if its aim rather be a savage 
 you are a savage as it is all you levins are savages 
 levin sighed he remembered his brother nikolai and felt ashamed and pained and he scowled but oblonsky began speaking of a subject which at once drew his attention 
 oh i say are you going tonight to our people the i mean he said his eyes sparkling significantly as he pushed away the empty rough shells and drew the cheese toward him 
 yes i shall certainly go replied levin though i fancied the princess was not very warm in her invitation 
 what nonsense her manner come boy the soup her manner grande dame said stepan arkadyevich coming too but i have to go to the countess rehearsal come it true that a savage how do you explain the sudden way in which you vanished from moscow the shcherbatskys were continually asking me about you as though i ought to know the only thing i know is that you always do what no one else does 
 yes said levin slowly and with emotion right i am a savage only my savageness is not in having gone away but in coming now now i have come 
 oh what a lucky fellow you are broke in stepan arkadyevich looking into eyes 
 why 
 i can tell the gallant steeds by some i know what i can tell youths by their faces declaimed stepan arkadyevich everything is before you 
 why is it over for you already 
 no not over exactly but the future is yours and the present is mine and the present well only fair to middling 
 how so 
 oh things right but i want to talk of myself besides i explain it all said stepan arkadyevich well why have you come to moscow then hi clear the table he called to the tatar

 levin emptied his glass and they were silent for a while 
 one other thing i ought to tell you do you know vronsky stepan arkadyevich asked levin 
 no i why do you ask 
 give us another bottle stepan arkadyevich directed the tatar who was filling up their glasses and fidgeting round them just when he was least wanted 
 why you ought to know vronsky because one of your rivals 
 vronsky said levin and his face was suddenly transformed from the look of childlike ecstasy which oblonsky had just been admiring to an angry and unpleasant expression 
 vronsky is one of the sons of count kirill ivanovich vronsky and one of the finest specimens of the gilded youth of peterburg i made his acquaintance in tver when i was there on official business and he came there for the levy of recruits fearfully rich handsome great connections an and with all that a very fine fellow but more than simply a fellow as found out here a cultured man too and very intelligent a man make his mark 
 levin scowled and kept silent 
 well he turned up here soon after gone and as i can see over head and ears in love with kitty and you know that her mother 
 excuse me but i know nothing said levin frowning gloomily and immediately he recalled his brother nikolai and how vile he was to have been able to forget him 
 you wait a bit wait a bit said stepan arkadyevich smiling and touching his hand told you what i know and i repeat that in this delicate and tender matter as far as one can conjecture i believe the chances are in your favor 
 levin dropped back in his chair his face was pale 
 but i would advise you to settle the thing as soon as possible pursued oblonsky filling up his glass 
 no thanks i drink any more said levin pushing away his glass i shall get drunk come tell me how are you getting on he went on obviously anxious to change the conversation 
 one word more in any case i advise you to settle the question soon tonight i advise you to speak said stepan arkadyevich go round tomorrow morning make a proposal in classic form and god bless you 
 oh do you still think of coming to me for some shooting come next spring do said levin 
 now his whole soul was full of remorse that he had begun this conversation with stepan arkadyevich his peculiar feeling was profaned by talk of the rivalry of some peterburg officer of the suppositions and the counsels of stepan arkadyevich 
 stepan arkadyevich smiled he knew what was passing in soul 
 come some day he said yes my dear women the pivot everything turns upon things are in a bad way with me very bad and all through women tell me frankly now he pursued picking up a cigar and keeping one hand on his glass give me your advice 
 why what is it 
 tell you suppose married you love your wife but are fascinated by another woman 
 excuse me but absolutely unable to comprehend how just as i comprehend how i could now after my dinner go straight to a shop and steal a loaf 
 stepan eyes sparkled more than usual 
 why not a loaf will sometimes smell so good that one resist it 
 himmlisch wenn ich bezwungen 
 meine irdische begier 
 aber doch nicht gelungen 
 hatt ich auch recht hbsch plaisir 
 as he said this stepan arkadyevich smiled subtly levin too could not help smiling 
 yes but joking apart resumed oblonsky you must understand that the woman a sweet gentle loving creature poor and lonely has sacrificed everything now when the done you see can one possibly cast her off even supposing one parts from her so as not to break up family life still can one help feeling for her setting her on her feet lightening her lot 
 well you must excuse me there you know to me all women are divided into two classes well no it would be truer to say there are women and there are never seen charming fallen beings and i never shall see them but such creatures as that painted frenchwoman at the counter with the ringlets are vermin to my mind and all fallen women are like her 
 but the magdalen 
 ah drop that christ would never have said those words if he had known how they would be abused of all the gospel those words are the only ones remembered however not saying so much what i think as what i feel i have a loathing for fallen women afraid of spiders and i of these vermin most likely not made a study of spiders and know their character and so it is with me 
 very well for you to talk like that very much like that gentleman in dickens who used to fling all difficult questions over his right shoulder with his left hand but denying the facts is no answer to be done you tell me that to be done your wife gets older while full of life before time to look round you feel that you love your wife with love however much you may esteem her and then all at once love turns up and done for done for stepan arkadyevich said with weary despair 
 levin smiled slightly 
 yes done for resumed oblonsky but to be done 
 steal loaves 
 stepan arkadyevich laughed outright 
 oh moralist but you must understand there are two women one insists only on her rights and those rights are your love which you give her while the other sacrifices everything for you and asks for nothing what are you to do how are you to act a fearful tragedy in it 
 if you care for my profession of faith as regards that tell you that i believe there was any tragedy about it and this is why to my mind love both sorts of love which you remember plato defines in his banquet serve as the touchstone of men some men only understand one sort and some only the other and those who only know the nonplatonic love talk in vain of tragedy in such love there can be no sort of tragedy much obliged for the gratification my humble respects all the tragedy and in platonic love there can be no tragedy because in that love all is clear and pure because 
 at that instant levin recollected his own sins and the inner conflict he had lived through and he added unexpectedly 
 but perhaps you are right very likely i know i positively know 
 you see said stepan arkadyevich very much all of a piece your quality and your failing you have a character all of a piece and you want the whole of life to be of a piece too but not how it is you despise public official work because you want the reality to be constantly corresponding with the aim and not how it is you want a work too always to have a defined aim and love and family life always to be undivided and not how it is all the variety all the charm all the beauty of life is made up of light and shadow 
 levin sighed and made no reply he was thinking of his own affairs and was not listening to oblonsky 
 and suddenly both of them felt that though they were friends though they had been dining together and drunk wine which should have drawn them closer yet each was thinking only of his own affairs and they had nothing to do with one another oblonsky had more than once experienced this extreme sense of aloofness instead of intimacy coming on after dinner and he knew what to do in such cases 
 have the check he called and he went into the next room where he promptly came across an of his acquaintance and dropped into conversation with him about an actress and her protector and at once in this conversation with the oblonsky had a sense of relaxation and relief after his conversation with levin which always put him to too great a mental and spiritual strain 
 when the tatar appeared with a check of roubles and some kopecks besides a tip for himself levin who would another time have been horrified like anyone from the country at his share of fourteen roubles did not notice it paid and set off homeward to dress and go to the where his fate was to be decided

 stepan eyes sparkled more than usual 
 why not a loaf will sometimes smell so good that one resist it 
 himmlisch wenn ich bezwungen 
 meine irdische begier 
 aber doch nicht gelungen 
 hatt ich auch recht hbsch plaisir 
 as he said this stepan arkadyevich smiled subtly levin too could not help smiling 
 yes but joking apart resumed oblonsky you must understand that the woman a sweet gentle loving creature poor and lonely has sacrificed everything now when the done you see can one possibly cast her off even supposing one parts from her so as not to break up family life still can one help feeling for her setting her on her feet lightening her lot 
 well you must excuse me there you know to me all women are divided into two classes well no it would be truer to say there are women and there are never seen charming fallen beings and i never shall see them but such creatures as that painted frenchwoman at the counter with the ringlets are vermin to my mind and all fallen women are like her 
 but the magdalen 
 ah drop that christ would never have said those words if he had known how they would be abused of all the gospel those words are the only ones remembered however not saying so much what i think as what i feel i have a loathing for fallen women afraid of spiders and i of these vermin most likely not made a study of spiders and know their character and so it is with me 
 very well for you to talk like that very much like that gentleman in dickens who used to fling all difficult questions over his right shoulder with his left hand but denying the facts is no answer to be done you tell me that to be done your wife gets older while full of life before time to look round you feel that you love your wife with love however much you may esteem her and then all at once love turns up and done for done for stepan arkadyevich said with weary despair 
 levin smiled slightly 
 yes done for resumed oblonsky but to be done 
 steal loaves 
 stepan arkadyevich laughed outright 
 oh moralist but you must understand there are two women one insists only on her rights and those rights are your love which you give her while the other sacrifices everything for you and asks for nothing what are you to do how are you to act a fearful tragedy in it 
 if you care for my profession of faith as regards that tell you that i believe there was any tragedy about it and this is why to my mind love both sorts of love which you remember plato defines in his banquet serve as the touchstone of men some men only understand one sort and some only the other and those who only know the nonplatonic love talk in vain of tragedy in such love there can be no sort of tragedy much obliged for the gratification my humble respects all the tragedy and in platonic love there can be no tragedy because in that love all is clear and pure because 
 at that instant levin recollected his own sins and the inner conflict he had lived through and he added unexpectedly 
 but perhaps you are right very likely i know i positively know 
 you see said stepan arkadyevich very much all of a piece your quality and your failing you have a character all of a piece and you want the whole of life to be of a piece too but not how it is you despise public official work because you want the reality to be constantly corresponding with the aim and not how it is you want a work too always to have a defined aim and love and family life always to be undivided and not how it is all the variety all the charm all the beauty of life is made up of light and shadow 
 levin sighed and made no reply he was thinking of his own affairs and was not listening to oblonsky 
 and suddenly both of them felt that though they were friends though they had been dining together and drunk wine which should have drawn them closer yet each was thinking only of his own affairs and they had nothing to do with one another oblonsky had more than once experienced this extreme sense of aloofness instead of intimacy coming on after dinner and he knew what to do in such cases 
 have the check he called and he went into the next room where he promptly came across an of his acquaintance and dropped into conversation with him about an actress and her protector and at once in this conversation with the oblonsky had a sense of relaxation and relief after his conversation with levin which always put him to too great a mental and spiritual strain 
 when the tatar appeared with a check of roubles and some kopecks besides a tip for himself levin who would another time have been horrified like anyone from the country at his share of fourteen roubles did not notice it paid and set off homeward to dress and go to the where his fate was to be decided

 levin emptied his glass and they were silent for a while 
 one other thing i ought to tell you do you know vronsky stepan arkadyevich asked levin 
 no i why do you ask 
 give us another bottle stepan arkadyevich directed the tatar who was filling up their glasses and fidgeting round them just when he was least wanted 
 why you ought to know vronsky because one of your rivals 
 vronsky said levin and his face was suddenly transformed from the look of childlike ecstasy which oblonsky had just been admiring to an angry and unpleasant expression 
 vronsky is one of the sons of count kirill ivanovich vronsky and one of the finest specimens of the gilded youth of peterburg i made his acquaintance in tver when i was there on official business and he came there for the levy of recruits fearfully rich handsome great connections an and with all that a very fine fellow but more than simply a fellow as found out here a cultured man too and very intelligent a man make his mark 
 levin scowled and kept silent 
 well he turned up here soon after gone and as i can see over head and ears in love with kitty and you know that her mother 
 excuse me but i know nothing said levin frowning gloomily and immediately he recalled his brother nikolai and how vile he was to have been able to forget him 
 you wait a bit wait a bit said stepan arkadyevich smiling and touching his hand told you what i know and i repeat that in this delicate and tender matter as far as one can conjecture i believe the chances are in your favor 
 levin dropped back in his chair his face was pale 
 but i would advise you to settle the thing as soon as possible pursued oblonsky filling up his glass 
 no thanks i drink any more said levin pushing away his glass i shall get drunk come tell me how are you getting on he went on obviously anxious to change the conversation 
 one word more in any case i advise you to settle the question soon tonight i advise you to speak said stepan arkadyevich go round tomorrow morning make a proposal in classic form and god bless you 
 oh do you still think of coming to me for some shooting come next spring do said levin 
 now his whole soul was full of remorse that he had begun this conversation with stepan arkadyevich his peculiar feeling was profaned by talk of the rivalry of some peterburg officer of the suppositions and the counsels of stepan arkadyevich 
 stepan arkadyevich smiled he knew what was passing in soul 
 come some day he said yes my dear women the pivot everything turns upon things are in a bad way with me very bad and all through women tell me frankly now he pursued picking up a cigar and keeping one hand on his glass give me your advice 
 why what is it 
 tell you suppose married you love your wife but are fascinated by another woman 
 excuse me but absolutely unable to comprehend how just as i comprehend how i could now after my dinner go straight to a shop and steal a loaf 
 stepan eyes sparkled more than usual 
 why not a loaf will sometimes smell so good that one resist it

 the young princess kitty shcherbatskaia was eighteen it was the first winter that she had been out in the world her success in society had been greater than that of either of her elder sisters and greater even than her mother had anticipated to say nothing of the young men who danced at the moscow balls being almost all in love with kitty two serious suitors had already the first winter made their appearance levin and immediately after his departure count vronsky 
 appearance at the beginning of the winter his frequent visits and evident love for kitty had led to the first serious conversations between parents as to her future and to disputes between them the prince was on side he said he wished for nothing better for kitty the princess for her part going round the question in the manner peculiar to women maintained that kitty was too young that levin had done nothing to prove that he had serious intentions that kitty felt no great attraction to him and there were some other reasons too but she did not state the principal point which was that she looked for a better match for her daughter that levin was not to her liking and that she did not understand him when levin had abruptly departed the princess was delighted and said to her husband triumphantly you see i was right when vronsky appeared on the scene she was still more delighted confirmed in her opinion that kitty was to make not simply a good but a brilliant match 
 in the eyes there could be no comparison between vronsky and levin the mother disliked in levin his strange and uncompromising opinions and his shyness in society founded on his pride as she supposed and his queer sort of life as she considered it absorbed in cattle and peasants she did not very much like it that he who was in love with her daughter had kept coming to the house for six weeks as though he were waiting for something inspecting as though he were afraid he might be doing them too great an honor by making a proposal and did not realize that a man who continually visits at a house where there is a young unmarried girl is bound to make his intentions clear and suddenly without doing so he disappeared as well not attractive enough for kitty to have fallen in love with him thought the mother 
 vronsky satisfied all the desires very wealthy clever of aristocratic family on the highroad to a brilliant career in the army and at court and a fascinating man nothing better could be wished for 
 vronsky openly flirted with kitty at balls danced with her and came continually to the house consequently there could be no doubt of the seriousness of his intentions but in spite of that the mother had spent the whole of that winter in a state of terrible anxiety and agitation 
 princess shcherbatskaia had herself been married thirty years ago her aunt arranging the match the wooer about whom everything was well known beforehand had come looked at his intended and been looked at the matchmaking aunt had ascertained and communicated their mutual impression that impression had been favorable afterward on a day fixed beforehand the expected proposal was made to her parents and accepted all had passed very simply and easily so it seemed at least to the princess but over her own daughters she had felt how far from simple and easy is the business apparently so commonplace of marrying off daughters the panics that had been lived through the thoughts that had been brooded over the money that had been wasted and the disputes with her husband over marrying the two elder girls darya and natalya now since the youngest began to come out in the world the princess was going through the same terrors the same doubts and still more violent quarrels with her husband than she had over the elder girls the old prince like all fathers indeed was exceedingly scrupulous on the score of the honor and reputation of his daughters he was unreasonably jealous over his daughters especially over kitty who was his favorite and at every turn he had scenes with the princess for compromising her daughter the princess had grown accustomed to this already with her other daughters but now she felt that there was more ground for the scrupulousness she saw that of late years much was changed in the manners of society that a duties had become still more difficult she saw that girls of age formed some sort of clubs went to some sort of lectures mixed freely in society drove about the streets alone many of them did not curtsy and what was the most important thing all of them were firmly convinced that to choose their husband was their own affair and not their marriages made nowadays as they used to be was thought and said by all these young girls and even by their elders but just how marriages were made nowadays the princess could not learn from anyone the french fashion of the parents arranging their future was not accepted it was condemned the english fashion of the complete independence of girls was also not accepted and not possible in russian society the russian fashion of matchmaking was considered unseemly it was ridiculed by everyone even by the princess herself but how girls were to be married and how parents were to marry them no one knew everyone with whom the princess had chanced to discuss the matter said the same thing mercy on us high time in our day to cast off all that business the young people have to marry and not their parents and so we ought to leave the young people to arrange it as they choose it was very easy for anyone to say who had no daughters but the princess realized that in the process of getting to know each other her daughter might fall in love and fall in love with someone who did not care to marry her or who was quite unfit to be her husband and however much it was instilled into the princess that in our times young people ought to arrange their lives for themselves she was unable to believe it just as she would have been unable to believe that at any time whatever loaded pistols were the most suitable playthings for children five years old and so the princess was more uneasy over kitty than she had been over the elder daughters 
 now she was afraid that vronsky might confine himself to simply flirting with her daughter she saw that her daughter was in love with him but tried to comfort herself with the thought that he was an honorable man and would not do this but at the same time she knew how easy it is with the freedom of manners of today to turn a head and how lightly men generally regard such a crime the week before kitty had told her mother of a conversation she had with vronsky during a mazurka this conversation had partly reassured the princess yet her assurance could not be perfect vronsky had told kitty that both he and his brother were so used to obeying their mother that they never made up their minds to any important undertaking without consulting her and just now i am impatiently awaiting my coming from peterburg as a peculiar piece of luck he had told her 
 kitty had repeated this without attaching any significance to the words but her mother saw them in a different light she knew that the old lady was expected from day to day that she would be pleased at her choice and she felt it strange that he should not make his proposal through fear of vexing his mother however she was so anxious for the marriage itself and still more for relief from her fears that she believed it was so bitter as it was for the princess to see the unhappiness of her eldest daughter dolly on the point of leaving her husband her anxiety over the decision of her youngest fate engrossed all her feelings today with reappearance a fresh source of anxiety arose she was afraid that her daughter who had at one time as she fancied a feeling for levin might from an extreme sense of honesty refuse vronsky and that arrival might generally complicate and delay the affair now so near conclusion 
 why has he been here long the princess asked about levin as they returned home 
 he came today maman 
 one thing i want to say began the princess and from her serious and alert face kitty guessed what it would be 
 mamma she said flushing hotly and turning quickly to her please please say anything about that i know i know all about it 
 she wished what her mother wished for but the motives of her wishes hurt her 
 i only want to say that to raise hopes 
 mamma darling for sake talk about it so horrible to talk about it 
 i said her mother seeing the tears in her eyes but one thing my love you promised me you would have no secrets from me you 
 never mamma none answered kitty flushing and looking her mother straight in the face but i have nothing to tell you now and i i if i wanted to i know what to say or how i know 
 no she could not tell an untruth with those eyes thought the mother smiling at her agitation and happiness the princess smiled so immense and so important seemed to the poor child everything that was taking place just now in her soul

 the young princess kitty shcherbatskaia was eighteen it was the first winter that she had been out in the world her success in society had been greater than that of either of her elder sisters and greater even than her mother had anticipated to say nothing of the young men who danced at the moscow balls being almost all in love with kitty two serious suitors had already the first winter made their appearance levin and immediately after his departure count vronsky 
 appearance at the beginning of the winter his frequent visits and evident love for kitty had led to the first serious conversations between parents as to her future and to disputes between them the prince was on side he said he wished for nothing better for kitty the princess for her part going round the question in the manner peculiar to women maintained that kitty was too young that levin had done nothing to prove that he had serious intentions that kitty felt no great attraction to him and there were some other reasons too but she did not state the principal point which was that she looked for a better match for her daughter that levin was not to her liking and that she did not understand him when levin had abruptly departed the princess was delighted and said to her husband triumphantly you see i was right when vronsky appeared on the scene she was still more delighted confirmed in her opinion that kitty was to make not simply a good but a brilliant match 
 in the eyes there could be no comparison between vronsky and levin the mother disliked in levin his strange and uncompromising opinions and his shyness in society founded on his pride as she supposed and his queer sort of life as she considered it absorbed in cattle and peasants she did not very much like it that he who was in love with her daughter had kept coming to the house for six weeks as though he were waiting for something inspecting as though he were afraid he might be doing them too great an honor by making a proposal and did not realize that a man who continually visits at a house where there is a young unmarried girl is bound to make his intentions clear and suddenly without doing so he disappeared as well not attractive enough for kitty to have fallen in love with him thought the mother 
 vronsky satisfied all the desires very wealthy clever of aristocratic family on the highroad to a brilliant career in the army and at court and a fascinating man nothing better could be wished for 
 vronsky openly flirted with kitty at balls danced with her and came continually to the house consequently there could be no doubt of the seriousness of his intentions but in spite of that the mother had spent the whole of that winter in a state of terrible anxiety and agitation 
 princess shcherbatskaia had herself been married thirty years ago her aunt arranging the match the wooer about whom everything was well known beforehand had come looked at his intended and been looked at the matchmaking aunt had ascertained and communicated their mutual impression that impression had been favorable afterward on a day fixed beforehand the expected proposal was made to her parents and accepted all had passed very simply and easily so it seemed at least to the princess but over her own daughters she had felt how far from simple and easy is the business apparently so commonplace of marrying off daughters the panics that had been lived through the thoughts that had been brooded over the money that had been wasted and the disputes with her husband over marrying the two elder girls darya and natalya now since the youngest began to come out in the world the princess was going through the same terrors the same doubts and still more violent quarrels with her husband than she had over the elder girls the old prince like all fathers indeed was exceedingly scrupulous on the score of the honor and reputation of his daughters he was unreasonably jealous over his daughters especially over kitty who was his favorite and at every turn he had scenes with the princess for compromising her daughter the princess had grown accustomed to this already with her other daughters but now she felt that there was more ground for the scrupulousness she saw that of late years much was changed in the manners of society that a duties had become still more difficult she saw that girls of age formed some sort of clubs went to some sort of lectures mixed freely in society drove about the streets alone many of them did not curtsy and what was the most important thing all of them were firmly convinced that to choose their husband was their own affair and not their marriages made nowadays as they used to be was thought and said by all these young girls and even by their elders but just how marriages were made nowadays the princess could not learn from anyone the french fashion of the parents arranging their future was not accepted it was condemned the english fashion of the complete independence of girls was also not accepted and not possible in russian society the russian fashion of matchmaking was considered unseemly it was ridiculed by everyone even by the princess herself but how girls were to be married and how parents were to marry them no one knew everyone with whom the princess had chanced to discuss the matter said the same thing mercy on us high time in our day to cast off all that business the young people have to marry and not their parents and so we ought to leave the young people to arrange it as they choose it was very easy for anyone to say who had no daughters but the princess realized that in the process of getting to know each other her daughter might fall in love and fall in love with someone who did not care to marry her or who was quite unfit to be her husband and however much it was instilled into the princess that in our times young people ought to arrange their lives for themselves she was unable to believe it just as she would have been unable to believe that at any time whatever loaded pistols were the most suitable playthings for children five years old and so the princess was more uneasy over kitty than she had been over the elder daughters 
 now she was afraid that vronsky might confine himself to simply flirting with her daughter she saw that her daughter was in love with him but tried to comfort herself with the thought that he was an honorable man and would not do this but at the same time she knew how easy it is with the freedom of manners of today to turn a head and how lightly men generally regard such a crime the week before kitty had told her mother of a conversation she had with vronsky during a mazurka this conversation had partly reassured the princess yet her assurance could not be perfect vronsky had told kitty that both he and his brother were so used to obeying their mother that they never made up their minds to any important undertaking without consulting her and just now i am impatiently awaiting my coming from peterburg as a peculiar piece of luck he had told her 
 kitty had repeated this without attaching any significance to the words but her mother saw them in a different light she knew that the old lady was expected from day to day that she would be pleased at her choice and she felt it strange that he should not make his proposal through fear of vexing his mother however she was so anxious for the marriage itself and still more for relief from her fears that she believed it was so bitter as it was for the princess to see the unhappiness of her eldest daughter dolly on the point of leaving her husband her anxiety over the decision of her youngest fate engrossed all her feelings today with reappearance a fresh source of anxiety arose she was afraid that her daughter who had at one time as she fancied a feeling for levin might from an extreme sense of honesty refuse vronsky and that arrival might generally complicate and delay the affair now so near conclusion 
 why has he been here long the princess asked about levin as they returned home 
 he came today maman 
 one thing i want to say began the princess and from her serious and alert face kitty guessed what it would be 
 mamma she said flushing hotly and turning quickly to her please please say anything about that i know i know all about it 
 she wished what her mother wished for but the motives of her wishes hurt her 
 i only want to say that to raise hopes 
 mamma darling for sake talk about it so horrible to talk about it 
 i said her mother seeing the tears in her eyes but one thing my love you promised me you would have no secrets from me you 
 never mamma none answered kitty flushing and looking her mother straight in the face but i have nothing to tell you now and i i if i wanted to i know what to say or how i know 
 no she could not tell an untruth with those eyes thought the mother smiling at her agitation and happiness the princess smiled so immense and so important seemed to the poor child everything that was taking place just now in her soul

 after dinner and till the beginning of the evening kitty was experiencing a sensation akin to that of a young man before a battle her heart throbbed violently and her thoughts would not rest on anything 
 she felt that this evening when both these men would meet for the first time would be a turning point in her life and she was continually picturing them to herself at one moment each individually and then both together when she mused on the past she dwelt with pleasure with tenderness on the memories of her relations with levin the memories of childhood and of friendship with her dead brother have a special poetic charm to her relations with him his love for her of which she felt certain was flattering and delightful to her and it was easy for her to think of levin in her memories of vronsky there always entered a certain element of awkwardness though he was in the highest degree a fashionable and man as though there were some false note not in vronsky he was very simple and charming but in herself while with levin she felt herself perfectly simple and clear but on the other hand directly she thought of the future with vronsky there arose before her a perspective of brilliant happiness with levin the future seemed misty 
 when she went upstairs to dress and looked into the looking glass she noticed with joy that it was one of her good days and that she was in complete possession of all her forces she needed this so for what lay before her she was conscious of external composure and free grace in her movements 
 at seven she had only just gone down into the drawing room when the footman announced constantin dmitrievich levin the princess was still in her room and the prince had not come in so it is to be thought kitty and all the blood seemed to rush to her heart she was horrified at her paleness as she glanced into the looking glass 
 at that moment she knew beyond doubt that he had come early on purpose to find her alone and to propose to her and only then for the first time the whole thing presented itself in a new different aspect only then she realized that the question did not affect her only with whom she would be happy and whom she loved but that she would have that moment to wound a man whom she liked and to wound him cruelly wherefore because he dear fellow loved her was in love with her but there was no help for it it must be so it would have to be so 
 my god shall i myself really have to say it to him she thought can i tell him i love him that will be a lie what am i to say to him that i love someone else no impossible going away going away 
 she had reached the door when she heard his step no not honest what have i to be afraid of i have done nothing wrong what is to be will be tell the truth and with him one be ill at ease here he is she said to herself seeing his powerful and timid figure with his shining eyes fixed on her she looked straight into his face as though imploring him to spare her and gave him her hand 
 not time yet i think too early he said glancing round the empty drawing room when he saw that his expectations were realized that there was nothing to prevent him from speaking his face became somber 
 oh no said kitty and sat down at a table 
 but this was just what i wanted to find you alone he began without sitting down and not looking at her so as not to lose courage 
 mamma will be down directly she was very much tired yesterday yesterday 
 she talked on not knowing what her lips were uttering and not taking her supplicating and caressing eyes off him 
 he glanced at her she blushed and ceased speaking 
 i told you i did not know whether i should be here long that it depended on you 
 she dropped her head lower and lower not knowing herself what answer she should make to what was coming 
 that it depended on you he repeated i meant to say i meant to say i came for this to have you be my wife he blurted out not knowing what he was saying but feeling that the most terrible thing was said he stopped short and looked at her 
 she was breathing heavily without looking at him she was feeling ecstasy her soul was flooded with happiness she had never anticipated that his utterance of love would produce such a powerful effect on her but it lasted only an instant she remembered vronsky she lifted her clear truthful eyes and seeing desperate face she answered hastily 
 that cannot be forgive me 
 a moment ago and how close she had been to him of what importance in his life and how aloof and remote from him she had become now 
 it could not have been otherwise he said without looking at her he bowed and was about to leave

 but at that very moment the princess came in there was a look of horror on her face when she beheld them alone and saw their disturbed faces levin bowed to her and said nothing kitty neither spoke nor lifted her eyes thank god she has refused him thought the mother and her face lighted up with the habitual smile with which she greeted her guests on thursdays she sat down and began questioning levin about his life in the country he sat down again waiting for other visitors to arrive in order to go off unnoticed 
 five minutes later there came in a friend of married the preceding winter countess nordstone 
 she was a thin sallow sickly and nervous woman with brilliant black eyes she was fond of kitty and her affection for her showed itself as the affection of married women for girls always does in the desire to make a match for kitty after her own ideal of married happiness she wanted her to marry vronsky levin she had often met at the early in the winter and she had always disliked him her invariable and favorite pursuit when they met consisted in making fun of him 
 i do like it when he looks down at me from the height of his grandeur or breaks off his wise conversation with me because a fool or is condescending to me i like that so to see him condescending i am so glad he bear me she used to say of him 
 she was right for levin actually could not bear her and despised her for what she was proud of and regarded as a fine characteristic her nervousness her refined contempt and indifference for everything coarse and earthly 
 the countess nordstone and levin had got into that mutual relation not infrequently seen in society when two persons who remain externally on friendly terms despise each other to such a degree that they cannot even take each other seriously and cannot even be offended by each other 
 the countess nordstone pounced upon levin at once 
 ah constantin dmitrievich so come back to our corrupt babylon she said giving him her tiny yellow hand and recalling what he had chanced to say early in the winter that moscow was a babylon come is babylon reformed or have you degenerated she added glancing with a simper at kitty 
 very flattering for me countess that you remember my words so well responded levin who had succeeded in recovering his composure and at once from habit dropped into his tone of joking hostility to the countess nordstone they must certainly make a great impression on you 
 oh i should think so i always note everything down well kitty have you been skating again 
 and she began talking to kitty awkward as it was for levin to withdraw now it would still have been easier for him to perpetrate this awkwardness than to remain all the evening and see kitty who glanced at him now and then and avoided his eyes he was on the point of getting up when the princess noticing that he was silent addressed him 
 shall you be long in moscow busy with the zemstvo though you and be away for long 
 no princess no longer a member of the board he said i have come up for a few days 
 something the matter with him thought countess nordstone glancing at his stern serious face he in his old argumentative mood but draw him out i do love making a fool of him before kitty and do it 
 constantin dmitrievich she said to him do explain to me please what does it mean you know all about such things in our village of kaluga all the peasants and all the women have drunk up all they possessed and now they pay us any rent the meaning of that you always praise the mouzhiks so 
 at that instant another lady came into the room and levin got up 
 excuse me countess but i really know nothing about it and tell you anything he said and looked round at the officer who came in behind the lady 
 that must be vronsky thought levin and to be sure of it glanced at kitty she had already had time to look at vronsky and looked round at levin and simply from the look in her eyes that grew unconsciously brighter levin knew that she loved this man knew it as surely as if she had told him in so many words but what sort of a man was he 
 now whether for good or for ill levin could not choose but remain he must find out what the man was like whom she loved 
 there are people who on meeting a successful rival no matter in what are at once disposed to turn their backs on everything good in him and to see only what is bad there are people who on the contrary desire above all to find in that successful rival the qualities by which he has worsted them and seek with a throbbing ache at heart only what is good levin belonged to the second class but he had no difficulty in finding what was good and attractive in vronsky it was apparent at the first glance vronsky was a squarely built dark man not very tall with a handsome and exceedingly calm and firm face everything about his face and figure from his black hair and freshly shaven chin down to his loosely fitting uniform was simple and at the same time elegant making way for the lady who had come in vronsky went up to the princess and then to kitty 
 as he approached her his beautiful eyes shone with an especially tender light and with a faint happy and modestly triumphant smile so it seemed to levin bowing carefully and respectfully over her he held out his small broad hand to her 
 greeting and saying a few words to everyone he sat down without once glancing at levin who had never taken his eyes off him 
 let me introduce you said the princess indicating levin constantin dmitrievich levin count alexei kirillovich vronsky 
 vronsky got up and looking cordially at levin shook hands with him 
 i believe i was to have dined with you this winter he said smiling his simple and open smile but you had unexpectedly left for the country 
 constantin dmitrievich despises and hates the town and us townspeople said countess nordstone 
 my words must make a deep impression on you since you remember them so well said levin and suddenly becoming conscious that he had said just the same thing before he reddened 
 vronsky looked at levin and countess nordstone and smiled 
 are you always in the country he inquired i should think it must be dull in the winter 
 not dull if one has work to do besides not dull by oneself levin replied abruptly 
 i am fond of the country said vronsky noticing yet affecting not to notice tone 
 but i hope count you would not consent to live in the country always said countess nordstone 
 i know i have never tried for long i experienced a queer feeling once he went on i never longed so for the country russian country with bast shoes and peasants as when i was spending a winter with my mother in nice nice itself is dull enough you know and indeed naples and sorrento are only pleasant for a short time and just there that russia comes back to mind most vividly and especially the country as though 
 he talked on addressing both kitty and levin turning his serene friendly eyes from one to the other and saying obviously just what came into his head 
 noticing that countess nordstone wanted to say something he stopped short without finishing what he had begun and listened attentively to her 
 the conversation did not flag for an instant so that the old princess who always kept in reserve in case a subject should be lacking two heavy guns the classical and professional education and universal military service had not to move out either of them while countess nordstone had no chance of chaffing levin 
 levin wanted to and could not take part in the general conversation saying to himself every instant now go he still did not go as though waiting for something 
 the conversation fell upon table turning and spirits and countess nordstone who believed in spiritualism began to describe the miracles she had seen 
 ah countess you really must take me for sake do take me to see them i have never seen anything extraordinary though i am always on the lookout for it everywhere said vronsky smiling 
 very well next saturday answered countess nordstone but you constantin dmitrievich are you a believer she asked levin 
 why do you ask me you know what i shall say 
 but i want to hear your opinion 
 my opinion answered levin is merely that this table turning proves that educated society so called is no higher than the peasants they believe in the evil eye and in witchcraft and conjurations while we 
 oh then you a believer 
 i believe countess 
 but if seen for myself 
 the peasant women too tell us they have seen hobgoblins 
 then you think i tell a lie 
 and she laughed a mirthless laugh 
 oh no masha constantin dmitrievich merely said he could not believe said kitty blushing for levin and levin saw this and still more exasperated would have answered but vronsky with his bright frank smile rushed to the support of the conversation which was threatening to become disagreeable 
 you do not admit the possibility at all he queried but why not we admit the existence of electricity of which we know nothing why should there not be some new force still unknown to us which 
 when electricity was discovered levin interrupted hurriedly it was only the phenomenon that was discovered and it was unknown from what it proceeded and what were its effects and ages passed before its applications were conceived but the spiritualists on the contrary have begun with tables writing for them and spirits appearing to them and have only later started saying that it is an unknown force 
 vronsky listened attentively to levin as he always did listen obviously interested in his words 
 yes but the spiritualists say we know at present what this force is but there is a force and these are the conditions in which it acts let the scientific men find out what the force consists of no i see why there should not be a new force if it 
 why because with electricity levin interrupted again every time you rub tar against wool a certain phenomenon is manifested but in this case it does not happen every time and so it follows it is not a natural phenomenon 
 feeling probably that the conversation was taking a tone too serious for a drawing room vronsky made no rejoinder but by way of trying to change the conversation he smiled brightly and turned to the ladies 
 do let us try at once countess he said but levin would finish saying what he thought 
 i think he went on that this attempt of the spiritualists to explain their miracles as some sort of new natural force is most futile they boldly talk of spiritual force and then try to subject it to material experiment 
 everyone was waiting for him to finish and he felt this 
 why i think you would be a medium said countess nordstone something enthusiastic about you 
 levin opened his mouth was about to say something reddened and said nothing 
 do let us try table turning at once please said vronsky princess will you allow it 
 and vronsky stood up looking about for a little table 
 kitty got up to fetch a table and as she passed her eyes met she felt for him with her whole heart the more because she was pitying him for a suffering of which she was herself the cause if you can forgive me forgive me said her eyes i am so happy 
 i hate them all and you and myself his eyes responded and he took up his hat but he was not destined to escape just as they were arranging themselves round the table and levin was on the point of retiring the old prince came in and after greeting the ladies addressed levin 
 ah he began joyously been here long my boy i even know you were in town very glad to see you the old prince embraced levin and talking to him did not observe vronsky who had risen and was calmly waiting till the prince should turn to him 
 kitty felt how grievous her cordiality was to levin after what had happened she saw too how coldly her father responded at last to bow and how vronsky looked with amiable perplexity at her father trying and failing to understand how and why anyone could be hostilely disposed toward him and she flushed 
 prince let us have constantin dmitrievich said countess nordstone we want to try an experiment 
 what experiment table turning well you must excuse me ladies and gentlemen but to my mind it is better fun to play the ring game said the old prince looking at vronsky and guessing that it had been his suggestion some sense in that anyway 
 vronsky looked wonderingly at the prince with his firm eyes and with a faint smile began immediately talking to countess nordstone of the great ball that was to come off next week 
 i hope you will be there he said to kitty as soon as the old prince turned away from him levin slipped out unnoticed and the last impression he carried away with him of that evening was the smiling happy face of kitty answering inquiry about the ball
